SERVICES; CHILD CARE FACILITY LICENSING; BY PROVIDING FOR A SEVERABILITY
CLAUSE; BY PROVIDING FOR A REPEALER CLAUSE; AND BY PROVIDING FOR THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THIS ORDINANCE UPON PASSAGE, APPROVAL AND PUBLICATION ACCORDING TO LAW.
WHEREAS, Chapter 5.03 of the Hailey Municipal Code was originally adopted on
September 13, 1999 by Ordinance No. 740 when state licensing requirements for
child care facilities were not considered to be adequate by the City of Hailey
to protect the safety of occupants of child care facilities located within the
City of Hailey;
WHEREAS, Idaho State Code Title 39, Chapter 11 establishes regulations for
child care providers and Idaho Administrative Procedures Act (IDAPA)
establishes procedures for implementing the state regulations.
WHEREAS, Idaho Legislature has granted authority to the Department and Board of
Health and Welfare to adopt and enforce rules governing standards for licensure
or certification of child care facilities.
WHEREAS, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare conducted extensive
information gathering from local cities during late 2008 through early 2010

the public health, safety and general welfare.

development and maintenance may be funded from the public art account, as
recommended by the Hailey arts and historic preservation commission, and
approved by the city council.

project's budgeted costs to the city shall include all amounts paid by the city
to third parties in connection with the projects, including, but not limited

component shall be calculated for the budgeted eligible capital improvement
project costs at the time of project approval by the city council. The city
council may modify the public art component budget if during planning or
implementation of the project, the eligible capital project costs significantly

administrative costs, including, but not limited to, costs of selection,
project management, maintenance, repair and conservation.

unexpended project funds will be eligible to be rebudgeted each year, until
project completion.
   E.   The Hailey arts and historic preservation commission may recommend and
the city council may decide that monies in the public art account be pooled to
do a larger project and/or expended on a project at an alternate site to be
determined by the city.

matching monies, donations, grants or other means. (Ord. 999 § 2, 2008)

transportation, federal highway administration, pursuant to federal motor
carrier safety regulations part 391 et seq., and whose vehicles are equipped
with air brakes and whose drivers are required to obtain a passenger
endorsement on their commercial driver's license (CDL).
LICENSEE: Any person having a city auto transportation service business license
for the operation and maintenance of an auto transportation service, or, where
applicable, an auto transportation service driver's license for the operation
of any auto transportation service vehicle, which is in current full force and
effect issued under this chapter.

permit to be conducted, operated or maintained, or to participate in the

therefor has been issued by the city as provided in this chapter and said
license is in current full force and effect.

on a form containing such information as the city may require, which

   C.   In order to determine an applicant's suitability for an auto
transportation service business license, an applicant who has not been
licensed, pursuant to this chapter, within the previous twelve (12) months
shall be required to be fingerprinted by the Idaho bureau of criminal
identification. Upon receipt of a satisfactory record check on the state level,
fingerprints shall be forwarded to the federal bureau of investigation for a
national criminal history record check. Pending the results of the fingerprint
background check on the federal level and upon recommendation of the chief of
police, and approval by the city, a temporary auto transportation service
business license may be issued to the driver by the city clerk. A permanent
license shall be issued upon satisfaction and completion of the background

is filed, such applicant shall be exempt from the fingerprint requirement upon
approval by the chief of police.

of operating and maintaining an auto transportation service when that person:
      1.   Is under the age of twenty one (21) years;

any applicant where satisfactory proof is submitted that such applicant
operates motor vehicles in an unskillful, dangerous or reckless manner, or
habitually uses liquor or drugs, or who repeatedly violates the laws of the
city or state relating to traffic or to this chapter;
      7.   The city council may, in its discretion, waive the disqualification
provided in this subsection upon a finding that by virtue of the nature of the
crime committed by the applicant, the applicant's qualifications to engage in
the business of operating an auto transportation service are not called into
question.
   E.   The affirmative showing required with respect to the qualifications of
an applicant shall also be required to be made with respect to each partner of

governing board of an applicant corporation or association.

transportation service notifies the city clerk prior to the expiration of the
thirty (30) days that such auto transportation service is not in service due to
major mechanical or structural damage requiring in excess of thirty (30) days
to repair. In the event that such notification is given, the licensee shall
have a reasonable period of time to place said vehicle(s) back in service. In
the event that said vehicle(s) is not placed back in service within a
reasonable period of time, to be determined by the city, such auto
transportation service license shall be deemed abandoned and shall revert to
the city for reissue. Those auto transportation service owners who are sole
operators, employ no employees, and do not lease their vehicle, or who operate
a temporary limousine service, may in writing request permission from the city
council to exceed the thirty (30) days not in service limit under special
emergency circumstances.
   G.   The city clerk, with recommendation from the chief of police, and
approval of the city council, shall issue an auto transportation service

Clerk and shall set forth the name under which the applicant transacts or
intends to transact business, the location of the business or places of
business, and such other information as the City Clerk may require. The

liquor by the drink and/or restaurant food. Each person required to hold a
Municipal Nonproperty Tax permit and number shall file a Municipal Nonproperty
Tax return and a copy of their Idaho State Sales Tax return for the month at
the same time the taxes imposed by this chapter are paid to the City Clerk,
unless the person has been permitted in writing by the Idaho State Tax

writing and the City Clerk thereupon may require reporting of State tax returns
over some other period.

5.32.100: AUDITS; DEFICIENCY DETERMINATIONS:
   A.   The city clerk may order an audit of any taxpayer under this chapter
for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness or completeness of any return
or payment.
   B.   If any error or omission is discovered in such audits or in any other
way, the city clerk may compute and determine the amount of tax due upon the
basis of facts obtained from such information within the city clerk's
possession and assert a deficiency. One or more deficiency determinations may
be made for the amount due for one or for more than one period. In making such
a determination, the city clerk may offset overpayments against amounts due.
Further, such determinations shall be made for the period or periods in respect
to which the person fails to make a return and shall be based upon any
information which is in the city clerk's possession.
   C.   The city clerk shall give written notice of his or her determination
and the amount of the deficiency, including interest at a rate of interest per
annum equal to the New York prime rate of interest as expressed in the Wall
Street Journal, from the date due, to the person from whom such deficiency
amount is due. Such notice may be given personally or mailed to the person at
the address furnished to the city clerk in the nonproperty tax permit
application. (Ord. 950 § 1, 2006)
5.32.110: REDETERMINATION OF DEFICIENCY:
   A.   Any person against whom a deficiency determination is made under this

thereof. If the petition for redetermination is not filed within the thirty
(30) day period, the determination becomes final at the expiration of the
period.
   B.   If a petition for redetermination is filed within the thirty (30) day
period, the city clerk shall reconsider the determination and, if the person so
requests in the petition, grant the person oral hearing and give said person
ten (10) days' notice of the time and place of the hearing personally or by
mail addressed to the person at the address furnished to the city clerk in the
person's application for a nonproperty tax permit. (Ord. 950 § 1, 2006)
5.32.120: APPEALS, INTEREST ON DEFICIENCY:
   A.   When a redetermination is made, the city clerk shall give notice to the
taxpayer against whom the redetermination is made. Within thirty (30) days of
the date upon which such notice of redetermination is mailed or served, the
taxpayer may file an appeal with the city council or may file a complaint with
the district court for review of the city clerk's redetermination. There shall
be no right of review to the city council nor to the district court on the
determination of taxes due made by the city clerk unless a petition for
redetermination has been timely filed. No assessment of a deficiency in respect
to the tax imposed by this chapter or proceeding to collect for its collection
shall be made, begun or prosecuted until such notice has been mailed to the
taxpayer and expiration of such thirty (30) day period after notice of
redetermination, nor if a protest is filed until a decision on the protest
becomes final. If the taxpayer does not protest to the city council or file an
action in district court within the time prescribed in this section, the
deficiency shall be assessed and shall become due and payable upon notice and
demand from the city clerk.
   B.   Interest upon any deficiency shall be assessed at the same time as the
deficiency and shall become due and payable upon notice and demand from the
city clerk and shall be collected as part of the tax at a rate per annum equal

from the date prescribed for payment of the tax. (Ord. 950 § 1, 2006)
5.32.130: COLLECTIONS AND ENFORCEMENT:
As soon as practical after a monthly municipal nonproperty tax return and
payment is filed, the city clerk shall examine the same, and determine the
correct amount of the tax. For the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of
any payment, determining the amount of tax due where none has been made,
determining the liability of any person for any tax payable under this chapter
or the liability at law or in equity of any person in respect to any tax
provided by this chapter, or collecting any such liability, the city clerk is
authorized to:
   A.   Examine the books, papers, records or other data which may be relevant
or material to the inquiry;
   B.   Summon the person liable for the tax or any officer, agent or employee
of such person, or any person having possession, custody or care of books of
accounting containing entries relating to the business of the person liable for
the tax, to appear before the city clerk, at a time and place named in its
summons to produce such books, papers, records or other data and/or give such
testimony under oath as may be relevant or material to such inquiry. (Ord. 950
§ 1, 2006)
5.32.140: REFUNDS, LIMITATIONS AND INTEREST:
   A.   If the city clerk determines that any amount due under this chapter has
been paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
computed, the city clerk shall set forth that fact in its records and the
excess amount paid or collected may be credited on any amount due or payable to
the city clerk for nonproperty taxes from that person, and any balance refunded
to the person by whom it was paid or to his successors, administrators or
executors.
   B.   No such credit or refund shall be allowed or made after one year from
the time the payment was made unless before the expiration of such period a
claim therefor is filed by the taxpayer.
   C.   Interest shall be allowed on the amount of such credits or refunds at a
rate of interest per annum equal to the New York prime rate of interest as
expressed in the Wall Street Journal from the date which such tax was paid.

Every person with a duty to account for or pay over any tax imposed by this
chapter on behalf of a corporation, limited liability company, partnership or
other legal entity, as an officer, employee or agent of the entity, shall be
personally liable for payment of such tax, plus penalties and interest. (Ord.
950 § 1, 2006)
5.32.160: PERIOD OF LIMITATION UPON ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION:
   A.   The amount of taxes imposed under this chapter shall be assessed within
three (3) years of the time the return upon which the tax asserted to be due
was or should have been filed, whichever is later; provided, however, if a
deficiency determination or assessment has been made within the prescribed
time, such tax may be collected within a period of six (6) years after
assessment. The running of limitations provided by this section shall be
suspended for the period during which the city clerk is prohibited from making
the assessment or from collecting or proceeding in court due to a petition for
redetermination or an appeal therefrom, and for thirty (30) days thereafter.
   B.   In the cases of taxes due during the lifetime of a decedent, the tax
shall be assessed and proceedings for collection begun with six (6) months
after written request therefor (filed after the return is made) by the
executor, administrator or other fiduciary representing the estate of such
decedent unless the assessment is stayed by a petition for redetermination or
any appeal therefrom.
   C.   In the case of a false or fraudulent return with intent to evade tax,
or of a failure to file a return, the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in
court for collection of such tax may be begun without assessment, at any time
within three (3) years after the date of the discovery of the facts
constituting the fraud or discovery of the failure to file. (Ord. 950 § 1,
2006)
5.32.170: SUCCESSORS' LIABILITY:
   A.   If a vendor liable for any amount of tax due under this chapter sells
out his business or stocks and goods, the vendee shall make an inquiry to the
city clerk and withhold from the purchase price any amount of tax that may be
due under this chapter until such time as the vendor produces a receipt stating
that no amount is due.
   B.   If the purchaser of business or stock of goods fails to withhold from
the purchase price, as above required, the purchaser or officer, employee or
agent of the entity is personally liable for the payment of the amount required
to be withheld by him, which amount shall become immediately due and payable
with interest as herein provided, and suit may be filed within the time limit
set forth in subsection
5.32.160A of this chapter. (Ord. 950 § 1, 2006)
5.32.180: GENERAL ADMINISTRATION BY CITY CLERK:

prescribe, adopt and enforce rules and regulations relating to its
administration and enforcement. The city clerk may employ qualified auditors
for examination of taxpayer's books and records, and shall also employ such
accountants, investigators, assistants, clerks, and other personnel as are
necessary for the efficient administration of this chapter, and may delegate
authority to his or her representatives to conduct hearings, or perform other
duties imposed by this chapter.
   B.   Every rental vehicle business owner, hotel-motel owner, seller of

person selling restaurant food, or any person liable for any tax thereon, and
may investigate the character of the business of the person in order to verify
the accuracy of any return made, or if no return is made by the person, to
ascertain and determine the amount required to be paid. Any persons who rent
rental vehicles, any hotel-motel owners, any persons who sell liquor by the
drink and any persons who sell restaurant food, whose pertinent records are
kept outside of the city, must bring the records to the city for examination by
the city clerk upon request of the city clerk, or by agreement with the city

5.32.190: PENALTIES:
   A.   Any person who violates any provision of this chapter shall be guilty
of a misdemeanor, punishable by up to one year in the county jail and/or three
hundred dollar ($300.00) fine, or both. Furthermore, each month in which a
person fails to report, or intentionally fails to accurately compute, or

or the amount of tax to be paid, as imposed under this chapter, shall be
considered a separate offense.
   B.   Any person who violates any provision of this chapter shall have his
municipal nonproperty tax permit and tax number revoked. The city clerk shall
send written notice of revocation of the permit and tax number to the permit
holder by mailing the permit certified mail to the address given on the permit
application. The permit holder shall have ten (10) days from the date the
notice is mailed to file a written request for appeal with the city council,
challenging the revocation. If no appeal is timely made, the revocation becomes
final. Whenever a person subject to this chapter has had a permit and tax
number revoked, the city clerk shall not reissue the permit nor issue a new

reasonable costs of collection, including attorney fees, in a court of
competent jurisdiction.

evasion of nonproperty taxes, the burden of proving that the rental of a rental
vehicle or a hotel-motel room or the retail sale of liquor by the drink or
restaurant food is not subject to a nonproperty tax imposed by this chapter, is
upon the person who makes the sale or rental in question. (Ord. 950 § 1, 2006)
5.32.200: PENALTY CHARGE:
Any person who is required to collect, truthfully account for and pay over any
tax imposed by this chapter and who wilfully fails to collect such a tax or

manner to evade or defeat such a tax or payment thereof, shall, in addition to
other penalties provided by law, be liable to a penalty equal to five percent
(5%) per month for a maximum of twenty five percent (25%) of the amount of the
tax evaded, or not collected, or not accounted for and paid over. The city
clerk shall determine and assess such penalties, and the same shall become due
and payable upon notice and demand from the city clerk. The city clerk shall

notice by certified mail to the address given on the permit application. The

charge determination. If no appeal is timely made, the penalty charge
determination becomes final. (Ord. 950 § 1, 2006)

9.18.070: Private Right Of Action
9.18.010: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   In order to ensure that all persons, regardless of sexual orientation
and/or gender identity/expression enjoy the full benefits of citizenship and
are afforded equal opportunities for employment, housing, commercial property
and use of public accommodations, the city of Hailey has determined that
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity/
expression must be addressed and appropriate legislation be enacted.
   B.   It is hereby declared that every individual in the city of Hailey has
the right to work and earn wages through gainful employment, has the right to
seek housing and has the right to enjoy public accommodation and hospitality.
   C.   It is hereby declared to be the public policy of the city of Hailey to
foster the employment of all individuals in accordance with their abilities.
Every individual has the right to work and earn wages through gainful
employment. Discriminatory employment practices are detrimental because they
impede the social and economic progress of a city by preventing all of the
city's citizens from contributing to the cultural, spiritual, social and
commercial life of the community. The contributions of all the citizens of the
city of Hailey are essential to the city's growth, vitality and prosperity.
   D.   It is the intent of this chapter that all persons be treated fairly and
equally, and it is the express intent of this chapter to guarantee fair and
equal treatment under the law to all people in the city of Hailey. The denial
of fair and equal treatment under the law due to sexual orientation or gender
identity/expression is detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the
city's citizens, and damages a city's economic well being.
   E.   This chapter shall be deemed an exercise of the police power of the
city of Hailey for the protection of the public welfare, prosperity, health and
peace of the city of Hailey, its residents and the community.
   F.   The prohibitions against discriminatory acts as provided for in this
chapter are intended to supplement state and federal civil rights law
prohibiting discrimination in the areas of employment, public accommodations
and housing. Therefore, this chapter shall not apply to complaints alleging
discrimination on a basis proscribed under state or federal law (e.g., race,
color, religious creed, ancestry, age, sex, national origin, familial status,
veteran's status and/or disability).
   G.   Nothing in this chapter is intended to alter or abridge other rights,
protections or privileges secured under state and/or federal law. This chapter
shall not create a private cause of action, nor shall it create any right or
remedy that is the same or substantially equivalent to a remedy under federal
or state law.
   H.   This chapter shall not create any special rights or privileges which
would not be available to all of Hailey's citizens because every person has a
sexual orientation and a gender identity.
   I.   This chapter shall be construed and applied in a manner consistent with
constitutional right of freedom of speech and exercise of religion. (Ord. 1174,
2015)

The people of Hailey, Idaho, find as follows:
WHEREAS the National Academy Of Sciences' Institute Of Medicine concluded after
reviewing relevant scientific literature including dozens of works documenting
marijuana's therapeutic value 1 , that there are some circumstances in which
smoking marijuana is a legitimate medical treatment 2 ; and
WHEREAS a scientific survey conducted in 1990 by Harvard University researchers
found that fifty four percent (54%) of oncologists with an opinion favored the
controlled medical availability of marijuana, and forty four percent (44%) had
already suggested at least once that a patient obtain marijuana illegally 3 ;
and
WHEREAS tens of thousands of patients nationwide - people with AIDS, cancer,
glaucoma, chronic pain, and multiple sclerosis - have found marijuana in its
natural form to be therapeutically beneficial 4  and are already using it with
their doctors' approval; and
WHEREAS numerous organizations have endorsed medical access to marijuana,
including the AIDS Action Council, American Nurses Association, American
Academy Of HIV Medicine, American Bar Association, American Medical Student
Association, American Preventive Medical Association, American Public Health
Association, California Academy Of Family Physicians, California Legislative
Council For Older Americans, California Medical Association, California Nurses
Association, California-Pacific Society Of Addiction Medicine, Florida Medical
Association, Gray Panthers, Lymphoma Foundation Of America, Multiple Sclerosis
California Action Network, National Association For Public Health Policy,
National Association Of Attorneys General, National Association Of People With
AIDS, National Black Police Association, National Women's Health Network, New
York State Nurses Association, Public Citizen, Virginia Nurses Association,
Whitman-Walker Clinic (Washington, D.C.), Women Of Reform Judaism; and
WHEREAS a scientific survey conducted in 1995 by Belden & Russonello (a
Washington, D.C. based polling firm) indicated seventy nine percent (79%) of
U.S. voters support the idea of "legalize(ing) marijuana to relieve pain and
for other medical uses if prescribed by a doctor" 5 ; and
WHEREAS national public opinion polls conducted by ABC news, CBS news, the
Family Research Council, and the Gallup Organization between 1997 and 1999
found substantial support for medical marijuana 6 ; and

cultivation, possession, and use of medical marijuana; and
WHEREAS on September 6, 1988, after reviewing all available medical data, the
drug enforcement administration's chief administrative law judge, Francis L.
Young, declared that marijuana is "one of the safest therapeutically active
substances known" and recommended making marijuana available by prescription 8
; and
WHEREAS the federal penalty for possessing one marijuana cigarette "even for
medical use" is up to one year in prison, and the penalty for growing one plant
is up to five (5) years 9 ; and
WHEREAS the penalties are similar in most states, where medical marijuana users
must live in fear of being arrested; and
WHEREAS the present federal classification of marijuana 10  and the resulting
bureaucratic controls impede additional scientific research into marijuana's
therapeutic potential 11 , thereby making it nearly impossible for the food and
drug administration to evaluate and approve marijuana through standard
procedural channels; and
WHEREAS seriously ill people should not be punished for acting in accordance
with the opinion of their physicians in a bona fide attempt to relieve
suffering; and
WHEREAS the state of Idaho has no mandate under the constitution to outlaw
medical marijuana and would therefore be subordinate to the will of the people
as expressed through the initiative process and guaranteed by article I,
section 2 of the Idaho constitution;
THEREFORE the people of the city of Hailey do hereby enact the following

   Marijuana And Oral THC Provide Symptomatic Relief In Some Patients With
   Spasticity Associated With Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Or Trauma". (page 13)

13.04.010: PURPOSES:
To protect the health, safety and general welfare of the public, the city of
Hailey deems it necessary to control the use and connection to the municipal
water and wastewater systems. To protect the health, safety and general welfare
of the public and to comply with the city's obligations under law to provide an
equitable system of rates and fees with the view toward attempting to make the
city's water and wastewater systems self-supporting, there is established a
system of periodic rates and fees for the purpose of equitably imposing upon
all users the costs and expenses of operation, maintenance, repair and
replacement of the municipal water and wastewater systems. (Ord. 1094, 2011)
13.04.020: APPLICABILITY:
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all property within the corporate
limits of the city, and any special users outside of the corporate limits of
the city, including all property owned or occupied by the United States Of
America, Blaine County and the state of Idaho. (Ord. 1094, 2011)
13.04.030: MANDATORY HOOKUP TO MUNICIPAL WATER AND WASTEWATER SYSTEMS:
The owner or occupant of any building, used for residential, commercial,
industrial, governmental or other use that requires water or wastewater
service, situated within the city which is abutting on or having a permanent
right of access to any street, alley or right of way in which there is located
a municipal water system or municipal wastewater system shall, if applicable,
cease using any other method of domestic water service or other method of
disposing of wastewater, waste or polluted water, as the case may be, and at
the owner's expense shall connect his private water system to the municipal
water system or his private wastewater system to the municipal wastewater
system in accordance with the provisions of this chapter within one hundred
eighty (180) days after official notice from the city to do so; provided,
however, that the water main or wastewater main, as the case may be, is within
three hundred feet (300') of any property line of the building to be served.
Notwithstanding the foregoing requirement, any owner of property annexed into
the city in a city initiated annexation may request a delay in complying with
the mandatory connection provided for herein by means of application to the
city council. Delayed compliance may be granted by the city council only if the
applicant establishes to the satisfaction of the city council that the
applicant's existing water system functions properly and meets all current
health and safety requirements. Such a showing shall not entitle the applicant
to delayed compliance, but such a delay may be granted by the city council, in
the city council's discretion, if the facts shown indicate a delay would be
fair and equitable and will not jeopardize the health and welfare of the
residents of the city. In no event shall a delay be granted which exceed a
period of five (5) years following granting of delayed compliance by the city
council. Any delay granted pursuant to this section shall be automatically
terminated if there is a change in use of the annexed property. As used herein,
"use" means the purpose for which the property or a building thereon is
designed, arranged, intended, or for which it is or may be occupied or
maintained. (Ord. 1094, 2011)
13.04.040: WATER SERVICE LINES AND WATER SERVICE CONNECTIONS:
All materials used and workmanship performed in the installation of a private
water service line and connections to the municipal water service line shall
conform to the following regulations:
   A.   No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any connections with or
opening into, use, alter or disturb any water main, municipal water service
line, or appurtenance thereof, without first obtaining a water connection
permit from the city, or shall unlawfully tamper with any water main, municipal
water service line or appurtenance thereof in an attempt to reinstate services
prior to payment of all required fees. The permit shall not be issued until all
water connection fees have been paid in full. If a building permit is required
for a building requiring a water hookup, the owner shall concurrently apply for
a water connection permit. Water services and all water user fees will commence
upon submission of a "request for commencement/discontinuance of water service"
form. Any attempt by the owner or owner's agent to utilize water service to the
property by means other than the water service line will result in immediate
activation of the owner's account and the required commencement of payment of
monthly water and wastewater fees.
   B.   To obtain municipal water services, the owner or his agent shall make

13.04.060: CROSS CONNECTIONS:
The purpose of this ordinance is to protect the water supply of City of Hailey
from contamination or pollution from any cross connections exiting or
potential; and to assure that approved backflow prevention assemblies are
tested when put into service and at least on an annual basis thereafter. This
ordinance is in compliance with Code 58.01.08.552.06 of the Idaho
Administrative code (IDAPA) and the 2017 Plumbing Code as adopted by the State
of ldaho.
   A.   Cross Connections Prohibited: The installation or maintenance of a
cross connection is hereby prohibited. Any such cross connection now existing
is declared a nuisance and shall be removed or abated upon order of the city.
Failure to remove a cross connection or install an approved backflow prevention
device as ordered within ten (10) days of the order shall result in
discontinuance of municipal water service until compliance is made.
   B.   Backflow Prevention Devices: Any facility requiring a backflow
prevention device shall follow the requirements of the cross connection
standards, as amended. The minimum required backflow prevention device shall
require a testable double check valve.
   C.   Inspections Of Existing Buildings, Structures Or Improvements:
Inspections by the city or its authorized agent, bearing proper credentials and
identification, may be made of any existing building, structures or
improvements of any nature receiving water from the municipal water system. The
city water division manager or his authorized agent shall make an inspection of
any property, building, improvement or structure of any nature receiving water
from the municipal water system if there appears probable cause to believe that
a cross connection exists or that a backflow prevention device should be
installed.
   D.   Required Installations: Backflow prevention devices shall be installed
at the owner's expense at the ties on the premises or within any premises
where, in the judgment of the city, the nature and extent of activities or the
materials stored on the premises would present an immediate and dangerous
hazard to health and/or be deleterious to the quality of the water should a
cross connection occur, even though such cross connection does not exist at the
time. In such circumstances, backflow prevention devices may be required in the
following premises:
      1.   Premises having an auxiliary water supply, unless the quality of the
auxiliary supply is in compliance with the cross connection standards and are
acceptable to the City.
      2.   Premises having internal cross connections that are not correctable,
or intricate plumbing arrangements which make it impracticable to ascertain
whether cross connections exist.
      3.   Premises having a repeated history of cross connections.
      4.   Premises on which any substance is handled under pressure so as to
permit entry into the Municipal water system or where a cross connection could
reasonably be expected to occur, including the handling of process waters and
cooling waters.
      5.   Premises where materials of a toxic or hazardous nature are handled
in such a way that if back siphonage should occur, a health hazard might
result.
      6.   The following premises, unless the City and/or a Health Officer
determine that no hazard exists:
         a.   Hospitals, mortuaries, clinics.
         b.   Laboratories.

         j.   Others as specified by the Health Officer.
      7.   Other premises where backflow prevention devices are reasonably
required to protect the Municipal water system.
      8.   Under circumstances set forth in this subsection, the City shall
have the right to require a reduced pressure principle backflow prevention
device or a proper air gap separation to be installed at the property line.
   E.   Minimum Backflow Prevention Device: The type of backflow prevention
device required to be installed conform with the requirements of the cross
connection standards and shall depend on the degree of hazard which exists.
      1.   An air gap separation and/or a reduced pressure principle backflow
prevention device shall be installed where the Municipal water system may be
contaminated with sewage, industrial waste of a toxic nature, or other
contaminant which could cause a health or system hazard.
      2.   In the case of a substance which may be objectionable but not
hazardous to health, a double check valve assembly, air gap separation, or a
reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device shall be installed.
      3.   Where lawn sprinkling systems using the Municipal water system are
installed, reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device, air gap
separation, or pressure vacuum breaker assembly shall be installed.
   F.   Installation: Backflow prevention devices required by this section
(with the exception of fire sprinkler or standpipe systems) shall be installed
at the water meter no closer than five feet (5') from the property line of the
premises, or at a location approved by the City. The device shall be located so
as to be readily accessible for maintenance, inspection and testing, and where
no part of the device shall be submerged.
   G.   Annual Testing Required: Backflow prevention devices required by this
chapter shall be installed under a permit issued by the City, tested upon
installation by the installer and reported to the City, and inspected and
approved by qualified City personnel. There shall be no charge for the permit
and inspection by the City prior to approval of the installation. Thereafter,
the owner shall have such backflow prevention device tested by a certified
backflow prevention tester annually. Such testing, together with all
maintenance and repair of such device, shall be at the owner's expense and
shall be completed no later than one year from the prior year's testing date.
All backflow prevention devices shall be tested by a certified backflow
prevention device tester at the owner's expense. Whenever a device does not
pass an annual test or is found to be defective, the devices shall, at the
owner's expense, be repaired, replaced, or isolated within ten (10) business
days. Failure of the owner to comply with the rules for installation,
maintenance, repair, replacement, isolation, testing or inspection of backflow
prevention devices required by this section shall be grounds for the
termination of water service to the premises.
   H.   Approved Backflow Preventive Devices: Any backflow preventive device
required by this section shall conform with the requirements of the cross
connection standards and Idaho Plumbing Code. These devices shall be furnished
and installed by and at the expense of the owner.

by the City.
   J.   Fire Sprinkler Protection Systems And Fire Hydrants: All existing fire
sprinkler or standpipe protection systems shall have an approved backflow
prevention device installed and tested by a licensed fire sprinkler installer.
Failure to properly install or maintain the device may result in daily fines as
provided for by the International Fire Code and this Code. Any termination of
water supply to a required fire sprinkler or standpipe system will prevent the
continued occupancy or use of the building until the water supply is
reestablished. Fire sprinkler and standpipe systems shall typically be
installed on a separate water supply line prior to any water meter. No
connection will be made to any fire hydrant by any person without having first
received the permission of the City, except for firefighting purposes.
   K.   Private Water System: No person shall make or permit the cross
connection of any private water system to a water line that is served by the
Municipal water system, except as provided in this chapter. Whenever an owner
connects to the Municipal water system, the owner, at owner's expense, shall
physically disconnect any private water system from the Municipal water system
in such a manner that water from a private water system will never pass through
the same pipes that carry water from the Municipal water system, except as may
be approved by the City and Health Officer. (Ord. 1264 § 1, 2020; Ord. 1217,
2017; Ord. 1177, 2015; Ord. 1140, 2013; Ord. 1094, 2011)

including the municipal water service lines, shall become the property of the
city. (Ord. 1188, 2015; Ord. 1094, 2011)
13.04.120: BASIS FOR USER FEES:
There is established a system of periodic rates and fees for the use of and
services provided to maintain the municipal water and wastewater systems. The
rates and fees provided by this chapter are levied and assessed against each
building or property connected with the municipal water and wastewater systems,
and all owners shall pay the user fees established under the provisions of this
chapter. (Ord. 1094, 2011)
13.04.130: WATER AND WASTEWATER USER FEES:
   A.   Water User Fees: The owner or owner's agent of all property connected
to the municipal water system under the terms of this chapter shall be assessed
and shall pay monthly user fees beginning at the time of connection, as
follows:
      1.   Base Water Fee: The base water fee is intended to cover the fixed
costs of the operation, maintenance and expansion of the municipal water system
generally attributable to indoor potable water usage, which shall be twenty
five percent (25%) of the water department budget. Except as otherwise provided
in subsection E of this section, the monthly base fee shall be assessed to each
property served by a service connection. The monthly base fee shall be
calculated by dividing twenty five percent (25%) of the water department budget
by the "number of water users" and by twelve (12), and as adopted by city
council resolution. The "number of water users" is equivalent to the number of
service connections in the city, less the number of service connections to
multiple-family dwellings, plus the number of dwelling units in multiple-family
dwellings on a property.
      2.   Metered Water Fee: The metered water fee is intended to cover the
variable costs of the operation, maintenance and expansion of the municipal
water system, generally attributable to outdoor irrigation water usage, which
shall be seventy five percent (75%) of the water department budget. Except as
otherwise provided in subsection E of this section, the monthly metered water
fee shall be assessed to each property served by a service connection. Except
as otherwise provided in subsection E of this section, the monthly metered
water fee shall be calculated based upon the usage of water measured by each
service connection, and as adopted by city council resolution. The metered
water fees shall be based on a sliding scale which assesses a proportionally
greater cost per one thousand (1,000) gallons of water as more water is used by
a property.
      3.   Bond Payment Fee: The monthly bond payment is intended to cover the
cost of bond and note retirement costs which are the legal indebtedness the
city is obligated to retire on a set schedule. The monthly water bond payment
is determined by taking the bond and note retirement costs and dividing by the
"number of water users" utilizing the system during the twelve (12) month
period. The "number of water users" is equivalent to the number of service
connections in the city, less the number of service connections to multiple-
family dwellings, plus the number of dwelling units in multiple-family
dwellings on a property. Except as otherwise provided in subsection E of this
section, the monthly bond payment fee shall be assessed to each property. Bond
payment fees will continue even if water services are discontinued at any
point.
      4.   Irrigation Fee: The monthly metered irrigation fee shall be assessed
to each property with a separate irrigation account based upon the amount of
water used during one billing period.
      5.   Fill Spout Fee: A fill spout permit shall be obtained for any water
used at a fill spout owned or operated by the city. The fee for use shall be
adopted by city council resolution.
   B.   Wastewater User Fees: Except as otherwise provided in subsection B4 of
this section, the owner or owner's agent of all property connected to the
municipal wastewater system under the terms of this chapter shall be assessed
and shall pay monthly user fees beginning at the time of connection, as
follows:
      1.   Metered Wastewater Fee: The metered wastewater fee is intended to
cover all costs of the operation and maintenance costs of the municipal
wastewater system. Except as otherwise provided in subsection E of this
section, the monthly metered wastewater charge shall be assessed to each
property served by a service connection. The monthly metered wastewater fee
shall be based upon the average amount of water used by a property or a
dwelling unit in a multiple- family dwelling on a property, as the case may be,
between November 1 and March 31, using rates adopted by city council
resolution. On an annual basis, the monthly metered wastewater fee shall be
adjusted based upon such average use of water used by each property or a
multiple-family dwelling, as the case may be, between November 1 and March 31
of the following year, except as provided under subsection D of this section.
      2.   New Account Or Seasonal User Fee: Effective January 1, 2015, except
as otherwise provided herein:
         a.   A new wastewater user, whose winter water use at the user's
property has not been established under subsection B1 of this section, shall be
charged the monthly wastewater fee as follows, until the metered wastewater fee
can be established pursuant to subsection B1 of this section:
            (1)   For wastewater service connected between April 1 and October
31, the fee shall be based on water usage of four thousand (4,000) gallons per
month; and
            (2)   For wastewater service connected between November 1 and March
31 the fee shall be as described in 2.a.(1) until two full and consecutive
months of winter usage, at which time the wastewater fee will be recalculated
based upon the average usage in those two full and consecutive winter months;
            (3)   For non-residential wastewater users only, the rate
established by 2.a.(2), shall be applied retroactively to the account as of the
original connection date, and the account shall be adjusted for any difference
between the rate established by 2.a.(1) and the rate calculated under 2.a.(2).
            (4)   For any new wastewater service connection with a
corresponding water service connection other than ¾", the four thousand (4,000)
gallon per month fee calculation established herein shall be increased pursuant
to the multiples shown in
13.04.140:D.
         b.   A seasonal wastewater user, who does not have any winter water
use but has a history of prior water use, shall pay a monthly charge based on
an average monthly water usage on the property during the prior season of use,
including irrigation use, if any, and nonirrigation use; and
         c.   A seasonal wastewater user, who does not have any winter water
use and does not have a history of prior water use, shall pay a monthly charge
based on total water usage during the initial two (2) months of use.
         d.   Upon request by the wastewater user, the metered wastewater fee
for those properties identified as having a separate metered irrigation system
shall be based on the average water use measured by a meter for nonirrigation
water during two (2) full months of water use until the metered wastewater fee
can be established pursuant to subsection B1 of this section. In the event
average water usage measured by a meter for nonirrigation water is more than
four thousand (4,000) gallons per month, the wastewater user shall pay the
difference for the two (2) month period. In the event average water usage
measured by a meter for nonirrigation water is less than four thousand (4,000)
gallons per month, the wastewater user shall be entitled to a credit for the
difference for the two (2) month period.
         e.   Upon request by the wastewater user, the metered wastewater fee
for seasonal wastewater users with separate meters for irrigation and
nonirrigation water shall be based on the average water use measured by a meter
for nonirrigation water during the first two (2) full months of water use in
the first year of separate metering. For every year thereafter, the metered
wastewater fee for seasonal wastewater users shall be based on the average
water use for nonirrigation water during the previous season.
      3.   Bond Payment Fee: The monthly bond payment is intended to cover the
cost of bond and note retirement costs which are the legal indebtedness the
city is obligated to retire on a set schedule. Except as otherwise provided in
subsection E of this section, the monthly wastewater bond payment fee shall be
assessed to each property served by a service connection. The monthly bond
payment fee shall be based upon the average amount of water used by a property
or a dwelling unit in a multiple-family dwelling on a property, as the case may
be, between November 1 and March 31 of the following year and as adopted by
city council resolution. On an annual basis, the monthly wastewater bond
payment fee shall be adjusted based upon such average use of water used by each
property or a multiple-family dwelling, as the case may be, between November 1
and March 31 of the following year, except as provided under subsection D of
this section. Bond payment fees as adopted by city council resolution will
continue even if sewer services are discontinued at any point.
      4.   Exception For New Construction: Wastewater user fees shall not be
assessed until the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for new construction.
   C.   Reduction In Water User Base Fees And Wastewater Metered And Bond Fees:
A reduced monthly water user base fee described in subsection A1 of this
section and wastewater metered and bond fees described in subsections B1 and B3
of this section may be assessed upon proper application to the city clerk for
residences occupied by persons qualifying under the Blaine County assessor's
office for reduction in property tax rates shall have a reduced fee as adopted
by city council resolution.
   D.   Reduction In Metered Water And Wastewater Fees:
      1.   Leak In Private Water Service Line Or Within Building:
         a.   Notice Of Leak: In the event a leak is discovered in a private
water service line or in a private water service line in a building and the
city is notified of the leak or the city notifies the water user of the leak,
the metered water fee and the metered wastewater fee shall be eligible for a
credit for a period beginning thirty (30) days before the city is notified or
the city sends notification, until sixty (60) days following notification (the
"credit period"), provided the leak is repaired during the ninety (90) day
period following notification, except as otherwise provided herein. If the leak
is not repaired during the sixty (60) day period following notification, the
water user shall not be entitled to any reduction in the metered water fee and
the metered wastewater fee, and the water and wastewater metered fee shall be
calculated as set forth in subsections A2 and B2 of this section, except as
otherwise provided herein. If the leak is repaired during the first thirty (30)
days following notification, the metered water fee and the metered wastewater
fee during the credit period shall be calculated based on the water user's
water usage during the same period of the previous year, or the actual metered
quantity, whichever is less. If the leak is repaired between thirty (30) days
and sixty (60) days following notification, the metered water fee and metered
wastewater fee during the credit period shall be based on the following:
         [(the actual metered usage) - (the water user's water usage during the
same period of the previous year)] x 50%, or the actual metered quantity,
whichever is more.
         b.   Notice Of Repair: No credit will be issued for notification of
leak repairs or requests for fee adjustments that are submitted to the city
after one hundred eighty (180) days from the date that the leak was repaired.
The water user has the burden to notify the city when the leak is repaired.
         c.   Exceptions:
            (1)   If a leak is discovered in a private water service line
between December 1 and April 15 of the following year, or within an irrigation
system which is winterized within 30 days after discovery and before the leak
can be repaired, the thirty (30) and sixty (60) day periods described to repair
a leak in Section D.1.a. shall begin on April 15 and the credit period, as
defined above, shall be modified so that the credit period begins thirty (30)
days before the city is notified or the city sends notification, until June 14.
            (2)   If a leak is discovered in a private water service line
between November 1 and March 31, the wastewater fee will be adjusted to reflect
the metered water fee adjustment. The adjusted water fee shall be calculated as
set forth in subsections B1 and B3 of this section. The water user shall
receive a wastewater fee credit for the months following March 31 that the
unadjusted wastewater rate was charged.
         d.   Limitations: A maximum of two (2) water or wastewater fee credits
shall be issued within a twelve (12) month period.
      2.   Provision Of Water To Neighboring Water User: In the event water
service is disrupted to a water user based on a frozen private water service
line between December 1 and April 15 of the following year, and a water user
provides water from the municipal water system to the water user whose water
service was disrupted following notification to the city, the metered water fee
and metered wastewater fee to be charged to the water user who provides water
for the period of time between the date of notification and the date water is
no longer provided to the water user whose water service was disrupted (which
shall not extend beyond April 15) shall be based on the water usage by the
water user whose water service was disrupted during same period of the previous
year, or a water usage of four thousand (4,000) gallons per month, whichever is
less. In such a case, the metered water fee and the metered wastewater fee to
be charged to the water user whose water service was disrupted shall be based
on the water user's water usage during the same period of the previous year or
on a water usage of four thousand (4,000) gallons per month, whichever is less.
      3.   Freeze Protection: Subject to the requirements set forth herein, in
the event water is required to continually or intermittently run to prevent
frozen pipes in a private water service line between November 1 and March 31 of
the following year and if the city is notified in advance of the continual or
intermittent use of water, the metered wastewater fee for the period of time
between the date of notification and date water was not continually or
intermittently run shall be based on the water user's water usage as metered or
four thousand (4,000) gallons per month, whichever is less. A request for water
service freeze protection form must be submitted to the city as notification
each year. A prior year's approval does not constitute as an approval or
adequate notification for any subsequent year. The owner shall not run the
freeze protection water into the wastewater system and shall provide proof
satisfactory to the city that water is not run into the wastewater system. If
the owner does not provide notification of the need to run water for freeze
protection and proof that the water, which is continually or intermittently
run, is not discharged into the wastewater system, then there shall be no
adjustment of the metered wastewater fee. The provisions allowing for a
reduction of wastewater fees for freeze protection do not relieve an owner from
paying for the water used for freeze protection.
   E.   Calculating Multiple-Family Dwelling Water And Wastewater User Fees:
Each multiple-family dwelling unit shall be assessed water and wastewater fees
in the following manner:
      1.   Water User Fees: To calculate the metered water fee for multiple-
family dwellings, the total number of gallons used each month by a multiple-
family dwelling that does not meter each dwelling unit individually shall be
divided by the number of dwelling units within a multiple-family dwelling to
determine an average usage per dwelling unit. The metered user fee shall then
be calculated based on the average usage per dwelling unit. The sum of the
metered user fee for all the dwelling units within all of the multiple-family
dwellings on a property shall be assessed to the property owner or owner's
agent. The monthly user base and bond fee shall be charged for each dwelling
unit within all of the multiple-family dwellings on a property and assessed to
the property owner or owner's agent.
      2.   Wastewater User Fees: To calculate the wastewater fee for multiple-
family dwellings, the total number of gallons used each month, as determined by
subsection B of this section, for a multiple-family dwelling that does not
meter each dwelling unit individually shall be divided by the number of
dwelling units within a multiple-family dwelling to determine an average usage
per dwelling unit. The metered user and bond fees shall then be calculated
based on the average usage per dwelling unit. The sum of the metered user and
bond fees for all the dwelling units within all of the multiple-family
dwellings on a property shall be assessed to the property owner or owner's
agent.
   F.   Calculating Community Irrigation System Water User Fees: If a property
is supplied irrigation water through a community irrigation system in lieu of
supplying the same water through an individually metered connection that is
billed consistent with the provisions of this chapter, then the community
irrigation system water user fee should be assessed in the following manner:
      1.   To calculate the metered water fee for community irrigation systems,
the total number of gallons used each month shall be divided by the number of
properties served to determine an average usage per property. The metered user
fee shall then be calculated based on the average usage per property. The sum
of the metered user fees for all of the properties within the community
irrigation system shall be assessed to the community system in a single lump
sum amount. The monthly user base and bond fee shall not be charged because
those fees are already accounted for in the individually metered connections.
   G.   Calculating City Park Water Fees: City park water fees shall be
assessed in the following manner:
      1.   Water Fees: To calculate the metered water fee for a City park, the
total number of gallons used each month by a City park shall be divided by the
maximum number of potential dwelling units (if hypothetically developed for
residential use), based on adjacent zoning district minimum lot size, less a
forty percent (40%) infrastructure area deduction, to determine an average
usage per potential dwelling unit, to be referred to as a "park unit". The
metered user fee shall then be calculated based on the average usage per park
unit. A park unit calculation shall be determined, at the sole discretion of
the Hailey Public Works Director. The sum of the metered user fee for all park
units within each park shall be assessed to the property owner. The monthly
user base and bond fee shall be charged for each park unit within a park
property and assessed to the property owner. (Ord. 1273 § 1, 2020; Ord. 1246,
2019; Ord. 1237, 2018; Ord. 1189, 2015; Ord. 1188, 2015; Ord. 1162, 2014; Ord.
1153, 2014; Ord. 1145, 2014; Ord. 1139, 2013; Ord. 1094 §§ 1, 2, 2011; Ord.
1091 §§ 1 - 3, 2011; Ord. 1085 §§ 1 - 3, 2011; Ord. 1078 § 1, 2010; Ord. 1073
§§ 1, 2, 2010)
13.04.140: WATER AND WASTEWATER CONNECTION FEES:
   A.   The owner or agent of any property connected to the Municipal water or
wastewater system shall pay a water connection fee for the value of water
service and a wastewater connection fee for the value of wastewater service.
Connection fees shall be paid to the City on or before the issuance of a
building permit, except as provided in subsection
15.08.020E of this Code. The basis for the connection fee for those persons or
entities connecting to the Municipal water and wastewater systems is to charge
the value of the system capacity that the new user will utilize at that point
in time. The value of the system is determined each year by updating the
original construction cost of each major capital improvement to the system to
determine the cost to replace that improvement in that particular year. This is
accomplished by determining the annual average engineering news record
construction costs index ("ENR (CCI)") in the year that the improvements were
made and the year that the connection fee is being determined. The ENR (CCI)
for the year calculated is divided by the ENR (CCI) for the year in which the
improvements were made. The value is then multiplied by the original cost for
the improvements. The value obtained is the estimated cost to replace the
improvements at the time the connection fee is calculated ("gross system
value"). The gross system value to replace the system must be adjusted by
subtracting the remaining bond principal to be retired and the unfunded
depreciation to obtain the "net system value". The remaining bond principal to
be paid for bond retirement is determined from the bond retirement schedule
each year. The remaining bond interest is not subtracted from gross system
value.
   B.   The following is the equation for determining the net system value of
the water and wastewater systems:
         Net system value = gross system value - remaining bond principal -
unfunded depreciation.
   C.   All three-fourths inch (3/4") water services shall be treated as one
City standard base connection. The base connection fee, as determined for a
standard three-fourths inch (3/4") residential connection, is then determined
by dividing the net system value by the design capacity of the system component
expressed in City standard three-fourths inch (3/4") residential connections.
All other size connections shall pay a connection fee based upon the size of
the water service using the multiplication factors set forth in subsection D of
this section. The size of the water service shall be used as the determination
of the wastewater connection fee using the multiplication factors set forth in
subsection D of this section.
   D.   For a water service larger than three-fourths inch (3/4"), the
connection fees for both water and wastewater services shall be based upon the
size of the water service and shall be based upon the following schedule:
 
Water Service Size Multiplication Factor
1 inch             1.7
11/2 inch          3.3
2 inches           5.3
3 inches           15
4 inches           25
6 inches           50
 
   E.   Accessory dwelling units connected through a meter serving the primary
residence shall be assessed an additional connection fee at a multiple of 0.24
times the base connection fee for a 3/4" meter. Accessory dwelling units with
their own individual meter shall be assessed the full connection fee based on
meter size.
   F.   The design capacity of the system component is determined by the City
Engineer based upon City policy and sound engineering practices.
   G.   If a property is supplied irrigation water through a community
irrigation system in lieu of supplying the same water through an individually
metered connection that is billed consistent with the provisions of this
chapter, then the irrigation connection fee shall be reduced so that the
property is not charged twice for the value of the system capacity anticipated
to be used.
   As an example, the connection fee for a metered four inch (4") irrigation
connection is set at twenty five (25) times the price of a standard base
connection. If that irrigation connection is serving twenty five (25)
properties already served by individual meters, then the value for the capacity
of the water system has already been charged and the four inch (4") metered
irrigation connection shall only be charged the cost of the meter assembly
itself. (Ord. 1281, 2021; Ord. 1237, 2018; Ord. 1188, 2015; Ord. 1094, 2011)
13.04.150: ADMINISTRATION OF MUNICIPAL WATER AND WASTEWATER SYSTEMS:
   A.   Water And Wastewater Department Budget: The water and wastewater
department of the city shall, during the month of June of each year, propose an
estimated budget showing the anticipated costs of replacement, repair,
maintenance and operation of the municipal water and wastewater systems for the
next fiscal year. The previously established water and wastewater connection
fund shall continue to be used for the purposes established by the water and
wastewater department and approved by the mayor and city council.
   B.   Annual Calculation Of Fees: The city council shall calculate on an
annual basis, or more frequently if deemed necessary by the city council, the
monthly water and wastewater user base, bond payment, metered water and
irrigation fees, metered wastewater fees, connection fees, and other fees
authorized by this chapter to be charged by the city pursuant to the provisions
set forth herein. The fees shall be established by a resolution of the city
council, duly made, passed and entered into the minutes of the meeting of the
city council, and shall become effective upon the date as established within
the resolution.
   C.   Water And Wastewater User Fees; Delinquency And Notice: All water and
wastewater user fees shall be due and payable to the city clerk on or before
the bill closing date of each month's bill and, upon failure to pay within the
time as prescribed, each user shall pay, in addition to the amount due, the sum
of two dollars ($4.00) and interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per
annum.
   D.   Discontinuance Of Water/Wastewater Service For Default: All bills for
water and wastewater user fees not paid within ten (10) days after the due date
shall authorize the city, in addition to its rights and remedies set forth
herein, to discontinue the water service to any such defaulting customer after
ten (10) days' written notice sent by U.S. mail to the customer. If a customer
fails to pay all delinquent fees within the ten (10) day period, the city shall
be authorized to disconnect the water service for the customer without further
notice and shall assess discontinuance fee as established by resolution against
the defaulting customer. Recommencement of water service shall be made
following the payment of the discontinuance fee, a recommencement fee as
established by resolution, and delinquent water and/or wastewater fees due.
Deposits held by the City shall be applied to pay current charges on customer
accounts until the deposits are depleted. Should the customer who paid the
deposit no longer reside at the address for which the deposit was paid, the
deposit shall be refunded to the customer who paid the deposit.
   E.   Commencement Of Services By Owner: The owner or owner's agent shall
request the start of water and wastewater service in writing. This written
request shall begin all water and wastewater user fees.
   F.   Discontinuance Of Services By Owner: Should an owner, or his agent,
request a water service to be discontinued, the request shall be made in
writing and the city shall discontinue service by closing and locking off the
water meter vault. The owner, or his agent, shall pay to the city a service fee
as established by city council resolution. The owner or his agent must request,
in writing, the city to place the line back in service before the water meter
vault valve is reopened. There shall be a service fee as established by city
council resolution for reopening the service. During any period of
discontinuance, the payment of both the water and wastewater monthly bond
payment fees shall continue, while the payment of the water and wastewater user
base fees shall not be charged.
   G.   Landlord/Tenant Agreements: All monthly water or wastewater user fees
will be charged against the property where the private water or wastewater
service line is installed, except that owners or their authorized agents may,
by written request, authorize the city clerk to charge water or wastewater user
fees against an occupant, tenant or contract purchaser of specific property. If
a preexisting deposit is held by the City, this deposit will be refundable to
the depositor, or his agent, at the termination of occupancy with satisfactory
identification and upon written request. Any outstanding charges (applicable
discontinuance or recommencement fee and delinquent water and/or wastewater
fees due up to the date of termination) owed by the tenant will be deducted
from the deposit and the balance refunded to the depositor. The deposit shall
be refunded within the normal accounts payable process.
   H.   Water And Wastewater System Funds: All fees received and collected
under authority of this chapter shall be deposited and credited to special
funds to be designated as the water system fund and the wastewater system fund.
The accounts of the funds shall show all receipts and expenditures for the
maintenance, operation, upkeep and repair of the municipal water and wastewater
systems and any payments into a sinking fund established for the purpose of
paying principal of and interest on the water and wastewater bond or note
indebtedness of the city, which shall, from time to time, be outstanding. As
provided by law, when budgeted and appropriated, the funds and credits to the
account of the water and wastewater system(s) shall be available for the
payment of the requirements of maintenance, operation, repairs and upkeep of
the municipal water and wastewater system, and to the extent legally available,
for payment into a sinking fund established for the payment of the principal of
and interest on the water and wastewater bond and note indebtedness of the
city, which shall, from time to time, be outstanding.
   I.   Insufficient Funds Checks: An insufficient funds fee shall be assessed
to all accounts that have returned payments. The fee for insufficient funds
shall be assessed in an amount adopted by city council resolution and
consistent with the cost of collection set forth in Idaho Code section 28-22-
105, as amended.
   J.   Administrative Fee For Sale Or Lease Of Property: When there is a sale
or conveyance of a property, or a lease of a property resulting in a landlord/
tenant agreement, an administrative fee shall be assessed in an amount as
adopted by city council resolution.
   K.   Fee Waiver: A fee waiver for twenty four (24) hour turn on/off for home
inspections and plumbing repairs for sale or foreclosure shall be applied as
adopted by city council resolution. (Ord. 1273 § 1, 2020; Ord. 1189, 2015; Ord.
1121, 2013; Ord. 1091 §§ 1 - 3, 2011; Ord. 1332, 9-25-2023)
13.04.160: UNAVAILABILITY OF MUNICIPAL WATER AND WASTEWATER SYSTEMS:
Where the municipal water and/or wastewater system(s) are not available under
the provisions of this chapter, a private water system or a private wastewater
system may be installed; provided, that the system(s) comply with all the
provisions of this chapter.
   A.   Before the commencement of construction of a private water system or a
private wastewater system, the owner shall first obtain a written permit from
the city. The application for said permit shall be made on a form furnished by
the city, which the applicant shall supplement by plans, specifications and
other information as may be deemed necessary by the city. A permit and
inspection fee established by resolution shall be paid to the city at the time
the application is filed.
   B.   A permit for a private water system or a private wastewater system
shall not permit the use of the system until the installation is completed to
the satisfaction of the city. The city shall be allowed to inspect the work at
any stage of construction, and the applicant for the permit shall notify the
city when the work is ready for various inspections, and before any underground
works are covered. The applicant shall request an inspection by the city two
(2) business days in advance of the need.
   C.   The type, capacities, location and layout of a private water system or
a private wastewater system shall comply with all of the rules and regulations
and recommendations of all applicable federal, state and local authorities.
   D.   Every two (2) years a private wastewater system shall be inspected and
maintained by a licensed subsurface sewage installer or pumper, who is
recognized on a list furnished by DEQ. This inspection shall be conducted at
the owner's expense. Documentation of the inspection shall be submitted to the
city and shall include a report detailing the condition of the system and
maintenance that was conducted.
   E.   At such times as the municipal water system becomes available to the
property served by the private water system, and the owner or tenant avails
himself of the municipal service, it is mandatory that the private water supply
is not connected or cross connected in any way to the water lines served by the
municipal water system and shall properly abandon the well in the private water
system. At such times as the municipal wastewater system becomes available to
the property served by the private wastewater system, the owner or agent shall
connect to the municipal wastewater system and properly abandon the private
wastewater system, including the removal of any septic tank and leach field.
   F.   The owners shall operate and maintain the private water and wastewater
system in a sanitary manner at all times, without any contamination to the
municipal water and wastewater systems, and at no expense to the city.
   G.   No statement contained in this section shall be construed to interfere
with any additional requirements that may be imposed by applicable federal or
state authorities, such as the Idaho department of health and welfare or the
Idaho department of water resources. (Ord. 1188, 2015; Ord. 1094, 2011)

   A.   Purpose And Policy: This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for
users of the city wastewater collection system and publicly owned treatment
works (POTW) for the city of Hailey and enables the city to protect public
health and to comply with all applicable local, state and federal laws,
including the clean water act (33 USC section 1251 et seq.) and the general
pretreatment regulations (40 CFR part 403).
   B.   Objectives: The objectives of this chapter are:
      1.   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will
interfere with the normal operation of the system and the use and disposal of
the resulting municipal sludge;
      2.   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will
pass through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters, or
otherwise be incompatible with the system;
      3.   To protect POTW personnel who may be affected by wastewater and
sludge in the course of their employment and to protect the general public;
      4.   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and
sludge from the system and to ensure that the quality of the wastewater
treatment plant sludge is maintained at a level which allows its use and
disposal in compliance with applicable statutes and regulations;
      5.   To allow the city to control wastewater inflow and to require users
of the POTW with unacceptable effluents to pretreat those effluents for the
removal of unacceptable compounds.
   C.   Regulations: This chapter provides for the regulation of discharges
into the POTW and shall apply to all users of the POTW. This chapter authorizes
the issuance of pretreatment discharge permit; authorizes monitoring,
compliance and enforcement activities; establishes administrative review
procedures; requires user reporting; and provides for the setting of fees for
the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established
herein. This chapter does not provide for recovery of operations, maintenance
or replacement costs of the POTW, or the costs associated with the construction
of collection and treatment systems used by industrial users, in proportion to
their use of the POTW, which are the subject of other provisions set forth in
this title.
   D.   Administration: Except as otherwise provided herein, the POTW director,
public works director, wastewater division head or their designee shall
administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this chapter. Any powers
granted or duties imposed upon the POTW director, public works director or
wastewater division head may be delegated when appropriate to other city
personnel. (Ord. 1086 §§ 1 - 5, 2011; Ord. 1070 § 1, 2010; Ord. 741 § 1, 1999)

standards as promulgated by the EPA pursuant to the act shall be met by all
users of the regulated industrial categories. The categorical pretreatment
standards found at 40 CFR ordinance I, subordinance N, parts 405-471, are
incorporated. An application for modification of the categorical pretreatment
standards may be considered for submittal to the EPA region 10 administrator,
or by the city when the city's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent
removal of the pollutants as defined by 40 CFR section 403.7.
      2.   State Requirements: State requirements and limitations on discharges
to the POTW shall be met by all users which are subject to such standards in
any instance which are more stringent than federal requirements and limitation,
or those in this chapter or other applicable ordinances.
      3.   Local Limits:
         a.   The city reserves the right to adopt local pollutant limits as
set forth in subsection D3b of this section, which may be more stringent than
federal and state requirements.
         b.   The following pollutants limits are established to protect
against pass-through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater
containing pollutant levels in excess of the following daily maximum allowable
discharge limits:
Pollutant mg/l

      4.   City Right Of Revision: The city reserves the right to amend this
chapter or an industrial wastewater permit to provide for more stringent
limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW where deemed necessary to
comply with the objectives set forth in section
13.05.010 of this chapter.
      5.   Dilution: No user shall, without written approval from the
wastewater division head, increase the use of potable or process water in any
way, nor mix separate waste streams, for the purpose of diluting a discharge as
a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment in order to achieve
compliance with the standards set forth in this chapter.
      6.   Mass Limitations: The wastewater division head may impose mass
limitations on users which are using dilution to meet the pretreatment
standards or requirements of this chapter or, in other cases, where the
imposition of mass limitations is deemed appropriate by the wastewater division
head.
      7.   Special Agreement: The city reserves the right to enter into special
agreements with users setting out special terms under which they may discharge
to the POTW. In no case will a special agreement waive compliance with a
federal categorical pretreatment standard or pretreatment requirements.
However, the user may request a net gross adjustment to a federal categorical
pretreatment standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. The user may also
request a variance from the federal categorical pretreatment standard from the
wastewater division head. Such request will be approved only if the user can
prove that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from
the factors considered by EPA when establishing the applicable federal
categorical pretreatment standard. A user requesting a fundamentally different
factor variance must comply with the procedural and substantive provisions set
forth in 40 CFR 403.13.
      8.   Pretreatment Facilities: Users shall provide necessary wastewater
treatment as required to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance
with all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements set out in this
chapter within the time limitations specified by the EPA, the state or the
city, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities required to pretreat
wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated and
maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment
facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review,
and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The
review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user
from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an
acceptable discharge to the city under the provisions of this chapter.
      9.   Additional Pretreatment Measures:
         a.   Fat, oil and grease and grit interceptors/traps shall be provided
when in the opinion of the POTW director, they are necessary for the proper
handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of fat, oil, grease and/or
grit. All such interceptors/traps shall be of a dual chamber design and shall
be a type and capacity approved by the POTW director. More capacity shall be
required when, in the opinion of the POTW director, it is necessary for
adequate treatment of effluent. Any other users shall also provide interceptors
when, in the opinion of the POTW director, they are necessary for the proper
handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of fats, oils, greases and/
or grit. Interceptors/traps shall be located as to be easily accessible for
cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors/traps shall be inspected, cleaned
and repaired as per manufacturers' recommendations and/or at the discretion of
the POTW director or his designee in accordance with city of Hailey BMPs,
established by resolution, and maintained in proper operating condition, by the
user at his expense.
         b.   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved, combustible gas detection meter.
         c.   The introduction of chemicals, bacterial, enzyme and/or any other
additive into fat, oil and grease, directly or indirectly, that causes
interference with the normal operation of the unit or causes pass-through of
prohibited substances is prohibited.
         d.   Interceptor/trap maintenance and cleaning records shall be
maintained by the user and made available to the city inspectors for review
upon request.
         e.   Interceptors/traps shall not be required for domestic user.
   E.   Deadline For Compliance With Applicable Pretreatment Requirements:
      1.   Existing users (categorical users) covered by the federal
categorical pretreatment standards shall be in compliance within three (3)
years of the date the standards become effective, unless a shorter compliance
time is specified in the appropriate standard. If necessary, the city shall
establish a final compliance deadline date for any existing significant
industrial user (SIU) not covered by categorical pretreatment standards, or for
any user when the local limits for said user are more restrictive than federal
categorical pretreatment standards.
      2.   New sources and new users (that fit the definition of SIU) are
required to comply with applicable pretreatment standards within the shortest
feasible time (not to exceed 90 days from the beginning of discharge). "New
sources" and "new users" shall install and have in operating condition and
shall "start up" all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable
pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge.
      3.   Any pretreatment discharge permit issued to a categorical user shall
not contain a compliance date beyond any deadline date established by federal
categorical pretreatment standards. Any other existing SIU, which is in
noncompliance with any local limits, shall be provided a compliance schedule
placed in an order, or other similar enforcement document, as outlined in the
"City Of Hailey Enforcement And Response Guide", or elsewhere in this chapter.
   F.   Accidental Discharge/Slug Control Plans:
      1.   The city may require any user to develop and implement an accidental
spill prevention control plan (ASPP). Where deemed necessary by the wastewater
division head, facilities to prevent accidental discharges or slug discharges
of pollutants shall be provided and maintained at the user's cost and expense.
An ASPP showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection
shall be submitted to the city for review and approval before implementation.
The wastewater division head shall determine which user is required to develop
a plan and shall require this plan to be submitted within ninety (90) days
after notification by the city. Each user shall implement its ASPP as submitted
or as modified after such plan has been reviewed and approved by the city.
Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures by the city shall
not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify its facility as
necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter and other federal, state or
local regulations.
      2.   Any user required to develop and implement an ASPP shall submit a
plan which addresses, at a minimum, the following:
         a.   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
         b.   Description of stored chemicals;
         c.   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental
or slug discharge. Such notification must also be given for any discharge which
would violate any of the standards set forth in subsections A, B and C of this
section; and
         d.   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants (including solvents) and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
      3.   Users shall notify the wastewater division head and/or city
immediately upon the occurrence of a "slug" or "accidental discharge" of
substances prohibited by this chapter. The notification shall include location
of discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume,
and corrective actions. Any affected user shall be liable for any expense, loss
or damage to the POTW, in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the
city on account thereof under state or federal law.
      4.   Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge, the user
shall submit to the wastewater division head, a detailed written report
describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user
to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the
user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a
result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil
penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or other
applicable federal or state law.
      5.   Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on the
user's premises advising employees whom to call in the event of a slug or
accidental discharge. Employers shall instruct all employees who may cause or
discover such a discharge with respect to emergency notification procedures.

13.05.060: ADMINISTRATION:
   A.   Wastewater Users: It is unlawful to discharge sewage, industrial wastes
or other wastes to any sewer within the jurisdiction of the city and/or to the
POTW without having first complied with the terms of this chapter. All existing
users who discharge industrial wastes or other wastes to the POTW shall comply
with all terms of this chapter within ninety (90) days of being notified by the
city. All users proposing to discharge waste to the POTW shall comply with all
terms of this chapter prior to discharging waste to the POTW.
   B.   Pretreatment Discharge Permit: No user shall discharge wastewater into
the POTW without first obtaining a pretreatment discharge permit from the city.
Any violation of the terms and conditions of a pretreatment discharge permit
shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and shall subject the pretreatment
discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in this chapter. Obtaining a
pretreatment discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to
comply with all federal and state pretreatment standards or requirements, or
with any other requirements of federal, state and local law. The wastewater
division head may require other users, including liquid waste haulers, to
obtain pretreatment discharge permit (as necessary) to carry out the purposes
of this chapter. The city reserves the right not to issue a pretreatment
discharge permit if the applicant cannot meet the pretreatment discharge
requirements. Any pretreatment discharge permit shall expressly state that a
violation of this chapter, or a pretreatment discharge permit, or order issued
under this chapter, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, will
make the permittee liable for any expense, loss or damage to the city
wastewater system or POTW.
   C.   Pretreatment Discharge Permit Requirements:
      1.   Industrial Waste Acceptance Permit: All existing users and users
proposing to connect to, or to discharge sewage, industrial wastes and other
wastes to, the POTW shall obtain a pretreatment discharge permit. The
pretreatment discharge permit shall be issued for a specified time period, not
to exceed five (5) years. A pretreatment discharge permit may be issued for a
period less than five (5) years at the discretion of the city. Each permit will
indicate a specific date upon which it will expire.
      2.   Disclosure Forms: Prior to the city granting a pretreatment
discharge permit, the user shall complete and file with the city a disclosure
declaration in the form prescribed by the city. Existing users shall file
disclosure forms within thirty (30) days of being notified by the city.
Proposed new users shall file their disclosure forms at least ninety (90) days
prior to connecting to the POTW. The disclosure to be made by the user shall be

applications will not be processed and will be returned to the user for
revision.
      4.   Signatory And Certification Requirement: All pretreatment discharge
permit applications and user reports must be signed by an authorized
representative of the user.
   D.   Pretreatment Discharge Permit Decisions: The wastewater division head,
or his designee, will evaluate the complete disclosure form and data furnished
by the user and may require additional information, including an inspection of
the premises. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of a complete wastewater
discharge permit application, and after full evaluation of the information
provided, and if necessary, a complete inspection of the premises, the
wastewater division head, or his designee, will determine whether or not to
issue a wastewater discharge permit, and type of permit to be issued. After
acceptance of the data furnished, the city shall notify the user of the city's
acceptance or denial thereof. Where determined necessary by the wastewater
division head, or his designee, a pretreatment discharge permit may be issued
setting forth limitations of various waste strengths as addressed under this
chapter.
   E.   Pretreatment Discharge Permit Conditions:
      1.   Revocation Of Pretreatment Discharge Permit: The pretreatment
discharge permit issued to a user by the city may be revoked for, but not
limited to, the following reasons:
         a.   Failure to notify the city of significant changes to the
wastewater prior to the changed discharge;
         b.   Failure to provide notification to the city of changed
conditions;
         c.   Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts
in the pretreatment discharge permit application;
         d.   Falsifying self-monitoring reports;
         e.   Tampering with monitoring equipment;
         f.   Failure to meet discharge limitations;
         g.   Failure to pay fines;
         h.   Failure to pay sewer charges;
         i.   Failure to meet compliance schedules;
         j.   Failure to complete a wastewater survey or the wastewater
discharge permit application;
         k.   Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of a permitted
facility;

terms of the pretreatment discharge permit or this chapter; or
         m.   If the city has to invoke its emergency provision as stated in
subsection
13.05.070A of this chapter.
      2.   Transfer Of Pretreatment Discharge Permit:
         a.   A pretreatment discharge permit may be reassigned or transferred
to a new owner and/or operator only if the permittee gives at least thirty (30)
days' advance notice to the wastewater division head, and the wastewater
division head approves the pretreatment discharge permit transfer. The notice
to the wastewater division head must include a written certification by the new
owner and/or operator which:
            (1)   States that the new owner and/or operator (user) has no
immediate intent to change the facility's operations and processes;
            (2)   Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to
occur; and
            (3)   Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the
existing pretreatment discharge permit.
         b.   Provided, that the requirements set forth in subsection E2a of
this section are met, and that there are no significant changes to the
manufacturing operation or wastewater discharge, the new owner will be
considered an "existing user" and be covered by the existing limits and
requirements in the previous owner's permit.
         c.   Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer, as set forth
above, renders the pretreatment discharge permit void as of the date of
facility transfer.
      3.   Pretreatment Discharge Permit Modification: The wastewater division
head may modify the pretreatment discharge permit for good cause including, but
not limited to, the following:
         a.   To incorporate any new or revised federal, state or local
pretreatment standards or requirements;
         b.   To address significant alterations or additions to the user's
operation, processes, wastewater volume or character since the time of
pretreatment discharge permit issuance;
         c.   A change in the POTW that requires either a temporary or
permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge;
         d.   Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a
threat to the city's POTW, city personnel or the receiving waters;
         e.   Violation of any terms or conditions of the wastewater discharge
permit;
         f.   Misrepresentations or failure to fully disclose all relevant
facts in the pretreatment discharge permit application or in any required
reporting or inspection;
         g.   Revision of, or grant of, a variance from categorical
pretreatment standards pursuant to 40 CFR 403.13;
         h.   To correct typographical or other errors in the wastewater
discharge permit; or
         i.   To reflect a transfer of the facility ownership and/or operation
to a new owner/operator.
      4.   Duty To Reapply For Pretreatment Discharge Permit: Within thirty
(30) days of the permit expiration, the user shall reapply for reissuance of
the pretreatment discharge permit on a form provided by the city. A user, whose
existing pretreatment discharge permit has expired and who has submitted its
reapplication in the time period specified herein, shall be deemed to have an
effective pretreatment discharge permit until the city issues or denies the new
pretreatment discharge permit. A user, whose existing pretreatment discharge
permit has expired and who has failed to submit its reapplication in the time
period specified herein, shall be deemed to be discharging without a
pretreatment discharge permit.
      5.   Severability: The provisions of a pretreatment discharge permit are
severable, and if any provision of the pretreatment discharge permit, or the
application of any provision of the permit to any circumstance is held invalid,
the application of such provision to other circumstances, and the remainder of
the permit shall not be affected thereby.
      6.   Property Rights: The issuance of a pretreatment discharge permit
does not convey any property rights in either real or personal property, or any
exclusive privileges, nor does it authorize any infringement of federal, state
or local regulations, nor any action, at law or in equity, for invasion of
personal rights for violation of any federal, state or constitutional
protections.
      7.   Permit Holders Outside City Limits: All users outside the city
limits who discharge sewage, industrial wastes or other wastes to any sewer
within the jurisdiction of the city and/or to the POTW shall be subject to the
wastewater pretreatment use regulations as users inside the city limits and at
a minimum any other use regulation set forth in an agreement between the city
and the permit holder.
   F.   Pretreatment Discharge Permit Appeals:
      1.   Any user may appeal to the city council, within thirty (30) days of
its issuance or denial, subject to the following conditions:
         a.   Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be deemed to
be a waiver of the administrative appeal.
         b.   In its appeal petition, the appellant must indicate which
pretreatment discharge permit provisions are objected to, the reasons for this
objection, and the alternative condition, if any, it seeks to place on the
pretreatment discharge permit.
         c.   The issuance or denial of the pretreatment discharge permit shall
not be stayed pending the appeal.
      2.   The city council may affirm, modify or reverse a decision issuing or
denying a pretreatment discharge permit. The city council decision shall be
considered final administrative action for purposes of judicial review. After a
final administrative appeal has been brought before the city, an aggrieved
party seeking judicial review of such final administrative pretreatment
discharge permit decision must do so by filing a petition for review with the
district court for Blaine County within the state of Idaho.
   G.   Reporting Requirements For Users:
      1.   Compliance Date Report:
         a.   Within thirty (30) days following commencement of the
introduction of wastewater into the POTW by a new source or new user, this new
user shall, upon request of the wastewater division head, submit to the city a
report indicating the nature and concentration of all prohibited or regulated
substances contained in its discharge, and the average and maximum daily flow
in gallons.
         b.   In the case of categorical users, the flows and pollutant
concentrations (or mass) of the waste streams from processes regulated under
categorical pretreatment standards must be reported separately. This report
shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are
being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O&M and/or
pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements.
         c.   For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established by the city in accordance with procedures established in 40 CFR
403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long
term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production (or other measure of production), this report shall include the
user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period.
         d.   All compliance reports shall be signed by an authorized
representative of the user.
      2.   Periodic Compliance Reports:
         a.   Any user that is required to have a pretreatment discharge permit
and/or who is otherwise subject to any applicable pretreatment standard set
forth in this chapter, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard,
or in the case of a new user, after commencement of discharge to the city,
shall submit to the city during the months of June and December, unless
required more frequently by the wastewater division head, a report indicating
the nature and concentration of prohibited or regulated substances in the
effluent which are limited by the pretreatment standards hereof and/or as
prescribed within the pretreatment discharge permit. In addition, this report
shall include a record of all measured or estimated average and maximum daily
flows during the reporting period as set forth in subsection G1 of this
section.
         b.   Reports of users shall contain all results of sampling and
analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration
of regulated pollutants, or production and mass where required by the city. The
frequency of monitoring by the user shall be as prescribed by wastewater
division head, shall occur not less than twice a year, unless the city agrees
to sample instead. All analyses shall be performed in accordance with
procedures established by the city pursuant to section 304(g) of the act and
contained in 40 CFR part 136, and subsections K and L of this section, or with
any other test procedures approved by the wastewater division head. The record
of all flow measurements (average and maximum) taken at the designated sampling
locations shall include any additional information required by this chapter
and/or the pretreatment discharge permit. Both daily maximum and average
concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported.
         c.   Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
approved by the wastewater division head and this chapter and shall be
representative of wastewater discharges during the reporting period. Where 40
CFR part 136 does not include sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutants in question, or where the wastewater division head determines that
the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the
pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed using validated
analytical methods, or any other sampling and analytical procedures, including
procedures suggested by the wastewater division head.
         d.   Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement;
provided, however, that the city may accept reports of average and maximum
flows estimated by verifiable techniques if the wastewater division head
determines that an actual measurement is not feasible.
         e.   The wastewater division head, for good cause shown, and
considering such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget
cycles, or other extenuating factors, may authorize the submission of such
reports on months other than those specified above.
         f.   The city may require self-monitoring by the user or, if requested
by the user, may agree to perform the periodic compliance monitoring needed to
prepare the periodic compliance report required under this section. If the city
agrees to perform such periodic compliance monitoring, it may charge the user
for such monitoring, based upon the costs incurred by the city for sampling and
analyses. Any such charges shall be added to the normal sewer charge and shall
be payable as part of the sewer bills. The city is under no obligation to
perform periodic compliance monitoring for a user.
         g.   A certification statement signed by an authorized representative
of the user is required as a part of the periodic compliance reports.
      3.   Notification Of Significant Production Changes: Any user operating
under a pretreatment discharge permit incorporating equivalent mass or
concentration limits shall notify the city within two (2) business days after
the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will
significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not providing a
notice of such anticipated change will be required to comply with the existing
limits contained in its pretreatment discharge permit.
      4.   Notice Of Potential Problems, Including Accidental Spills And/Or
Slug Loadings: Any user shall notify the city immediately of all discharges
that could cause problems to the POTW, including any slug loadings as defined
in sections 13.05.010 through 13.05.040 of this chapter. The notification shall
include the concentration and volume of the discharge. Corrective action,
including steps being taken to reduce any adverse impact should also be noted
during the notification. Any user who discharges a slug (or slugs) of
prohibited materials shall be liable to the city for any expense, loss or
damage to the POTW, in addition to the amount of any fines imposed under state
or federal law.
      5.   Noncompliance Reporting: If sampling performed by a user indicates a
violation, the user shall notify the city within twenty four (24) hours of
becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling within
five (5) days and shall submit the results of the repeat analysis to the city
within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation, except the user
is not required to resample if the city performs sampling at the user facility
between the time when the user performs its initial sampling and the time when
the user receives the results of this sampling.
      6.   Notification Of Changed Discharge: All users shall promptly notify
the city in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of
pollutants in their discharge, including significant manufacturing process
changes, pretreatment modifications, and the listed or characteristic hazardous
wastes for which the user has submitted initial notification under 40 CFR
403.12(p).
      7.   Notification Of Hazardous Waste:
         a.   Existing users that are discharging fifteen (15) kilograms of
hazardous wastes as defined in 40 CFR 261 (listed or characteristic wastes) in
a calendar month, or any facility which generates any amount of acutely
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) are required to
provide a onetime notification in writing to the city and the EPA regional
waste management division director. Any existing user exempt from this
notification, shall comply with the requirements contained herein within thirty
(30) days of becoming aware of a discharge of fifteen (15) kilograms of
hazardous wastes in a calendar month or the discharge of acutely hazardous
wastes to the city sewer system. Such notification shall include:
            (1)   The name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR part
261;
            (2)   The EPA hazardous waste number; and
            (3)   The type of discharge (continuous, batch or other).
         b.   If a user generates more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such
waste per calendar month to the sewer system, the notification shall also
contain the following information to the extent it is known or readily
available to the user:
            (1)   An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in
the wastes;
            (2)   An estimation of the mass and concentration of such
constituents in the waste streams discharged during that calendar month; and
            (3)   An estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste
streams expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months.
         c.   These notification requirements do not apply to pollutants
already reported under the self-monitoring requirements.
         d.   Whenever the EPA publishes final rules identifying additional
hazardous wastes or new characteristics of hazardous waste, a user shall notify
the city of the discharge of such a substance within ninety (90) days of the
effective date of such regulations.
         e.   In the case of any notification made under this subsection, a
user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and
toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   H.   Reports From Unpermitted Users: All others not required to obtain a
pretreatment discharge permit pursuant to this chapter shall provide
appropriate access for sampling, flow measurements and analysis to the city as
the wastewater division head, or his or her designee, may require. Users
subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain and make
available for inspection and copying all records of information obtained
pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter, and any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include
the date, exact place, method and time of sampling and the name of the person
(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; and the name of the
person who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used;
and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a
period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended
for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or POTW, or where the
user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the
wastewater division head.
   I.   Compliance Schedules For Meeting Applicable Pretreatment Standards: The
compliance schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing
preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major
components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc.). No
increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months.
   J.   Monitoring Facilities: The city may require the user to install
monitoring equipment as necessary.
      1.   Each user shall provide and operate, at the user's own expense, a
monitoring facility to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of each
sewer discharge to the sewer.
      2.   Each monitoring facility shall be situated on the user's premises,
except where such location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the
user. The city may permit the monitoring facility to be constructed in the
public street or sidewalk area providing that the facility is located so that
it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
      3.   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to allow
accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility,
sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and
proper operating condition at the expense of the user. All devices used to
measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated at a frequency
determined by the city to ensure their accuracy.
      4.   All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in
accordance with all applicable local construction standards and specifications
as well as local zoning and land use ordinances. Construction shall be
completed within one hundred twenty (120) days of receipt of the permit by the
user, unless a compliance schedule has been approved by the wastewater division
head.
   K.   Compliance Monitoring:
      1.   Inspection And Sampling: The city shall have the right to obtain
consent to enter the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of
this chapter, and any pretreatment discharge permit, or order issued hereunder,
is being met and whether the user is complying with all requirements thereof.
Users shall allow the city ready access to all parts of the premises for the
purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying and the
performance of any additional duties.
      2.   Search Warrants: If the wastewater division head, or his or her
designee, has been refused access to a building, structure or property, or any
part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there
may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect as part
of a routine inspection program of the city designed to verify compliance with
this chapter or any pretreatment discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or
to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then
the wastewater division head, or his or her designee, shall seek issuance of
search and/or seizure warrant from the district court in and for the county of
Blaine. Such warrant shall be served by the wastewater division head, and his
or her designee, in the company of a uniformed police officer of the city or
local county.
      3.   Vandalism: No person shall wilfully or negligently break, damage,
destroy, uncover, deface, tamper with or prevent access to any structure,
appurtenance or equipment, or other part of the POTW. Any person found in
violation of this requirement shall be subject to the sanctions set out in this
chapter.
   L.   Sampling And Analytical Requirements:
      1.   Sampling Requirements For Users:
         a.   A minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide,
total phenols, fats, oils and greases, sulfide and volatile organics. The
wastewater division head will determine on a case by case basis whether the
user may be able to composite the individual grab samples. For all other
pollutants, twenty four (24) hour composite must be obtained through flow
proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The wastewater
division head may waive flow proportional composite sampling for any user that
demonstrates that flow proportional sampling is infeasible. In such cases,
samples may be obtained through time proportional composite sampling
techniques, or through a minimum of eight (8) grab samples, where the user
demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent
being discharged.
         b.   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if such exist, or immediately downstream from the regulated or
manufacturing process if no pretreatment exists, or as determined by the
wastewater division head and contained in the user's pretreatment discharge
permit.
            (1)   For categorical users, if other wastewaters are mixed with
the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user should measure the
flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastes formula
of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the applicable
pretreatment standards.
            (2)   For other SIUs, for which the city has adjusted its local
limits to factor out dilution flows, the user should measure the flows and
concentrations necessary to evaluate compliance with the adjusted pretreatment
standard(s).
         c.   All sample results shall indicate the time, date and place of
sampling and methods of analysis and shall certify that such sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges from the user. If a user samples more frequently than what was
required in its pretreatment discharge permit, it must submit all results of
sampling and analysis of the discharge as part of a self-monitoring report
during the reporting period.
      2.   Analytical Requirements: All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in
40 CFR part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical
pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR part 136 does not contain sampling or
analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must
be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA.
   M.   Pretreatment Facilities:
      1.   Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities shall be
submitted to the city for review, and must be acceptable to the city before
construction of the facility. The review of such plans shall in no way relieve
the user from the responsibility of modifying its facility as necessary to
produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this
chapter.
      2.   Within a reasonable time after the completion of the wastewater
pretreatment facility, the user shall furnish its operation and maintenance
procedures for the wastewater division head to review.
      3.   Any subsequent, significant changes to the pretreatment facility or
its method of operation shall be reported to and accepted by the wastewater
division head prior to the user's initiation of the changes.
   N.   TTO Reporting: Categorical users which are required by EPA to eliminate
and/or reduce the levels of toxic organics (TTOs) discharged into the sewer
system must follow the categorical pretreatment standards for that industry.
Those users must also meet the following requirements:
      1.   Categorical users must sample, as part of the application
requirements, for all the organics listed under the TTO limit (no exceptions);
and
      2.   The user elects to develop a solvent management plan in lieu of
continuously monitoring for TTO, the user must routinely submit a certification
statement as part of its self-monitoring report that there has been no dumping
of concentrated toxic organic into the wastewater and that it is implementing a
solvent management plan as approved by the city. (Ord. 1086 §§ 1 - 5, 2011;
Ord. 1070 § 1, 2010; Ord. 741 § 1, 1999)
13.05.070: ENFORCEMENT:
   A.   Emergency Suspension Of Service And Pretreatment Discharge Permit: The
city may, without advance notice, order the suspension of the wastewater
treatment service to a user when it appears to the city that an actual or
threatened discharge:
      1.   Presents or threatens an imminent or substantial danger to the
health or welfare of persons, or substantial danger to the environment. Any
user notified by the city's suspension order shall immediately cease all
discharges. In the event of failure of the users to comply with the suspension
order, the city is authorized to physically prevent the discharge from entering
the public owned sewerage collection system, and assess all associated costs to
the user.
      2.   Threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or to violate
any pretreatment limits imposed by this chapter. Any user notified of the
city's suspension order shall immediately cease all discharges. In the event of
failure of the user to comply with the suspension order, the city may commence
judicial proceedings immediately thereafter to compel the user's specific
compliance with such order and/or to recover civil penalties. The city shall
reinstate the wastewater treatment service upon proof by the user of the
elimination of the noncomplying discharge or conditions creating the threat as
set forth above. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a
hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
   B.   Termination Of Treatment Services; Nonemergency Procedures:
      1.   Termination: The city may terminate wastewater treatment services to
any user who:
         a.   Fails to factually report accurately the wastewater constituents
and characteristics of its discharge;
         b.   Fails to report significant changes in wastewater constituents or
characteristics; or
         c.   Violates the provisions of this chapter, or any order of the city
with respect thereto.
      2.   Cease And Desist Orders: When the wastewater division head finds
that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this
chapter, a pretreatment discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations
are likely to recur, the wastewater division head may issue an order to the
user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the
user to:
         a.   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
         b.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   C.   Administrative Enforcement Remedies:
      1.   Notices Of Violation (NOV): When the city finds that a user has
violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this chapter, a
pretreatment discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the city may serve that user a written
notice of violation (NOV). If required, within five (5) working days of the
receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required
actions, shall be submitted by the user to the city. Submission of this plan in
no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or
after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit
the authority of the city to take any action, including emergency actions or
any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
      2.   Consent Orders: The city may enter into consent orders, assurances
of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement
with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include
specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a
time period specified by the document and as determined by the wastewater
division head. Use of a consent order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
      3.   Compliance Orders: When the wastewater division head finds that a
user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a
pretreatment discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the wastewater division head may issue an
order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come
into compliance within a time specified in the order. If the user does not come
into compliance within the time specified in the order, sewer service may be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders may also
contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional
self-monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the
deadline for compliance established for a federal categorical pretreatment
standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of
liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a
compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user.
      4.   Show Cause Hearing: Where the violation of this chapter is not
corrected in adherence to compliance orders or any other enforcement action in
a timely manner, the city may order any user which suffers or permits a
violation of this chapter to show cause before the city, or its duly authorized
representative, why the proposed service termination action should not be
taken. A written notice shall be served on the user by personal service, or
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested:
         a.   Specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the city
or its designee regarding the violation;
         b.   The reasons why the enforcement action is to be taken;
         c.   The proposed enforcement action.
The notice shall further direct the user to show cause before the city or its
designee why the enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the
hearing shall be served no less than ten (10) days before the hearing. Service
may be made on any agent, officer or authorized representative of a user. The
proceedings at the hearing shall be considered by the city, which shall then
enter appropriate orders with respect to the alleged violations of the user.
   D.   Judicial Proceedings: Following the entry of any order by the city with
respect to the violation by a user of this chapter, the city may commence in an
action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the appropriate local
court, including the following:
      1.   Injunctive Relief: When the wastewater division head or his designee
determines that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of
this chapter, a pretreatment discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the wastewater division head or
his designee may petition the district court of the fifth judicial in and for
the county of Blaine for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction,
as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
pretreatment discharge permit, order or other requirement imposed by this
chapter on activities of the user. The city may also seek such other action as
is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for
the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief
shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action
against a user.
      2.   Criminal Prosecution:
         a.   It shall be unlawful for any user to:
            (1)   Violate any provision of this chapter, a pretreatment
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement;
            (2)   Introduce any substance into the POTW which causes personal
injury or property damage;
            (3)   Knowingly make any false statements, representations or
certifications in any application, report, plan or other documentation filed,
or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter, pretreatment discharge
permit or order issued hereunder; or
            (4)   Falsify, tamper with or knowingly render inaccurate any
monitoring device or method required under this chapter.
         b.   Any person, firm or other legal entity violating any provision of
this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof,
shall be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00)
or imprisonment in the county jail for a period not to exceed six (6) months,
or both such fine and imprisonment. Each day such violation is committed or
permitted to continue shall constitute a separate offense and shall be
punishable as such hereunder. Any penalty shall be in addition to any other
cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state
law.
      3.   Restitution: Any user violating any of the provisions of this
chapter who discharges or causes a discharge producing a deposit or
obstruction, or causes damage to or impairs the city wastewater system shall be
liable to the city for any expense, loss or damage caused by such violation of
discharge. The city may bill the user for the actual and/or estimated cost
incurred by the city for any cleaning, sampling and monitoring expenses, repair
or replacement work caused by the violation or discharge, including reasonable
attorney fees, court costs and other expenses associated with the violation.
   E.   Civil Penalty:
      1.   Any user who violates an order of the city, or who fails to comply
with any provision of this chapter, or any regulations, rules or permits of the
city, issued pursuant to this chapter, shall be liable to the city for a civil
penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation. Each day
upon which a violation occurs or continues shall constitute a separate
violation. In the case of a monthly or other long term average discharge limit,
the penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
Such penalties may be recovered by judicial actions and/or, to the extent
permissible by state law, by administrative procedures.
      2.   A user desiring to dispute such penalty must file a written request
for the city to reconsider the fine, along with full payment of the fine,
within fifteen (15) days of the imposition of the penalty. Upon receipt of the
request to reconsider the penalty, the city council shall convene a hearing
within thirty (30) days of receiving the request. In the event the user's
appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto,
shall be returned to the user.
      3.   In determining the amount of civil liability, the city shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user and any other factor as
justice requires.
      4.   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
   F.   Remedies Nonexclusive: The provisions in this section are not exclusive
remedies. The rights and remedies provided by this chapter are cumulative and
the use of any one right or remedy shall not preclude the city from pursuing
any or all other remedies the city may have by law, statute, ordinance or
otherwise.
   G.   Affirmative Defenses To Discharge Violation:
      1.   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards if the
requirements of subsection E2 of this section are met.
      2.   A user who wishes to establish an affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
         a.   An upset occurred and that the user can identify the cause(s) of
the upset;
         b.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
         c.   The user has submitted the following information to the city
within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this
information is submitted orally, a written submission must be provided within 5
days):
            (1)   A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance;
            (2)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
            (3)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent reoccurrence of the noncompliance.
      3.   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
      4.   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
applicable pretreatment standards.
      5.   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with applicable pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the treatment
facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This
requirement applies to the situation where, among other things, the primary
source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. (Ord. 1086
§§ 1 - 5, 2011; Ord. 1070 § 1, 2010; Ord. 741 § 1, 1999)
13.05.080: RECORDS RETENTION:
All users subject to this chapter shall retain and preserve, for no less than
three (3) years, any records, books, documents, memoranda, reports,
correspondence and any and all summaries thereof, relating to monitoring,
sampling and chemical analyses made by or in behalf of a user in connection
with its discharge. All records which pertain to matters which are the subject
of administrative adjustment or any other enforcement of litigation activities
brought by the city pursuant hereto shall be retained and preserved by the user
until all enforcement activities have concluded and all periods of limitation
with respect to any and all appeals have expired. (Ord. 1070 § 1, 2010; Ord.
741 § 1, 1999)
13.05.090: NONLIABILITY:
   A.   It is expressly the purpose of this chapter to provide for and promote
the health, safety and welfare of the general public. It is not the intent of
this chapter to create or otherwise establish or designate any particular class
or group of persons who will or should be especially protected or benefited by
the terms of this chapter.
   B.   It is the specific intent of this chapter to place the obligation of
complying with these regulations upon the applicant or user and no provision
nor any term used in this chapter is intended to impose any other duty
whatsoever upon the city or any of its officers, employees or agents, except as
provided under the act or other related statutes of the United States or the
state of Idaho.
   C.   Nothing contained in this chapter is intended to be nor shall be
construed to create or form the basis for any tort liability on the part of the
city or its officers, employees or agents, for any injury or damage resulting
from failure of an applicant or user to comply with the provisions of this
chapter, or by reason or in consequence of any inspection, notice, order,
certificate, permission or approval authorized or issued or done in connection
with the implementation or enforcement of this chapter or inaction on the part
of the city related in any manner to the implementation or the enforcement of
this chapter by its officers, employees or agents. (Ord. 1070 § 1, 2010; Ord.

facts and circumstances of a proposed annexation for the purpose of
determining: a) whether the proposed annexation will be harmonious and in
accordance with the goals and policies of applicable components of the Hailey
comprehensive plan; and b) whether the proposed annexation would be in the best
interests of the citizens of Hailey. The commission shall also make a
recommendation that the property sought to be annexed should be zoned as one or
more particular zoning districts, as more fully described in the Hailey zoning
ordinance. The commission shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law
relating to the application's general compliance with the Hailey comprehensive
plan and to the commission's recommendation for zoning. The commission shall
forward those findings and conclusions in writing to the council and the
applicant. (Ord. 1050 § 1, 2010; Ord. 889 § 1, 2004)
14.01.090: COUNCIL REVIEW:
   A.   Conduct And Notice Of Council Hearing: Upon receipt of the commission's
findings of fact and conclusions of law, the council shall schedule a public
hearing to review the application for annexation. Notice of the public hearing
shall be conducted in the same manner as the notice for a commission hearing
pursuant to section
14.01.070 of this chapter. The council shall have the right to request further
information deemed necessary by the council at any time during the proceedings.
   B.   Fiscal Impact: The council shall require the applicant to pay, as
consideration for annexation and any annexation agreement, the fees established
by resolution, as amended, for annexation of property into the city. The
council retains the right to require further monetary or nonmonetary
contributions for any annexation to ensure the proposed annexation will not
have a negative fiscal impact upon the existing citizens of Hailey at the time
of annexation and in the future.
   C.   Findings:
      1.   During the public hearing process of the application for annexation,
the council shall make its own findings of fact and conclusions of law to
determine:
         a.   Whether the proposed application will be harmonious and in
accordance with the goals and policies of applicable components of the Hailey
comprehensive plan;
         b.   Whether the proposed annexation would be in the best interests of
the citizens of Hailey; and
         c.   To the extent possible, whether the proposed annexation will have
a negative fiscal impact upon the existing citizens of Hailey at the time of an
annexation and in the future.
      2.   If the council finds general compliance with the Hailey
comprehensive plan, the council shall then consider the application for a
zoning classification and consider any and all factors it deems, in its sole
and absolute discretion, important to determine whether an application for
annexation shall be granted or denied. If the commission made negative findings
related to the comprehensive plan under section
14.01.080 of this chapter and therefore did not make a recommendation on zoning
classification for the property sought to be annexed, but the council
subsequently made favorable findings related to the comprehensive plan and
wishes to proceed with the annexation, the council shall remand the proceedings
to the commission for its recommendation on zoning classification.
   D.   Decision: The council has the sole and absolute discretionary right to
approve, approve with conditions or deny an application for annexation. In
addition, the council is authorized to require, as a condition of approval,
that the applicant and the city enter into an annexation agreement providing
for the terms and conditions of an approved annexation. The council may also
require the applicant, as a condition of approval, to construct certain
improvements, including, but not limited to, private and/or public utilities,
facilities, recreational or other amenities and landscaping, and to pay such
annexation fees or other monetary or nonmonetary contributions as the council
deems necessary to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the
citizens of Hailey. In the event the fees and/or contributions are not paid at
the time of annexation approval, the council shall require the applicant to
provide security in the form of a performance bond, irrevocable letter of
credit or cash equivalent acceptable to Hailey for one hundred fifty percent
(150%) of the bona fide estimate of the cost of the improvements and one
hundred percent (100%) of the fees and/or contributions within thirty (30) days
of the date when the council approves the application but before the effective
date of any annexation ordinance. Furthermore, the council may, consistent with
Idaho Code section 67-6537, require the applicant, as a condition to approval,
to use all surface water appurtenant to the real property to be annexed as the
primary water source for irrigation of the real property to be annexed.
In the event a subsequent development proposal materially differs from the
development shown in approved annexation, the annexation agreement shall
provide that the proposed development may be denied, that the applicant shall
be responsible for any increased annexation fees and/or that the property may
be deannexed. There shall be no right of an appeal by an applicant or by an
affected party from an adverse recommendation by the commission or from an
adverse decision of the council on an annexation application. If the council
elects to approve the application for annexation with or without conditions,
the council shall also establish the appropriate zoning district(s) for the
annexed property in accordance with the procedures set forth in title 17,
chapter 17.14 of this code. (Ord. 1205, 2016; Ord. 1104, 2012; Ord. 1050 § 2,

15.16.010: FINDINGS AND PURPOSE:
15.16.010.01: FINDINGS:
   A.   Based on the city of Hailey comprehensive plan adopted by the city,
pursuant to Idaho Code title 67, chapter 65, including, but not limited to, the
capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan, and based on the
general governmental goal of protecting the health, safety and general welfare
of the citizens of the city, it is necessary that the city's public facilities
for: 1) parks and recreation; 2) transportation; 3) police; and 4) fire/
emergency medical services (EMS) be expanded and improved to accommodate new
development within the city. Throughout this chapter, the system improvements
for these types of public facilities are sometimes collectively referred to as
the "city capital facilities" and sometimes individually referred to as a "city
capital improvements element".
   B.   The city has formed the development impact fee advisory committee as
required by Idaho Code section 67-8205, and that committee has performed the
duties required of it pursuant to Idaho Code sections 67-8205 and 67-8206(2).
The city intends that the committee continue to exist and to perform those
duties identified in Idaho Code section 67-8205 that occur following the
adoption of development impact fees.
   C.   New residential and nonresidential development imposes and will impose
increasing and excessive demands upon city capital facilities.
   D.   The revenues generated from new residential and nonresidential
development often do not generate sufficient funds to provide the necessary
improvements of these city capital facilities to accommodate new development.
   E.   New development is expected to continue, and will place ever increasing
demands on the city to provide and expand city capital facilities to serve new
development.
   F.   The city has planned for the improvement of the city capital facilities
in the capital improvements element of the city of Hailey comprehensive plan.
   G.   Idaho Code title 67, chapter 82 (the Idaho development impact fee act)
authorizes the city to adopt a development impact fee system to offset, recoup
or reimburse the portion of the costs of needed improvements to the city
capital facilities caused by new development in the city.
   H.   The creation of an equitable development impact fee system would
promote the purposes set forth in the Idaho development impact fee act, in that
it would: 1) ensure that adequate public facilities are available to serve new
growth and development; 2) promote orderly growth and development by
establishing uniform standards by which the city may require that those who
benefit from new growth and development pay a proportionate share of the cost
of new public facilities needed to serve new growth and development; 3)
establish minimum standards for the adoption of development impact fees; 4)
ensure that those who benefit from new growth and development are required to
pay no more than their proportionate share of the cost of public facilities
needed to serve new growth and development; and 5) prevent duplicate and ad hoc
development requirements.
   I.   The creation of an equitable development impact fee system would enable
the city to accommodate new development, and would assist the city to implement
the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan.
   J.   In order to implement an equitable Development Impact Fee system for
the City Capital Facilities, the City retained D.P. Guthrie, LLC to prepare an
impact fee study for these types of facilities. The resulting document is
titled "2021 Development Impact Fees, dated August 4, 2021 (the "Development
Impact Fee Study"). The Development Impact Fee Study was prepared by qualified
professionals in the fields relating to finance, engineering, planning and
transportation. Guthrie has consulted with the Hailey City Council and the
Development Impact Fee Advisory Committee. The Development Impact Fee Study has
been updated in accordance with previous studies dated March 23, 2007, April
13, 2012, and May 27, 2016.
   K.   The methodology used in preparing the development impact fee study,
when applied through this chapter, complies with all applicable provisions of
Idaho law, including those set forth in Idaho Code sections 67-8204(1), (2),
(16) and (23), 67-8207 and 67-8209. The incorporation of the development impact
fee study by reference satisfies the requirement in Idaho Code section 67-8204
(16) for a detailed description of the methodology by which the development
impact fees were calculated, and the requirement in Idaho Code section 67-8204
(24) for a description of acceptable levels of service for system improvements.
   L.   In determining the proportionate share of the cost of system
improvements, the city has considered: 1) the cost of the existing system
improvements; 2) the means by which the existing system improvements have been
financed; 3) the extent to which the new development will contribute to the
cost of system improvements through taxation, assessment or developer or
landowner contributions, or has previously contributed to the cost of system
improvements through developer or landowner contributions; 4) the extent to
which the new development is required to contribute to the cost of existing
system improvements in the future; 5) the extent to which the new development
should be credited for providing system improvements, without charge to other
properties within the service area or areas; 6) extraordinary costs, if any,
incurred in serving the new development; 7) the time and price differential
inherent in a fair comparison of fees paid at different times; and 8) the
availability of other sources of funding system improvements, including, but
not limited to, user charges, general tax levies, intergovernmental transfers,
and special taxation. The governmental entity shall develop a plan for
alternative sources of revenue.
   M.   The development impact fee study contains the capital improvements
element of the city of Hailey comprehensive plan, and such element has been
prepared in conformance with the requirements of Idaho Code title 67, chapters
65 and 82.
   N.   The development impact fee study sets forth reasonable methodologies
and analyses for determining the impacts of various types of new development on
the city capital facilities, and determines the cost of acquiring or
constructing the improvements necessary to meet the demands for such facilities
created by new development.
   O.   In accordance with Idaho Code, the development impact fee study was
based on actual system improvement costs or reasonable estimates of such costs.
In addition, the development impact fee study uses a fee calculation
methodology that is net of credits for the present value of revenues that will
be generated by new growth and development based on historical funding patterns
and that are anticipated to be available to pay for system improvements,
including taxes, assessments, user fees and intergovernmental transfers.
   P.   The development impact fees described in this chapter are based on the
development impact fee study, and do not exceed the costs of system
improvements for city capital facilities to serve new development that will pay
the development impact fees.
   Q.   The facilities for parks and recreation, transportation, and fire/
emergency medical services (EMS) included in the calculation of fees in the
development impact fee study will benefit all new residential and
nonresidential development throughout the city, and it is therefore appropriate
to treat all areas of the city as a single service area for purposes of
calculating, collecting, and spending the development impact fees collected
from residential and nonresidential development.
   R.   In accordance with Idaho Code section 67-8208, the city of Hailey has
adopted a development impact fee for the cost of preparing the capital
improvements element of the city of Hailey comprehensive plan.
   S.   There is both a rational nexus and a rough proportionality between
development impacts created by each type of development covered by this chapter
and the development impact fees that such development covered by this chapter
and the development impact fees that such development will be required to pay.
   T.   This chapter creates a system by which development impact fees paid by
new development will be used to finance, defray or reimburse a portion of the
costs incurred by the city to construct improvements for city capital
facilities in ways that benefit the development for which each development
impact fee was paid within a reasonable period of time after the development
impact fee is paid, and in conformance with Idaho Code section 67-8210.
   U.   This chapter creates a system under which development impact fees shall
not be used to correct existing deficiencies for any capital facilities, or to
replace or rehabilitate existing improvements, or to pay for routine operation
or maintenance of those facilities.
   V.   This chapter creates a system under which there shall be no double
payment of impact fees, in accordance with Idaho Code section 67-8204(19).
   W.   This chapter is consistent with all applicable provisions of Idaho Code
title 67, chapter 82, concerning development impact fee ordinances. (Ord. 1293
§ 1, 2021; Ord. 1204, 2016; Ord. 985 § 1, 2007)
15.16.010.02: PURPOSE:
   A.   This chapter is adopted to be consistent with, and to help implement
the city of Hailey comprehensive plan, and particularly the capital
improvements element of the comprehensive plan.
   B.   The intent of this chapter is to ensure that new development bears a
proportionate share of the cost of improvements to the city capital facilities;
to ensure that such proportionate share does not exceed the cost of
improvements to such facilities required to accommodate new development; and to
ensure that funds collected from new development are actually used for
improvements to the city capital facilities in accordance with Idaho Code title
67, chapter 82.
   C.   It is the further intent of this chapter to be consistent with those
principles for allocating a fair share of the cost of new capital facilities to
new development, and for adopting development impact fee ordinances,
established by Idaho Code title 67, chapter 82.
   D.   It is not the intent of this chapter to collect any money from any new
development in excess of the actual amount necessary to offset new demands for
city capital facilities created by such new development.
   E.   It is not the intent of this chapter that any monies collected from any
development impact fee deposited in an impact fee account ever be commingled
with monies from a different impact fee account, or ever be used for a
development impact fee component different from that for which the fee was
paid, or ever be used to correct current deficiencies in the city capital
facilities or ever be used to replace, rehabilitate, maintain or operate any
city facility. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2007)

15.16.040: CALCULATION OF DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES:
15.16.040.01: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Accounting Principles: The calculation of a development impact fee
shall be in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
development impact fee shall not be deemed invalid because payment of the fee
may result in an incidental benefit to owners or developers within the service
area other than the person paying the fee.
   B.   Levels Of Service: A development impact fee shall be calculated on the
basis of levels of service for public facilities adopted in this chapter that
are applicable to existing development as well as new growth and development.
The construction, improvement, expansion or enlargement of new or existing
public facilities for which a development impact fee is imposed must be
attributable to the capacity demands generated by the new development. (Ord.
985 § 1, 2007)
15.16.040.02: METHODOLOGY:
   A.   Proportionate Methodology: A development impact fee shall not exceed a
proportionate share of the cost of system improvements determined in accordance
with Idaho Code section 67-8207, as amended. Development impact fees shall be
based on actual system improvement costs or reasonable estimates of such costs.
The amount of the development impact fee shall be calculated using the
methodology contained in the development impact fee study and as summarized in
the schedule in section
15.16.130, exhibit A of this chapter.
   B.   Proportionate Share Determination:
      1.   All development impact fees shall be based on a reasonable and fair
formula or method under which the development impact fee imposed does not
exceed a proportionate share of the costs incurred or to be incurred by the
city in the provision of system improvements to serve the new development. The
proportionate share is the costs attributable to the new development after the
city considers the following:
         a.   Any appropriate credit, offset or contribution of money,
dedication of land or construction of system improvements;
         b.   Payments reasonably anticipated to be made by or as a result of a
new development in the form of user fees and debt service payments;
         c.   That portion of general tax or other revenues allocated by the
jurisdiction to system improvements; and
         d.   All other available sources of funding such system improvements.
      2.   In determining the proportionate share of the cost of system
improvements to be paid by the developer, the following factors shall be
considered by the city and accounted for in the calculation of the development
impact fee:
         a.   The costs of existing system improvements within the service
area;
         b.   The means by which existing system improvements have been
financed;
         c.   The extent to which the new development will contribute to the
cost of system improvements through taxation, assessments or developer or
landowner contributions, or has previously contributed to the cost of system
improvements through developer or landowner contributions;
         d.   The extent to which the new development is required to contribute
to the cost of existing system improvements in the future;
         e.   The extent to which the new development should be credited for
providing system improvements, without charge to other properties within the
service area;
         f.   Extraordinary costs, if any, incurred in serving the new
development;
         g.   The time and price differential inherent in a fair comparison of
fees paid at different times; and
         h.   The availability of other sources of funding system improvements,
including, but not limited to, user charges, general tax levies,
intergovernmental transfers and special taxation.
   C.   Nonlisted Uses: If the proposed development is of a type not listed in
section
15.16.130, exhibit A of this chapter, then the city shall apply the development
impact fees applicable to the most nearly comparable type of land use listed in
section
15.16.130, exhibit A of this chapter. The determination as to which type of
development is most nearly comparable to the proposed development shall be made
by referring to traffic generation rates for land uses published by Institute
Of Transportation Engineers, and by identifying that land use listed in section
15.16.130, exhibit A of this chapter, whose traffic generation rates are most
comparable to the proposed land use. If no traffic generation rate for the
proposed land use appears in a publication of the Institute Of Transportation
Engineers, or if it is not possible to determine which land use listed in
section
15.16.130, exhibit A of this chapter has the most comparable traffic generation
rates, then the most nearly comparable land use shall be determined by the
development impact fee administrator based on comparison of other
characteristics of the proposed land use (including employment or occupancy,
the size of the facility, and the amount of parking to be provided) with the
characteristics of those land uses listed in section
15.16.130, exhibit A of this chapter.
   D.   Mixed Uses: If the development for which a building permit is sought
contains a mix of uses, the development impact fee will be calculated for each
type of development based on net floor area.
   E.   Developer's Election: A developer shall have the right to elect to pay
a project's proportionate share of system improvement costs by payment of
development impact fees according to the fee schedule in section
15.16.130, exhibit A of this chapter as full and complete payment of the
development project's proportionate share of system improvement costs, except
as provided in Idaho Code section 67-8214(3), as amended. (Ord. 1204, 2016;
Ord. 985 § 1, 2007)
15.16.040.03: SCHEDULES:
Development impact fees shall be calculated using the schedule in section
15.16.130, exhibit A of this chapter, unless: a) the fee payer requests an
individual assessment pursuant to subsection
15.16.040.04C of this chapter; or b) the city finds an extraordinary impact for
a proposed development in writing to the fee payer, in which case subsection
15.16.040.04D of this chapter shall apply. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2007)
15.16.040.04: PROCEDURES:
   A.   Building Permit: Upon submittal of complete building permit plans, the
city shall calculate the development impact fees in accordance with this
chapter within thirty (30) days of submittal.
   B.   Exemption: An exemption must be claimed by the fee payer upon
application for a building permit. Any exemption not so claimed shall be deemed
waived by the fee payer. Applications for exemption shall be submitted to and
determined by the city within ninety (90) days.
   C.   Using An Individual Assessment:
      1.   In lieu of calculating the amount of development impact fees by
reference to section
15.16.130, exhibit A of this chapter, a fee payer may request that the amount
of the required development impact fee be determined through an individual
assessment for the proposed development. The individual assessment process
shall permit consideration of studies, data, and any other relevant information
submitted by the fee payer to adjust the amount of the fee. If a fee payer
requests the use of an individual assessment, the fee payer shall be
responsible for retaining a qualified professional to prepare the individual
assessment that complies with the requirements of this chapter, at the fee
payer's expense. The fee payer shall, at the fee payer's expense, bear the
burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the resulting
individual assessment complies with the requirements of this chapter. The fee
payer shall bear the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that
the resulting individual assessment is a more accurate measure of its
proportionate share of the cost of city capital improvements, based on the
city's adopted levels of service, than the development impact fees that would
otherwise be due pursuant to the schedule set forth in section
15.16.130, exhibit A of this chapter.
      2.   Each individual assessment shall be based on the same level of
service standards and unit costs for system improvements used in the
development impact fee study, shall use an average cost (not a marginal cost)
methodology, and shall document the relevant methodologies and assumptions
used.
      3.   An application for an individual assessment may be submitted at any
time that the types and amounts of development in each category identified in
section
15.16.130, exhibit A of this chapter are known. The city shall issue a decision
within thirty (30) days following receipt of a completed application for
individual assessment and supporting information from the applicant, so as not
to unreasonably delay subsequent applications for or issuance of building
permits.
      4.   Each individual assessment shall be submitted to the development
impact fee administrator, and may be accepted, rejected, or accepted with
modifications by the development impact fee administrator as the basis for
calculating development impact fees. The criteria for acceptance, rejection or
acceptance with modifications shall be whether the individual assessment is
more accurate measure of demand for the city capital improvements element(s)
created by the proposed development, or the costs of those facilities, than the
applicable fee shown in section
15.16.130, exhibit A of this chapter.
      5.   The decision by the development impact fee administrator on an
application for an individual assessment shall include an explanation of the
calculation of the development impact fee, shall specify the system improvement
(s) for which the development impact fee is intended to be used, and shall
include an explanation of those factors identified in Idaho Code section 67-
8207.
      6.   If an individual assessment is accepted or accepted with
modifications by the development impact fee administrator, then the development
impact fees due under this chapter for such development shall be calculated
according to such individual assessment.
   D.   Extraordinary Impacts:
      1.   If the city determines that a proposed development generates
extraordinary impacts that will result in extraordinary costs, the city will
notify the fee payer of such determination within thirty (30) days after
receipt for a certification pursuant to subsection E of this section, or a
request for a building permit of development approval, whichever occurs first.
Such notice shall include a statement that the potential impacts of such
development on system improvements are not adequately addressed by development
impact fee study, and that a supplemental study at the fee payer's expense will
be required.
      2.   Circumstances that may lead to a determination of extraordinary
impacts include, but are not limited to: a) an indication that traffic
generation from the proposed development or activity will exceed those typical
for a facility or activity of its type; b) an indication that employment
generated by the development or activity will exceed those typical for a
facility or activity of its type; c) an indication the assumptions used in the
development impact fee study underestimate the level of activity or impact on
city capital facilities from the proposed development or activity; or d) an
indication that levels of calls for fire or emergency services from
developments or activities owned or operated by the fee payer or its agents
will exceed assumptions used in the development impact fee study.
      3.   Within thirty (30) days following the designation of a development
with extraordinary impacts, the city shall meet with the fee payer to discuss
whether the fee payer wants to: a) pay for the supplemental study necessary to
determine the system improvement costs related to the proposed development; or
b) modify the proposal to avoid generating extraordinary impacts; or c)
withdraw the application for certification, building permit or development
approval.
      4.   If the fee payer agrees to pay for the supplemental study required
to document the proposed development's proportionate share of system
improvement costs, then the city and the fee payer shall jointly select an
individual or organization acceptable to both to perform such study. The fee
payer shall enter into a written agreement with such individual or organization
to pay the costs of such study. Such agreement shall require the supplemental
study to be completed within thirty (30) days of such written agreement, unless
the fee payer agrees to a longer time.
      5.   Once the study has been completed, the fee payer may choose to: a)
pay the proportionate share of system improvement costs documented by the
supplemental study; or b) modify the proposed development to reduce such costs;
or c) withdraw the application. If the fee payer agrees to pay the system
improvement costs documented in the supplemental study, that agreement shall be
reduced to writing between the city and the fee payer prior to review and
consideration of any application for any development approval or building
permit related to the proposed development.
      6.   Notwithstanding any agreement by the fee payer to pay the
proportionate share of system improvement costs documented by the supplemental
study, nothing in this chapter shall obligate the city to approve development
that results in an extraordinary impact.
   E.   Certification: After the development impact fees due for a proposed
development have been calculated pursuant to section
15.16.130, exhibit A of this chapter or the individual assessment, the fee
payer may request the development impact fee administrator or a designee for a
certification of the amount of development impact fees due for that
development. Within thirty (30) days after receiving such request, the
development impact fee administrator shall issue a written certification of the
amount of development impact fees due for the proposed development. Such
certification shall establish the development impact fee so long as there is no
material change to the particular project as identified in the individual
assessment application, or the impact fee schedule set forth in section
15.16.130, exhibit A of this chapter. The certification shall include an
explanation of the calculation of the impact fee, including an explanation of
factors considered under Idaho Code section 67-8207 and shall also specify the
system improvement(s) for which the development impact fee is intended to be
used. (Ord. 1204, 2016; Ord. 985 § 1, 2007)
15.16.050: CREDITS AND REIMBURSEMENT:
15.16.050.01: CREDITS TO BE ISSUED:
When a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest has constructed
system improvements of the same category as a city capital improvement, or
contributed or dedicated land or money toward the completion of system
improvements of the same category as a city capital improvement, and the city
has accepted such construction, contribution or dedication, the city shall
issue a credit against the development impact fees otherwise due for the same
city capital improvements in connection with the proposed development, as set
forth in this section
15.16.050. Credit shall be issued regardless of whether the contribution or
dedication to system improvements was required by the city as a condition of
development approval or was offered by the developer and accepted by the city
in writing, and regardless of whether the contribution or dedication was
contributed by the developer or by a local improvement district controlled by
the developer. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2007)
15.16.050.02: LIMITATIONS:
Credits against development impact fees shall not be given for: a) project
improvements; or b) any construction, contribution or dedication not agreed to
in writing by the city prior to commencement of the construction, contribution
or dedication. Credits issued for one city capital improvement may not be used
to reduce development impact fees due for a different capital improvement. No
credits shall be issued for system improvements contributed or dedicated prior
to the effective date hereof. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2007)
15.16.050.03: VALUATION OF CREDIT AT PRESENT VALUE:
   A.   Land: Credit for qualifying land dedications shall, at the fee payer's
option, be valued at the present value of: 1) one hundred percent (100%) of the
most recent assessed value for such land as shown in the records of the county
assessor; or 2) that fair market value established by a private appraiser
acceptable to the city in an appraisal paid for by the fee payer.
   B.   Improvements: Credit for qualifying acquisition or construction of
system improvements shall be valued by the city at the present value of such
improvements based on complete engineering drawings, specifications, and
construction cost estimates submitted by the fee payer to the city. The city
shall determine the amount of credit due based on the information submitted,
or, if it determines that such information is inaccurate or unreliable, then on
alternative engineering or construction costs acceptable to the city as a more
accurate measure of the value of the offered system improvements to the city.
(Ord. 985 § 1, 2007)
15.16.050.04: WHEN CREDITS BECOME EFFECTIVE:
   A.   Land: Approved credits for land dedications shall become effective when
the land has been conveyed to the city in a form acceptable to the city, at no
cost to the city, and has been accepted by the city. Upon request of the fee
payer, the city shall issue a letter stating the amount of credit available.
   B.   Improvements: Approved credits for acquisition or construction of
system improvements shall generally become effective when: 1) all required
construction has been completed and has been accepted by the city; 2) a
suitable maintenance and warranty bond has been received and approved by the
city; and 3) all design, construction, inspection, testing, bonding and
acceptance procedures have been completed in compliance with all applicable
requirements of the city and the state of Idaho. Upon request of the fee payer,
the city shall issue a letter stating the amount of credit available. (Ord. 985
§ 1, 2007)
15.16.050.05: APPLICATION PROCEDURES:
   A.   Request: In order to obtain a credit against development impact fees
otherwise due, a fee payer shall submit a written offer to dedicate to the
development impact fee administrator for specific parcels of qualifying land or
a written offer to contribute or construct specific system improvements to the
city capital facilities in accordance with all applicable state or city design
and construction standards, and shall specifically request a credit against the
type of development impact fees for which the land dedication or system
improvement is offered. No request for a credit against development impact fees
shall be accepted unless a written offer to dedicate, contribute or construct
has previously been approved in writing.
   B.   Review: After receipt of the request for credit, the development impact
fee administrator shall review the request and determine whether the land or
system improvements offered for credit will reduce the costs of providing city
capital facilities by an amount at least equal to the value of the credit. If
the development impact fee administrator determines that the offered credit
satisfies that criteria, then the credit shall be issued. The city shall
complete its review and determination of an application within thirty (30) days
after receipt of an application for credit. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2007)
15.16.050.06: CREDITS EXCEEDING FEE AMOUNTS DUE:
   A.   If the credit due to a fee payer pursuant to sections 15.16.050.01
through 15.16.050.05 of this chapter exceeds the development impact fee that
would otherwise be due from the fee payer pursuant to this chapter (whether
calculated through section
15.16.130, exhibit A of this chapter or through an independent assessment), the
fee payer may choose to receive such credit in the form or either: 1) a credit
against future development impact fees due for the same capital improvements;
or 2) a reimbursement from development impact fees paid by future development
that impacts the system improvements contributed or dedicated by the fee payer.
   B.   Unless otherwise stated in an agreement with the fee payer, the city
shall be under no obligation to use any city funds, other than development
impact fees paid by other development for the same city capital improvements,
to reimburse the fee payer for any credit in excess of development impact fees
due. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2007)
15.16.050.07: WRITTEN AGREEMENT REQUIRED:
If credit or reimbursement is due to the fee payer pursuant to this section
15.16.050, the city shall enter into a written agreement with the fee payer,
negotiated in good faith, prior to the contribution, dedication or funding of
the system improvements giving rise to the credit. The agreement shall provide
for the amount of credit or the amount, time and form of reimbursement, and
shall have a term not exceeding ten (10) years. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2007)

is denied or abandoned;
   C.   The fee payer pays a development impact fee under protest and a
subsequent review of the fee paid or the completion of an individual assessment
determines that the fee paid exceeded the proportionate share to which the city
was entitled to receive; or
   D.   The city has collected a development impact fee and has failed to
appropriate or expend the collected fees pursuant to section
15.16.060.02 of this chapter. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2007)
15.16.060.02: FAILURE TO COMMENCE CONSTRUCTION OR ENCUMBER TRUST FUNDS:
Any development impact fees paid shall be refunded if the city has failed to
commence construction of system improvements in accordance with this chapter,
or to appropriate funds for such construction, within eight (8) years after the
date on which such fee was paid. Any refund due shall be paid to the owner of
record of the parcel for which the development impact fees were paid. The city
may hold development impact fees for longer than eight (8) years if it
identifies in writing: a) a reasonable cause why the fees should be held longer
than eight (8) years; and b) an anticipated date by which the fees will be
expended, but in no event greater than eleven (11) years from the date they
were collected. If the city complies with the previous sentence, then any
development impact fees identified in such writing shall be refunded to the fee
payer if the city has failed to commence construction of system improvements in
accordance with this chapter, or to appropriate funds for such construction on
or before the date identified in such writing. (Ord. 1110, 2012; Ord. 985 § 1,
2007)
15.16.060.03: NO REFUND DUE FOR SUBSEQUENT REDUCTION IN SIZE OF DEVELOPMENT:
After a development impact fee has been paid pursuant to this chapter and after
a certificate of occupancy has been issued, no refund of any part of such fee
shall be made if the project for which the fee was paid is later demolished,
destroyed, or is altered, reconstructed, or reconfigured so as to reduce the
size of the project. (Ord. 1204, 2016; Ord. 985 § 1, 2007)
15.16.060.04: INTEREST:
Each refund shall include a refund of interest at one-half (1/2) the legal rate
provided for in Idaho Code section 28-22-104 from the date on which the fee was
originally paid. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2007)
15.16.060.05: TIMING:
The city shall make a determination of whether a refund is due within thirty
(30) days after receipt of a written request for a refund from the owner of
record of the property for which the fee was paid. When the right to a refund
exists, the city shall send the refund to the owner of record within ninety
(90) days after the city determines that a refund is due. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2007)

A development impact fee trust fund (the "trust fund") is hereby established
for the purpose of ensuring that the development impact fees collected pursuant
to this chapter are used to address impacts reasonably attributable to new
development for which the development impact fees are paid. The trust fund
shall be divided into the accounts. The trust fund shall be maintained in an
interest bearing account. The interest earned on each account shall not be
governed by Idaho Code section 57-127, as amended, but shall be considered
funds of the account and shall be subject to the same restrictions on uses of
funds as the development impact fees on which interest is generated. (Ord. 985
§ 1, 2007)
15.16.070.04: FIRST IN/FIRST OUT:

15.16.090: APPEALS, PROTEST AND MEDIATION:
15.16.090.01: APPEALS:
   A.   Any fee payer that is or may be obligated to pay a development impact
fee, or that claims a right to receive a refund, reimbursement, exemption or
credit under this chapter, and who is dissatisfied with a decision made by the
development impact fee administrator in applying this chapter, may appeal such
decision to the city council. The fee payer shall have the burden of proving by
clear and convincing evidence that the decision was in error.
   B.   In order to pursue the appeal described in subsection A of this
section, the fee payer shall file a written notice of the appeal with the
development impact fee administrator within thirty (30) days after the date of
the decision, or the date on which the fee payer submitted a payment of
development impact fees under protest, whichever is later. Such written
application shall include a statement describing why the fee payer believes
that the decision was in error, together with copies of any documents that the
fee payer believes support the claim.
   C.   The city council shall hear the appeal within sixty (60) days after
receipt of a written notice of appeal. The fee payer shall have a right to be
present and to present evidence in support of the appeal. The development
impact fee administrator who made the decision under appeal or his or her
representative shall likewise have the right to be present and to present
evidence in support of the decision. The criteria to be used by the city
council in considering the appeal shall be whether: 1) the decision or
interpretation made by the development impact fee administrator; or 2) the
alternative decision or interpretation offered by the fee payer, more
accurately reflects the intent of this chapter that new development in the city
pay its proportionate share of the costs of system improvements to city capital
facilities necessary to serve new development and whether this chapter has been
correctly applied. The city council shall issue a decision upholding, reversing
or modifying the decision being appealed within thirty (30) days after hearing
the appeal. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2007)
15.16.090.02: PAYMENT UNDER PROTEST:
A fee payer may pay a development impact fee under protest in order not to
delay in the issuance of a building permit. A fee payer making a payment under
protest shall not be estopped from exercising the right to appeal provided
herein, nor shall such fee payer be estopped from receiving a refund of any
amount deemed to have been illegally collected. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2007)
15.16.090.03: MEDIATION:
   A.   Any fee payer that has a disagreement with the city regarding a
development impact fee that is or may be due for a proposed development
pursuant to this chapter, may enter into a voluntary agreement with the city to
subject the disagreement to mediation by a qualified independent party
acceptable to both the fee payer and the city.
   B.   Mediation may take place at any time following the filing of a timely
appeal pursuant to section
15.16.090.01 of this chapter, or as an alternative to such appeal; provided,
that the request for mediation is filed no later than the last date on which a
timely appeal could be filed pursuant to section
15.16.090.01 of this chapter.
   C.   Participation in mediation does not preclude the fee payer from
pursuing other remedies provided for in this section
15.16.090.
   D.   If mediation is requested, any related mediation costs shall be shared
equally by the fee payer and the city, and a written agreement regarding the
payment of such costs shall be executed prior to the commencement of mediation.

amount of the security shall automatically become a lien upon any and all
property within the subdivision owned by the owner and/or developer. (Ord. 1296

16.04.020: STREETS:
Streets shall be provided in all subdivisions where necessary to provide access
and shall meet all standards below:
   A.   Development Standards: All streets in the subdivision must be platted
and developed with a width, alignment and improvements such that the street is
adequate to safely accommodate existing and anticipated vehicular and
pedestrian traffic and meets city standards. Streets shall be aligned in such a
manner as to provide through, safe and efficient access from and to adjacent
developments and properties and shall provide for the integration of the
proposed streets with the existing pattern.
   B.   Cul-De-Sacs; Dead End Streets: Cul-de-sacs or dead end streets shall be
allowed only if connectivity is not possible due to surrounding topography or
existing platted development. Where allowed, such cul-de-sacs or dead end
streets shall comply with all regulations set forth in the IFC and other
applicable codes and ordinances. Street rights of way extended into unplatted
areas shall not be considered dead end streets.
   C.   Access: More than one access may be required based on the potential for

conditions or other factors that could limit access.
   D.   Design: Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as
possible at right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at less
than eighty degrees (80°). Where possible, four-way intersections shall be
used. A recommended distance of five hundred feet (500'), with a maximum of
seven hundred fifty feet (750'), measured from the centerline, shall separate
any intersection. Alternatively, traffic calming measures, including, but not
limited to, speed humps, speed tables, raised intersections, traffic circles or
roundabouts, meanderings, chicanes, chokers and/or neckdowns shall be a part of
the street design. Alternate traffic calming measures may be approved with a
recommendation by the city engineer. Three-way intersections shall only be
permitted where most appropriate or where no other configuration is possible. A
minimum distance of one hundred fifty feet (150'), measured from the
centerline, shall separate any two (2) three-way intersections.
   E.   Centerlines: Street centerlines which deflect more than five degrees
(5°) shall be connected by a curve. The radius of the curve for the centerline
shall not be more than five hundred feet (500') for an arterial street, one
hundred sixty six feet (166') for a collector street and eighty nine feet (89')
for a residential street. Alternatively, traffic calming measures, including,
but not limited to, speed humps, speed tables, raised intersections, traffic
circles or roundabouts, meanderings, chicanes, chokers and/or neckdowns shall
be a part of the street design. Alternate traffic calming measures may be
approved with a recommendation by the city engineer.
   F.   Width: Street width is to be measured from property line to property
line. The minimum street width, unless specifically approved otherwise by the
council, shall be as specified in city standards for the type of street.
   G.   Roadways: "Roadway", for the purpose of this section, shall be defined

not generally exceed six percent (6%). Grade may exceed six percent (6%), where
necessary, by one percent (1%) (total 7 percent) for no more than three hundred
feet (300') or two percent (2%) (total 8 percent) for no more than one hundred
fifty feet (150'). No excess grade shall be located within two hundred feet
(200') of any other excess grade nor there any horizontal deflection in the
roadway greater than thirty degrees (30°) within three hundred feet (300') of
where the excess grade decreases to a two percent (2%) slope.
   I.   Runoff: The developer shall provide storm sewers and/or drainage areas
of adequate size and number to contain any runoff within the streets in the
subdivision in conformance with the applicable Federal, State and local
regulations. The developer shall provide copies of State permits for shallow
injection wells (dry wells). Drainage plans shall be reviewed by City staff and
shall meet the approval of the City Engineer. Developer shall provide a copy of
EPA's "NPDES General Permit for Stormwater Discharge From Construction
Activity" for all construction activity affecting more than one acre.
   J.   Signage: The developer shall provide and install all street and traffic
control signs in accordance with City standards.
   K.   Dedication; Names: All streets and alleys within any subdivision shall
be dedicated for public use, except as provided herein. New street names

driveway easement. Easements and parcels shall clearly indicate the beneficiary
of the easement or parcel and that the property is unbuildable except for
ingress/egress, utilities or as otherwise specified on the plat. A building
envelope may be required in order to provide for adequate building setback.
      6.   No driveway shall interfere with maintenance of existing
infrastructure and shall be located to have the least adverse impact on
residential dwelling units, existing or to be constructed, on the lot the
easement encumbers and on adjacent lots.
      7.   Driveways shall not be named.
   N.   Parking Access Lane: Multi-family, townhouse developments of greater
than four (4) dwelling units, and cottage developments may be served by a

existing and future sidewalks adjacent to the site.
   D.   Sites located adjacent to a public street or private street that are
not currently through streets, regardless whether the street may provide a
connection to future streets, shall provide sidewalks to facilitate future
pedestrian connections.
   E.   The requirement for sidewalk and drainage improvements are not required
for any lot line adjustment. (Ord. 1191, 2015)
16.04.040: ALLEYS AND EASEMENTS:
   A.   Alleys:
      1.   Alleys shall be provided in all Business District and Limited
Business District developments where feasible.
      2.   The minimum width of an alley shall be twenty six feet (26').
      3.   All alleys shall be dedicated to the public or provide for public

      4.   All infrastructures to be installed underground shall, where
possible, be installed in the alleys platted.
      5.   Alleys in commercial areas shall be improved with drainage as
appropriate and which the design meets the approval of the City Engineer. The
developer shall provide storm sewers and/or drainage areas of adequate size and
number to contain any runoff within the streets in the subdivision upon the
property in conformance with the latest applicable Federal, State and local
regulations. The developer shall provide copies of State permits for shallow
injection wells (dry wells). Drainage plans shall be reviewed by City staff and
shall meet the approval of the City Engineer.
      6.   Dead end alleys shall not be allowed.
      7.   Where alleys are not provided, easements of not less than ten feet
(10') in width may be required on each side of all rear and/or side lot lines
(total width = 20 feet) where necessary for wires, conduits, storm or sanitary
sewers, gas and water lines. Easements of greater width may be required along
lines, across lots, or along boundaries, where necessary for surface drainage
or for the extension of utilities.
   B.   Easements: "Easements", defined as the use of land not having all the
rights of ownership and limited to the purposes designated on the plat, shall
be placed on the plat as appropriate. Plats shall show the entity to which the
easement has been granted. Easements shall be provided for the following
purposes:
      1.   To provide access through or to any property for the purpose of
providing utilities, emergency services, public access, private access,
recreation, deliveries or such other purpose. Any subdivision that borders on
the Big Wood River shall dedicate a twenty foot (20') wide fisherman's access
easement, measured from the mean high water mark, which shall provide for
nonmotorized public access. Additionally, in appropriate areas, an easement
providing nonmotorized public access through the subdivision to the river shall
be required as a sportsman's access.
      2.   To provide protection from or buffering for any natural resource,
riparian area, hazardous area, or other limitation or amenity on, under, or
over the land. Any subdivision that borders on the Big Wood River shall
dedicate a one hundred foot (100') wide riparian setback easement, measured
from the mean high water mark, upon which no permanent structure shall be
built, in order to protect the natural vegetation and wildlife along the
riverbank and to protect structures from damage or loss due to riverbank
erosion. A twenty five foot (25') wide riparian setback easement shall be
dedicated adjacent to tributaries of the Big Wood River. Removal and
maintenance of live or dead vegetation within the riparian setback easement is
controlled by the applicable bulk requirement of the flood hazard overlay
district. The riparian setback easement shall be fenced off during any
construction on the property.
      3.   To provide for the storage of snow, drainage areas or the conduct of
irrigation waters. Snow storage areas shall be not less than twenty five
percent (25%) of parking, sidewalk and other circulation areas. No dimension of
any snow storage area may be less than ten feet (10'). All snow storage areas
shall be accessible and shall not be located over any aboveground utilities,
such as transformers. (Ord. 1191, 2015)
16.04.050: BLOCKS:
The length, width and shape of blocks shall be determined with due regard to
adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use
contemplated, the zoning requirements as to lot size and dimensions, the need
for convenient access and safe circulation and the limitations and
opportunities of topography. (Ord. 1191, 2015)
16.04.060: LOTS:
All lots shown on the subdivision plat must conform to the minimum standards
for lots in the district in which the subdivision is planned. The city will
generally not approve single-family residential lots larger than one-half (1/2)
acre (21,780 square feet). In the event a single-family residential lot greater
than one-half (1/2) acre is platted, irrigation shall be restricted to not more
than one-half (1/2) acre, pursuant to Idaho Code section 42-111, and such
restriction shall be included as a plat note. District regulations are found in
the zoning ordinance.
   A.   If lots are more than double the minimum size required for the zoning
district, the developer may be required to arrange lots in anticipation of
future resubdivision and provide for future streets where necessary to serve
potential lots, unless the plat restricts further subdivision.
   B.   Double frontage lots shall be prohibited except where unusual
topography, a more integrated street plan, or other conditions make it
undesirable to meet this requirement. Double frontage lots are those created by
either public or private streets, but not by driveways or alleys. Subdivisions
providing a platted parcel of twenty five feet (25') or more between any street
right of way and any single row of lots shall not be considered to have platted
double frontage lots. The twenty five foot (25') wide parcel provided must be
landscaped to provide a buffer between the street and the lot(s).
   C.   No unbuildable lots shall be platted. Platted areas that are not
buildable shall be noted as such and designated as "parcels" on the plat. Green
space shall be clearly designated as such on the plat.
   D.   A single flag lot may be permitted at the sole discretion of the
hearing examiner or commission and council, in which the "flagpole" projection
is serving as a driveway as provided herein, providing connection to and
frontage on a public or a private street. Once established, a flag lot may not
be further subdivided, but a lot line adjustment of a flag lot is not
considered a further subdivision. The "flagpole" portion of the lot shall be
included in lot area, but shall not be considered in determining minimum lot
width. The "flagpole" shall be of adequate width to accommodate a driveway as
required by this title, fire and other applicable codes. Flag lots within the
townsite overlay district are not allowed, except where parcels do not have
street access, such as parcels adjacent to the ITD right of way.
   E.   All lots shall have frontage on a public or private street. No frontage
width shall be less than the required width of a driveway as provided under
subsection
16.04.020M2 of this chapter and subsection D of this section. Townhouse sublots
are excluded from this requirement; provided, however, that townhouse
developments shall have frontage on a street.
   F.   In the townsite overlay district, original townsite lots shall be
subdivided such that the new platted lots are oriented the same as the original
lots, i.e., lots shall be subdivided in such a way as to maintain frontage on
both the street and alley. Exceptions may be made for corner properties with
historic structures. (Ord. 1191, 2015)
16.04.070: ORDERLY DEVELOPMENT:
   A.   Phasing Required: Development of subdivisions shall be phased to avoid
the extension of city services, roads and utilities through undeveloped land.
   B.   Agreement: Developers requesting phased subdivisions shall enter into a
phasing agreement with the city. Any phasing agreement shall be approved and
executed by the council and the developer on or before the preliminary plat
approval by the council.
   C.   Mitigation Of Negative Effects: No subdivision shall be approved which
affects the ability of political subdivisions of the state, including school
districts, to deliver services without compromising quality of service delivery
to current residents or imposing substantial additional public costs upon
current residents, unless the developer provides for the mitigation of the
effects of subdivision. Such mitigation may include, but is not limited to, the
following:
      1.   Provision of on site or off site street or intersection
improvements.
      2.   Provision of other off site improvements.
      3.   Dedications and/or public improvements on property frontages.
      4.   Dedication or provision of parks or green space.
      5.   Provision of public service facilities.
      6.   Construction of flood control canals or devices.
      7.   Provisions for ongoing maintenance.
   D.   Area Development Plan: When the developer of contiguous parcels
proposes to subdivide any portion of the contiguous parcels, an area
development plan shall be submitted and approved. The commission and council
shall evaluate the following basic site criteria and make appropriate findings
of fact:
      1.   Streets, whether public or private, shall provide an interconnected
system and shall be adequate to accommodate anticipated vehicular and
pedestrian traffic.
      2.   Nonvehicular circulation routes shall provide safe pedestrian and
bicycle ways and provide an interconnected system to streets, parks and green
space, public lands, or other destinations.
      3.   Water main lines and sewer main lines shall be designed in the most
effective layout feasible.
      4.   Other utilities, including power, telephone, cable and gas shall be
designed in the most effective layout feasible.
      5.   Park land shall be most appropriately located on the contiguous
parcels.
      6.   Grading and drainage shall be appropriate to the contiguous parcels.
      7.   Development shall avoid easements and hazardous or sensitive natural
resource areas.
The commission and council may require that any or all contiguous parcels be
included in the subdivision. (Ord. 1191, 2015)
16.04.080: PERIMETER WALLS, GATES AND BERMS:
The city of Hailey shall not approve any residential subdivision application
that includes any type of perimeter wall or gate that restricts access to the
subdivision. This regulation does not prohibit fences on or around individual
lots. The city shall also not allow any perimeter landscape berm more than
three feet (3') higher than the previously existing (original) grade. (Ord.
1191, 2015)
16.04.090: CUTS, FILLS, GRADING AND DRAINAGE:
   A.   Plans Required: Proposed subdivisions shall be carefully planned to be
compatible with natural topography, soil conditions, geology and hydrology of
the site, as well as to minimize cuts, fills, alterations of topography,
streams, drainage channels and disruption of soils or vegetation. Fill within
the floodplain shall comply with the requirements of the flood hazard overlay
district of the zoning ordinance.
      1.   A preliminary soil report prepared by a qualified engineer may be
required by the hearing examiner or commission and/or council as part of the
preliminary plat application.
      2.   A preliminary grading plan prepared by a civil engineer may be
required by the hearing examiner or commission and/or the council as part of
the preliminary plat application, to contain the following information:
         a.   Proposed contours at a maximum of two foot (2') contour
intervals;
         b.   Cut and fill banks in pad elevations;
         c.   Drainage patterns;
         d.   Areas where trees and/or natural vegetation will be preserved;
         e.   Location of all street and utility improvements, including
driveways to building envelopes; and
         f.   Any other information which may reasonably be required by the
administrator, hearing examiner, commission and/or council.
   B.   Design Standards: The proposed subdivision shall conform to the
following design standards:
      1.   Grading shall be designed to blend with natural landforms and to
minimize the necessity of padding or terracing of building sites, excavation
for foundations, and minimize the necessity of cuts and fills for streets and
driveways.
      2.   Areas within a subdivision which are not well suited for development
because of existing soil conditions, steepness of slope, geology or hydrology
shall be allocated for green space for the benefit of future property owners
within the subdivision.
      3.   Where existing soils and vegetation are disrupted by subdivision
development, provision shall be made by the developer for revegetation of
disturbed areas with perennial vegetation sufficient to stabilize the soil upon
completion of the construction, including temporary irrigation for a sufficient
period to establish perennial vegetation. Until such time as the vegetation has
been installed and established, the developer shall maintain and protect all
disturbed surfaces from erosion.
      4.   Where cuts, fills or other excavation are necessary, the following
development standards shall apply:
         a.   Fill areas for structures or roads shall be prepared by removing
all organic material detrimental to proper compaction for soil stability.
         b.   Fill for structures or roads shall be compacted to at least
ninety five percent (95%) of maximum density as determined by American
Association Of State Highway And Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and American
Society For Testing Materials (ASTM).
         c.   Cut slopes shall be no steeper than two horizontal to one
vertical (2:1). Subsurface drainage shall be provided as necessary for
stability.
         d.   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than three horizontal to one
vertical (3:1). Neither cut nor fill slopes shall be located on natural slopes
of three to one (3:1) or steeper, or where fill slope toes out within twelve
feet (12') horizontally of the top of existing or planned cut slope.
         e.   Tops and toes of cut and fill slopes shall be set back from
structures and property lines as necessary to accommodate drainage features and
drainage structures.
      5.   The developer shall provide storm sewers and/or drainage areas of
adequate size and number to contain the runoff upon the property in conformance
with the applicable federal, state and local regulations. The developer shall
provide copies of state permits for shallow injection wells (dry wells).
Drainage plans shall be reviewed by planning staff and shall meet the approval
of the city engineer. Developer shall provide a copy of EPA's "NPDES General
Permit For Stormwater Discharge From Construction Activity" for all
construction activity affecting more than one acre. (Ord. 1191, 2015)

alteration permit is required before any development occurs. (Ord. 1191, 2015)
16.04.110: PARKS, PATHWAYS AND OTHER GREEN SPACES:
   A.   Parks And Pathways: Unless otherwise provided, every subdivision shall
set aside a park and/or pathway(s) in accordance with standards set forth
herein.
      1.   Parks:
         a.   The developer of any subdivision, or any part thereof, consisting
of three (3) or more residential lots, including residential townhouse sublots
and residential condominium units, without regard to the number of phases
within the subdivision, shall set aside or acquire land area within, adjacent
to or in the general vicinity of the subdivision for parks. Parks shall be
developed within the city of Hailey and set aside in accordance with the
following formula:
P = x multiplied by .0277
"P" is the parks contribution in acres
"x" is the number of single-family lots, residential townhouse sublots or
residential condominium units contained within the plat. Where multi-family
lots are being platted with no fixed number of units, "x" is maximum number of
residential lots, sublots and units possible within the subdivision based on
current zoning regulations
         b.   In the event the subdivision is located in the business (B),
limited business (LB), neighborhood business (NB) or transitional (TN) zoning
districts, the area required for a park shall be reduced by seventy five
percent (75%), but in no event shall the area required for a park/cultural

      1.   After receiving a recommendation by the parks and lands board, the
council may at their discretion approve and accept voluntary cash or in-kind
contributions in lieu of park land dedication and park improvements.
      2.   The voluntary cash or in-kind contributions in lieu of park land
shall be equivalent to the area of land (e.g., square footage) required to be
dedicated under this title multiplied by the fair market value of the land
(e.g., $/square foot) in the development at the time of preliminary plat
approval by the council. The city shall identify the location of the property
to be appraised, using the standards in subsections E4 and E5 of this section.
The appraisal shall be submitted by a mutually agreed upon appraiser and paid
for by the applicant.
      3.   Except as otherwise provided, the voluntary cash or in-kind
contribution in lieu of park land shall also include the cost for park
improvements, including all costs of acquisition, construction and all related
costs. The cost for such improvements shall be based upon the estimated costs
provided by a qualified contractor and/or vendor. In the business (B), limited

affected person who seeks judicial review of a decision by the administrator,
hearing examiner, commission or council must first seek reconsideration of the
final decision within fourteen (14) days. A request for reconsideration shall

17.04J.020: DEFINITIONS:
The following definitions shall be used to define words and phrases within this
article. All other words and phrases not defined in this section, shall be
defined by
chapter 17.02 of this title:
ADDITION (To An Existing Building): An extension or increase in the floor area
or height of a building or structure.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO, AH, AR/AO, or AR/AH Zone on a
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent (1%) or greater
annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one foot (1') to three feet
(3') where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding
is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: See definition of special flood hazard area
(SFHA).
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): A determination by the Federal Insurance
Administrator of the water surface elevations of the base flood, that is, the
flood level that has a one percent (1%) or greater chance of occurrence in any
given year. When the BFE has not been provided in a special flood hazard area,
it may be obtained from engineering studies available from a Federal, State, or
other source using FEMA-approved engineering methodologies. This elevation,
when combined with the freeboard, establishes the flood protection elevation.
BASEMENT: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
CHANNEL: A natural or artificial watercourse with definite bed and banks to
confine and conduct continuously or periodically flowing water, and which, in
the absence of evidence to the contrary, shall be presumed to consist of the
area between the boundaries of vegetation on either side of the watercourse.
CRITICAL FACILITIES: Facilities that are vital to flood response activities or
critical to the health and safety of the public before, during, and after a
flood, including public service facilities, public uses, and public utility
facilities, such as a hospital, emergency operations center, electric
substation, sewer lift station, police station, fire station, nursing home,
school, vehicle and equipment storage facility, or shelter; and facilities
that, if flooded, would make the flood problem and its impacts much worse, such
as a hazardous materials facility, power generation facility, water utility, or
wastewater treatment plant.
DATUM: A common vertical elevation reference point, usually in relation to sea
level. Historically, that common set of points was the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD29). The vertical datum currently adopted by the
Federal government as a basis for measuring heights is the North American
Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88).
DEVELOPMENT: Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of
equipment or materials, remodeling or repair; and the deposition or extraction
of materials; specifically including the construction of dikes, berms and
levees.
DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY: Any activity defined as development which will
necessitate a floodplain development permit; such as: the construction of
buildings, structures, or accessory structures; additions or substantial
improvements to existing structures; bulkheads, retaining walls, piers, and
pools; the placement of mobile homes; or the deposition or extraction of
materials; and the construction or elevation of dikes, berms and levees.
DIGITAL FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (DFIRM): The digital official map of a
community, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, on which both the
special flood hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the
community are delineated.
ELEVATED BUILDING: For flood insurance purposes, a non-basement building which
has its lowest elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls,
shear walls, posts, piers, pilings, or columns.
ELEVATION: Height above a given datum.
ELEVATION CERTIFICATE: The elevation certificate is an important administrative
tool of the NFIP. It is used to determine the proper flood insurance premium
rate; it is used to document elevation information necessary to ensure
compliance with community floodplain management regulations; and it may be used
to support a request for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) or Letter of Map
Revision Based On Fill (LOMR-F).
ENCLOSURE: An area enclosed by solid walls below the BFE/FPE or an area formed
when any space below the BFE/FPE is enclosed on all sides by walls or
partitions. Insect screening or open wood lattice used to surround space below
the BFE/FPE is not considered an enclosure.
ENCROACHMENT: The advance or infringement of uses, fill, excavation, buildings,
structures, or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the
flow capacity of a floodplain.
EXISTING CONSTRUCTION: For the purposes of determining rates, structures for
which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the
FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing
construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures".
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR MANUFACTURED HOME SUBDIVISION: A
manufactured home park or subdivision where the construction of facilities for
servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed
(including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of
streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed
before the effective date of the original floodplain management regulations
adopted by the community, dated February 8, 1988.
EXISTING STRUCTURES: See definition of existing construction.
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The preparation
of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of
utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the
pouring of concrete pads).
FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA): The Federal agency with the overall
responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).
FILL: The intentional placement of material (from any source, including the
subject property) that raises the ground (natural grade), not including
deposition resulting from a naturally occurring event.
FLOOD ELEVATION DETERMINATION: See definition of base flood elevation (BFE).
FLOOD ELEVATION STUDY: See definition of Flood Insurance Study (FIS).
FLOOD FRINGE: The portion of the floodplain outside of the floodway covered by
floodwaters during the base flood.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): An official map of a community, on which the
Federal Insurance Administrator has delineated both the special hazard areas
and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been
made available digitally is called a Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM).
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS): An examination, evaluation, and determination of
flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations; or
an examination, evaluation and determination of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and/or
flood-related erosion hazards.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land from:
1. The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
2. The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any
source.
3. Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by flooding as
defined in subsection A2 of this definition and are akin to a river of liquid
and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is
carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current.
   B.   The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other
body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents
of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an
unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe
storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an
abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event
which results in flooding as defined in subsection A1 of this definition.
FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (FPE): The base flood elevation plus the freeboard.
   A.   In special flood hazard areas where base flood elevations (BFEs) have
been determined, this elevation shall be the BFE plus two feet (2') of
freeboard; and
   B.   In special flood hazard areas where no BFE has been established, this
elevation shall be at least two feet (2') above the highest adjacent grade.
FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM: Those physical structural works for which funds have
been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed
specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the area
within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the
depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes dams,
reservoirs, levees, or dikes. These specialized flood-modifying works are those
constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.
FLOOD ZONE: A geographical area shown on a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) that
reflects the severity or type of flooding in the area.
FLOODPLAIN: The land that has been or may be covered by floodwaters, or is
surrounded by floodwater and inaccessible, during the occurrence of the base
flood that is specifically defined as the "special flood hazard areas inundated
by 100-year flood" on the current edition of the flood insurance rate map
(FIRM), or as modified by FEMA by an interpretation of on-site elevations. The
riverine floodplain includes the floodway and the flood fringe.
FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT PERMIT: Any type of permit that is required in
conformance with the provisions of this article, prior to the commencement of
any development activity.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to
emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, and floodplain management
regulations.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS: Zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations,
Building Codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a
floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance, and erosion control ordinance), and
other applications of police power. The term describes such State or local
regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the
purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.
FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation.
FREEBOARD: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level,
the BFE, for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effects of urbanization in a watershed. The base flood
elevation (BFE) plus the freeboard establishes the flood protection elevation
(FPE). Freeboard shall be two feet (2').
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT FACILITY: A facility that cannot be used for its
intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to
water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and
unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, or ship repair facilities. The
term does not include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service
facilities.
GRADING: Shaping the ground surface, usually by earth-moving equipment such as
graders.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE (HAG): The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed walls of a structure.
Refer to the FEMA elevation certificate for HAG related to building elevation
information.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE: A structure that is:
   A.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the National Register;
   B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or to a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify
as a registered historic district;
   C.   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places and
determined as eligible by states with historic preservation programs which have
been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or
   D.   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places and
determined as eligible by communities with historic preservation programs that
have been certified either:
1. By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior,
or
2. Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved
programs.
LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC): A general term used to refer to the several types
of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by letter.
They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision (LOMR), and
Letter of Map Revision Based On Fill (LOMR-F).
Conditional Letter Of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and comment as to
whether a proposed flood protection project or other project complies with the
minimum NFIP requirements for such projects with respect to delineation of
special flood hazard areas. A CLOMR does not revise the effective Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or Flood Insurance Study (FIS). Upon submission and
approval of certified as-built documentation, a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)
may be issued by FEMA to revise the effective FIRM building permits and/or
floodplain development permits cannot be issued based on a CLOMR, because a
CLOMR does not change the NFIP map.
Letter Of Map Amendment (LOMA): An official amendment, by letter, to an
effective National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) map. A LOMA establishes a
property's location in relation to the special flood hazard area (SFHA). LOMAs
are usually issued because a property has been inadvertently mapped as being in
the floodplain but is actually on natural high ground above the base flood
elevation.
Letter Of Map Revision (LOMR):   FEMA's modification to an effective Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or a Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM) or both.
LOMRs are generally based on the implementation of physical measures that
affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and
thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the
effective base flood elevations (BFEs), or the special flood hazard area
(SFHA). The LOMR officially revises the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or
Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM), and sometimes the Flood Insurance Study
(FIS) report, and when appropriate, includes a description of the
modifications. The LOMR is generally accompanied by an annotated copy of the
affected portions of the FIRM, FBFM, or FIS report.
Letter Of Map Revision Based On Fill (LOMR-F):   FEMA's modification of the
special flood hazard area (SFHA) shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
based on the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway. The
LOMR-F does not change the FIRM, FBFM, or FIS report.
LEVEE: A man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed according to sound engineering practices, to contain, control, or
divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.
LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees,
and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE (LAG): The lowest point of the ground level next to the
structure. Refer to the FEMA elevation certificate for LAG related to building
elevation information.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking
of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement is not
considered a structure's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not
built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-
elevation design requirements of 44 CFR section 60.3 and this article.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, built on
a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured
home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land
divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
MARKET VALUE: The building value, not including the land value and that of any
accessory structures or other improvements on the lot. Market value may be
established by independent certified appraisal; replacement cost depreciated
for age of building and quality of construction (actual cash value); or
adjusted tax assessed values.
MEAN HIGH WATER MARK: The mark on all watercourses, where the presence and
action of waters is so common and continued in all ordinary years as to mark
upon the soil a character distinct from that of the abutting upland, in respect
to vegetation and destroying its value for agricultural purposes. In areas
where riprap bank stabilization has occurred, the measurement shall begin on
the landward side of such stabilization work.
MEAN SEA LEVEL: For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP),
the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum (such as
North America Vertical Datum of 1988 - NAVD88) to which base flood elevations
(BFEs) shown on a community's FIRM are referenced.
MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW): Describes a condition where there is a river, flow,
or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside usually as a result of a dual
condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on
the ground preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. A
mudslide (i.e., mudflow) may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a landslide
is in progress, and will be recognized as such by the Administrator only if the
mudflow, and not the landslide, is the proximate cause of damage that occurs.
MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) AREA MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program
of corrective and preventive measures for reducing mudslide (i.e., mudflow)
damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, mudslide
control works, and floodplain management regulations.
MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) PRONE AREA: An area with land surfaces and slopes of
unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate indicate a
potential for mudflow.
NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal program created
by Congress to mitigate future flood losses nationwide through sound,
community-enforced building and zoning ordinances and to provide access to
affordable, Federally backed flood insurance protection for property owners.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: For floodplain management purposes, a structure for which the
start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain
management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
Any construction started after February 8, 1988 and before the effective start
date of this article is subject to the ordinance in effect at the time the
permit was issued, provided the start of construction was within one hundred
eighty (180) days of permit issuance.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A place where the construction of
facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be
affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction
of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is
completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations
adopted by a community, effective FIRM dated November 26, 2010.
POST-FIRM: Construction or other development for which the "start of
construction" occurred on or after February 8, 1988, the effective date of the
initial Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
PRE-FIRM: Construction or other development for which the "start of
construction" occurred before February 8, 1988, the effective date of the
initial Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle that is:
   A.   Built on a single chassis, and
   B.   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection, and

living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
REGULATORY FLOODWAY: See definition of floodway.
REMEDY A VIOLATION: To bring the structure or other development into compliance
with State or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not
possible, to reduce the impacts of its non-compliance. Ways that impacts may be
reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from
flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance or
otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing Federal financial
exposure with regard to the structure or other development.
REPETITIVE LOSS STRUCTURE: An NFIP-insured structure that has had at least two
(2) paid flood losses of more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) each in any
10-year period since 1978.
RIPARIAN SETBACK: The distance measured at right angles from the mean high
water mark of a waterway, between the mean high water mark and an imaginary
line parallel to the mean high water mark, defining an area between such lines
within which no building, deck or other applicable structure may be placed, and
whereby any existing vegetation shall remain undisturbed.
RIVER RESTORATION PROJECT: A project that is primarily designed to improve or
restore fish and wildlife habitat within the floodplain, including associated
stream bank restoration and stabilization.
RIVERINE: Relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including
tributaries), stream, brook, etc.
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA): The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
For purposes of these regulations, the term "special flood hazard area" is
synonymous in meaning with the phrase "area of special flood hazard".
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was
within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means
either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site,
such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
STREAM ALTERATION: To obstruct, diminish, destroy, alter, modify, relocate or
change the existing shape of the natural channel within or below the mean high
water mark, including the removal of material or structures in the stream
channel.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of its market value before the damage occurred. See
definition of "substantial improvement".
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction"
of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred
"substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include either:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local Health, Sanitary, or Safety Code specifications
which have been identified by the local Code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
   B.   Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure" and the alteration is approved by variance issued pursuant to this
article.
TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED: Having the temperature regulated by a heating and/or
cooling system, built-in or appliance.
VARIANCE: A grant of relief by the Governing Body from a requirement of this
article.
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the finished construction elevation certificate,
other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR
section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is
presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of
1988 (or other specified datum), of floods of various magnitudes and
frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.
WATERCOURSE: A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel, or other topographic
feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse
includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may
occur. (Ord. 1234, 2018)
17.04J.030: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Lands To Which This Article Applies: This article shall apply to all
special flood hazard areas within the jurisdiction of the City of Hailey.
Nothing in this article is intended to allow uses or structures that are
otherwise prohibited by this title.
   B.   Basis For Special Flood Hazard Areas:
      1.   Special Flood Hazard Areas Adopted By Reference: The special flood
hazard areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) for Blaine County, Idaho and Incorporated Areas, dated
November 26, 2010, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) or
Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps (DFIRM), and other supporting data, are
adopted by reference and declared a part of this article. The FIS and the FIRM
are on file at the Office of the Community Development Department at 115 Main
Street South, Hailey, Idaho. The DFIRM is available on Blaine County's website
at: http://maps.co.blaine.id.us/jsapi/ParcelInfoMap.html.
      2.   Floodway And Floodplain Regulations: The Flood Hazard Overlay
District is divided into two (2) subdistricts, the Floodway Subdistrict and the
Floodplain Subdistrict. The boundaries of these subdistricts are indicated on
the FIRM(s).
      3.   Boundaries: The precise boundaries of the Floodway and Floodplain
Subdistrict boundaries may be determined by on site elevations as interpreted
from the adopted flood insurance study. Interpretations of the elevation
information can result in a floodplain/floodway area greater than that depicted
on the FIRMs. The floodplain/floodway areas cannot be less than the area
depicted on the FIRMs unless changed by a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). All
land within the external boundary of the Floodplain Subdistrict shall be
considered to be within the floodplain and all land within the external
boundary of the Floodway Subdistrict shall be considered to be within the
floodway, and governed by the provisions of this district.
   C.   Floodplain Development Permit Requirement: A floodplain development
permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this article
prior to the commencement of any development activities within special flood
hazard area. Table 1 of this section outlines the types of permits that are
required for specific types of activities and which standards are applicable to
those activities. Examples provided under each activity type are intended to be
illustrative in nature and are not an exhaustive list of possible actions for
that activity type. Please consult the Floodplain Administrator for additional
information.

Notes:
   1.    Additional standards may apply, depending on actual scope of work.
   2.    Administrative procedure of review, assess and document.
   3.    Base flood elevation.
      1.   The term "development" shall not apply to routine maintenance of
existing, permitted, vegetative landscaping that does not alter topography or
to isolated cosmetic building maintenance projects that do not constitute
substantial improvement, such as:
         a.   Mowing or cutting of weeds, trees and other nuisance growth,
except in the riparian setback as regulated by subsection
17.04J.040B4e of this article;
         b.   Lawn maintenance activities, such as mowing, fertilizing and weed
control;
         c.   Pulling of weeds;
         d.   General farming, pasture, horticultural activities, and forestry
that do not involve any clearing/grubbing of an area;
         e.   Planting of seeds, and plants from one gallon or smaller
containers;
         f.   Raking, sweeping, leaf blowing and other seasonal yard clean- up
activities;
         g.   House painting, interior or exterior, not in conjunction with a
larger remodel project;
         h.   Roofing material replacement, not in conjunction with a larger
remodel project; and
         i.   Appliance repair.
      2.   All applications for a floodplain development permit for a
subdivision shall be evaluated and approved or denied by the commission and
Council at the same time as the preliminary and final plat applications, in
accordance with the subdivision ordinance.
      3.   All other floodplain development permit applications, with the
exception of stream alteration permits, shall be evaluated and approved or
denied by the Floodplain Administrator. At the Floodplain Administrator's
discretion, minor projects, that do not alter existing topography or flood
carrying capacity, are not candidates for substantial improvement and/or do not
involve replacement of utilities, may be permitted through an expedited review,
assess and document (RAD) process. Said documentation shall be maintained by
the jurisdiction in perpetuity.
      4.   Stream alteration permits shall be considered by the commission per
the requirements of section
17.04J.070, "City Issued Stream Alteration Permit", of this article.
   D.   Compliance: No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended,
converted, altered, or developed in any way without full compliance with the
terms of this article and other applicable regulations.
   E.   Repeal And Greater Restrictions: This article shall not in any way
repeal, abrogate, impair, or remove the necessity of compliance with any other
laws, ordinances, regulations, easements, covenants, or deed restrictions,
etcetera. However, where this article and another conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes more stringent or greater restrictions shall control.
   F.   Interpretation: In the interpretation and application of this article
all provisions shall be:
      1.   Considered as minimum requirements;
      2.   Liberally construed in favor of the Governing Body; and
      3.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State Statutes.
   G.   Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability: The degree of flood protection
required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such
as ice jams, increased bedload in the river and bridge openings restricted by
debris. This article does not imply that land outside the special flood hazard
areas or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of City of Hailey
or by any officer or employee thereof for flood damages that result from
reliance on this article or an administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
Each and every licensed real estate agent, salesperson and broker, and each and
every private party who offers for sale a parcel of real property and/or
structure for sale within the Flood Hazard Overlay District shall provide the
prospective purchaser with notice that the real property and/or structure is
located within the Flood Hazard Overlay District and that it is subject to all
applicable regulations of this Code.
   H.   Penalties For Violation: No structure or land shall hereafter be
located, extended, converted, or altered unless in full compliance with the
terms of this article and other applicable regulations.

repairs of substantial damage, and any other improvement of or work on such
buildings and structures, the Floodplain Administrator, in coordination with
the building official, shall:
         a.   Estimate the market value, or require the applicant to obtain an
appraisal of the market value prepared by a qualified independent appraiser, of
the building or structure before the start of construction of the proposed
work. In the case of repair, the market value of the building or structure
shall be the market value before the damage occurred and before any repairs are
made;
         b.   Compare the cost to perform the improvement, the cost to repair a
damaged building to its pre-damaged condition, or the combined costs of
improvements and repairs, if applicable, to the market value of the building or
structure;
         c.   Determine and document whether the proposed work constitutes
substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage; and
         d.   Notify the applicant if it is determined that the work
constitutes substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage and that

this article, the authorizing body may attach such conditions to the granting
of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of
this article.
      6.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation (BFE) and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and that such construction
below the BFE increases risks to life and property, and that the issuance of a
variance to construct a structure below the BFE will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty five dollars ($25.00) per one
hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage. Such notification shall be
maintained with a record of all variance actions, including justification for
their issuance.
      7.   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency and the State of Idaho upon request.
      8.   Conditions for variances are as follows:

provisions are required:
      1.   All new construction, substantial improvements, and development,
including manufactured homes and accessory buildings, shall be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral
movement of the structure, all new construction and substantial improvements
shall be designed with engineered foundations and all development shall be
reasonably safe from flooding.
      2.   All new construction, substantial improvements, and development
shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood
damage in accordance with the Technical Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant
Materials Requirements, and available from the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
      3.   All new construction, substantial improvements, and development
shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages.
      4.   All new and replacement electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing,
air conditioning equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/
or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding to the flood protection elevation,
except as provided for in subsections A7 and B4, "Additions/Improvements", of
this section. These include, but are not limited to, HVAC equipment, water
softener units, bath/kitchen fixtures, ductwork, electric/gas meter panels/
boxes, utility/cable boxes, hot water heaters, and electric outlets/switches.
      5.   Any proposed water supply and sanitation system shall prevent
disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions as follows:
         a.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
         b.   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
         c.   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed
to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
      6.   A fully enclosed area, of new construction and substantially
improved structures, which is below the lowest floor shall:
         a.   Be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials at least to
the flood protection elevation; and
         b.   Include, in Zones A, AE, AH, AO, and A1-30, flood openings to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the
entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed
the following minimum design criteria:
            (1) A minimum of two (2) flood openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
            (2) The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding or per
engineered flood opening requirements;
            (3) If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed
area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and
exit;
            (4) The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher
than one foot (1') above the interior or exterior adjacent grade, but only the
net area of the flood opening below the base flood elevation may contribute to
the required opening size;
            (5) Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions; and
            (6) Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning,    regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above.
      7.   Nothing in this article shall prevent the repair, reconstruction, or
replacement of a building or structure existing on the effective date of this
article and located totally or partially within the floodway, flood fringe
area, or stream setback, provided there is no additional encroachment below the
flood protection elevation in the floodway, flood fringe area, or stream
setback, and provided that such repair, reconstruction, or replacement meets
all of the other requirements of this article.
      8.   New solid waste disposal facilities and sites, hazardous waste
management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage facilities shall not
be permitted in the special flood hazard area, except by variance as specified
in subsection
17.04J.050E9 of this article. A structure or tank for chemical or fuel storage
incidental to an allowed use or to the operation of a water treatment plant or
wastewater treatment facility may be located in a special flood hazard area
only if the structure or tank is either elevated or floodproofed to at least
the flood protection elevation and certified in accordance with the provisions
of subsection
17.04J.050C3, "Certification Requirements", of this article.
      9.   The proposed development shall cause no significant danger to life
and property due to increased flood heights or velocities, no materials may be
swept onto other lands or downstream to the injury of others and the proposed
development shall be reasonably safe from flooding.
      10.   The proposed location shall represent the safest location on the
subject property for the proposed use.
      11.   Safe access to the property shall be available in times of a base
flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles.

bank and within the required one hundred foot (100') riparian setback shall be
preserved.
      14.   New landscaping shall include plantings that are low growing and
have dense root systems to stabilize stream banks and to repair any damage
previously done to riparian vegetation.
      15.   Any chemicals or other toxic materials that could cause
contamination of surface waters or groundwater, or that could be injurious to
public health, safety and welfare, shall be located at the flood protection
elevation and stored in a manner that prevents their release in the event of a
flood.
      16.   When a structure is partially located in a special flood hazard
area, the entire structure shall meet the requirements for new construction and
substantial improvements.
      17.   When a structure is located in multiple flood hazard zones or in a
flood hazard risk zone with multiple base flood elevations, the provisions for
the more restrictive flood hazard risk zone and the highest base flood
elevation (BFE) shall apply.
      18.   Fill is prohibited in the SFHA, including construction of buildings
on fill, unless compensatory storage is provided so that the total amount of
fill placed on the site does not exceed the amount excavated from the site.
Placement of fill necessary to satisfy drainage requirements of the Building
Code shall be allowed if determined necessary by the Floodplain Administrator.
However, any placement of fill must be evaluated by the Floodplain
Administrator to ensure that it does not have adverse impact on neighboring
properties. This includes not giving City of Hailey approval when asked by FEMA
to review Conditional Letters or Letters of Map Revision (CLOMR-F or LOMR-F),
unless they meet the above requirements.
   B.   Specific Standards: In all special flood hazard areas where base flood
elevation (BFE) data has been provided, as set forth in subsection

unpredictable and indeterminate. In addition to subsections A, "General
Standards", and B, "Specific Standards", of this section all new construction
and substantial improvements shall meet the following requirements:
 
      1.   The lowest floor shall be elevated at least as high as the depth
number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), in feet, plus a
freeboard of two feet (2'), above the highest adjacent grade; or at least four
feet (4') above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
 
      2.   Non-residential structures may, in lieu of elevation, be
floodproofed to the same level as required in subsection F1 of this section so
that the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities,
below that level shall be watertight with walls substantially impermeable to

The purpose of the SCI district is to provide an area for master planned
business park developments that do not conflict with, and do support, the
central business district. The SCI district is further divided into two (2)
subdistricts to provide and allow for flexibility within the master planned
business park, to group compatible uses, and to better respond to the
surroundings of the planned business park. The SCI district is intended to be a
category of land use for large parcels and may not be appropriate for smaller
parcels. (Ord. 1191, 2015)
17.04L.010.01: DISTRICTWIDE REGULATIONS:
   A.   Uses; Adverse Conditions: All uses in the SCI district shall conform to
the comprehensive plan and shall be reviewed for conditions that may be
hazardous, including, but not limited to, traffic hazards, parking overflow,
noise, cinders, dust, fumes, odors, smoke, vapor, vibration, glare or
industrial waste. Any conditions that could adversely affect the surrounding
areas are subject to review upon application for design review. The commission
may require mitigation, including, but not limited to, enclosure within a
structure, landscape buffering or alternate method of operation.
      1.   Fire Hazards: Any activity involving the use or storage of flammable
or explosive materials shall be protected by adequate firefighting and fire
prevention equipment and by such safety devices as are normally used in the
handling of any such material. Such hazards shall be kept removed from adjacent
activities to a distance that is compatible with the potential danger involved
and as specified in the IFC.
      2.   Air And Water Pollution: All uses shall be subject to the
requirements and regulations established by the federal, state and local
regulations.

subdistrict designation within the application. (Ord. 1191, 2015)
17.04L.020: SALES AND OFFICE SUBDISTRICT (SCI-SO):
The purpose of the sales and office subdistrict is to allow for a master
planned office, technology and service park and associated sales and support
uses, as well as a location for the sales and service of large or bulky retail
goods, or goods associated directly with the building trades. The subdistrict
is created to provide a location for those uses that might otherwise be
appropriate in, but, by their nature, may be inappropriate for the central
business district. The nature of those businesses which are appropriate for
this subdistrict are those that require a substantial number of service
vehicles, have a substantial portion of the building area dedicated to storage
or processing, or consist of uses or scale of operation that are better
accommodated outside the central business district. This article assumes that
the following list of uses is not exhaustive and that other like uses may be
permitted upon administrative review pursuant to subsection

   J.   Preservation of Historic Structures:
      1.   Bulk Requirement Flexibility: The City aims to promote the historic,
architectural, archaeological and cultural heritage, features and qualities of
Hailey through the identification, evaluation, designation, and protection of
historic structures. Where historic commercial and residential structures are
preserved, flexibility in the bulk requirements of the Townsite Overlay (TO)
Zoning District may be approved by the Administrator and/or the Planning and
Zoning Commission on a case-by-case basis, as follows: 
         a.   Maximum Building Height: When any building permit application
includes the retention of a historic commercial or residential structure, the
maximum building height shall be subject to the maximum building height allowed
by the underlying zoning designation of the parcel(s).
         b.   Maximum Lot Coverage: When any building permit application
includes the retention and preservation of a historic residential structure,
the maximum lot coverage may be forty percent (40%), regardless of the number
of stories above grade or the existence of a garage. Where a historic
residential or commercial structure is retained and preserved and located
within a zoning district that allows for lot coverage greater than forty
percent (40%), the underlying zoning district and/or zoning overlay shall
govern. 
      2.   Specific Standards
   K.   Purpose:
      1.   The Hailey historic preservation and bulk requirement flexibility
standards provide the required design elements for the granting of bulk
requirement flexibility that may accompany the preservation of a historic
residential or commercial building. Bulk requirement flexibility shall only be
granted to qualifying residential or commercial structures in the Townsite
Overlay Zoning District.
      2.   In general, the City of Hailey considers structures built in or
prior to the year 1975 as "historic". There is both inherent and instrumental
value in the preservation of historic buildings in Hailey. However, all
applications seeking to apply bulk requirement flexibility shall be reviewed on
a case-by-case basis. Additionally, there may be instances where a structure is
not at least fifty (50) years old, yet said structure possesses unique,
significant, and/or context-specific value to the overall historic and
architectural culture of Hailey.
      3.   The specific standards contained herein ensure that all bulk
requirement flexibility projects - which are reviewed on a case-by-case basis
by the Planning and Zoning Commission - retain a shared set of characteristics
that uphold the integrity of Hailey's historic building stock.
      4.   For bulk requirement flexibility to be granted, each of the
following standards must be met:
         a.   The residential or commercial building was constructed in or
before the year 1975, and therefore considered "historic", according to City
Standards.
         b.   Any addition to a qualifying historic structure should not
obscure, shield, or otherwise prohibit viewership of the primary frontage of
the existing historic structure, as seen from public street. Additions are
strongly preferred at the rear of the existing historic structure. If site
conditions and/or project circumstances do not allow for rear location, the
addition shall match or complement the existing historic structure with each of
the following: material type, material arrangement, material color,
fenestration scale and design, roof material, and roofline shape.
         c.   If a project seeks to apply flexibility in maximum building
height, the addition shall only be permitted behind the front wall plane, so as
not to obscure viewership of existing historic structure from the primary
street frontage.
         d.   Material types for new additions shall be limited to either the
matching material type of the existing historic structure, or material types
that are natural and/or reflective of the period in which the existing historic
structure was built. This may include wood (painted or natural stain),
corrugated metal, stone, and brick.
         e.   Any Applicant seeking to apply bulk requirement flexibility, in
exchange for the preservation of a historic structure, shall provide a written
narrative statement with their Application, to be retained in the City of
Hailey Public Record. Such a narrative statement shall include:
            (1)   Date of original construction of all historic structures
proposed for retention.
            (2)   Date and type of any renovations for all historic structures
proposed for retention, to include building square footage expansions,
additions of windows and/or doors, and any other construction that
substantially altered the character and scope of the structure in question. Re-
roof renovations are exempt.
            (3)   Statement and timeline of preserved historic structure uses
(residence, office, small business, etc.), from earliest known and leading to
the present.
            (4)   Identification and description of at least two (2) distinct
architectural and/or design elements from the existing historical structure
that will be matched, expanded upon, and/or reflected in the proposed addition.
Description should include specific element names and a brief explanation of
how each element is reflective of a specific historical period (i.e. mid-
century modern, post-World War II, settlement/territorial, etc.)
   L.   Other Requirements: The following requirements shall also govern and
apply to all Design Review Applications seeking to preserve historic structures
and qualify for bulk requirement flexibility:
      1.   Existing Nonconforming Buildings: Where an existing building is
nonconforming with respect to the bulk requirements of the Townsite Overlay
(TO) Zoning District, provisions outlined in Section
17.04M.070: Nonconforming Buildings shall be met.
      2.   Flexibility in the bulk requirements apply to historic commercial or
residential structures only. Historic outbuildings and/or other accessory
structures do not qualify. Historic outbuildings and/or other accessory
structures shall meet the bulk requirements of the underlying zoning district
and/or zoning overlay, whichever designation controls.
      3.   For purposes of this section, historic shall mean any commercial or
residential structure built in or before the year 1975.
      4.   All other bulk requirements not expressly written herein shall be
met.
      5.   Applicants may only seek consideration of one (1) bulk requirement
flexibility per Application, and only one (1) bulk requirement flexibility per
Application may be granted. Additional waivers and/or flexibilities may be
addressed through established City processes, including Planned Unit
Developments (Section
17.10) and/or Variances (Section
17.12). (Ord. 1342, 2024; Ord. 1320, 2023; Ord. 1298, 3-28-2022; Ord. 1275,
2021; Ord. 1191, 2015; Ord. 1347, 2025)
 
Notes
  1. Reference streets: River Street, Main Street, 1st Avenue, 2nd Avenue. If a
1 lot does not have frontage on any of these streets, then the street fronting
  the lot becomes the reference street.
   
17.04M.070: NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS:
Where an existing building is nonconforming with respect to setbacks, expansion
of said building within the plane of the furthest intrusion shall be permitted;
provided, that the nonconformity with respect to the distance of the setback is
not further increased. Such expansion shall not be considered to be increasing
the degree of nonconformity pursuant to section
17.13.060 of this title. The following exceptions apply:
   A.   In no case may expansion occur that results in a setback of less than
six feet (6') from property lines abutting other private property.
   B.   Any wall, as measured from the highest point, including any gable or
peak in a direct vertical line to record grade, shall have a setback of one
foot (1') for every two and one-half feet (21/2') of wall height (see section
17.04M.090, diagram 1 and table 2 of this article), but not less than six feet
(6') from property lines abutting other private property, regardless of
underlying zoning.
   C.   No roof overhangs, fire escapes, chimneys, bay windows or other
features, which are subject to section
17.07.010, "Supplementary Yard Setback Requirements", of this title, shall have
a setback less than five feet (5') from property lines abutting other private
property. (Ord. 1191, 2015)
17.04M.080: LOT LINE VACATIONS:
If a parcel in single ownership consists of two (2) or more original townsite
lots, or a combination of lot(s) and portions of lot(s), each internal original
townsite lot line(s) shall be vacated prior to the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy if either of the following criteria applies: a) a proposed new
building or addition increases the degree of nonconformity or creates a new
nonconformity with regard to setbacks, measured from the nearest adjacent
original townsite lot line, not from the parcel boundary of multiple original
townsite lots held in single ownership; or b) lot lines, which a building is
not currently built on, are located underneath a proposed new building or
addition.

17.04N.010: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   The purpose and intent of the hillside overlay district is to promote
the health, safety and welfare of current and future residents of the city of
Hailey by regulating development on hillside areas, to:
      1.   Preserve the environmental, recreational and aesthetic values and
other benefits of hillsides, integral to the character of the city;
      2.   Maintain slope and soil stability;
      3.   Prevent cuts and fills, including those for access roads and
driveways, that exacerbate the natural hazards, such as erosion and landslide,
associated with developing on hillsides;
      4.   Encourage grading that follows natural contours and require drought
tolerant and/or native landscaping where existing vegetation has been
disturbed;
      5.   Limit the extent of disturbance to natural grade and existing
vegetation associated with any development;
      6.   Direct development of buildings and other structures to appropriate
areas of lowest elevation on hillside properties where such areas are part of
the parcel or lot under consideration;
      7.   Direct development in a manner that avoids natural hazards
associated with developing on hillsides;
      8.   Ensure safe and reasonable access to and from the properties,
including access by emergency services;
      9.   Ensure adequate review of all land use proposals that may have an
impact on the above;
      10.   Allow public nonmotorized recreational access and use of hillsides
where appropriate to the terrain, access and neighboring uses;
      11.   Regulate site alteration and structural development in the hillside
overlay district to assure that site alteration and development occurs in the
hillside overlay district only when no sufficient available area for the
proposed site alteration or development exists outside of the district and all
other criteria under this article have been met, and to assure that any site
alteration and structural development within the district occurs in a manner
that minimizes hillside visibility.
   B.   The intent of the hillside overlay district is to direct development to
land outside of the hillside overlay district. Only when no area for
development exists outside of the hillside overlay district and all other
criteria under this article have been met may a site alteration occur within
the district. Even then, the development must be located at a site within the
district which will minimize its hillside visibility. Conditions of approval
should be placed on all applications to ensure that any development will be
limited in its bulk, design and use of materials to minimize its visibility
from public streets. (Ord. 1191, 2015)
17.04N.020: ESTABLISHMENT OF HILLSIDE OVERLAY DISTRICT:
   A.   The hillside overlay (HO) district is hereby established. The
regulations of this overlay district shall apply to all areas of land within
the city shown on the official zoning map, which generally correspond with

district applies to these properties regardless of zoning district designation.
   B.   An application to amend the HO district boundary on any parcel based on
a site specific survey is subject to
chapter 17.14 of this title. (Ord. 1191, 2015)
17.04N.030: GENERAL APPLICATION:
The hillside overlay district shall set forth use and bulk requirements for
buildings and structures located within the HO district. Where the regulations
specified in this article differ from corresponding regulations specified for
the underlying zoning district, the requirements of the HO district shall
govern. The regulations of the HO district shall not apply to platted lots
existing within Hailey city limits prior to the effective date hereof, on March

17.04N.070: STANDARDS OF EVALUATION:
The applicant has the burden of presenting all necessary and relevant
information and evidence in support of the application. (Ord. 1191, 2015)
17.04N.070.01: GENERAL:
   A.   Siting New Buildings: The siting of new buildings or structures shall
demonstrate through visual simulation graphics or other graphic means that the
building or structure does not skyline from any public street or improved
public trail.
   B.   Neutral Colors: Buildings shall be designed with neutral colors or with
colors naturally found in the surrounding hillsides.
   C.   Recreation Uses, Amenities: All recreation uses and amenities shall be
appropriate to the terrain, with minimal visual impact.
   D.   Wildlife Impact: All development shall minimize impact on wildlife
migration corridors and wintering grounds. (Ord. 1191, 2015)
17.04N.070.02: GRADING:
   A.   Unstabilized Cut Slopes: Unstabilized cut slopes shall be designed and
constructed according to the recommendations of a qualified engineer, unless a
structural alternative such as a retaining wall or other measure acceptable to
the city is provided.
   B.   Retaining Walls: Retaining walls may be preferred as a means to break
up long, uninterrupted cuts. These retaining walls should be interspersed with
other cut slopes if possible to break up the length. Retaining walls should be
no higher than four feet (4') or terraced with a three foot (3') horizontal
separation of walls. They should be constructed of materials that are utilized

shall remain undisturbed, unless otherwise required by the wildland/urban
interface code. If evidence acceptable to the city is provided showing that the
strict enforcement of this provision would prohibit access to the lot or that
placement of utilities would be impossible, then the applicant may apply for a
waiver to this provision. Waivers shall only be considered in situations where
strict application of the requirements of this section will deny to the
developer the reasonable and beneficial use of the property in question, and
not in situations where the developer establishes only that exceptions will
allow a more financially feasible project.
   F.   Building Code Compliance: All retaining walls and grading shall comply
with the most currently adopted edition of the international building code.

   14.    May be subject to additional provisions per the Townsite Overlay (TO)
Zoning District. See subsection
17.04M1 of this title.
   15.    Townhouse and cottage sublots are exempt from minimum lot sizes and
widths; however, townhouse and cottage developments shall adhere to the density
requirements, as stated in the bulk requirements table of this section, as well
as the subdivision and zoning requirements in Titles 16 and 17 respectively.
   16.    Townhouse and cottage sublots shall conform to the standards
established in the IFC.
   17.    For a building with any portion of the building footprint within the

   22.   Riparian setback. Unless otherwise provided for herein, all permanent
buildings and structures shall have a 100-foot-wide riparian setback from the
mean high-water mark of the Big Wood River. Removal of live vegetation or
excavation within the riparian setback is prohibited, except for any tree that
has been recommended for removal by a certified arborist, in writing, because
the tree has been found to potentially endanger the resident(s) of the property
on which it is located or any member of the public, or has become hazardous to
any street, alley or other public right-of-way or public utility, or because
the removal of a tree would substantially improve the health of other trees on
the property. Pruning of trees and planting of riparian trees, shrubs and
ground cover within the riparian setback are allowed, provided however, that
all plantings conform to the criteria for evaluation in subsection
17.04J.040B4e of this title. Where the application of the 100-foot riparian
setback and other applicable setbacks will result in a building site of 1,000

Compliance Alternative. Building envelope tightness shall be determined with a
blower door test, by a certified professional, verifying compliance with this
standard.

development shall be a deed restricted community housing unit, for sale or
rent, in perpetuity. The deed restricted unit shall comply with income,
occupancy, and/or other affordable community housing criteria as established in
a community housing plan approved by the City of Hailey. As an alternative, two
(2) Locals Only units, as outlined by the City of Hailey, may be provided.
Additional alternative community housing compliance options may be proposed by
the developer and may be approved by the City based on housing need in the
community at the time of application.
         d.   Minimum two (2) dwelling units per acre in each detached
townhouse development shall be deed restricted community housing units, for
sale or rent, in perpetuity. The deed restricted units shall comply with
income, occupancy, and/or other affordable community housing criteria as
established in a community housing plan approved by the City of Hailey. As an
alternative, four (4) Locals Only units, as outlined by the City of Hailey, may
be provided. Additional alternative community housing compliance options may be
proposed by the developer and may be approved by the City based on housing need
in the community at the time of application.
         e.   The deed restricted community housing unit(s) shall be identical
to at least one (1) other market-rate unit within the cottage development.
   24.   While the maximum allowed gross floor area per individual cottage
dwelling unit is fourteen hundred (1,400) square feet, the average gross floor
area per dwelling unit in a cottage development shall not exceed twelve hundred
(1,200) square feet.
      Cottage dwelling units are subject to a maximum ground floor size of one
thousand (1,000) gross square feet, including an attached garage, but not
including porches, dedicated storage, or basement. Basement area shall be
limited to the size of the ground floor footprint and located with the basement

   B.   Nonresidential And Mixed Use Buildings Located Within B, LB Or TN
Districts: In addition to the standards applicable to any nonresidential,
multi- family or mixed use building located within the city of Hailey described
in subsection A of this section, the following design standards also apply to
any nonresidential and mixed use buildings located within the B or LB zoning
districts:
      1.   Site Planning:
         a.   The site shall support pedestrian circulation and provide
pedestrian amenities. Sidewalks shall be provided along building fronts.
         b.   Wider sidewalks are encouraged to provide additional amenities,
such as seating areas and bicycle racks.
      2.   Building Design:
         a.   The main facade shall be oriented to the street. The main
entrance(s) to the building shall be located on the street side of the
building. If the building is located on a corner, entrances shall be provided
on both street frontages. If the design includes a courtyard, the main entrance
may be located through the courtyard. Buildings with more than one retail space
on the ground floor are encouraged to have separate entrances for each unit.
         b.   Multi-unit structures shall emphasize the individuality of units
or provide visual interest by variations in rooflines or walls or other human
scale elements. Breaking the facades and roofs of buildings softens the
institutional image which may often accompany large buildings.
         c.   Building designs shall maximize the human scale of buildings and
enhance the small town "sense of place". This can be achieved by utilizing
voids and masses, as well as details, textures and colors on building facades.
Human scale can also be achieved by incorporating structural elements, such as
colonnades and covered walkways, overhangs, canopies, entries and landscaping.
Particular attention should be paid to creating interest at the street level.
         d.   Buildings that exceed thirty feet (30') in height, the entire
roof surface shall not project to the highest point of the roof. The commission
shall review building height relative to the other dimensions of width and
depth combined with detailing of parapets, cornices, roof and other
architectural elements.
         e.   Livable outdoor spaces in multi-story buildings that create
pleasing elements and reduce the mass of taller buildings are encouraged.
         f.   Fire department staging areas shall be incorporated into the
design elements of the building.
         g.   New buildings adjacent to residential areas shall be designed to
ensure that building massing and scale provide a transition to adjoining
residential neighborhoods. Possible mitigation techniques include, but are not
limited to, the following:
            (1)   Locating open space and preserving existing vegetation on the
edge of the site to further separate the building from less intensive uses;
            (2)   Stepping down the massing of the building along the site's
edge; and
            (3)   Limiting the length of or articulating building facades to
reflect adjacent residential patterns.
      3.   Landscaping: When abutting the LR, GR or TN zoning districts, a
landscape buffer between the project and the residential property shall be
provided. The buffer shall be at least eight feet (8') wide to create a year
round visual screen of at least six feet (6') in height. The buffer shall be
designed to avoid the appearance of a straight line or wall of uniform plant
material and shall be wide enough to accommodate the planted species when
mature.
   C.   Nonresidential Building Located Within LI, SCI, TI Or A Districts: In
addition to the standards applicable to any nonresidential, multi-family or
mixed use building located within the city of Hailey described in subsection A
of this section, the following design standards also apply to any
nonresidential building located within the LI, SCI, TI or A zoning districts:
      1.   Site Planning:
         a.   Adjoining parcels shall be considered when planning building
configuration, vehicular circulation and access, parking and drainage.
         b.   Reciprocal vehicular ingress and egress, circulation and parking
arrangements are encouraged when the adjacent site(s) allows in order to
facilitate the ease of vehicular movement between adjoining properties.
         c.   Vehicle circulation, parking and loading shall not block
pedestrian accessways.
   D.   Multi-Family Development: In addition to the standards applicable to
any nonresidential, multi-family or mixed use developments located within the
city of Hailey described in subsection A of this section, the following design
standards also apply to multi-family developments located within the City of
Hailey:
      1.   Site Planning:
         a.   The location of buildings shall respond to the specific site
conditions, such as topography, street corners, open space and existing and
planned adjacent uses.
         b.   Site plans shall include a convenient, attractive and
interconnected pedestrian system of sidewalks and shared pathways to reinforce
pedestrian circulation within a site.
         c.   Buildings shall be organized to maximize efficient pedestrian
circulation and create gathering places.

         a.   Buildings shall incorporate massing, group lines and character
that responds to single-family homes. Buildings may also include the use of
varying materials, textures and colors to break up the bulk and mass of large
multi-family buildings. Front doors should be individual and visible from the
street. Windows should be residential in scale and thoughtfully placed to
provide for privacy and solar gain.
         b.   At ground level, buildings shall present a setting that is
visually pleasing to the pedestrian and that encourages human activity and
interaction. (Ord. 1311, 2022; Ord. 1191, 2015)
   E.   Detached Townhouse Development: In addition to the standards applicable
to all nonresidential, multi-family or mixed-use developments located within
the City of Hailey described in subsection A of this section, the following
design standards also apply to detached townhouse developments located within
the City of Hailey:
      Driveway Access: Garages shall be located near the rear of the primary
residence and in no case shall be located less than ten feet (10') behind the
front façade of the residence.
   F.   Cottage Development: In addition to the standards applicable to all
nonresidential, multi-family or mixed-use developments located within the City

street, its front entry porch shall be visible from the street, and the cottage
shall have at least one (1) entry porch, front or secondary, visible from the
common open space.
      3.   Parking And Driveway Location And Design:
         a.   Required off street parking is encouraged to be detached from the
cottage dwelling units and located in a clustered format. Maximum one (1)
attached private, single car garage per dwelling unit is also acceptable,
provided the garage meets all other standards specified in this section.
         b.   Parking shall be located in the same development as the cottage
units.
         c.   Clustered parking areas shall be located to the side or rear of

17.06.090: DESIGN REVIEW GUIDELINES 1  FOR RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS IN TOWNSITE
OVERLAY DISTRICT (TO):
   I.   Purpose
The Hailey townsite design review guidelines have been developed to provide
standards for development in Old Hailey. The term "Old Hailey" means all land
within the townsite overlay district. These design guidelines address the basic
elements of design related to building location, orientation, function and
scale, as well as how the building and improvements relate to the neighborhood.
Subsection IIIA herein outlines the guiding principles that provide a framework
for the detailed guidelines. These design guidelines allow for a wide variety
of building styles, while ensuring that each new building respects the
neighborhood character of Old Hailey. The design guidelines contain some
flexibility to allow for individual solutions to site specific issues.
   II.   Applicability
Proposals for new single-family dwellings, accessory dwelling units, accessory
structures and duplexes and additions thereto that add floor area equal to or
greater than fifty percent (50%) of the original structure will be reviewed for
compliance with these design guidelines. A remodel or alteration of the
exterior of a historic structure that does not add floor area is subject only
to subsection IIIC10 herein.
Guidelines that contain the word "shall" are mandatory. Guidelines that contain
the word "should" are discretionary. Guidelines are in bold type. Some
guidelines contain bulleted sections, also in bold type, which are considered
part of the guideline. Explanatory text is not in bold type and is not meant to
specifically regulate development proposals, but to elaborate on the intent of
the guideline. An example of the formatting of these guidelines is provided
below.
This is the guideline and:
•Bold bullets are considered part of the guideline.
~this further indented bullet is considered part of the guideline also.
This is the guideline.
This is explanatory text.
   III.   Design Guidelines
The design guidelines are organized into sections based on different elements
of building and site design.
   A.   Guiding Principles
The guiding principles serve as a framework for the specific guidelines in this
document. All improvements subject to the design guidelines should address
these guiding principles. They should be used in the review process to ensure
that new proposals meet the overall intent of design guidelines.
      1.   Ensure that new buildings and redevelopment are compatible in terms
of mass and scale with the existing neighborhood and building pattern in Old
Hailey;
      2.   Maintain the scale of buildings as seen from Hailey streets;
      3.   Minimize the visual impact of larger buildings on the neighborhood
and on adjacent properties;
      4.   Encourage the preservation of historic structures;
      5.   Preserve and maintain existing mature trees in Old Hailey;
      6.   Allow for design diversity in terms of style and character by
allowing for approval of alternative design solutions so long as the new styles
meet the spirit and intent of the design guidelines;
      7.   Reduce the visual and functional impact of cars and auto traffic on
Hailey streetscapes, sidewalks and pedestrian areas.
   B.   Hierarchy Of "Neighborhoods"
The design guidelines emphasize neighborhood compatibility in the design
process, and in design solutions. The guidelines do not impose hard boundaries
for the term "neighborhood". The term "neighborhood" may be used in different
contexts. In some cases, "neighborhood" can refer to the buildings immediately
surrounding or on the block. In other cases "neighborhood" can be interpreted
in a broader context to refer to all of Old Hailey. Designs should consider the
appropriateness of these different contexts. In some cases, design solutions
that reflect immediately surrounding buildings may be appropriate, and in other
cases designs that reflect the "best" of Old Hailey may be more suitable.
   C.   Specific Guidelines
      1.   Site Planning
Site planning encompasses a variety of issues related to the platting of the
neighborhoods, building placement on the lot, circulation, light and air, and
solar access. Old Hailey has developed with a distinct grid pattern, with the
original lots in the neighborhood being proportionately shorter along the
street side and rectangular in shape. This lot and block platting pattern has
been reinforced by the alignment of buildings on the lots within that grid. The
creation of alleys in the early platting of Old Hailey allowed service vehicles
to use the back half of the property. This predominant grid pattern has been a
strong influence on the site planning of lots in Old Hailey.
Another key element of site planning is the relationship of the building size
to the lot. Traditionally, buildings in Old Hailey were proportionally smaller
than seen today. A clear front and back yard were visible on the site. The
front of the house was easily recognizable. This pattern of front and back
yards contributed to a fairly consistent sense of open space in the
neighborhoods. This open space makes a valuable contribution to the character
of Old Hailey neighborhoods.
Guideline: The pattern created by the Old Hailey town grid should be respected
in all site planning decisions.
A rectangular lot shape is preferred to a square one, as the rectangular lot
pattern is more in keeping with Old Hailey, and most often results in more
useable and visible open spaces.
Guideline: Site planning for new development and redevelopment shall address
the following:
 
•scale and massing of new buildings consistent with the surrounding
neighborhood;
•building orientation that respects the established grid pattern of Old Hailey;
•clearly visible front entrances;
•use of alleys as the preferred access for secondary uses and automobile
access;
•adequate storage for recreational vehicles;
•yards and open spaces;
•solar access on the site and on adjacent properties where feasible, and where
such decisions do not conflict with other design guidelines;
•snow storage appropriate for the property;
•underground utilities for new dwelling units.
Guideline: The use of energy conserving designs that are compatible with the
character of Old Hailey are encouraged. The visual impacts of passive and
active solar designs should be balanced with other visual concerns outlined in
these design guidelines.
Glass areas should reflect the composition, layout and window to wall ratio of
windows seen traditionally in Old Hailey versus large continuous surfaces of
glass.
Solar energy collection devices should be integrated into the overall building
design.
Designers should be aware of the solar exposures of neighboring properties, and
should, where possible, avoid blocking these exposures with buildings or solar
collectors.
Roof mounted solar collection panels shall not extend above the ridge line of
the roof. They should be integrated into the structure, and as close to the
roof angle as feasible.
Freestanding solar collection panels should be subordinate in size and
placement to the structure they serve, and should generally not be located in
areas visible from the street.
      2.   Bulk Requirements (Mass And Scale, Height, Setbacks)
Bulk requirements are addressed in section
17.04M.060 of the Hailey zoning ordinance. These requirements govern building
height, lot coverage, setbacks and other dimensional standards. The design
guidelines will work in conjunction with the bulk and dimensional parameters
established in the Hailey zoning ordinance.
Historically, larger buildings were located on larger lots, such that these
buildings appeared proportional when compared to surrounding smaller buildings.
While the bulk requirements of the Hailey zoning ordinance will govern the
exact details of building bulk, larger buildings must be carefully designed so
as to meet these design guidelines.
Guideline: The perceived mass of larger buildings shall be diminished by the
design.
The height of taller buildings should be stepped down on the streetside
elevation.
Buildings with greater mass should be broken into smaller modules.
Changes in wall planes and building materials should be used to reduce the
visual impacts of taller buildings.
      3.   Architectural Character
Architectural character is a large part of the charm of Old Hailey. Turn of the
century and later buildings reflect a diversity of styles, building forms,
materials and other elements. At the same time, these buildings are "good
neighbors", having been constructed to be in scale with their surroundings.
These standards are not intended to restrict design styles, but to ensure that
new ideas and styles also respect the scale and elements of the existing
neighborhood.
         a.   General
Guideline: New buildings should be respectful of the past, but may offer new
interpretations of old styles, such that they are seen as reflecting the era in
which they are built.
The design guidelines are not intended to dictate a particular style or era for
new buildings.
Exact replication of old buildings is not the intent of these design
guidelines, so that historic buildings can be appreciated for their own
uniqueness. Designers may draw on the past, without necessarily replicating the
design of old buildings. The use of traditional building forms, scale and broad
design elements is encouraged.
         b.   Building Orientation
Most of the buildings in Old Hailey are oriented to the street. Often the front
door would face the street, with a porch or other visible entry. Keeping a
primary entrance to buildings on the street helps to convey a sense of human
scale, allows a clear identity for emergency access and furthers a "neighborly"
feel.
Guideline: The front entry of the primary structure shall be clearly identified
such that it is visible and inviting from the street.
The use of walkways, porches, smaller roof forms and other design elements is
encouraged to emphasize the location of the front entry.
Guideline: Buildings shall be oriented to respect the existing grid pattern.
Aligning the front wall plane to the street is generally the preferred building
orientation.
In some cases, the front door to a building may be positioned such that it is
perpendicular or at an angle to the street. If so, other design elements such
as the front wall plane, porch element or walkway elements should be used to
help define the front door location, and to respect the overall building
orientation pattern in the neighborhood.
         c.   Building Form
Buildings in Old Hailey were most commonly rectangular in shape. In addition,
the older buildings were generally oriented with the short side facing the
street, and the longer side along the side lot lines. This basic building form
is encouraged in the design guidelines. Some variations may be compatible where
the overall mass and scale of the new building is similar to the other
buildings in the neighborhood.
Guideline: The use of building forms traditionally found in Old Hailey is
encouraged. Forms that help to reduce the perceived scale of buildings shall be
incorporated into the design.
Simple rectangles or a combination of rectangles is encouraged.
Examples of forms that help to reduce the perceived scale include the use of
smaller forms combined together and the use of a smaller building form along
the street.
Less traditional forms should be very carefully planned to respond to the scale
and character of the neighborhood.
         d.   Roof Form
Roofs help define a neighborhood by creating a pattern on the horizon, framing
views to distant areas, and defining light and air between buildings. While a
variety of roof styles are present in Old Hailey, most of these roofs are
pitched roofs with gable elements. Typically, gabled roof slopes were in the
range of 8:12 to 12:12. Ridge lengths were typically a maximum of 40 - 50 feet
in length. This ridge length is an important element in the scale and feel of
Old Hailey neighborhoods.
Guideline: Roof forms shall define the entry to the building, breaking up the
perceived mass of larger buildings, and to diminish garages where applicable.
Garages are preferred to be located off of alleys, as outlined in subsections
C5 and C6 herein. Where the alley option does not exist or is not feasible,
garages on the front of buildings should be diminished by integrating them into
the primary roof form, by offsetting them back from the primary structure, or
by detaching them.
Offsets in eave and ridge lines may be helpful in breaking up building mass.
Guideline: Roof pitch and style shall be designed to meet snow storage needs
for the site.
•Roof pitch materials and style shall retain snow on the roof, or allow snow to
shed safely onto the property, and away from pedestrian travel areas.
•Designs should avoid locating drip lines over key pedestrian routes.
•Where setbacks are less than ten feet (10'), special attention shall be given
to the roof form to ensure that snow does not shed onto adjacent properties.
Guideline: The use of roof forms, roof pitch, ridge length and roof materials
that are similar to those traditionally found in the neighborhood are
encouraged.
Sloping roof forms, including gable and hip roofs, are encouraged.
Dormers and other roof details that do not detract from the primary roof form
are encouraged, but should be used in moderation.
Dormers should stay below the roofline and shall not extend above the roofline
of the building.
Shed roofs, flat roofs and roof pitches under 5:12 may be appropriate in
certain locations.
Ridge lengths should appear similar in scale to those seen in the neighborhood.
A break in the roofline can be used to diminish the impact of longer ridge
lengths.
Guideline: The roof pitch of a new building should be compatible with those
found traditionally in the surrounding neighborhood.
Gable roof pitches in the 8:12 to 12:12 range are encouraged.
         e.   Wall Planes
Wall planes are the walls of buildings as viewed two- dimensionally.
Traditionally, front wall planes in Old Hailey were 25 - 30 feet in width. The
gables ends most often ran parallel to the street. Side wall planes were
typically the longer wall plane. Often these side wall planes were broken up
with either a jog in the building wall, or a pop-out such as a bay window.
Guideline: Primary wall planes should be parallel to the front lot line.
These guidelines consider the front wall plane to be the primary wall plane.
Guideline: Wall planes shall be proportional to the site, and shall respect the
scale of the surrounding neighborhood.
A preference is given towards front wall planes that match the scale of
traditional buildings (25 - 30 feet in width).
If front wall planes exceed the traditional width, a setback or jog in wall
plane should be used to break up the perceived mass.
In general, one-story wall planes may be longer than two-story wall planes,
while still appearing proportional to the site.
Guideline: The use of pop-outs to break up longer wall planes is encouraged.
Side wall planes are typically longer than front wall planes: pop-outs such as
bay windows, chimneys and other architectural elements can be used to break up
these longer wall planes.
         f.   Windows
Windows are a strong design element in the character of Old Hailey buildings.
Diversity and ornamentation in window design add charm, interest and scale to
buildings. Window components that influence design include window proportion,
window placement on the building, the relationship of window space to wall
space, elements that break up the glass such as multi- paned windows, trim
detailing and the type of glass.
Guideline: Windows facing streets are encouraged to be of a traditional size,
scale and proportion.
Consider the position, area and arrangement of windows when designing street
side facades.
Consider the ratio of window opening area to solid wall area when designing
building elevations such that neither dominates.
Multi-paned windows of a vertical orientation are encouraged. As a general
guideline, windows facing streets are encouraged to have a height that is twice
the dimension of the width.
Guideline: Windows on side lot lines adjacent to other buildings should be
carefully planned to respect the privacy of neighbors.
In general, new windows on side lot lines should be located such that they are
not directly opposite windows on neighboring properties.
         g.   Decks And Balconies
Decks and balconies traditionally found in Old Hailey were smaller, subordinate
building design elements. They often faced the street, and avoided overhanging
near neighboring properties.
Guideline: Decks and balconies shall be in scale with the building and the
neighborhood.
Decks and balconies should appear as subordinate elements in terms of scale,
location and detailing.
Guideline: Decks and balconies should be designed with the privacy of neighbors
in mind when possible.
In general, uncovered decks are preferred to be located to the rear of
buildings, while covered porches are preferred to be located in the front of
buildings.
         h.   Building Materials And Finishes
Building materials found in Old Hailey were traditionally log, stone, brick,
shake and wood siding. All of these materials have a "human" scale, which means
the materials are of a recognizable size. Newer materials can also reflect a
sense of human scale and may be appropriate, if they can be designed to break
up wall planes. In addition to the materials, the use of color adds to the
charm and feel of Old Hailey buildings.
Guideline: Materials and colors shall be selected to avoid the look of large,
flat walls. The use of texture and detailing to reduce the perceived scale of
large walls is encouraged.
A change of materials should be used appropriately on the building to help
"ground" the building and to provide a distinction between foundations and
walls. For example, a heavier material such as stone would be appropriate
around the base of a building.
Guideline: Large wall planes shall incorporate more than one material or color
to break up the mass of the wall plane.
Building materials that contribute to a human sense of scale are encouraged.
Examples of materials that convey a human sense of scale include wood siding,
shake siding, brick and stone.
Scoring joints, changes in surface, and the use of trim are other ways to break
up the perceived scale of large walls.
A change of building materials may not be necessary if other design elements
such as bay windows or pop-outs are used to break up wall planes.
         i.   Ornamentation And Architectural Detailing
Ornamentation refers to all of the architectural detailing on the buildings.
Detailing elements include window treatment, trim pieces, sills, headers, knee
braces, posts or columns, shutters, railings, corbels, and other details found
on buildings in Old Hailey. Front porches were also very common, and are an
important design element in old and new buildings alike. Generally speaking,
ornamentation was simple, with one or two of these elements incorporated into
the building design. The ornamentation on the buildings helps establish the
character of the neighborhood.
Guideline: Architectural detailing shall be incorporated into the front wall
plane of buildings.
While ornamentation is encouraged, the use of highly ornamental details not
traditionally found in Old Hailey is not.
Guideline: The use of porches, windows, stoops, shutters, trim detailing and
other ornamentation that is reminiscent of the historic nature of Old Hailey is
encouraged.
Front porches are particularly encouraged. In general, they should be
substantial in size, such that they function as more than just a landing, and
should be covered by a roof.
If front porches must be enclosed to provide a cold entry, the use of windows
and a higher ratio of window to wall surface is encouraged to retain the image
of the old front porch.
Guideline: Architectural details and ornamentation on buildings should be
compatible with the scale and pattern of the neighborhood.
Buildings that draw on historic details without exact copying are preferred.
      4.   Circulation And Parking
Parking and vehicular circulation in Old Hailey has traditionally been designed
to be subordinate to the main house and walk up entrance. Many older houses
have used the alleys for parking and vehicular access needs. Garages that were
located off of the street were typically single car garages, set back from the
main house, with a one car access drive. The standards in this section address
today's needs for vehicle circulation and storage, while respecting the
historic pattern that placed these uses as secondary on the site. Additionally,
pedestrian circulation is an important part of the neighborly feel of the
community and should be encouraged in all design considerations.
Guideline: Safety for pedestrians shall be given high priority in site
planning, particularly with respect to parking, vehicular circulation and snow
storage issues.
Parking areas should be planned with adequate sight distances from sidewalks.
Guideline: The visual impacts of on site parking visible from the street shall
be minimized.
Parking is encouraged to be screened from view with landscaping, fences or low
walls.
Guideline: As a general rule, garages and parking should be accessed from the
alley side of the property and not the street side.
Guideline: Detached garages accessed from alleys are strongly encouraged.
Guideline: When garages must be planned on the street side, garage doors shall
be set back and remain subordinate to the front wall plane.
See also roof form in these guidelines for discussion on the use of roofs to
diminish the impact of garages.
Guideline: When garages and/or parking must be planned on the street side,
parking areas are preferred to be one car in width. When curb cuts must be
planned, they should be shared or minimized.
Guideline: Off street parking space for recreational vehicles should be
developed as part of the overall site planning.
Storage areas for recreational vehicles should be screened from view with
landscaping, fencing or other building walls.
      5.   Alleys
Hailey alleys were platted as part of the original townsite in 1881. They
remain a key component of the character and function of Old Hailey
neighborhoods. Alleys provide a location for utilities, service needs, vehicle
circulation and access to accessory buildings. Often the buildings that were
located off of the alleys were funkier, or quirkier than the primary building
on the site.
Alleys offer a secondary pedestrian route that passes through the "backyards"
of Old Hailey neighborhoods. The guidelines in this section recognize the
importance of alleys in Old Hailey.
Guideline: Alleys shall be retained in site planning. Lot lines generally shall
not be modified in ways that eliminate alley access to properties.
Guideline: Alleys are the preferred location for utilities, vehicular access to
garages, storage areas (including recreational vehicles) and accessory
buildings. Design and placement of accessory buildings that access off of
alleys is encouraged.
Buildings located off of alleys can be quirkier and more unique, reflecting the
eclectic nature of alley buildings in Old Hailey.
Guideline: Generally, the driving surface of alleys within limited residential
and general residential may remain a dust free gravel surface, but should be
paved within business, limited business and transitional. The remainder of the
city alley should be managed for noxious weed control, particularly after
construction activity.
State law requires that noxious weeds be controlled.
Guideline: Landscaping and other design elements adjacent to alleys should be
kept simple, and respect the functional nature of the area and the pedestrian
activity that occurs.
Leave enough space between new landscaping and the alley property line to allow
trees to grow to maturity without encroaching into the public alley right of
way.
      6.   Accessory Structures
Accessory structures are smaller buildings that serve other uses for the
primary residence or the primary use on a property. Old Hailey has many
accessory structures. These smaller buildings were often located off of the
alley, or otherwise designed to complement but not compete with the main house.
Often they were quirkier or more eclectic than the primary building on the
site. These buildings add to the character and charm of the neighborhoods, and
often will break up the scale and mass of building on a site. Accessory
structures in Old Hailey are encouraged to be preserved.
Guideline: Accessory buildings shall appear subordinate to the main building on
the property in terms of size, location and function.
There may be specific instances where accessory structures may have a larger
floor area than the primary structure, such as in the case of an existing small
primary structure that has historic significance, and which is proposed to be
preserved.
Guideline: In general, accessory structures shall be located to the rear of the
lot and off of the alley unless found to be impractical.
      7.   Snow Storage
Snow storage is an important issue in Hailey. Good planning at the initial site
planning stage is needed to ensure pedestrian safety, clear vision triangles
for drivers, adequate parking and walking areas, and that snow does not shed
off of the roof onto neighboring properties.
Guideline: All projects shall be required to provide 25% snow storage on the
site.
For new construction and additions, snow is not permitted to slide onto the
property of others.
Snow storage areas shall be 25% of on-site parking and circulation areas.
Guideline: A snow storage plan shall be developed for every project showing:
•Where snow is stored, key pedestrian routes and clear vision triangles.
•Consideration given to the impacts on adjacent properties when planning snow
storage areas.
      8.   Existing Mature Trees And Landscaping
Mature trees and landscaping are a key component to the character of Old
Hailey. Mature trees are the larger ones, which provide an overhead canopy or
are at a size, age and in good enough condition to be landmarks in the
neighborhood. Old Hailey contains a significant resource in public street trees
found in the city rights of way, many of which are over 50-70 years old. These
city street trees provide a canopy over the streets, separate automobile and
walking areas, and create a pattern of landscaping with their trunks and
branches. Trees and landscaping on private property also contribute
significantly to the character of Old Hailey. They can provide summer shade,
give privacy to buildings, and frame the architecture. The standards in this
section address both public and private trees.
Guideline: Existing mature trees shall be shown on the site plan, with
notations regarding retention, removal or relocation. Unless shown to be
infeasible, a site shall be carefully planned to incorporate existing mature
trees on private property into the final design plan.
Guideline: Attention shall be given to other significant landscape features
which may be present on the site. Mature shrubs, flower beds and other
significant landscape features shall be shown on the site plan and be
incorporated into the site plan where feasible.
Mature shrubs such as lilacs should not be overlooked in site planning.
The use of plant materials that are appropriate for the Hailey climate and
growing season are encouraged.
Drought resistant lawn areas that resemble the traditional lawns of Old Hailey
are encouraged.
Xeriscape plantings in other yard areas are good alternatives for retaining
landscaping while lowering water use.
Berms in front yards are generally discouraged.
Guideline: Noxious weeds shall be controlled according to state law.
      9.   Fences And Walls
Fences are a part of the design character of Old Hailey, with some dating to
the 19th century. In particular, the design of fences in front yards created a
neighborly feel. These older front yard fences were most often constructed with
transparent material types such as wood picket and wrought iron. They were also
lower in height, and had a clearly marked gate.
Guideline: Fences and walls that abut public streets and sidewalks should be
designed to include fence types that provide some transparency, lower heights
and clearly marked gates.
Fence heights are regulated by the Hailey zoning ordinance.
Guideline: Retaining walls shall be in scale to the streetscape.
Streetside retaining walls should be lower in height, or broken up to avoid the
look of a large wall.
      10.   Historic Structures
Hailey citizens have stated that the older buildings in town greatly contribute
to the cultural heritage and the overall character of the community. In
addition to the guidelines below, the Hailey arts and historic preservation
commission plays a key role in the demolition and remodeling of historic
structures. Careful consideration should be given to the removal of historic
structures in Old Hailey.
Definitions. For the purpose of this section 10, the terms set forth below have
the following definitions:
ADAPTIVE REUSE: The modification of an existing building (most typically a
single-family dwelling) for use as either an office or a multi-family dwelling
unit or a historic institutional use or the conversion of any such structure
back to its original use.
CONGRUOUS: The sensitivity of a development proposal in maintaining the
character of existing development. Elements affecting congruousness include,
but are not limited to, whether the form, texture, height, mass and bulk of
alterations or additions are in agreement, harmony, and coherence with and
correspond to the setting and the townsite overlay district. Congruous,
compatible and harmonious are used as synonyms.
CONTRIBUTING: A contributing building, site, structure or object adds to the
historic architectural qualities, historic associations or archeological values
for which a property is significant because either: a) it was present during
the period of significance, and possesses historic integrity reflecting its
character at that time or is capable of yielding important information about
the period; or b) it independently meets the criteria of the national register
of historic places.
PERIODS OF SIGNIFICANCE: The time periods are as follows:
      1.   1855-1890 settlement/territorial;
      2.   1890-1904 early statehood;
      3.   1904-1920 Beginning of the new century;
      4.   1920-1940 Inter-war/great depression.
Time periods after 1940 are considered World War II and premodern, and modern.
Buildings and structures built after 1940 are not subject to the guidelines
contained in this subsection C10.
General Guidelines: Any alteration to the exterior of a historic structure
requiring design review approval shall meet the following guidelines:
•The alteration should be congruous with the historical, architectural,
archeological, educational or cultural aspects of other historic structures
within the townsite overlay district, especially those originally constructed
in the same period of significance.
•The alteration shall be contributing to the townsite overlay district.
Adaptive reuse of historic structures is supported while maintaining the
architectural integrity of the original structure.
 
Specific Guidelines: Any alteration to the exterior of a historic structure
requiring design review approval shall meet the following specific guidelines:
•The design features of repairs and remodels, including the general
streetscape, materials, windows, doors, porches, and roofs shall not diminish
the integrity of the original structure.
•New additions should be designed to be recognizable as a product of their own
period of significance with the following guidelines related to the historical
nature of the original structure:
~The addition should not destroy or obscure important architectural features of
the original building and/or the primary facade;
~Exterior materials that are compatible with the original building materials
should be selected;
~The size and scale of the addition should be compatible with the original
building, with the addition appearing subordinate to the primary building;
~The visual impact of the addition should be minimized from the street;
~The mass and scale of the rooftop on the addition should appear subordinate to
the rooftop on the original building, and should avoid breaking the roofline of
the original building;
~The roof form and slope of the roof on the addition should be in character
with the original building;
~The relationship of wall planes to the street and to interior lots should be
preserved with new additions.

17.08B.010: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   The unique character, landscapes and scenic vistas of Hailey are among
its most valuable assets. Preserving and promoting those assets are essential
to the long range social and economic well being of the city and its
inhabitants. Protecting these assets requires sensitive placement and design of
wireless communication facilities so that these facilities remain in scale and
harmony with the existing character of the community.
   B.   This article is intended to provide reasonable standards and procedures
for the development of PWSFs and WCFs that will serve citizens, the traveling
public, and others within the city in order to:
      1.   Preserve the character, viability and property values of areas which
are in close proximity to PWSFs or WCFs by minimizing the adverse impacts of
such facilities and protecting the public safety through careful location,
siting, design and screening thereof;
      2.   Protect the health, safety and welfare of persons living or working
in the area surrounding such PWSFs or WCFs from possible adverse impacts
(within the confines of the federal telecommunications act of 1996) relating to
the placement, construction or modification of such facilities;
      3.   Provide development that is compatible in appearance with allowed
uses of the underlying zoning district in which such facilities are placed;
      4.   Promote the public welfare by facilitating the city's permitting
process to encourage fair and meaningful competition among providers of
wireless facilities and, to the greatest extent possible, extend to all Hailey
citizens high quality wireless communication services at reasonable costs;
      5.   Encourage the use of existing structures for PWSFs or WCFs where
appropriate;
      6.   Encourage PWSFs or WCFs that have the least impact on, and the
greatest compatibility with, the character of the community, surrounding land
uses and the general public health, safety and welfare;
      7.   Encourage the joint use and clustering of antenna sites and
structures, when practical, to help reduce the number of such facilities which
may be required in the future to service the needs of customers, thereby
averting the unnecessary proliferation of facilities on private and public
property;
      8.   Provide necessary public safety radio communication infrastructure
to ensure the health, safety and general welfare of the public. (Ord. 1191,
2015)

Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall
be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to
give this section its most reasonable application:
AREA LIGHT: A luminaire equipped with a lamp that produces over one thousand
eight hundred (1,800) lumens. Area lights include, but are not limited to,
streetlights, parking lot lights and yard lights. (See section
17.08C.040.05, table 1 of this article for light output of various lamps.)

situation (with snow cover if that is to be expected in the given situation)
measured at ground level with the light meter placed parallel to the ground.
BUILDING OFFICIAL: The city of Hailey building official.
EIGHTY FIVE DEGREE CUTOFF TYPE OF LUMINAIRES: Luminaires that do not allow
light to escape above an eighty five degree (85o) angle measured from a
vertical line from the center of the lamp extended to the ground (see section
17.08C.040.05, figure 2 of this article).
EXTERIOR LIGHTING: Temporary or permanent lighting that is installed, located
or used in such a manner to cause light rays to shine outdoors. Luminaires that
are indoors that are intended to light something outside are considered
exterior lighting for the purpose of this article.
FLOODLIGHT: A lamp that produces up to one thousand eight hundred (1,800)
lumens and is designed to flood a well defined area with light. (See section
17.08C.040.05, table 1 of this article for light output of various lamps.)
FOOT-CANDLE (FC): The American unit used to measure the total amount of light
cast on a surface (illuminance). One foot- candle is equivalent to the
illuminance produced by a source of one candle at a distance of one foot (1').
For example, the full moon produces .01 s; s are measured with a light meter.
One foot-candle is approximately equal to ten (10) lux, the British unit used
to measure illuminance.
FULL CUTOFF LUMINAIRES: A luminaire designed and installed where no light is
emitted at or above a horizontal plane running through the lowest point on the
luminaire (see section
17.08C.040.05, figure 1 of this article).
FULLY SHIELDED: The luminaire incorporates a solid barrier (the shield), which
permits no light to escape through the barrier (see section
17.08C.040.05, figure 4 of this article).
GLARE: Stray, unshielded light striking the eye that may result in: a) nuisance
or annoyance glare, such as light shining into a window; b) discomfort glare,
such as bright light causing squinting of the eyes; c) disabling glare, such as
bright light reducing the ability of the eyes to see into shadows; or d)
reduction of visual performance.

energy efficiency and life span compared to traditional lamp types.
LED (LIGHT EMITTING DIODE) LIGHTING: A semiconductor light source available
across the visible, ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths, capable of producing
a greater number of lumens per watt and having a longer life span compared to
traditional lamp types.
LAMP: The generic term for an artificial light source, to be distinguished from
the whole assembly (see definition of Luminaire). Commonly referred to as
"bulb".
LIGHT: The form of radiant energy acting on the retina of the eye to make sight
possible.

LIGHTING ADMINISTRATOR: A city official designated by the planning and zoning
administrator to administer, interpret and enforce the Hailey outdoor lighting
ordinance, and make recommendations thereunder.
LUMEN: The unit used to quantify the amount of light energy produced by a lamp
at the lamp. Lumen output of most lamps is listed on the packaging. For
example, a sixty (60) watt incandescent lamp produces nine hundred fifty (950)
lumens, while a fifty five (55) watt low pressure sodium lamp produces eight
thousand (8,000) lumens.
LUMINAIRE: A complete lighting unit, consisting of a lamp or lamps, together
with the parts designed to distribute the light, to position and protect the
lamps and to connect the lamps to the power. When used, includes ballasts and
photocells. Commonly referred to as "fixture".
MAINTAINED ILLUMINANCE: The condition that occurs after two hundred (200) hours
of lamp use prior to a point where luminaire cleaning is necessary.
Measurements are taken at ground level with sensor parallel to the ground for
horizontal illuminance and measured at five feet (5') aboveground with sensor
perpendicular to the ground for vertical illuminance.
NONESSENTIAL LIGHTING: Lighting that is not necessary for an intended purpose
after the purpose has been served. Does not include any lighting used for
safety and/or public circulation purposes.
PARTIALLY SHIELDED: The luminaire incorporates a translucent barrier, the
"partial shield" around the lamp that allows some light to pass through the
barrier while concealing the lamp from the viewer (See section
17.08C.040.05, figure 3 of this article).
PLANNING AND ZONING ADMINISTRATOR: The city of Hailey planning and zoning
administrator.

   A.   Energy Efficiency:   LED, induction or some other form of energy
efficient lighting should be used whenever possible.
   B.   Walkways: Illuminance levels for parking lots, sidewalks and other
walkways affected by side mounted building lights, and freestanding sidewalk
lights (not streetlights) shall not exceed illuminance levels listed in the
most current IESNA recommended practices. The city of Hailey recognizes that
not every such area will require lighting or lighting to the extent recommended
by the most current IESNA recommended practices.
   C.   Parking Lots: Parking lot lighting shall not exceed an overall average
illumination of one and five-tenths (1.5) foot-candles.
   D.   Streetlights: Streetlights shall be high pressure sodium, low pressure
sodium or metal halide, or a more energy efficient type. All streetlights
within all zoning districts shall be a maximum of one hundred (100) watts hps,
or have a maximum lumen output of nine thousand five hundred (9,500), except
lights at traffic signal controlled intersections on state highways shall be a
maximum of two hundred fifty (250) watts hps, or a maximum lumen output of
twenty seven thousand five hundred (27,500). If a light type other than high
pressure sodium is used, then the equivalent output shall be the maximum for
the other light type (see section
17.08C.040.05, table 1 of this article). LED and induction lights do not have
an equivalent lumens output compared to traditional light types found in
section
17.08C.040.05, table 1 of this article; therefore, the number of foot-candles
shall not exceed those compared to the initial lumens of existing compliant
streetlights with the same placement height.
   E.   Light Trespass: All existing and/or new exterior lighting shall not
cause light trespass and shall protect adjacent properties from glare and
excessive lighting. (Ord. 1191, 2015)
17.08C.040.05: TABLES AND INFORMATION SHEETS:
The figures and information sheets shall be incorporated into this article as
guidelines for the public and the city. The city does not endorse or
discriminate against any manufacturer or company that may be shown, portrayed
or mentioned by the examples.

SECTION:
17.08D.010: Purpose and Intent
17.08D.020: Applicability
17.08D.030: General Provisions
17.08D.040: Registration Required
17.08D.050: Occupancy Restrictions - Short Term Occupancy
17.08D.060: Subordinate Scale and Size
17.08D.070: Livability
17.08D.080: Tiny Homes On Wheels
17.08D.010: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   Purpose: The City of Hailey recognizes that land use, population
growth, and community character are interrelated, and that social well-being
and diversity are tied to the availability of an array of housing types and
sizes available for sale and for rent at various price points. Accessory
dwelling units and tiny homes on wheels, when thoughtfully designed, can
simultaneously complement the fabric of existing neighborhoods, increase the
supply of available housing, and sustainably accommodate population growth.
The purpose of this section is to address supplemental design and quality of
life for accessory dwelling units and tiny homes on wheels with the intent of
reinforcing the preceding and following statements, which are reflective of
statements and goals expressed in the comprehensive plan:
      1.   Hailey is a community that believes livability and quality of life
can be maintained and enhanced only with strong, diverse residential
neighborhoods. Further, the community recognizes its identity to include being
a place primarily comprised of full-time residents and being a community where
the workforce can reside.
      2.   The City of Hailey seeks to accommodate population growth in a
balanced manner, with "infill" development and redevelopment of existing lands
in City limits being two strategies. Accessory dwelling units and tiny homes on
wheels provide opportunities for infill development and redevelopment.
      3.   Many social benefits are realized when workers live in their own
community. Quality of life and safety improve when critical care employees live
within close responding distance. Children do better in school when parents are
at home in the mornings and evenings. Homeowners are more active in their
communities, creating a greater vibrancy and sense of unity.
      4.   Accessory dwelling units and tiny homes on wheels add to the
diversity of housing unit types, additionally supporting the flexibility and
convenience for residents seeking housing within the City. (Ord. 1320, 2023;
Ord. 1275, 2021)
17.08D.020: APPLICABILITY:
The standards of this section apply to all accessory dwelling units created
after February 10, 2021, whether created by new construction, addition, or
conversion of an existing building or area within an existing building; and to

principal building or may be located within a detached accessory building.
Detached accessory dwelling units may comprise the entirety of the accessory
building or may comprise part of the floor area of an accessory building with
another permitted accessory use or uses comprising the remaining floor area.
   B.   Only one (1) accessory dwelling unit or one tiny home on wheels is
permitted on a lot, as an accessory to a single-family dwelling unit.
   C.   Accessory dwelling units and tiny homes on wheels are only permitted in
conjunction with single-family residences in residential zones. In the Townsite
Overlay, Transitional and SCI zones accessory dwelling units are permitted in
conjunction with commercial buildings. In Business, Limited Business and
Neighborhood Business one (1) or more residential unit(s) are considered mixed-
use.
   D.   Accessory dwelling units and tiny homes on wheels in the Special Flood
Hazard Area (SFHA) shall have the top of the lowest floor elevated no lower
than the flood protection elevation as defined in section

(Ord. 1191, 2015)
17.09.040.06: EXCESS OF PERMITTED PARKING:
   A.   Approval Required: No use shall provide on site parking for more than
two hundred percent (200%) of the number of spaces required by this chapter
unless permitted by specific action of the commission. Applications for parking
in excess of that normally permitted will be heard by the commission as part of
other applications, or, where no other application is pertinent, under the
notice and hearing procedures set forth for design review.
   B.   Criteria: The commission shall consider the following criteria when
evaluating any application for parking in excess of that normally permitted.
Applicants are required to satisfy at least four (4) of the following criteria:
      1.   The excess parking area will be commonly used for public interests
such as park and ride or carpool lots. The property owner will be permitted to
reserve the use of the parking area twelve (12) days in any calendar year.
      2.   The excess parking area provided would relieve or help to relieve a
substantial shortage of parking within an eight hundred foot (800') radius.
      3.   The excess parking area will not be adjacent to a public right of
way, and will be separated from the right of way by a building.
      4.   The excess parking area is part of an overall development scheme
which compensates for insufficient parking in other portions of the same
development.
      5.   The excess parking area will be used as an alternate facility, such
as a basketball court or skateboard park, when not in use as an overflow
parking area. The property owner will be permitted to reserve the use of the
parking area twelve (12) days in any calendar year.
      6.   The excess parking area will surfaced with an alternative and
attractive material. (Ord. 1191, 2015)
17.09.040.07: BICYCLE PARKING:
All multi-family residential, commercial, or mixed-use development, including
new construction and additions, shall provide at least three (3) bicycle
parking spaces or bicycle spaces equivalent to twenty five percent (25%) of the
required number of vehicle parking spaces, whichever is greater. (Ord. 1336,
2023; Ord. 1191, 2015)
17.09.040.08: SHARED PARKING:
   A.   Shared Parking Program: Notwithstanding any other parking requirements
set forth in this chapter, a mixed use shared parking program ("shared parking
program") may be applied where mixed uses are proposed or existing, and the mix
of uses creates staggered peak periods of parking demand. A shared parking
program allows the property developer to use parking spaces more efficiently by
allowing the same spaces to be "shared" by various land uses, thus reducing the
total amount of required parking. A shared parking program may include parking
on the same site or different sites subject to the provisions herein. Shared
parking is not intended to be used by two (2) or more residential uses or other
uses which have the same peak demand.
   B.   Conditions: The commission may approve a shared parking program;
provided that: 1) pedestrian access is provided to and from the parking area
and the building; and 2) all other requirements set forth herein are met.
   C.   Reserved Spaces; Handicap Accessible Spaces: Parking spaces that are
reserved for a specific business purpose (e.g., reserved for doctors only)
shall not be counted toward meeting the shared parking requirements. Handicap
accessible spaces may be shared if they meet the requirements of the IBC and
ANSI A117.1.
   D.   Feasibility; Maximum Reduction: Those wishing to apply for a shared
parking program must demonstrate to the commission the feasibility of shared
parking in accordance with this section. The maximum reduction in the number of
parking spaces required for all uses sharing the parking area shall be twenty
percent (20%), unless otherwise provided by subsection F of this section.
   E.   Location On Different Lot Than Use: Shared parking spaces may be
located on a different lot than the use, which it serves only where the
following conditions are met:
      1.   The parking is located no more than three hundred feet (300') from
the use that it serves. The distance between the use and the parking lot shall
be measured following a reasonable and safe walking route from the main
entrance of the use to the nearest parking lot;
      2.   The applicant(s) for a building permit or certificate of occupancy
for the use which is to be served by a shared parking program shall submit a
copy of a written agreement pursuant to subsection H of this section, along
with his or her application for such permit or certificate.
   F.   Shared Parking Study: Determination of the shared parking requirements
may be determined by the applicant using the parking calculation methods set
forth in subsection G of this section, or the commission, in its sole and
absolute discretion may allow shared parking arrangements based upon a more
detailed study which clearly establishes which uses will utilize the shared
spaces at different times of the day, week, month or year. A more detailed
study may:
      1.   Be based on the urban land institute's or another accredited
methodology;
      2.   Address the size and type of activities, the composition of tenants,
the rate of turnover for proposed shared spaces and the anticipated peak
parking and traffic loads.
   G.   Parking Credit Schedule Chart For Mixed Use Shared Parking Calculation:
The minimum number of parking spaces required for a shared parking plan may be
determined by multiplying the minimum parking requirements for each individual
use by appropriate percentage, as set forth in table 1 of this section, for
each of the five (5) designated time periods, and then add the resulting sums
from each vertical column. The column total having the highest total value is
the minimum shared parking space requirement for that combination of land uses.

   H.   Agreement For Shared Parking Plan: The developer(s) applying for a
shared parking program in accordance with this section shall submit a written
agreement approved by the city attorney requiring that the parking spaces shall
be maintained as long as the uses requiring the parking exist or unless the
required parking is provided elsewhere in accordance with the provisions of
this section. Such written agreement shall be recorded by the developer(s) with
the Blaine County recorder prior to the issuance of a building permit or
business license if no building permit is necessary, and a copy filed in the
project review file. The agreement shall, at a minimum:
      1.   List the names and ownership interest of all parties to the
agreement and contain the signatures of those parties;
      2.   Provide a legal description of the land upon which the parking area
(s) and building(s) appurtenant to the parking areas are located;
      3.   Include a site plan showing the area of the parking parcel and open
space reserved area which would provide for future parking;
      4.   Agree and expressly declare the intent for the covenant to run with
the land and bind all parties and all successors in interest to the covenant;
      5.   Assure the continued availability of the spaces for joint use and
provide assurance that all spaces will be usable to all participating uses;
      6.   Describe the obligations of each party, including the maintenance
responsibility to retain and develop reserved open space for additional parking
spaces if the need arises;
      7.   Describe the method by which the covenant may be revised, if
necessary.
   I.   Change In Use: In the event a use is changed, the application for the
new business license related to the changed use must be accompanied by evidence
that the parking necessary for the new uses does not exceed the amount that was
required by the previous uses, or that the applicant can satisfy the parking
requirements existing at that time. (Ord. 1191, 2015)
17.09.050: IN LIEU CONTRIBUTIONS:
17.09.050.01: PURPOSE:
In lieu parking contributions are hereby created to allow the city to waive
parking requirements set forth in this chapter in exchange for the payment of
fees to the parking improvement fund. (Ord. 1191, 2015)

17.11.040.02: SMALL SCALE WIND ENERGY SYSTEMS (WEC):
For small scale wind energy systems, the commission or hearing examiner shall
review the particular facts and circumstances of each proposed conditional use
in terms of the standards below. The applicant for any WEC has the burden of
demonstrating compliance with these standards and if required by the building
official, shall obtain a building permit prior to installing any WEC.
   A.   Roof Mounted Height: The height of roof mounted WECs shall not exceed
ten feet (10') beyond the maximum building height requirement for the
applicable district. The measured height shall include the entire system,
including the blade radius.
   B.   Engineer Stamp: Any plan for a roof mounted WEC shall be stamped by a
structural engineer.
   C.   Rotor Diameter: The rotor diameter shall not exceed seven feet (7') for
a freestanding or roof mounted system.
   D.   Wind Speed: The average wind speed shall meet or exceed the minimum
required by the small scale wind energy system manufacturer's specification.
Wind speed information shall be measured by an anemometer at the height and
location of the proposed WEC.
   E.   Freestanding Height: The height of freestanding WECs shall not exceed
the maximum building height requirement for the applicable district.
   F.   Number Freestanding: Freestanding WECs are limited to one per lot(s)
held in single ownership.
   G.   Setback: Minimum setback of freestanding WECs is two (2) times the
tower height from the property line, measured from the tallest point of WEC.
This standard does not apply to roof mounted systems.
   H.   Noise: Any WEC shall comply with the maximum permissible noise level.
Every use shall be operated such that the noise level produced does not
inherently and recurrently exceed twenty (20) decibels beyond ambient noise
levels, during the hours of seven o'clock (7:00) A.M. to seven o'clock (7:00)
P.M., or ten (10) decibels beyond ambient noise level decibels during the hours
of seven o'clock (7:00) P.M. to seven o'clock (7:00) A.M. During the hours of
seven o'clock (7:00) A.M. to seven o'clock (7:00) P.M., the noise levels
permitted may increase a maximum of five (5) decibels for a period not to
exceed fifteen (15) minutes in any one hour.
      1.   Measurement Along Property Boundary: Noise levels shall be measured
at any point along any boundary line of the property on which the use is
located.
      2.   Measurement Along Property Owner's Building Wall: Where there is
more than one property ownership in a building (e.g., a condominium or attached
townhome), the noise levels shall be measured along any adjacent wall of a
property owner.
   I.   Vibration: Any WEC shall generate no perceptible vibration. Every use
shall be operated so that it does not inherently and recurrently generate a
ground vibration that is perceptible, without instruments, at any point along
any boundary line of the property on which the use is located. Where there is
more than one property ownership in a building (e.g., a condominium or attached
townhome), this standard shall be measured along any adjacent wall of a
property owner.
   J.   Alternative Locations: Alternative locations and placement within the
subject property shall be evaluated to ensure that the placement of any WEC is
optimal to minimize visual impacts to adjacent properties and viewsheds while
still maintaining access to the site's wind resource. (Ord. 1191, 2015)

17.12.010: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Authority: The commission or hearing examiner may authorize in specific
cases a variance from the terms of this title as will not be contrary to the
public interest, where, owing to unique physical and topographical conditions,
such as steepness of slope or other conditions applying to a lot or building,
the strict application of the zoning regulations will deprive the property of
privileges enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity and under the same
zoning classification. A variance is a modification of the requirements of this
title as to lot size, lot coverage, width, depth, front, side and rear yard
setbacks, parking spaces, height of buildings, or other ordinance provisions
affecting the size or shape of a structure or the placement of the structure
upon lots, or the size of lots.
   B.   Permitted, Nonconforming Uses Not Considered: Permitted or
nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures or buildings in other
districts shall not be considered grounds for issuance of a variance.
   C.   Issuance Not Precedent: The issuance of a variance shall not be
considered a precedent for the issuance of other variances.
   D.   Convenience, Right Or Privilege Not Consideration: Variances shall not
be granted on the grounds of convenience and shall not be considered a right or
special privilege.

      7.   Unique physical characteristics of the lot or building that
constitute the undue hardship.
      8.   Diagrams and plot plans as requested by the administrator showing
the nature and extent of the proposed variance.
      9.   Shadow pattern showing the effect on neighbor's solar access, if
applicable.
      10.   A list of the names and addresses of all property owners within
three hundred feet (300') of the subject property.

The commission or hearing examiner shall review the application for variance
from this title and shall approve, conditionally approve or deny the variance
application. A variance shall not be considered a right or special privilege,
but may be granted to an applicant only upon a showing of undue hardship
because of characteristics of the site and that the variance is not in conflict
with the public interest. Before any variance can be granted, the commission or
hearing examiner must make all of the following findings:
   A.   The variance, when granted, will not conflict with, or cause or allow
any situation which is in conflict with, any existing federal, state or local
law, or which may result in injury to the public.

and will be substantially deprived, by ordinance, of the privileges legally
enjoyed by property owners of property within the vicinity of the subject
property. (Ord. 1191, 2015)
17.12.050: ACTION:
   A.   Uses Not Permissible: Under no circumstances shall the commission or
hearing examiner grant a variance to allow a use not permissible under the
terms of this title in the district involved, or any use expressly or by
implication prohibited by the terms of this title.
   B.   Decision: The commission or hearing examiner shall make a decision to
approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the application within fifteen
(15) days after conclusion of the public hearing and issue its decision,
together with the reasons therefor. The commission or hearing examiner shall
review the application, all supporting documents and plans, and recommendations
of city staff in making their decision. (Ord. 1191, 2015)

commission or hearing examiner in accordance with section
17.03.050 of this title.
   B.   New Application Upon Denial: If the city denies an application, the
applicant or his successor in interest may not file a new application for
substantially the same variance for a period of one year from the date the
hearing examiner or commission, or council in the case of an appeal, takes
action. (Ord. 1191, 2015)
17.12.070: EXPIRATION:
   A.   Specified: A variance which is not used within the time specified in
the permit, or if no time is specified, within one year after the permit is
granted, is void.
   B.   Discontinuance Of Use: A variance is void six (6) months after the use
for which it is issued is discontinued. (Ord. 1191, 2015)

17.13.070: Discontinuance Of Use
17.13.080: Repair
17.13.090: Restoration
17.13.010: INTENT:
It is the intent of this chapter to allow the continuation of nonconforming
uses and buildings existing at the time of adoption of the ordinance codified
herein and legal uses which become nonconforming by adoption of this title, but
not to encourage their survival or allow an increase in size or intensity of
nonconforming uses. (Ord. 1191, 2015)
17.13.020: NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD:
   A.   Permitted: Where an individual lot was held in separate ownership from
adjoining properties or was platted in a recorded subdivision approved by the
council prior to the effective date hereof and fails to meet the requirements
for area or width or both, that are generally applicable in the district, such
lot may be occupied according to the permitted uses provided for in the zoning
district, provided all other regulations, including setbacks, for the district
are met. No multi-family project shall be developed on any lot or property
smaller than the minimum area required by this title.
   B.   Buildings On Undersized Lots: In all zoning districts, a building on an
undersized lot of record at the effective date hereof shall not be considered a
nonconforming building, provided the building meets all other bulk and setback
requirements in that district.
   C.   Undivided Parcels: If two (2) or more lots or a combination of lots and
portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at
the time of adoption of the ordinance codified herein and if all or part of the
lots with no buildings do not meet the requirements established for lot width
and area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for
the purposes of this title and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold
in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements
established by this title, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which
creates a lot with a width or area below the requirements stated in this title.
(Ord. 1191, 2015)
17.13.030: CONTINUATION OF USE:
A nonconforming use may be continued, subject to the provisions of this
chapter. (Ord. 1191, 2015)

A nonconforming use may be changed only to a conforming use. (Ord. 1191, 2015)
17.13.050: EXPANSION OF USE:
A nonconforming use may not be enlarged or extended, including, without
limitation, any increase in the total amount of space devoted to the
nonconforming use, thereby increasing the degree of nonconformity. Criteria
used to determine enlargement or extension shall include, but not be limited
to, areas of land covered, square footage of building or use space, number of
dwelling units, hours of operation, traffic generated and volume of goods
handled. A nonconforming use shall not be used as justification for adding
other structures or uses prohibited in the same district. A nonconforming use
may not be extended to additional buildings or to land outside the original
building. (Ord. 1191, 2015)
17.13.060: EXPANSION OF NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS:
A nonconforming building may not be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, moved or
structurally altered so as to increase the degree of nonconformity. A
nonconforming building may be enlarged so long as the enlargement does not
create new nonconformities with respect to such matters as setbacks and parking
requirements. Minor repair, as defined in section
17.13.080 of this chapter, of nonconforming buildings is allowed. (Ord. 1191,
2015)
17.13.070: DISCONTINUANCE OF USE:
   A.   Six Months: If active and continuous operations of a nonconforming use
are not carried on during a continuous period of six (6) months, the tract of
land where such a nonconforming use previously existed shall thereafter be used
only for a conforming use. Intent to resume active operations shall not be
considered active and continuous operations.
   B.   Manufactured Homes Removed: Notwithstanding the provisions of this
chapter, if a nonconforming manufactured home is removed from the tract of land
on which it was located, said tract of land shall thereafter be occupied by
only a conforming use. (Ord. 1191, 2015)
17.13.080: REPAIR:
On any nonconforming structure, or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs or on repair or
replacement of nonbearing wall fixtures, wiring or plumbing; provided, that the
repair does not increase the degree of nonconformity of the use or building as
described in sections 17.13.050 and
17.13.060 of this chapter. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent
the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part
thereof declared to be unsafe by the city building inspector upon order of such
official. (Ord. 1191, 2015)
17.13.090: RESTORATION:
   A.   Permitted: A nonconforming building (not to include buildings
continuing a nonconforming use) which has been damaged, partially destroyed or
completely destroyed, either by fire or other calamity or natural causes or by
intentional demolition by the owner of said building, may be rebuilt so long as
the repaired or rebuilt building in no way increases the degree of
nonconformity, including nonconformity with respect to such matters as setbacks
and parking requirements. Any enlargement of such a nonconforming building
shall not increase the degree of any nonconformity, and shall also meet the
requirements of section
17.13.060 of this chapter, with regard to prohibition against the creation of
any new nonconformities. The height of the repaired or reconstructed building
shall not exceed the height of the building that existed prior to repair or
reconstruction unless design review approval for a building with an increased
height has been granted by the commission.
   B.   Destroyed Nonconforming Manufactured Home: Notwithstanding the
provisions of subsection A of this section, a nonconforming manufactured home
used as the residence of the owner which is destroyed by fire or natural causes
may be replaced with a manufactured home having the same overall dimensions as
the previously existing manufactured home; provided, that such replacement
occurs within three (3) months of the calamity, and provided the new
manufactured home meets the current minimum requirements for a manufactured
home. (Ord. 1191, 2015)

fact on the following criteria:
      1.   The proposed amendment is in accordance with the comprehensive plan;
      2.   Essential public facilities and services are available to support
the full range of proposed uses without creating excessive additional
requirements at public cost for the public facilities and services;
      3.   The proposed uses are compatible with the surrounding area; and
      4.   The proposed amendment will promote the public health, safety and
general welfare.
   B.   Rezones: When evaluating any proposed zoning ordinance map amendment to
rezone property to business (B) zoning district, limited business (LB) zoning
district or transitional (TN) zoning district, the hearing examiner or
commission and council shall consider the following:
      1.   Vacancy rates of existing buildings and land within the existing
business (B), limited business (LB) or transitional (TN) zoning districts. A
lower vacancy rate will favor a rezone, while a higher vacancy rate will not
favor a rezone.

overlay district boundary. A shorter distance from the central core overlay
district boundary will favor a rezone, while a longer distance from the central
core overlay district boundary will not favor a rezone. (Ord. 1191, 2015)
17.14.070: RESUBMISSION OF APPLICATION:
No application for amendment which has been denied by the council shall be
resubmitted in either substantially the same form or with reference to

made which has resulted in a change in conditions applying to the specific land
under consideration. (Ord. 1191, 2015)
17.14.080: ZONING MAP AMENDMENT PURSUANT TO DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT:
   A.   Permitted: A zoning ordinance map amendment, as defined in subsection

of the property to be rezoned making a commitment concerning the use or
development of the subject parcel. Any such written commitment shall be made in
accordance with Idaho Code section 67-6511A and may be made as part of a
development agreement entered into between the city and the owner or developer.
   B.   Recording Required: Commitments, whether part of a development
agreement or not, shall be recorded in the office of the Blaine County recorder
and shall take effect upon the adoption of the zoning ordinance map amendment.
Unless modified or terminated by the council, any such commitment shall be
binding upon the owner of the property, each subsequent owner, and each other
person acquiring an interest in the subject property.
   C.   Modifications: A commitment may be modified only by permission of the
council after compliance with the notice and hearing requirements of Idaho Code
section 67-6509, as amended. A commitment may be terminated, and the zoning
designation upon which it was based reversed, upon failure of the requirements
in the commitment after a reasonable time as determined by the council, or upon
failure of the owner or developer, each subsequent owner, or each other person
acquiring an interest in the subject property, to comply with the conditions in
the commitment, and after the council complies with the notice and hearing
provisions of Idaho Code section 67-6509, as amended. A written commitment

recommendation by the hearing examiner or commission shall be heard by the
council as a de novo hearing at the next available regular council meeting
after the commission's findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommendation
are signed by the commission. In the event the hearing examiner's or
commission's action on the underlying zoning or subdivision application is a
final decision, the hearing examiner's or commission's decision on the
application for infrastructure project is final.

request that five (5) sets of final construction plans be delivered to the city
at least one week prior to a preconstruction meeting.
      3.   Any work, which will affect the movement or safety of vehicles,
bicycles or pedestrians, will require submittal of a traffic control plan at

A street's classification may be revised if the typical daily volume changes
over time or may be revised based on reasonable anticipated uses which would
use the street.
   B.   Street Type: Streets within the city are categorized as business,
residential or transition. A street's type may be revised if the zoning changes
over time or may be revised based on reasonable anticipated zoning changes.
   C.   Street Designations: Streets within the city may be designated as truck
routes, school connections or bicycle corridors. A street's designation may be
revised if the city of Hailey transportation master plan (TMP) changes over
time or may be revised based on reasonable anticipated changes to the TMP.
   D.   Special Designations:
      1.   Bicycle Corridors:
         a.   The streets designated as bicycle corridor streets provide
connection to other bicycle facilities, are preferred routes for bicyclists or
provide connection to destinations such as a park, school, other neighborhoods
or a commercial area. These streets should be improved with a sharrow or
bicycle lane and signed as bicycle routes as funds become available and
allocated by council.
         b.   Signed bicycle routes:
            (1) Bicycle corridors should be signed as bicycle routes when the
following criteria are met:
   (A) Shoulder or lane widths meet or exceed minimum shared lane widths;
   (B) Street parking has been removed or restricted in areas of limited width
to provide improved safety for bicyclists; and
   (C) A smooth surface has been provided, including, but not limited to,
bicycle safe drainage grates and potholes filled.
            (2) Signs should be placed every five hundred meters (500 m) (1/
4 mile), at every turn and at signalized intersections.
            (3) Signs shall meet MUTCD standards and include supplemental
destination plates, to inform cyclists of route continuity and major
destinations and attractions, such as "To Downtown".
            (4) Sharrow pavement markings should be applied to the pavement at
reasonable intervals.
      2.   Transition Blocks: The half block between residential and business
zoning of the streets identified in the table in this section, are transition
blocks, except if located within the historic sidewalk district. Consideration
should be given to vary the design of infrastructure projects to best match the
design on either side of the transition block.
      3.   Wood River Trail Crossings: Street design adjacent to the Wood River
Trail crossing should transition to sidewalks with curb and gutter at the edge
of the travel lane. Width of sidewalk in the transition to the Wood River Trail
crossing should increase to a minimum of eight feet (8').
      4.   Historic Sidewalk District: The blocks within the original Hailey
Townsite identified on figure 2 of this section are included in the historic
sidewalk district. The city should plan for the connection of the sidewalks in
the historic sidewalk district through the corners and plan for the maintenance
of these sidewalks to eliminate hazards and keep the pedestrian zone clear of
encroaching vegetation.
   E.   Table: The following table lists the classification, type and
designation of each street within the city. Figure 1 of this section is a map
of these classifications and types with transition blocks shown. Figure 2 of
this section is a map of designations with the historic sidewalk district
shown.

(Ord. 1116, 2012)
18.06.012: STREET DESIGN GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS:
   A.   General: Street design shall be appropriate to the context and function
of the street and the surrounding neighborhood, and shall recognize that
balancing user needs and flexible design may be achieved in different ways
depending on the area in which the street is located and its classification,
type and designation.
   B.   Factors: The following factors affecting pedestrian and bicycle safety
shall be considered when determining the appropriate street design:
      1.   Front in angle parking is hazardous for bicyclists riding in the
street due to drivers' vision being limited while backing out of a space.
      2.   Parallel parking provides a buffer between pedestrians and moving
cars in the travel lane.
      3.   Parallel parking is hazardous for bicyclists riding in the street
due to doors opening suddenly.
      4.   Parallel parking results in fewer spaces than perpendicular parking.
      5.   Bicyclists on sidewalks increases potential for collisions at
driveways and intersections, which are frequent throughout Hailey, due to the
fact bicyclists on sidewalks are farther away from the driver's line of sight
and therefor less visible to the driver.
      6.   Wide sidewalks on both sides of the street gives less confident
bicyclists an area that "feels" safe. It is important to reinforce safe biking
techniques, particularly biking on the right side of the street, in the same
direction as vehicles on the street.
      7.   Sidewalks on both sides of the street provide pedestrians convenient
and safe access to more destinations by providing space separated from
bicyclists and motor vehicles and by minimizing street crossings.
   C.   Sidewalk Zone, Bicycle Facilities, Parking And Drainage: The following
table recommends a minimum allocation of space for each mode to maximize the
safety of pedestrians and bicyclists and recommends the type of parking and
drainage. When determining the appropriate allocation of space on a street,
subsections A and B of this section should be considered.

   D.   Business/Collector Streets: Except as otherwise provided herein,
drought tolerant landscaping, irrigation, bike racks and streetscape elements
approved by the city should be installed within the buffer zone on business/
collector streets with right of way widths of one hundred feet (100').
      1.   For city funded projects, drought tolerant landscaping and
irrigation should be planned and included in the overall project budget. If
funds for the installation and maintenance of landscaping are not available due
to budget constraints, then at a minimum irrigation infrastructure should be
installed to enable landscaping to be installed and maintained at a later date.
      2.   Streetscape elements may be located in the buffer or frontage zones.
   E.   Residential/Collector Streets: Except as otherwise provided herein,
landscaping and irrigation should be installed on residential/collector streets
with right of way widths of eighty (80) or one hundred feet (100').
      1.   For city funded projects, drought tolerant landscaping and
irrigation should be planned and included in the overall project budget. If
funds for the installation and maintenance of drought tolerant landscaping are
not available due to budget constraints, then at a minimum irrigation
infrastructure should be installed to enable drought tolerant landscaping to be
installed and maintained at a later date. (Ord. 1116, 2012)
18.06.016: TRAFFIC CALMING GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS:
   A.   Measures: The following traffic calming measures are acceptable for the
street type and classification indicated in the following table:
 Collector Local
            Collector             Local
            Stop signs            Raised intersections
            Neckdowns and chokers Speed humps
Business    Roundabouts           Chicanes/lateral shifts
            Bulb outs             Neckdowns/chokers
                                 Neighborhood roundabouts
            Stop signs            Raised intersections
            Neckdowns and chokers Speed humps
Residential Roundabouts           Chicanes/lateral shifts
                                 Neckdowns/chokers
                                 Neighborhood roundabouts
 
Chicanes/lateral shifts are curb extensions that alternate from one side of the
roadway to the other, forming S shaped curves. Neckdowns/chokers are curb
extensions at intersections that reduce curb to curb roadway travel lane
widths.
   B.   Traffic Calming Evaluation Procedure: The commission or council shall
consider the following in determining whether a traffic calming measure should
be installed:
      1.   Stop Signs:
         a.   Installation of a stop sign may be warranted if an intersection
meets at least one of the following criteria:
            (1) A visual obstruction is within one hundred feet (100') of the
intersection and prevents a clear view of the intersection; obstructions may be
removed to resolve the problem.
            (2) The streets intersect at angles less than eighty degrees (80o)
and/or have a slope of more than five percent (5%) within one hundred feet
(100') of the intersection.
            (3) The intersection experiences traffic flows in excess of one
thousand (1,000) vehicles per day.
            (4) A public school is within six hundred sixty feet (660') of the
intersection.
            (5) A public park or other public recreation area is within six
hundred sixty feet (660') of the intersection.
            (6) A known history of accidents at the intersection.
         b.   The following criteria apply when placing a stop sign:
            (1) At intersections between an arterial and a collector or local
street, traffic on the collector or local street is stopped.
            (2) At intersections between two (2) collector streets, traffic on
both streets is stopped.
            (3) At intersections between a collector and a local street,
traffic on the local street is stopped.
      2.   All Other Traffic Calming Measures: Installation of an acceptable
traffic calming measure may be warranted if at least one of the following
criteria is met:
         a.   Eighty fifth percentile speed is at least ten (10) miles per hour
over the posted speed limit.
         b.   A petition is signed by at least seventy five percent (75%) of
the total occupied households within three hundred feet (300') from the
proposed traffic calming measure(s). (Ord. 1116, 2012)
18.06.022: PEDESTRIAN FACILITY DESIGN GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS:
   A.   Sidewalk Corridor: Sidewalk corridors should promote access and may
include the following characteristics:
      1.   Clearly defined pedestrian, buffer/landscape/furniture and frontage
zones;
      2.   Wide pedestrian zones;
      3.   Minimal obstacles/protruding objects;
      4.   Minimal walking distance;
      5.   Moderate grades and cross slopes;
      6.   Rest areas outside of pedestrian zone;
      7.   Firm, stable, slip resistant surfaces; and
      8.   Adequate illumination, while still complying with the city's outdoor
lighting ordinance.
   B.   Sidewalk Corridor Zones: The sidewalk corridor is divided into four (4)
distinct functional zones used to determine the width of the sidewalk corridor
and help ensure that obstacles, such as utility poles and other street
furniture, will not limit pedestrian access and mobility. Sidewalk corridor
zone widths are recommended in this chapter.
      1.   Curb (or edge) zone: The area between the face of curb and the
furnishing zone providing clearance between parked vehicles or traveled way and
appurtenances or landscaping.
      2.   Buffer/landscape (or furnishing) zone: The area of the sidewalk
corridor that provides a buffer between pedestrians and vehicles, which may
contain landscaping, public street furniture, transit stops, art, bike racks,
signage or utilities.
      3.   Pedestrian (or throughway) zone: The area of the sidewalk corridor
reserved for the movement of pedestrians. The pedestrian zone should be wide
for two (2) pedestrians to travel side by side without passing other
pedestrians, or for two (2) people going in opposite directions to pass one
another.
      4.   Frontage (or shy) zone: The distance between the pedestrian zone and
the building front or property line that is used to buffer pedestrians from
window shoppers, appurtenances and doorways. The frontage zone may contain art,
signage, merchandise displays or street furniture, such as benches and café
chairs and tables.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2447.jpg] 
   C.   Sidewalk Corridor Clear Width, Grade And Cross Slopes: Minimum
standards are based on Americans with disabilities act accessible guidelines
("ADAAG").
      1.   Clear Width: A minimum clear width of four feet (4') is required on
all public and private sidewalks.
      2.   Sidewalk Corridor Grade Standards: The grade of the pedestrian zone
shall not exceed the grade established for the adjacent roadway. Except the
running slope of a pedestrian access route may be permitted to be steeper than
the grade of the adjacent roadway; provided, that the pedestrian access route
is less than one to twenty (1:20).
      3.   Sidewalk Corridor Cross Slope Standards:
         a.   The cross slope of the pedestrian zone shall be one to forty
eight (1:48) maximum.
         b.   Changes in cross slope shall not exceed two percent (2%).
         c.   The number of driveway crossings should be minimized. When a
driveway crossing is necessary, the following types are acceptable:
(1) Level landing with return curb;
(2) Level crossing with parallel ramps;
(3) Level landing with jogged sidewalk.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2449.jpg] 
   D.   Curb Ramp Guidelines And Standards:
      1.   Best Practices: Curb ramp designs should attempt to meet all of the
following federal highway administration ("FHWA") "Designing Sidewalks And
Trails For Access" best practices for curb ramp design to maximize
accessibility and safety for all pedestrians, particularly when retrofitting
existing curb ramps:
         a.   Provide a level maneuvering area or landing at the top of the
curb ramp.
         b.   Clearly identify the boundary between the bottom of the curb ramp
and the street with a detectable warning.
         c.   Design ramp grades that are perpendicular to the curb.
         d.   Place the curb ramp within the marked crosswalk area.
         e.   Avoid changes of grade that exceed eleven percent (11%) over a
six hundred ten millimeter (610 mm) (24 inch) interval.
         f.   Design the ramp that does not require turning or maneuvering on
the ramp surface.
         g.   Provide a curb ramp grade that can be easily distinguished from
surrounding terrain; otherwise, use detectable warnings.
         h.   Design the ramp with a grade of seven and one-tenth (7.1), cannot
exceed eight and three-tenths percent (8.3%) (1:12).
         i.   Design the ramp and gutter with a cross slope of two percent
(2%).
         j.   Provide adequate drainage to prevent the accumulation of water or
debris on or at the bottom of the ramp.
         k.   Transitions from ramps to gutter and streets should be flush and
free of elevation changes.
         l.   Align the curb ramp with the crosswalk, so there is a straight
path of travel from the top of the ramp to the center of the roadway to the
curb ramp on the other side. Provide clearly defined and easily identified
edges or transitions on both sides of the ramp to contrast with sidewalk.
Depending on site constraints, it may not be possible to incorporate all of the
best practices within each curb ramp.
      2.   Curb Ramp Slope:
         a.   For new construction curb ramp slope shall not exceed eight and
three-tenths percent (8.3%).
         b.   For retrofits where eight and three-tenths percent (8.3%) ramp
slopes cannot be attained, the following ADAAG exceptions may be permitted:
 
Maximum Rise Minimum Slope Maximum Slope
6 inches     8.3 percent   10 percent
3 inches     10 percent    12.5 percent
 
         c.   A slope steeper than twelve and one-half percent (121/2%) should
be avoided regardless of length of ramp.
      3.   Cross Slope: Ramp cross slope shall not exceed two percent (2%).
      4.   Ramp Length: See FHWA designing sidewalks and trails for access.
      5.   Minimum Width: Ramp minimum width is four feet (4') (48 inches).
      6.   Drainage Slopes: Drainage slopes shall not exceed two percent (2%).
The cross slope of the street and gutter approach shall not exceed five percent
(5%).
      7.   Transition Areas: Transition areas shall have a gradual transition
with a minimum grade change of less than eleven percent (11%).
      8.   Sidewalk Approaches: Sidewalk approaches shall have a minimum three
foot (3') (36 inch) clear space.
      9.   Landings: Slopes of a landing shall not exceed two percent (2%).
Landings should extend at least four feet (4') beyond the top of the curb ramp
for maneuverability (figure 1 of this section). If the space is limited and a
four foot (4') landing cannot be provided, an absolute minimum three foot (3')
(36 inch) landing is acceptable, provided the minimum ramp width is four feet
(4') (48 inches) and ramp flare slope does not exceed eight and three-tenths
percent (8.3%) (figure 2 of this section).

   E.   Pedestrian Crossings:
      1.   Design Solutions At Wide Intersections: The following techniques are
appropriate to use to improve pedestrian conditions and access at wide
intersections, particularly on Main Street where appropriate right of way
exists, and may be incorporated into a design:
         a.   Center medians to provide a refuge for slower pedestrians;
         b.   Accessible pedestrian signals to assist in providing people with
vision impairments enough time to cross the street;
         c.   Increase crossing times so that people who walk slowly will have
sufficient time to cross before the signal indication changes;
         d.   Increase the crossing times so that people who delay the start of
their crossing to confirm the "Walk" interval will have sufficient time to
cross before the signal indication changes;
         e.   Prohibit left turns during the "Walk" interval;
         f.   Restrict right turns on red;
         g.   Enhance the visibility of the crosswalk markings or consider a
raised crosswalk with detectable warnings (truncated domes) at both ends;
         h.   Reduce crossing distances and increase visibility through the
construction of curb extensions;
         i.   Reduce traffic speed;
         j.   Clarify the pedestrian crossing area by installing stamped or
raised crosswalks with detectable warnings (truncated domes) installed at both
ends;
         k.   Pedestrian lead time and an accessible pedestrian signal so
pedestrians, including those with vision impairments, can assert themselves in
the crosswalk before motorists start making right and left turns;
         l.   Midblock signalized crossing with accessible pedestrian signal
opportunities at busy intersections to encourage people to cross where there
are fewer potential points of conflict between pedestrians and motorists;
         m.   Traffic and pedestrian signal indications if they do not already
exist.
      2.   Turning Radius: Smaller turning radii are encouraged to slow traffic
speeds, allow perpendicular curb ramps to be positioned parallel to the
crosswalk and perpendicular to the curb, significantly decrease crossing
distances for pedestrians, enhance detection of the crosswalk and improve
crossing conditions for people with vision impairments. The addition of on
street bicycle lanes adds turning space for larger vehicles in lieu of wider
curb radii.
      3.   Truncated Domes: Truncated domes shall be installed when altering
curb ramps.

(Ord. 1116, 2012)
18.06.024: BICYCLE FACILITY DESIGN GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS:
   A.   Sidewalks:
      1.   Sidewalks generally should not be considered bicycle facilities and
should not be signed as a bicycle route.
      2.   Sidewalk riding by children or adults uncomfortable riding in the
street is to be expected and tolerated, but should not be encouraged.
   B.   Shared Use Path:
      1.   Shared use paths are generally not recommended in areas within the
city of Hailey served by the street network, but may be appropriate within an
exclusive right of way, to connect neighborhood cul-de-sacs or where few, or
no, driveways or street intersections will cross the path.
      2.   A shared use path shall have a minimum pavement width of ten feet
(10'), with a preferred width of twelve (12) or fourteen feet (14') if
significant volume and mix of users (pedestrians, cyclists, runners, skaters,
etc.) or user types (children, basic adults, advanced riders) is present.
   C.   Bicycle Lanes:
      1.   Guidelines: Bicycle lanes shall be one-way facilities and carry bike
traffic in the same direction as adjacent motor vehicle traffic.
         a.   Two-way bicycle lanes on one side of the roadway are prohibited
when they result in bicycles riding against the flow of motor vehicle traffic.
(1) There may be special situations where a two-way bicycle lane for a short
distance can eliminate the need for a bicyclist to make a double crossing of a
busy street or travel on a sidewalk. This should only be considered after
careful evaluation of the relative risks.
         b.   Bicycle lanes on one-way streets are required to be placed on the
right side of the street. Bicycle lanes on the left side are unfamiliar and
unexpected for most motorists but may be considered when a bicycle lane on the
left will substantially decrease the number of conflicts, such as those caused
by heavy bus traffic or unusually heavy turning movements to the right, or if
there are a significant number of left turning bicyclists.
         c.   Two-way bicycle lanes on the left side of a one-way street may be
considered with a suitable separation from the motor vehicle traffic after a
complete engineering study of other alternatives and relative risks.
      2.   Minimum Width:
         a.   For roadways with curb and gutter or where substantial truck
traffic is present, or where motor vehicle speeds exceed fifty (50) miles per
hour, the minimum width of a bicycle lane shall be five feet (5') from the face
of a curb or guardrail to the bicycle lane stripe. This five foot (5') width
should be sufficient in cases where a one to two foot (2') wide concrete gutter
pan exists; provided, that a minimum of three feet (3') of ridable surface is
provided and the longitudinal joint between the gutter pan and pavement surface
is smooth. The width of the gutter pan should not be included in the
measurement of the ridable or usable surface. If the joint is not smooth, four
feet (4') of ridable surface should be provided.
         b.   If parking is permitted, the bicycle lane should be placed
between the parking area and the travel lane and have a minimum width of five
feet (5').
         c.   If parking is permitted but a parking stripe or stalls are not
utilized, the shared area should be a minimum of eleven feet (11') without a
curb face and twelve feet (12') adjacent to a curb face.
         d.   If the parking volume is substantial or turnover is high, an
additional one to two feet (2') of width is desirable.
         e.   For roadways with no curb and gutter, and where parking is
prohibited and where the area beyond the paved shoulder can provide additional
maneuvering width, the minimum width may be four feet (4').
      3.   Placement:
         a.   Bicycle lanes between the parking lane and curb lane are
prohibited.
         b.   On a street without curbs and gutters, bicycle lanes should be
located within the limits of the paved shoulder at the outside edge.
      4.   Pavement Surface:
         a.   The pavement surface in this area, thirty two (32) to forty
inches (40") from a curb face, should be smooth and free of structures. Drain
inlets and utility covers that extend into this area may cause bicyclists to
swerve and effectively reduce the usable width of the lane. Where these
structures exist, the bicycle lane width may need to be adjusted accordingly.
      5.   Lane Striping:
         a.   A bicycle lane shall be delineated from the motor vehicle travel
lanes with a minimum six inch (6") wide solid white line.
         b.   An additional four inch (4") solid white line may be placed
between the parking lane and the bicycle lane. This second line will encourage
parking closer to the curb, providing added separation from motor vehicles, and
where parking is light it can discourage motorists from using the bicycle lane
as a through travel lane.
      6.   Hazards:
         a.   Bicycle lanes should be provided with adequate drainage to
prevent ponding, washouts, debris accumulation and other potentially hazardous
conditions.
         b.   Drainage grates should be bicycle safe. When an immediate
replacement of an incompatible grate is not possible, a temporary correction of
welding thin metal straps across the grates perpendicular to the drainage slots
at four inch (4") center to center spacing should be considered.
         c.   A smooth riding surface should be provided and utility covers
should be adjusted flush with the surface.
         d.   Raised pavement markings and raised barriers can cause steering
difficulties for bicyclists and should not be used to delineate bicycle lanes.
      7.   Bicycle Lanes At Intersections:
         a.   Bicycle lane striping should not be installed across any
pedestrian crosswalks, and, in most cases, should not continue through any
street intersections.
         b.   If there are no painted crosswalks, the bicycle lane striping
should stop at the near side corner of the intersection and then resume at the
far side corner. The only exception may be the extension of dotted guidelines
through particularly complex intersections or multilane roundabouts.
         c.   The same bicycle lane striping criteria apply whether parking is
permitted or prohibited in the vicinity of the intersection.
         d.   At signalized or stop controlled intersections with right turning
motor vehicles, the solid striping to the approach should be replaced with a
broken line. The length of the broken line section is usually fifty feet (50')
to two hundred feet (200').
         e.   At nonsignalized minor intersections with no stop controls and
small volumes of right turning motor vehicles, solid bicycle lane striping can
continue all the way to the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection.
         f.   If there is a bus stop or high right turn volume, the six inch
(6") solid line should be replaced with a broken line for the length of the bus
stop. The bicycle lane striping should resume at the outside line of the
crosswalk on the far side of the intersection.
         g.   If a bus stop is located on a far side of the intersection rather
than on a near side approach, the solid white line can also be replaced with a
broken line for a distance of at least eighty feet (80') from the crosswalk on
the far side of the intersection.
         h.   At T intersections with no painted crosswalks, the bicycle lane
striping on the side across from the T intersection should continue through the
intersection area with no break. If there are painted crosswalks, the bicycle
lane striping on the side across from the T intersection should be discontinued
only at the crosswalks.
      8.   Bicycle Lanes And Turning Lanes: Bicycle lanes sometimes complicate
bicycle and motor vehicle turning movements at intersections. Because they
encourage bicyclists to keep to the right and motorists to keep to the left,
both operators are somewhat discouraged from merging in advance of turns. Thus,
some bicyclists may begin left turns from the right side bicycle lane and some
motorists may begin right turns from the left of the bicycle lane. Both
maneuvers are contrary to established rules of the road and may result in
conflicts; however, these can be lessened by signing and striping.
         a.   At intersections, bicyclists proceeding straight through and
motorists turning right must cross paths. Striping and signing configurations
which encourage crossings in advance of the intersection, in a merging fashion,
are preferable to those that force the crossing in the immediate vicinity of
the intersection. To a lesser extent, the same is true for left turning
bicyclists; however, in this maneuver, most vehicle codes allow the bicyclist
the option of making either a "vehicular style" left turn (where the bicyclist
merges leftward to the same lane used for motor vehicle left turns) or a
"pedestrian style" left turn (where the bicyclist proceeds straight through the
intersection, turns left at the far side, then proceeds across the intersection
again on the cross street) (figure 17 of this section).
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/5606e566b0f1d7348d0490e1a0bd08f8ddad0d73/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2455.jpg] 
         b.   Where there are numerous left turning bicyclists, a separate
turning lane can also be considered. The design of bicycle lanes should also
include appropriate signing at intersections to warn of conflicts. General
guidance for pavement marking of bicycle lanes is contained in the MUTCD 2. The
approach shoulder width should be provided through the intersection, where
feasible, to accommodate right turning bicyclists or bicyclists who prefer to
use crosswalks to negotiate the intersection.
         c.   Intersections with throat widening at approaches that provide an
exclusive left turn bay can also provide an exclusive right turn lane for motor
vehicles. In those cases where throat widening has reduced the available
pavement width below the minimum requirements for bicycle lane operation and it
is not possible to widen the pavement, the bicycle lane striping should be
discontinued following a regulatory sign. Bicyclists proceeding straight
through the intersection should be directed to merge with motor vehicle traffic
to cross the intersection. Where sufficient width exists, a separate through
bicycle lane should be placed to the right of the through lane.
      9.   Bicycle Lane Symbols And Markings: Pavement markings and signing
guidance provided by the "Manual On Uniform Traffic Control Devices" (MUTCD)
shall be followed when striping bicycle lanes.
   D.   Bicycle Racks:
      1.   A single bicycle rack shall meet the following criteria:
         a.   Support the bicycle upright by its frame in two (2) places.
         b.   Prevent the wheels of the bicycle from tilting or twisting.
         c.   A U-lock should be able to lock the front wheel and the down tube
of an upright bicycle or lock the rear wheel and seat tube of the bicycle.
      2.   Two (2) or more single racks may be mounted in a row on a common
base or attached in a row to a frame.
      3.   Inverted "U" racks mounted in a row should be placed thirty inches
(30") apart on center, allowing enough room for two (2) bicycles to be secured
to each rack and providing easy access to each bicycle.
      4.   Racks should be made of material that resists being cut or detached
using common hand tools. The rack should be anchored so that it cannot be
stolen with the bikes attached. Racks that are large and heavy enough such that
the rack cannot be easily moved or lifted with the bicycles attached do not
have to be anchored.
      5.   Racks shall be placed so that they do not block the entrance,
inhibit pedestrian flow in or out of the building or generally impede snow
removal. If placed on a sidewalk, racks should be placed so that at least five
feet (5') of sidewalk width is maintained.
      6.   Where multiple racks are installed in rows with aisles separating
the rows, the following dimensions shall apply:
         a.   Minimum aisles width shall be forty eight inches (48"). The aisle
is measured from tip to tip of bike tires across the space between racks.
         b.   Minimum depth shall be seventy two inches (72") for each row of
parked bicycles.
         c.   Areas with a high turnover rate should have a minimum aisle width
of seventy two inches (72") and should have more than one entrance.
      7.   Racks shall be mounted within fifty feet (50') of the entrance it
serves, or as close as the nearest car parking space, whichever is closer, and
shall be clearly visible from the entrance it serves.
      8.   Creative, three-dimensional bicycle racks are permitted, provided
the criteria of the rack design are met.
      9.   When possible, bicycle parking areas should be protected from the
elements (rain, snow, etc.).

(Ord. 1116, 2012)
18.06.026: STREET TREE GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS:
   A.   Purpose: the purpose of these street tree guidelines and standards is
to encourage tree diversity and promote strong, healthy trees that are not
limited by environmental conditions from achieving a long life and mature size.
   B.   Applicability: These standards are applicable exclusively to street
trees within the Hailey City rights of way.
   C.   Definitions:
      CALIPER: Diameter measurement of nursery stock trees at six (6) inch
above the root flare.
      DBH (DIAMETER BREAST HEIGHT): On large trees, diameter is measured at
four and a half (4 ½) feet above the ground.
      PLANTING STRIP: Trees planted in a linear strip along sidewalks and
streets.
      STRUCTURAL SOIL: A planting medium designed so that when mixed and placed
properly any compactive load is born by the stone matrix leaving the soil
between the stone matrix uncompacted. The planting medium components should be
approximately eighty percent (80%) one (1) inch size crushed stone (no fine
particles) and twenty percent (20%) soil by weight, with a small amount of
binder such as hydrogel to aid in the uniform blending of the two materials.
The soil should range from "loam" to "clay loam" and contain at least twenty
percent (20%) clay to maximize water and nutrient holding capacity. Only
structural soil shall be allowed underneath hardscape or sidewalk features.
      SUITABLE SOIL: Soil should be a “sandy loam” soil with fifty to eighty
percent (50 - 80%) medium and coarse sand (less than twenty-five percent (25%)
fine sand), five to twenty percent (5 - 20%) clay, five to thirty-five percent
(5-35%) silt, contain a minimum of one to three percent (1 - 3%) organic matter
by weight (four to six percent (4 - 6%) for the top twelve (12) inches), be
free draining at one to two (1-2) inches per hour, contain no more than one
thousand two hundred and eighty (1,280) ppm soluble salt, and have a pH
appropriate to the planted species. Soil should have a density of sixty-two to
eighty-eight (62 - 88) pounds per cubic foot and contain no herbicides, heavy
metals, or hydrocarbons that will impact growth.
      TREE WELL: Generally located in a hardscape area, a tree well is a three-
dimensional space dedicated to usable root area for the tree. Tree wells must
contain a minimum amount of suitable soil as herein established for root
development, and must be free from compaction.
   D.   Guidelines and Standards:
      1.   Tree placement should be a function of expected mature size, with
consideration for crown size and height spacing conflicts to existing plantings
and utilities. A site assessment shall be performed by an arborist or landscape
architect prior to project design to minimize conflicts with retained existing
trees and utilities.
         a.   Existing trees: All existing public trees within the project area
shall be identified for species, condition, diameter or caliper, approximate
age, heritage, and historical value. Before a project is approved and initiated
the city shall identify trees that require preservation or that have specific
monetary value and the city shall be compensated for those trees if damaged or
removed. Said compensation may include, at the city's discretion, replacement
of equal value or greater at locations deemed acceptable to the city, and said
compensation shall also include planting expenses and initial maintenance.
Appraised value of the tree shall be established by the city or a certified
arborist acceptable to the city.
         b.   New Plantings: New plantings shall be planned with consideration
for the mature crown size and necessary clearance to other conflicts.
         Linear plantings shall be spaced a maximum of 40 feet on center unless
otherwise approved. Alternative designs or clustering for Residential
developments may be allowed in lieu of linear plantings at the discretion of
the city but are generally discouraged. If allowed, tree clusters should be
spaced a maximum of one hundred and twenty feet (120') on center and should
consist of between three and seven trees. Individual trees within a cluster
shall be spaced in accordance with the needs of the fully developed canopy. The
minimum number of trees in an alternative or clustering design shall be no less
than the theoretical number of trees in a linear planting design for the same
area.
         Additional tree placement criteria are as follows:
            (1)   Trees shall be no closer to the face of curb than shown in
the standard drawings.
            (2)   No Class I trees are allowed within five (5) feet of an
improved travel way, (sidewalks, pathways, pedestrian or vehicular lanes, etc.)
            (3)   Class I trees shall have a minimum planting strip width of
ten (10) feet.
            (4)   Class II and III trees shall have a minimum planting strip
width of three (3) feet but wider is preferred.
            (5)   Trees shall not be located within any designated snow storage
area unless specifically approved by the Public Works Department.
      2.   Infrastructure Requirements:
         a.    Tree wells: The top 4 inches of a tree well shall consist of
organic mulch except within 6" of the trunk. The remainder of the tree well
shall be filled with suitable soil not susceptible to compaction and which
drains well. Tree wells may have non-invasive grasses, ground cover, bulbs &
perennials, annuals or other low maintenance plantings located a minimum of two
feet from trunk or as shown on the standard drawings. Any portion of a tree
well located under sidewalk or hardscape areas shall be capable of supporting
said structures.
         b.   Root barriers are encouraged as needed to prevent damage to
hardscape.
         c.    Projects subject to the City of Hailey Design Review or
Subdivision process shall have plantings as follows (Minor exceptions may be
allowed if deemed appropriate by the city):
            (1)   Tree plantings within new sidewalk or hardscape areas: To
create the best environment for trees and guard against compaction, hard
surface areas should be supported with suspended pavement systems whenever it
is economically feasible. If these systems are not used, other beneficial
treatments could be used including structural soils or greater volumes of
suitable soil.
      No dimension (width, length, or depth) of the tree well should be less
than three feet (3’). A minimum of twenty (20) square feet must be open to the
air (some hardscape removal may be required) and the tree well must contain a
minimum of three hundred (300) cubic feet of suitable soil which may include
structural soil or suspended pavement systems beneath hardscape features.
            (2)   Tree plantings within existing hardscape areas: No dimension
(width, length, or depth) of the tree well should be less than three feet (3').
A minimum of twenty (20) square feet must be open to the air (some hardscape
removal may be required) and the tree well must contain a minimum of one
hundred and twenty (120) cubic feet of suitable soil which may include
structural soil or suspended pavement systems beneath hardscape features.
            (3)   Tree plantings adjacent to any sidewalk or hardscape areas:
An uncompacted area of suitable soil at least five feet (5') wide with a length
that is equivalent to the diameter of the mature canopy, or an equivalently
sized uncompacted area, shall be provided.
            (4)   Tree plantings greater than five feet (5') from any sidewalk
or hardscape areas: In open planting areas trees should be protected from
compaction that may occur as a result of parking, movement of automobiles, or
heavy equipment.
         d.    Projects exempt from the City of Hailey Design Review or
Subdivision process shall provide a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the tree
well volume described in 18.06.026.D.2.c.
      3.   Species Selection and Planting Stock:
         a.   Species Selection shall be in accordance with the approved list
(see Hailey Street tree list for approved Class I, II and III trees). Species
selection shall maintain consistency within the block but avoid monoculture.
         b.   Planting Tree Stock: trees shall be no less than two and half
(2.5) inches and no greater than four (4) inches caliper size as tagged by a
local nursery. Only trees with one dominant stem and no visible fungal or
insect damage evident will be allowed. Balled and burlapped stock is generally
preferred over containerized stock which often have encircling roots.
      4.   Establishment and Maintenance of New Trees:
         a.   Trees should be planted in spring or fall when possible, using
proper tree planting methods (see Wood River Valley Tree Guide). Encircling
roots in container stock should be cut to a straight root or removed before
planting. Permanent irrigation is required with higher application rates
provided during the first season. Protection from traffic, compaction, and
equipment, including snow removal equipment, must be provided. Electrical and
soil standards must be met.
         b.   Planting areas should connect, either on the surface or within
the subsurface space to allow for continuous root development and increase
usable soil volumes. Preferred hardscaped surfaces include pavers that allow
the penetration of water and air, or permeable asphalt.
(Ord. 1262, 2020; Ord. 1116, 2012)
18.06.028: STREETSCAPE ELEMENTS GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS:
   A.   Streetlights: Streetlights are required to be installed at
intersections on business/collector streets and should maximize the lighting of
the pedestrian zone and crosswalks.
   B.   Tree Grates: Tree grates are required for street trees planted on
business/collector streets.
   C.   Trash And Recycling Receptacles: The standard trash receptacle is
"Central Park" receptacle. Recycling receptacles are also encouraged.
   D.   Benches: A variety of styles with similar elements are encouraged to
add interest to the streetscape and avoid monotony.
   E.   Drinking Fountains: Opportunities to incorporate drinking fountains
into key public spaces should be considered.
   F.   Public Art: The incorporation of public art is encouraged. Any
streetscape element can take the form of public art.

18.08.010: SUBGRADE PREPARATION:
   A.   General: The contractor shall do all excavation, stripping, disposal
and compaction of subgrade necessary within the street right of way. The work
shall include the removal and disposal of any minor structures or miscellaneous
obstructions, which are visible or are indicated on the plans, which encroach
upon or otherwise obstruct the work. All unsuitable material, such as rocks and
rubbish, shall be disposed of by the contractor at an approved disposal area.
   B.   Execution:
      1.   The top twelve inches (12") of subgrade shall be compacted to a
minimum of ninety five percent (95%) of the maximum density as determined by
ASTM D698. Only subgrade material approved by the city engineer or his
representative may be used. All soft spots or otherwise unsuitable material
shall be removed and replaced with suitable material. The subgrade shall be
watered or aerated as necessary to obtain optimum moisture content as
determined by ASTM D698. Subgrade shall be finished to within 0.10 feet of the
grade and cross sections shown on the plans or as staked on the ground.
Compaction equipment shall be of the size and type capable of obtaining
specified compaction. Compaction equipment shall be approved by the city
engineer.
      2.   At all times, the top of the subgrade shall be kept in such
condition that it will drain readily and effectively. In no case will vehicles
be allowed to travel in a single track. If ruts are formed, the subgrade shall
be reshaped and recompacted to the required density. Storage or stockpiling of
materials on the top of the subgrade will not be permitted. Until the subgrade
has been inspected and approved, no subbase, leveling course or pavement shall
be placed thereon.
      3.   Embankments required to construct the subgrade shall be compacted to
a minimum of ninety five percent (95%) of the maximum density as determined by
ASTM D698. Embankment material shall be approved by the city engineer.
Embankment material may be from on site borrow areas or imported from off site
borrow areas as approved by the city engineer. Embankment shall be placed in
layers not exceeding eight inches (8") in loose thickness. Each layer shall be
uniformly compacted at plus or minus three percent (±3%) of the approved
optimum moisture content to a minimum of ninety five percent (95%) of the
maximum density as determined by ASTM D698. A copy of the soil inspection
report from a certified inspector for this requirement shall be provided to the
city engineer. A minimum of one test per two hundred fifty feet (250') of
street shall be performed. Compaction tests shall be performed at the
contractor/developer's expense. Watering or aeration as necessary shall be
accomplished to obtain optimum moisture content. Compaction equipment shall be
of the size and type capable of obtaining specified compaction. Where
embankments are to be placed on slopes steeper than three to one (3:1),
horizontal benches shall be constructed. In the construction of embankments,
starting layers shall be placed in the deepest portion of the fill; as
placement progresses, layers shall be constructed approximately parallel to the
finished grade line. If pipelines are to be placed in the embankment, the
embankment shall be constructed to an elevation of two feet (2') above the top
of the pipe prior to trench excavation for the pipeline. Completed embankments
shall be dressed to elevations and slopes specified on the plans or as staked
by the engineer. (Ord. 1116, 2012)

(performance grade). The asphalt cement used shall comply with and be in
accordance with subsection 702.01 of the (2004) state of Idaho, transportation
department, division of highways, standard specifications for highway
construction, and most recent supplemental specifications thereto. The liquid
asphalt content shall be five percent (5%) to seven percent (7%) by weight, of
the combined dry aggregate. The exact percentage of asphalt in the mix shall be
fixed by the engineer based upon preliminary laboratory tests, sieve analysis,
grading and character of the aggregate furnished within the specification
limits. The city of Hailey will reject any batch or load of resultant mixture
that contains an excess or deficient amount of asphalt varying more than four-
tenths (0.4) of one percent (1%) from the exact percentages as fixed by the
engineer. The upper limit may be increased if absorptive aggregates are used.
The owner/developer will submit certifications to the city engineer, if
requested, certifying the conformance of the asphalt material.
      2.   The mineral aggregate shall meet the following gradation
requirements unless otherwise accepted by the engineer. The engineer shall
provide a current sieve analysis of the proposed aggregate to the city
engineer.
Passing Sieve Size Percentage By Weight Passing Square Mesh Sieve
Passing Sieve Size Percentage By Weight Passing Square Mesh Sieve
1/2 inch           95 - 100

         a.   The aggregate shall show a loss of not more than thirty five
percent (35%) on the Los Angeles abrasion test.
         b.   The above gradations represent the extreme limits, which shall
determine the suitability of aggregate for use. The final gradation as approved
by the engineer shall not vary from the low limits on one screen to the high
limits on the adjacent screen, or vice versa.
      3.   The job mix formula shall be designated in accordance with HVEEM
method of testing asphalt mixtures for relative stability AASHTO T-246 and T-
247, and shall have the following in place criteria:
         a.   Minimum stability = thirty five (35).
         b.   Minimum film thickness = six (6) micron.
         c.   Percent air voids = three (3) to five percent (5%).
         d.   Minimum immersion compression = eighty five percent (85%).
         e.   Percent voids in mineral aggregate, minimum = thirteen percent
(13%).
      4.   The contractor shall be responsible for providing information
concerning the need for antistripping additive as determined by an independent
laboratory using AASHTO test methods T165 and T182, latest editions. The
engineer shall provide a job mix formula to the city engineer. The owner/
developer shall arrange for an independent laboratory test at his own expense.
      5.   A tack coat shall be applied to all surfaces that will be in contact
with the new asphalt pavement. The tack coat shall be liquid asphalt grade CSS-
1 and shall conform to the specifications series no. 2 (CSS-1) of the asphalt
institute. The rate of application shall be 0.05 to 0.10 gallons per square
yard.
   C.   Workmanship:
      1.   Plant Mix Placement: The plant mix surfacing shall be placed over
the prepared or tacked surface. Placement shall be accomplished with a self-
propelled paver with an automatic screed operable from a profile "shoe" or
"ski" referencing the base surface or adjoining completed surface. The length
and type of the shoe or ski shall be acceptable to the city engineer and
capable of compensating for minor variations in the base profile. The minimum
ambient temperature for laying plant mix pavement shall be forty degrees
Fahrenheit (40°F) and rising. The laydown temperature shall be two hundred
seventy degrees (270°) to three hundred ten degrees Fahrenheit (310°F), or as
specified on the mix formula sheet from a certified laboratory testing firm.
      2.   Connections With Existing Surfacing: Connections to existing
surfacing shall be accomplished by cutting back the existing surface to a
vertical face to assure positive full depth paving. The vertical face shall be
tacked with CSS-1 prior to paving.
      3.   Rolling:
         a.   Unless otherwise directed, the initial or breakdown rolling shall
consist of one complete coverage of the paving mixture performed with a two (2)
axle tandem roller and shall weigh seven (7) to thirteen (13) tons. Rolling
shall be performed in such a manner that cracking, shoving or displacement will
be avoided. Any surface cracks shall be seal coated by applying an emulsion.
Final rolling shall be completed the same day the pavement is placed.
         b.   Any displacement occurring as a result of the reversing of the
direction of a roller or from other causes shall be corrected at once by the
use of rakes and addition of fresh mixture when required. Care shall be
exercised in rolling not to displace the line and grade of the edges of the
pavement. Rolling shall continue until all roller marks are eliminated, the
surface is of uniform texture, and true to grade and cross section.
         c.   To prevent adhesion of the mixture to the rollers, the wheels
shall be kept properly moistened with water or water mixed with very small
quantities of detergent or other approved material. Excess liquid will not be
permitted.
         d.   Along all edges, forms, curbs, headers, walls and other places
not accessible to the rollers, the mixture shall be thoroughly compacted with
hot hand tampers, smoothing irons, or with mechanical tampers.
         e.   The contractor shall compact the mix to a density of at least
ninety five percent (95%) of maximum density as based on the HVEEM method. The
pavement thickness shall be a minimum of three inches (3") after rolling.
      4.   Shoulders: When the rolling of the surface course has been completed
and the edges have been thoroughly compacted, gravel shoulder material shall be
placed against the edges and rolled.
      5.   Surface Smoothness: The completed surface shall be uniform and to
proper line and profile. The completed surfacing shall not vary more than one-
fourth inch (1/4") from a ten foot (10') straight edge centerline. Slope shall
be controlled and in accordance with the plan typical section. Test for
conformity shall be made immediately after initial compaction and variations
shall be corrected by removing or adding materials as may be necessary. Rolling
shall then continue as specified. After final rolling, the smoothness of the
course shall be checked again and any irregularity of the surface exceeding the
above limits and any area defective in texture, compression or composition
shall be corrected, including removal and replacement of unsatisfactory
material, as directed by the city engineer.
      6.   Weather Limitations: Plant mix material shall not be placed on a wet
surface, when the air temperature is below forty degrees Fahrenheit (40°F), or
when weather or surface conditions otherwise prevent the proper handling or
finishing of the plant mix material.
      7.   Quality Control:
         a.   The contractor shall notify the city a minimum of twenty four
(24) hours prior to beginning any work covered by this section.
         b.   Samples may be taken each day of production. Testing and
frequency may be reduced by the city engineer if test results and visual
observations indicate consistent mix production.
         c.   Core samples may be required by the city engineer to verify mix
samples or air void content. Cores will not normally be required if asphalt
content and gradation test results remain within acceptable tolerances.
         d.   Sampling and testing methods shall be approved in advance by the
city engineer. Copies of all test reports shall be submitted to the city
engineer.
      8.   Penetration: All manhole lids, water valve boxes, dry well lids and
other items which must penetrate the pavement shall be installed and covered,
as appropriate, below the surface of the leveling course prior to paving. The
contractor shall extend these items through the pavement and install a concrete
collar after paving is complete. The contractor shall accurately locate these
items to assure a minimum amount of disturbance occurs.
   D.   Guarantee:
      1.   The owner/developer shall be responsible for any damage or failure,
progressive or total, of the plant mix surfacing for the period of two (2)
years following completion of the construction. This shall include any
deformation of the roadway cross section or profile.
      2.   Replacement or repair of the unsatisfactory areas shall be as
specified by the city engineer. The completion of the repairs, as specified,
will satisfy the requirements of the guarantee. (Ord. 1116, 2012)
18.08.018: CONCRETE AND REINFORCED CONCRETE:
   A.   General: This section covers the work necessary for the concrete and
reinforced concrete, including, but not limited to, furnishing the materials,
constructing and stripping the forms; proportioning, mixing, transporting,
placing, compacting, finishing, curing and protecting the concrete; furnishing
and installing reinforcing steel; setting and fastening embedded items; and all
incidental and related work.
   B.   Material:
      1.   Strength: All concrete twenty eight (28) day compressive strength,
unless otherwise specified, shall be three thousand (3,000) psi.
      2.   Concrete Mixture:
         a.   Cement: Only portland cement conforming to ASTM specification C-
150, type I, normal, or type III, high early strength, shall be used unless
otherwise specified. There shall be a minimum of five hundred seventeen (517)
pounds of cement per yard of concrete.
         b.   Aggregates: Concrete aggregates shall conform to ASTM
specification C-33 for concrete aggregates or for the applicable sections of
the specifications for highway construction. The maximum size of coarse
aggregate shall be one inch (1"), unless specified otherwise. No aggregate
shall contain organic matter in excess of that permitted by ASTM C-40.
         c.   Water: Mixing and curing water shall be clean, free from
deleterious amounts of acids, alkalis, soils, decayed vegetable matter or other
organic materials. In general, water suitable for drinking will be considered
acceptable but will be subject to review by the engineer.
         d.   Admixtures: Only air entraining admixtures will be used unless
otherwise specifically authorized in writing by the city engineer. The
admixtures used for air entrainment shall conform to ASTM specification C-260
and the specific brand used and method of introduction into the mix shall be
subject to review by the city engineer.
      3.   Forms: Forms shall be of wood, metal or of such other material as
approved by the city engineer.
      4.   Reinforcing Steel: All reinforcing rods for concrete reservoirs
shall conform to ASTM specification A-615, grade 60. Other reinforcing rods
shall conform to ASTM specification A-15 or A-16. All reinforcing rods shall
have deformations conforming to ASTM specification A-305. Welded wire fabric
shall conform to ASTM specification A-185.
      5.   Fiber Mesh: Fiber mesh shall be added to all concrete placed in the
city of Hailey. All fiber mesh shall meet ASTM standard C1116.
      6.   Water Stops: Polyvinyl chloride, minimum one thousand seven hundred
fifty (1,750) psi tensile strength, maximum possible lengths, preformed
corners, heat welded splicing.
      7.   Nailing Strips: Pressure treated Douglas fir.
      8.   Curing Compounds: Type 2, class A per ASTM C309-94.
   C.   Execution:
      1.   Form Work:
         a.   General: Forms shall be accurately built and placed to conform to
the shape, line, grade and dimensions of the concrete called for on the plans.
Material previously used in forms shall be thoroughly cleaned and free of nails
before being reused if in contact with concrete. Forms shall be mortar tight.
All concrete angles shall be beveled or filleted unless otherwise specifically
shown on the plans or authorized by the city engineer. Bevels and fillets shall
be approximately three-fourths inch (3/4") in dimension and (except where
specifically detailed otherwise on the plans) shall all be of the same size.
Discontinuous edges of horizontal surfaces may be rounded with an edging tool.
         b.   Design And Construction: Form work shall be designed to properly
support all loads which may fall upon it during the placing and compaction of
concrete and that portion of the curing period during which the concrete is
unable to support itself. If the form should shift or be damaged during or
subsequent to the placing of concrete in a surface which will be exposed to
view during the service of the finished structure, such disfigurement shall be
removed and/or corrected to the practical intent of the plans. Where plywood is
used as form liner, adjacent pieces of plywood shall have the grain running
parallel with each other if in doing otherwise the structure would be
disfigured. In any case, all wood shall be treated with nonstaining form oil or
by other means in order to prevent raising the grain when the surface becomes
wet. On interior circular walls, tongue and groove lumber or lumber lined with
plywood shall be used. Where surfaces are to be given a special finish, which
is not affected by the forms, one inch (1") boards of uniform width may be used
for forms. All joints between adjacent pieces of form lumber shall be closely
fitted to prevent disagreeable lines in the concrete and to prevent the loss of
mortar from the concrete mix with the consequent formation of rock pockets in
the concrete.
(1) Manner and type of form tying shall be subject to the review of the city
engineer. Of primary concern in this respect is the effect on the finished
appearance of the structure produced by the use of the particular tie under
consideration. The city engineer may require a change in the method of tying
forms at any time if it is reasonable that the results being produced by the
method in use are detrimental to the appearance of the structure and a more
satisfactory result can be obtained through the use of a different method. In
general, the use of twisted wire for form ties will not be permitted. Ties for
walls exposed to weather or earth shall have the conical or spherical type
heads and shall be so constructed such that when the forms are removed no metal
shall be within five-eighths inch (5/8") of any surface. Diesel fuel shall not
be used for form treatment.
(2) The use of reusable form work provided by companies specializing in the
manufacture and rental of such units will be permitted, providing the forms
meet the aforementioned requirements, especially those regarding mortar tight
joints.
(3) No form treatment shall be applied in such a manner that it will
contaminate the reinforcing steel or impair the bond of concrete with it. When
oiling forms, care shall be taken in those areas where subsequent work must be
bonded to the concrete and no form treatment shall be used which might impair
this bond. Diesel fuel shall not be used for form treatment.
         c.   Removal Of Forms:
(1) Forms shall be removed after the concrete has gained sufficient strength to
resist damage during the process of removal. Consideration shall be given to
the loads on the concrete, the dead load of the concrete itself, the weather
and other conditions affecting the curing of the mix and the mix itself in
determining the length of time to elapse between the placing of concrete in the
forms and the removal of the forms.
(2) In general, the following periods, exclusive of days when the temperature
falls below forty degrees Fahrenheit (40°F), may be used as a guide for the
removal of form work, subject to the approval of the engineer.
 
Description                        Time Period
Walls                              12 to 24 hours
Sides of beams and other parts     12 to 24 hours
Columns                            1 to 7 days
Suspended slabs and beam centering 7 to 14 days
 
      2.   Concrete Reinforcement:
         a.   General: The contractor shall furnish and place all steel
reinforcement, including rods, welded wire fabric, and structural shapes as
indicated on the drawings or otherwise required. At the time of concrete
placement, all reinforcing shall be free from loose, flaky rust and scale, oil,
grease or any other coating, which might destroy or reduce its bond with the
concrete. All placing shall be done in accordance with drawings furnished by
the contractor and reviewed by the city engineer.
         b.   Fabrication:
(1) In general, detail in fabrication shall follow the manual of standard
practice for detailing reinforcing concrete structures by the American Concrete
Institute. The plans show amounts and placement of reinforcing necessary for
the structure, but some deviation from the plans will be permitted, subject to
review by the city engineer, if the same bar area and perimeter of steel is
present in all concrete sections.
(2) Reinforcement shall be accurately formed to the dimensions indicated on the
plans and the bending details. All bars shall be bent cold. No bending or
straightening shall be done in any manner that will injure the material. Where
splicing of reinforcement is permitted, not less than twenty four (24) bar
diameters shall be overlapped unless otherwise provided by the plans or
elsewhere in the specifications. The minimum overlap for lapped splices in flat
slab construction shall not be less than thirty six (36) bar diameters. Where
special splice details are shown on the plans they shall be strictly followed.
         c.   Placing: The steel shall be placed in position accurately as
shown on the plans or supplemental drawings. The steel shall be secured so that
no displacement shall occur during the placing and compacting of the concrete.
The plans do not show all required tie bars nor do they show chairs or any
other locating devices except in special instances. The fabricator shall take
note of this and shall provide these extra bars and appliances necessary to
accurately hold the reinforcing steel in the positions indicated. After
reinforcement is placed and at least twenty four (24) hours before concrete is
to be poured, the placement of the reinforcement and anchor bolts must be
inspected and approved by the city engineer.
            (1) Galvanized metal chairs shall be used to support reinforcing in
slabs where the slab undersurface will be exposed for ceilings or overhangs.
Splices in bars shall be staggered where possible. Where welded wire fabric is
lapped, the lap shall not be less than one mesh interval in width. When the
steel is placed, it shall be free from dirt, detrimental rust, loose scale,
paint or any other foreign material. The bars shall be tied at all
intersections except where spacing is less than one foot (1') in each direction
in which case alternate intersections may be tied. If welding is required, the
above mentioned requirements shall be supplemented by the requirements of ASWD
12.1, recommended practices for welding reinforcing steel, metal inserts, and
connections in reinforced concrete construction.
            (2) Reinforcement in concrete placed against earth without forming
shall have no less than three inches (3") of concrete between it and the ground
contact surface. Reinforcing in concrete exposed to the weather, or to be in
contact with the ground following the removal of forms, shall be protected with
not less than two inches (2") of concrete for bars larger than no. 5, and one
and one-half inches (11/2") for no. 5 and smaller bars. Reinforcement in
concrete surfaces not exposed directly to the ground or to the weather shall
have not less than three-fourths inch (3/4") of concrete between the
reinforcing steel and the surface for slabs and walls and not less than one and
one-half inches (11/2") for beams and girders. Concrete joist floors in which
the clear distance between joists is not more than thirty inches (30"), the
protection of the reinforcement shall be at least three- fourths inch (3/4").
Columns shall have at least one and one- half inches (11/2") of concrete
outside the column ties or spiral reinforcing.
            (3) The minimum clear distance between parallel bars shall not be
less than one inch (1") or less than one and one-third (11/3) times the maximum
size of the coarse aggregate.
            (4) Where necessary to cut bars for openings and where not shown
otherwise, an equivalent area of steel shall be placed around the opening and
extended on each side sufficiently to develop bond in each bar.
      3.   Embedded Items:
         a.   General: Cooperation and coordination with all other contractors
and/or subcontractors and all trades shall be made in order that all inserts
and fastening devices, such as anchors, hangers, ties, bolts, conduits,
blockouts, water stops, seep rings, nailing strips or any other embedded item
shall be properly located and secured in position before concrete is placed.
         b.   Water Stops: Intersection pieces shall be furnished to form a
continuous seal. Splices shall be made using thermostatically controlled
heating elements in strict accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The
strength of the splice shall be at least fifty percent (50%) of the strength of
the base material.
         c.   Nailing Strips: Nailing strips shall be of a size and shape
indicated on the plans and shall be of Douglas fir, pressure treated after
cutting to size. The type of pressure treatment shall be subject to the
engineer's review.
         d.   Hatches, Manholes And Other Openings: Openings in the concrete
structure shall be as detailed on the drawings or as reviewed by the city
engineer. Where it is necessary to cut steel that would otherwise extend
through the opening, the equivalent amount shall be placed in the slab on each
side of the opening. Where openings are edged with metal inserts or are formed
by the metal inserts themselves, the reinforcing displaced by such opening
outlines or edgings shall be moved to the edges of the openings and extended
beyond the edge of the opening at least thirty (30) bar diameters in each
direction and located and secured in a position and in a manner satisfactory to
the city engineer, unless otherwise defined in the plans.
      4.   Placing Concrete:
         a.   Proportioning: The proportions of water, sand, cement, fine and
coarse aggregate and air entraining agent shall be so determined and fixed as
to produce concrete having the strength and properties specified. Mixes shall
be designated or verified by independent testing laboratories approved by the
city engineer at the owner/developer's expense. Air content in all concrete
shall be held between three percent (3%) and five percent (5%) for mixing and
handling. The water- cement ratio shall not exceed six (6) U.S. gallons per bag
(94 pounds) of cement. Concrete to be placed under water shall have the cement
content increased ten percent (10%) above that normally used for the strength
concrete required. If a change in the proportions of the concrete mix is
necessary to meet changed conditions on the job or to more adequately meet the
requirements of particular portions of the structure being assembled, such
changes shall be promptly complied with.
         b.   Mixing:
(1) All concrete shall be machine mixed. All concrete placed in pours of 0.5
cubic yard or more shall be ready mix concrete, unless otherwise approved by
the city engineer. Ready mix concrete shall be batched and handled by plant and
equipment conforming to ASTM specification C-94. The maximum size of batch in
truck mixers shall not exceed the maximum rated capacity of the mixer as stated
by the manufacturer and stamped in metal on the mixer. Concrete transported in
a truck agitator or other transportation device shall be discharged at the job
and placed in its final position in the forms within one and one-half (11/2)
hours after introduction of the mixing water to the cement and after
introduction of the mixing water to the cement and aggregate, except that in
hot weather or under other conditions contributing to quick stiffening of the
mix, the maximum allowable time may be reduced by the city engineer.
(2) Concrete shall be mixed only in such quantities as is required for
immediate use and any that has begun to develop initial set shall not be used.
Concrete, which has partially hardened, shall not be retempered or remixed, nor
shall materials be batched into a truck partially filled with concrete that was
earlier batched.
         c.   Placing: Water shall be removed from the space to be occupied by
the concrete before it is deposited unless otherwise directed by the city
engineer. Concrete shall be placed to avoid segregation of the materials and
the displacement or movement of the reinforcement. The use of long troughs,
chutes, and pipes for conveying concrete from the mixer to the form will be
permitted only on written authorization of the city engineer. In case an
inferior quality of concrete is produced by the use of such conveyors, the city
engineer may order discontinuance of their use and the substitution of a
satisfactory method of placing. Open troughs and chutes shall be metal or metal
lined, approximately semicircular in cross section and kept clean and free from
coatings of hardened concrete by scraping and/or thoroughly flushing with water
after each run. The water used for flushing shall be discharged clear of the
structure in such a manner as not to contaminate concrete in the forms. Free
drop of the concrete mix from chutes shall not be more than four feet (4'). If
greater fall is entailed in placing concrete to its final position, drop chutes
or elephant trunks shall be used. In walls or other situations where the
placing of concrete requires placing the mix through a net of reinforcing
steel, if the free drop exceeds three feet (3'), drop chutes or elephant trunks
shall be used.
            (1) In high or thin walls, or where concentration of reinforcing
steel occurs, openings shall be provided in the forms in order to facilitate
placement of concrete without segregation. Openings in the forms shall also be
provided where concrete placed above would leave accumulations of hardened
concrete on reinforcing steel and form walls when making multiple pours.
            (2) Concrete shall be worked into the corners and angles of the
forms and around all reinforcement and embedded items without permitting
segregation. Concrete shall be deposited as closely as possible to its final
position on the forms. Placing of concrete in forms shall be done in horizontal
layers approximately eighteen inches (18") thick. When a monolithic layer
cannot be completed in one operation, it shall be terminated as a vertical
bulkhead with a height of newly placed concrete no less than six inches (6").
            (3) Concrete during and immediately after placing shall be
thoroughly compacted by mechanical vibration. Type and design of concrete
vibrators shall be subject to review by the city engineer. Frequency of
vibration shall not be less than four thousand five hundred (4,500) impulses
per minute. The intensity of vibrations shall be such as to visibly affect a
mass of concrete over a radius of at least eighteen inches (18"). The
reinforcing shall not be vibrated, nor shall form work be vibrated except in
special cases and only with written authorization by the city engineer. Insofar
as is practicable, the stinger of the vibrator shall be inserted into the newly
deposited concrete vertically and points of vibration and length of vibration
shall be such as to completely work the concrete into all spaces within the
form work and to allow the discharge of all entrapped bubbles of air. Vibration
shall not be continued at any single point for such duration of time that
localized areas of grout are formed. Vibration shall not be used to cause the
concrete to flow in the forms to an extent where segregation becomes possible,
nor shall vibrators be used for transport of concrete within the forms.
Vibration shall be supplemented by such spading as is necessary to ensure
smooth surfaces and dense concrete along form surfaces and in corners and
locations impossible to reach with the vibrators.
            (4) Concrete shall be deposited at such a rate as to prevent the
formation of cold joints in the pour. Should a sloping wall be placed in
several lifts, the edges of succeeding pours shall not be feathered out, but
blockouts shall be made in the top surface of the concrete in each lift to the
extent that a minimum depth of six inches (6") of concrete is deposited in each
lift. Work shall not be stopped within eighteen inches (18") of the top of any
face unless natural features of the work indicate a discontinuity at which the
pour line may be hidden. Concrete in columns shall be placed in one continuous
operation unless otherwise directed. A time interval of at least twelve (12)
hours shall elapse before the caps are placed. Concrete in tee beam
construction, or in slabs having integral beams, may be placed in two (2) lifts
or in one single operation. If the concrete is placed in one operation, it
shall be placed in two (2) stages. Concrete shall be deposited first in the
stem of the beams and compacted. After the lapse of approximately forty five
(45) minutes, the concrete in the slabs shall be placed. Vibration of the slab
shall include inserting the probe of the vibrator at least half its length into
the beam in order to thoroughly knit the two (2) pours. If the concrete is
placed to the top of the beams and allowed to harden before placing the slab,
special care shall be used in ensuring adequate bond between the stem and the
slab. Shear keys shall be used as required, and the size and spacing of shear
keys between the stem and slab shall be computed. Suitable keys may be formed
by the use of wood blocks cut from two inch by four inch (2" x 4") dimension
lumber having a length approximately four inches (4") less than the width of
the girder stem. These blocks shall be spaced along the girder stem as required
to form keys, but the spacing shall be not greater than one foot (1') center to
center. The blocks shall be leveled to facilitate removal from the concrete and
shall be removed as soon as the concrete has set sufficiently to hold its form.
No treatment shall be used on these blocks.
            (5) Prior to depositing new concrete on or against concrete which
has achieved its initial set, the forms shall be retightened and the surface of
the hardened concrete prepared to receive the new concrete in order that proper
bond shall be made between the two (2) pours. All foreign matter shall be
removed. No loosened particles of aggregate or damaged concrete shall be left
on the surface. Areas contaminated with form oils or any other material that
would inhibit proper bonding between the pours shall be chipped away in such a
manner which will not impair the integrity of that concrete which is left
following the preparation for the new pour. To improve bond and to prevent the
formation of unsightly pour joints, grout shall be placed on all concrete
surfaces against which new concrete will be placed. On horizontal surfaces,
approximately one inch (1") of grout made by mixing sand and cement of the
ratio in the concrete to be placed, mixed with just enough water to make
possible proper placing, shall be used. On vertical surfaces, a neat cement
slurry shall be broomed into the surface immediately prior to placing the next
pour.
            (6) The foundation upon which the portland concrete is to be placed
shall be properly compacted and brought to true line and grade as shown in the
contract plans or as directed by the city engineer. The foundation shall be
frost free and shall not have freestanding water pockets. Prior to placement of
concrete, the foundation shall be dampened to a depth of at least three inches
(3"). Concrete placed during raining conditions must be fully protected during
the placing operation and for at least twenty four (24) hours after placing.
      5.   Finishing:
         a.   General: The appearance of exposed concrete is of major
importance. Concrete requiring finishing shall not be placed until materials,
tools and labor necessary for the work are on the job. All horizontal surfaces
shall be steel trowel finished unless otherwise specified or otherwise
authorized by the city engineer in writing.
         b.   Walls: Immediately following the removal of forms, all form ties
shall be broken back at least one-half inch (1/2") behind the finished face of
the concrete and all form tie holes, all rock pockets and other defects pointed
up with a dry tamped in mixture of one part cement to two (2) parts fine sand.
Where pullout snap ties are used, the hole shall be filled as recommended by
the manufacturer of the ties. The surface of the cavity to be patched shall be
thoroughly wet before the patching mixture is applied. Following this, all form
marks and pointings shall be ground or rubbed to give a reasonably smooth
surface without pits, depressions or obvious irregularities and the surfaces
then rubbed and sacked to a smooth even finish.
         c.   Floors And Roof Slabs:
(1) Slabs shall be finished as noted on the plans or called out elsewhere in
the specifications. No dusting of wet surfaces with dry material shall be done
unless specifically called out otherwise. Slabs shall be thoroughly compacted
by tamping or by vibration. Preparatory to finishing, floor slabs shall be
struck off true to the required level shown on the plans. Floors shall be level
with a tolerance of one-eighth inch (1/8") in ten feet (10'), except where
drains occur, in which case the floors shall be pitched to the drains as
indicated on the plans. All discontinuous edges shall be rounded off with a
suitable edging tool. Unless otherwise specified, floors and slabs shall be
finished by being wood floated to a true even plane with no coarse aggregate
visible subsequent to being struck off. Sufficient pressure shall be used on
the wood float to bring moisture to the surface. When surface moisture has
disappeared, the concrete shall be hand troweled to a smooth impervious surface
free from trowel marks. The surface shall be burnished by a second troweling.
The final troweling shall produce a ringing sound from the trowel. No dry
cement shall be used in troweling nor shall the amount of troweling be
excessive. Slabs receiving fill concrete or settling beds of mortar or grout
surfacing shall be finished by tamping the concrete to force the coarse
aggregate away from the surface, screeded to bring the surface to the required
finish plane, and the surface left clean for subsequent work. Exterior slabs
and ramps and any other surface called out on the plans or in the
specifications as having a wood float surface shall be finished as for a steel
trowel finish, but the steel troweling not done. Where a broomed finish is
specified or called out on the plans, the concrete shall be finished as for
steel trowel finish except for the final troweling. The surface shall be
finished by drawing a fine hair broom lightly across the surface. All brooming
shall be in the same direction and parallel to expansion joints or in the case
of inclined slabs, perpendicular to the slope. Special surface finishes will be
as described elsewhere in these specifications or on the approved construction
plans.
            (2) Concrete slabs, the under surfaces of which act as ceilings or
overhangs and are exposed to view, shall have defects repaired and ground to a
reasonably true and even surface prior to painting or other surface treatment
specified on the plans or elsewhere herein. Where no surface treatment is
called out, care shall be taken to ensure that the packing, pointing or other
repair is the same color as the rest of the exposed concrete.
      6.   Construction Joints: The locations of construction and expansion
joints are indicated on the plans. These may be changed upon request by the
contractor, but only upon approval by the city engineer. Decisions in regards
to construction joint changes will be based on the need for the joint at the
place proposed and the final service requirements of the structure. The
contractor shall submit a schedule for the placement of all concrete, outlining
therein the sequence of his pouring operations and locations of all desired
construction and expansion joints. Construction joints not indicated on the
plans must be made and located as to least impair the strength of the
structure. The contractor shall place no concrete prior to receiving approval
of his schedule for placement of concrete.
         a.   Premolded joint fillers shall be placed in the forms at the
proper position before concrete is placed and fastening devices used to hold it
following the first pour. Unless otherwise indicated, expansion joints shall be
formed by one- fourth inch (1/4") thick premolded joint filler and in those
areas indicated, the top one-half inch (1/2") shall be removed and replaced by
an approved asphaltic base expansion joint filler after appropriate priming of
the joint in accordance with the expansion joint sealer manufacturer's
specifications. Where a Thiokol base joint sealant is indicated on the plans,
it shall be one-fourth inch (1/4") thick and as approved by the city engineer.
         b.   Where contraction joints are indicated, one-half (1/2) the steel
through the joints shall be interrupted at the joint. Where water stops are
indicated, they shall be carefully positioned and held in place so that half
the water stop is located on each side of the joint centerline, special care
being taken when placing concrete around them in order that all portions are
equally and thoroughly embedded in the concrete. All construction joints in
basins holding liquid or gas shall be provided with water stops unless noted or
shown otherwise on the plans. Water stops shall be held in place by the use of
split forms or other approved methods in such a manner that no displacement
will occur during the placing and compacting of the concrete. Nails may be
driven into the forms and bent over the water stop to hold it in position, but
in no case shall any nail be driven through a water stop.
         c.   Asphaltic joint sealing compounds, which are poured in place,
shall not be placed until all other concrete adjacent has been poured. Joints
shall be thoroughly cleaned, dry and primed according to the asphalt filler
manufacturer's instructions before placement.
      7.   Blockouts: Unless otherwise noted, if the contractor chooses to
facilitate his operations by leaving blockouts in concrete walls where pipe or
conduit pass through them, such will be allowed subject to review by the city
engineer. Blockouts shall be no larger than required to locate the pipe and/or
conduit, in general, nor more than two inches (2") larger than the largest
dimension of the item passing through the wall. After the items are accurately
placed and securely braced to prevent motion during subsequent operations, the
contacting surfaces of the previously placed concrete shall be prepared so as
to ensure proper bonding of the new concrete and that concrete previously
placed. Where required, particularly in areas, which must withstand hydraulic
pressure, a nonshrink aggregate such as Embeco shall be added to the mix used
to fill the blockout. Such concrete shall be thoroughly compacted using
vibration or rodding in order to achieve a watertight joint between the old
concrete, the new concrete and the pipe or conduit. If a form is used for the
closure, it shall be constructed having a pouring funnel and the new concrete
so placed so that a portion remains in the pouring funnel and the surface
ground to a smooth even face subsequent to the removal of the form. Where
possible, the placing of concrete and blockout shall be done from the pressure
side. Special care shall be taken in such areas to keep them thoroughly wet for
a period of at least seven (7) days. With the city engineer's review, blockouts
may be dry packed using a nonshrink grout. The mixture shall be made up in
accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer of the nonshrink aggregate
and carefully tamped into place, preferably from the pressure side of the
opening. Appropriate backing boards shall be provided to facilitate proper
tamping. Blockouts in areas that are not required to withstand hydraulic
pressure may be dry packed with a plain sand-cement mix.
      8.   Swept In Surfaces: Where a concrete slab is to have grout swept in
by a mechanism, such grout shall consist of a one to two (1:2) ratio of
portland cement to sand mix with sufficient water to make possible its placing.
Prior to placing any grout, all material shall be removed from the surface of
the rough concrete slab receiving the topping and the surface thoroughly
cleaned and washed. It shall be kept constantly wet for a period of at least
twenty four (24) hours prior to the placing of grout. It shall be damp but have
no standing water on it when a water-cement slurry is broomed into the surface.
Before the slurry has a chance to take a set, the grout shall be placed and
swept to the required contour by rotating the mechanism until the surface
conforms accurately to the required contour. The mechanism manufacturer's
instructions shall be strictly adhered to regarding the application of power
during the screeding and sweeping in of the grout mix. Following this, the
grout shall be steel troweled to a smooth even finish. When sufficiently hard,
the entire surface shall be flooded and covered with water for a period of at
least seven (7) days. The surface shall be prevented from drying while
hardening by dampening with a fine spray as required.
      9.   Curing, Sealer And Treatments: Concrete shall be kept moist for a
period of at least seven (7) days following placing where normal portland
cement (type I) is used, or three (3) days when high-early strength cement
(type III) is used, unless otherwise specified. This may be accomplished by
keeping the forms moist or applying an approved sealing compound or by flushing
or sprinkling or otherwise applying water to the hardened concrete. In any
case, the method used shall be subject to the city engineer's approval.
      10.   Cold Weather Placement Of Concrete: Adequate equipment shall be
provided for heating the concrete materials and protecting the concrete during
freezing or near freezing weather. All reinforcement, forms, fillers and ground
with which the concrete is to come in contact shall be free from frost. All
cold weather concrete construction shall conform to the latest revision of the
American Concrete Institute (ACI) standard ACI 306, cold weather concreting.
      11.   Tests:
         a.   Test Cylinders:
(1) Where there is a total of more than twenty (20) cubic yards of concrete in
the work or where the local building code requires, the contractor shall take
four (4) test cylinders for each fifty (50) cubic yards of concrete placed, or
from each major pour if the amount is less than fifty (50) cubic yards. Two (2)
test cylinders are to be cured under the job conditions and two (2) in an
approved commercial testing laboratory. Two (2) cylinders shall be tested for
compressive strength at seven (7) days and two (2) at twenty eight (28) days.
Making and curing the test cylinders shall conform to ASTM C-31, and testing
shall conform to ASTM C-39. Two (2) copies of all test reports shall be
furnished to the engineer by the testing laboratory.
(2) If the concrete fails to meet the twenty eight (28) day strength
requirements, removal of the concrete may be required, or approved alternate
strength tests may be permitted. Alternate tests, such as coring, may be made
upon approval by the city engineer to determine the acceptability of the
concrete in question.
         b.   Air Entrainment: The concrete shall be tested for the amount of
entrained air therein according to the applicable ASTM specification.
         c.   Slump: Concrete will be tested for slump in accordance with ASTM
C-143 at the job site by or under the direction of the engineer. In general,
the slump shall fall within the range indicated in the table below. At least
one slump test shall be taken for each ready mix truck of concrete.

Aggregate shall have a cleanness factor of not less than seventy five (75). At
least seventy percent (70%) by weight of the particles retained on the no. 4
sieve shall have one fractured face or more. The aggregate shall not show a
loss of more than thirty percent (30%) in the Los Angeles abrasion test,
grading C. When tested in accordance with AASHTO T-182, aggregate shall have a
retained film above ninety five percent (95%). Aggregate shall be applied at a
rate of twenty eight (28) pounds per square yard.
   C.   Workmanship:
      1.   Asphalt shall not be applied when the roadway surface or weather
conditions would prevent satisfactory construction. Seal coating shall not be
undertaken unless the ambient temperature is above seventy degrees Fahrenheit
(70°F) and the pavement surface temperature is below one hundred forty four
degrees Fahrenheit (144°F), unless authorized in writing. Seal coats shall be
applied no later than August 31 and not prior to June 15 of each year. Plant
mix pavement shall cure a minimum of ten (10) days before a seal coat is
applied.
      2.   Roadways shall be clean and dried prior to asphalt application.
Approaches shall be sealed before sealing the asphalt roadway. All cracks shall
be routered and filled with approved material prior to application of the seal
coat. Asphalt shall not be spread until the surface has been cleaned and the
section to be sealed has been approved.
      3.   Asphalt shall be applied by means of a pressure distributor in a
uniform, continuous spread over the section to be treated and within the
temperature range specified. A strip of building paper three feet (3') wide and
one foot (1') wider than the distributor spray bar shall be used at the
beginning of each spread. If the cutoff is not positive, the use of paper may
be required at the end of each spread. The distributor shall be moved forward
at proper application speed at the time the spray bar is opened. Any skipped
areas or deficiencies shall be corrected. Junctions of spreads shall be
carefully made to assure a smooth surface. The length of the asphalt spread
shall not be in excess of that which trucks loaded with aggregate can
immediately cover. Meet lines shall be allowed within one foot (1') of lane
lines. Under no circumstances will meet lines be allowed within a wheel path.
The spread of asphalt shall not be more than six inches (6") wider than the
width covered by the aggregate from the spreading device. Under no
circumstances shall operations proceed in such manner that the asphalt will be
allowed to chill, set up, or otherwise impair retention of the aggregate. The
distributor, when not spreading, shall be parked so that the spray bar or
mechanism will not drip on the surface.
      4.   Immediately following the application of the asphalt, aggregate
shall be spread in quantities as designated. Spreading shall be accomplished in
such a manner that the tires of the trucks or aggregate spreader at no time
contact the uncovered asphalt.
      5.   If directed, the aggregate shall be moistened with water to
eliminate or reduce the dust coating of the aggregate.
      6.   Immediately after the aggregate material is spread, deficient areas
shall be covered by additional material. Rolling shall begin immediately behind
the spreader and shall be continued until four (4) complete coverages are
obtained. Rolling shall be completed prior to allowing traffic to use the new
surface. The contractor's equipment shall not be operated at a speed that turns
or displaces the aggregate. Only pneumatic tire rollers shall be used with a
weight displacement of two hundred (200) to three hundred fifty (350) pounds
per inch of roller width. Turning of equipment, which displaces or turns the
aggregate, will not be permitted. Prior to brooming, it may be necessary to
apply approved reject material over the surface as directed to absorb any free
asphalt. Excess aggregate shall be swept from the entire roadway surface by
means of rotary brooms. Brooming shall be done by the morning following the
previous day's seal coat application unless otherwise directed. Brooming shall
be conducted so as not to displace embedded material. In curb and gutter
section, excess material shall be picked up and disposed of as directed.
      7.   The brooms shall be in good condition and capable of sweeping a path
at least seventy inches (70") wide without loosening or displacing embedded
materials. The surface shall be swept when ordered.
      8.   Where brooming operations could create dust to the extent that it
would violate air pollution regulations or create a safety hazard, the surface
of the roadway to be swept shall be lightly sprayed with enough water to
prevent dust from becoming airborne.
      9.   Brooming aggregate from the surface onto maintained shoulder
foreslope areas will not be permitted where the adjacent property owner cares
for the area and maintains turf or landscape. All loose aggregate material
shall be immediately swept, removed from the site and disposed of in a manner
acceptable to the city of Hailey. (Ord. 1116, 2012)

toe of fills, on the downhill side of large cut through areas, natural drainage
areas, at grade breaks on cut/fill slopes, or as shown on the construction
drawings.
      2.   Construct silt fencing after tree removal and before any excavating
or soil disturbing activities commence.
      3.   The fences must remain in place until the disturbed area is
stabilized.
      4.   Design configuration:
         a.   Maximum drainage area: 0.25 acre per one hundred feet (100') of
fence length.
         b.   Maximum slope steepness above fence: One to one (1:1) grade.
         c.   Minimum toe in depth: Six inches (6").
         d.   Post spacing: Eight feet (8') maximum with wire support fence,

         c.   Prior to connecting the water service clamp to the water main,
the contractor shall clean the exterior of the main of dirt or other foreign
matter that may impair the quality of the completed connection. The contractor
shall provide the necessary tapping machines for making the connections, and he
shall furnish the miscellaneous materials required for making the taps. Place
the service clamp at the desired location and clamp tight by tightening
alternate nuts progressively. Do not place service clamp within one foot (1')
of pipe joint or other clamp. Taps shall be made in the pipe by experienced
workmen using tools in good repair with the proper adapters for the size main
being tapped. Copper tube for services shall be one piece for runs less than
sixty feet (60') in length. All components of a service connection shall be the
same size as the nominal designation of the service pipe. The copper tubing
shall be cut with square ends, reamed, cleaned, and made up tightly. Care shall
be taken to prevent the tube from kinking or buckling on short radius bends.
Kinked or buckled sections of copper tube shall not be cut out and spliced. A
new copper tube shall be installed from the corporation stop to the meter vault
at the contractor's expense.
         d.   Service connections installed during new construction shall be
pressure tested with the water main. Service connections installed on existing
water mains shall be pressure tested at the normal hydrostatic main pressure
and visually inspected for leaks before backfilling. Service connections shall
be sterilized at the same time as the main line by opening the valve at the
meter vault to flush, then closed.
         e.   Prior to backfilling, a steel fence post of sufficient length to
extend at least four feet (4') above finish grade shall be placed at the end of
the completed service for a marker. The top of the post shall be spray painted
blue.
      5.   Pressure Testing:
         a.   Pressure and leakage tests shall be made on all newly laid pipe
or any valved section of it, or both. The city engineer will observe the tests,
and the contractor shall furnish all necessary equipment, labor and material,
and shall make all taps in the pipe as required. The contractor shall provide a
minimum twenty four (24) hours' notice to the city water superintendent prior
to testing.
         b.   The contractor will be required to furnish water for testing.
         c.   The tests shall be conducted after the trench has been
backfilled. Where any section of pipe is provided with concrete thrust
blocking, the pressure test shall not be made until at least five (5) days have
elapsed after the concrete thrust blocking is installed. If high early cement
is used for the concrete thrust blocking, the time may be cut to two (2) days
instead of the five (5) previously specified.
         d.   The pressure test shall be conducted in the following manner:
After the pipe has been backfilled, the pipe shall be filled with water. The
test pressure shall be one and one-half (11/2) times the normal static
pressure, but not less than one hundred fifty (150) pounds per square inch.
         e.   The duration of each pressure test shall be a minimum of two (2)
hours, or as specified by the city engineer or his representative.
         f.   Before applying the specified test pressure, all air shall be
expelled from the pipe.
         g.   Each valved section of pipe shall be slowly filled with water to
replace any water lost; and the specified test pressure, measured at the point
of lowest elevation, shall be applied by means of a pump connected to the pipe
in a satisfactory manner.
         h.   The pump shall then be valved off, and the pressure shall be held
in the line for the test period. At the end of the test period, the pump shall
be operated until the test pressure is again attained. The pump suction shall
be through a meter so that the amount of water required to restore the test
pressure may be measured accurately.
         i.   Leakage shall be defined as the quantity of water necessary to
restore the specified test pressure at the end of the test period. The pipe
installation will not be accepted until the leakage is less than the number of
gallons per hour as determined by the formula following:
 
L = ND (P)1/2 in which
7400           
 
L = Allowable leakage in gallons per hour
N = Number of joints in the length of pipe tested
D = Nominal diameter of pipe in inches
P = Average test pressure during the leakage test in pounds per square inch
 
Should any test of pipe laid disclose leakage greater than that allowed above,
the contractor shall, at his own expense, locate and repair the defective
joints or pipe until the leakage is within the specified allowance.
      6.   Disinfection:
         a.   Sterilization of new lines shall be completed by the contractor
prior to connection to the existing system. Only chemicals in conformance with
NSF-60 shall be used.
         b.   Prior to chlorination, all dirt and foreign matter shall be
flushed from the line. Water shall then be fed slowly into the new line with
chlorine applied in amounts to produce a dosage of forty (40) to fifty (50)
ppm. Treated water shall be retained in the pipe for at least twenty four (24)
hours. A residual of not less than twenty five (25) ppm shall be produced in
all parts of the line after the twenty four (24) hour period.
         c.   Operate all valves, hydrants and other appurtenances during
sterilization to assure that the sterilizing mixture is dispersed into all
parts of the line, including dead ends, new services, and similar areas that
otherwise may not receive the treated water.
         d.   Chlorine tablets may be used with prior approval. Tablets shall
be attached to the top of each pipe with PVC cement or honey. Adequate tablets
shall be installed to provide a chlorine dosage of forty (40) to fifty (50)
ppm.
         e.   After chlorination, flush the water from the line until the water
through the line is equal chemically and bacteriologically to the permanent
source of supply.
         f.   Dispose of sterilizing water in an approved manner. Do not allow
sterilizing water to flow into a waterway without adequate dilution or other
satisfactory method of reducing chlorine concentrations to a safe level.
         g.   After final flushing and before the water main is placed in
service, test samples collected from the main(s) for coliform bacteria. Take
two (2) samples from each location at least twenty four (24) hours apart.
         h.   Unless otherwise directed by the engineer, collect samples from
each one thousand two hundred feet (1,200') of the new main and one from each
branch.
         i.   The contractor is directed to cooperate with the city in draining
the water system after sterilization procedures are complete, and closing off
dead end lines as directed by the city engineer before filling the system with
potable water.

   C.   Execution:
      1.   Pipe:
         a.   All pipe and fittings shall be carefully inspected before being
laid, and no cracked, broken, or defective pipe or fittings shall be used in
the work. The ends of the pipe shall be cleaned with a brush, washed, and
thoroughly scrubbed where necessary to remove dirt or other foreign material.
         b.   Extreme care shall be exercised to ensure that the inside surface
of the bell is smooth and free from any projections, which would interfere with
the assembly or watertightness of the joint.
         c.   Proper implements, tools, and facilities shall be provided and
used by the contractor for the safe and proper protection of the work. When
such damaged pipe cannot be repaired to the satisfaction of the city engineer
or his representative, it shall not be used in the work. The pipe shall be
carefully lowered in the trench to prevent damage to the pipe. Under no
circumstances shall pipe be dropped or dumped in trenches. Foreign matter and
dirt shall be removed from the inside of the pipe before it is lowered into the
trench, and it shall be kept clean by approved means during and after laying.
         d.   Maximum deviation from true line or grade shall be three- eighths
inch (3/8").
         e.   Measurement for grade shall be taken at the pipe invert, not at
the top of pipe, because of permissible variation in pipe wall thickness.
         f.   Grade and line shall be established from batter boards set along
the trench at maximum fifty foot (50') intervals or a laser. The engineer shall
provide offset stakes for the line and grade of the sewer main.
         g.   Sufficient pressure shall be applied in making the joint to
assure that the joint is home as defined in the standard installation
instructions provided by the pipe manufacturer. Sufficient restraint shall be
applied to the line to assure that joints, once home, are held so by tamping
fill material under and alongside the pipe or otherwise. At the end of the
day's work, the end of the last pipe shall be blocked in such a manner as may
be required to prevent creep and shall be tightly plugged to prevent entrance
of dirt, vermin or debris into the pipe.
      2.   Manholes:
         a.   The concrete base for the precast manhole shall be constructed so
that the first section of the precast manhole has a uniform bearing throughout
the full circumference of the manhole wall. Sufficient mortar shall be
deposited on the concrete base to provide a watertight seal between the base
and the manhole wall. Pipe shall not be inserted into manhole bases in manner
that negatively affects the performance of any gaskets or creates an
obstruction to smooth flow.
         b.   Preformed plastic sealing gaskets shall be placed on the groove
of the lower section of pipe prior to placing the next section of pipe. After
all the sections are in place, the excess sealing compound shall be trimmed off
prior to finishing. The entire joint shall be filled with mortar and troweled
to a smooth finish.
         c.   The cast iron manhole frames and covers shall be installed and
grouted on the tops of the manhole so as to positively prevent any infiltration
of surface or ground water into the manholes. The manhole frame and concrete
collar shall be set using Whirlygigs as shown in the Hailey standard drawing,
subsection
18.14.010C1 of this title. Pipe clamps on rubber boots shall be torqued to the
manufacturer's specifications (60 in/lb. typ.).
      3.   Sewer Service Connections:
         a.   Sewer service connection shall be constructed and located in
accordance with the approved construction plans and Hailey standard drawings.
Service connections to the main shall be wyes for all new construction.
Services shall not be connected to manholes. To the greatest extent possible,
services shall be laid perpendicular or radial to the street from the center of
the lot to the sewer main. Install the sewer wye so as to locate the connection
pipe within a horizontal distance of one foot (1') either side of the
preselected locations staked by the engineer. Batter boards will not be
required, but lay the pipe uniformly between the wye or the top of the riser
section and the stake. Where minimum slopes are used, lay the pipe by means of
a good quality builder's level, not less than twenty four inches (24") in
length. Minimum slope shall be one-fourth inch (1/4") per foot, unless
otherwise permitted by the city engineer, but in no case less than one-eighth
inch (1/8") per foot.
         b.   Wye size shall be four inch (4") diameter for single service
unless otherwise indicated on the approved construction plans and shall be
terminated with a bell and plug. The plug shall be an approved PVC plug or a
neoprene plug. Tees are not permitted for service connections to sewer mains.
         c.   In some instances where the sewer main is deeper than required
for a specific service connection, the service stub may be set either
vertically or at forty five degrees (45°) with one or more sections of straight
pipe placed prior to the one-eighth (1/8) bend. When the service stub is set
vertically, there will be required a one-fourth (1/4) bend in place of the one-
eighth (1/8) bend.
         d.   The contractor is cautioned to use extreme care in backfilling
around the sewer service connection and sewer service pipe to assure a
watertight joint when complete. The sewer service connection and its sewer
service pipe extension shall be included in the air or hydrostatic test of the
main sewer pipe.
         e.   Sewer service connections to existing sewer pipe shall be made
with Romac universal CB sewer saddle or equivalent.
         f.   A steel fence post of sufficient length to extend at least four
feet (4') above finished grade shall be placed at the end of the completed
service for a marker. The top of the post shall be spray painted green. A #12
copper wire, thermally insulated, shall be tied to the bottom of the post and
attached to the end of the sewer service.
         g.   Backfill shall not be done until both the engineer and the
contractor have made accurate field measurements, as to the exact location of
each service connection for filing on the record drawings.
         h.   All excavation and backfill shall be done in accordance with
chapter 18.12, "Excavation And Backfill", of this title.
      4.   Tests And Inspections: Following backfill, all pipes will be tested
for deflection with a five percent (5%) tolerance "Go-No-Go" gauge. All pipe
failing the test shall be reinstalled.
         a.   Air Tests For Sewer Lines:
            (1) The contractor shall air test all of the sewer lines after
backfilling and compacting of the trenches and shall furnish all equipment and
personnel required to perform the tests.
            (2) To facilitate the detection of any leaks that may have occurred
during the pipe laying operation, the contractor may, at his option, air test
any or all of the sewer lines prior to backfilling. However, this test will be
in addition to the required air test following the backfilling and compaction
of the trench.
            (3) The low pressure air test is a test that determines the rate at
which air under pressure leaves an isolated section of pipeline. This rate
indicates the presence or absence of pipe damage and/or pipe or poor quality.
The test procedure is described as follows:
   (A) The section of pipe to be tested is plugged at each end. The ends of all
branches, laterals, and wyes which are to be included in the test are sealed or
plugged. All plugs shall be carefully braced to prevent slippage and blowout
due to internal pressure. One of the plugs provided must have an inlet tap or
other provision for connecting an air hose.
   (B) Connect one end of the air hose to the inlet tap on the plug and connect
the other end of the hose to portable air control equipment. The air control
equipment shall consist of pressure gauges and valves used to control the rate
at which the air flows to the test section and to monitor the air pressure
inside the pipe. The air control equipment can then be connected to a source of
air supply such as a portable air compressor.
   (C) After the air hoses are properly connected, inject air into the test
section. Monitor the air pressure so that the pressure inside the pipe does not
exceed five (5.0) psi gauge (psig).
   (D) When the pressure inside the test section reaches four (4.0) psig,
throttle the air supply so that the internal pressure is maintained between
four (4.0) and three and one-half (3.5) psig for at least two (2) minutes.
These two (2) minutes allow time for the temperature of the air to come to
equilibrium with the pipe walls.
   (E) After the temperature has been allowed to stabilize for the two (2)
minute period, the air supply should be disconnected, and the pressure allowed
to decrease to three and one-half (3.5) psig. At three and one-half (3.5) psig,
a stopwatch is to be started to determine the time required for the pressure to
drop to three (3.0) psig.
   (F) The section of pipeline being tested shall be considered acceptable if
the time required in seconds for the pressure to decrease from three and one-
half (3.5) to three (3.0) psig is equal to or greater than that shown in table
I, the current edition of the ISPWC specifications, section 501, Gravity
Sewers.
            (4) The contractor shall provide a minimum of twenty four (24)
hours' notice to the city wastewater superintendent prior to testing.
         b.   Manhole Leakage Test: One of the following tests shall be
performed:
            (1) Hydrostatic Testing: When the groundwater table is too low to
permit visual detection of leaks, project manholes may be required to be
hydrostatically tested. The city engineer shall determine if this test will be
performed. The test shall consist of plugging all inlets and outlets and
filling the manhole with water to a height determined by the city engineer.
Leakage in each manhole shall not exceed 0.1 gallon per hour per foot of head
above the invert. A manhole may be filled twenty four (24) hours prior to time
of testing, if desired, to permit normal absorption into the pipe walls to take
place. Repair all manholes that do not meet the leakage test, or are
unsatisfactory from visual inspection, to conform to the requirements herein.
            (2) Vacuum Testing: Vacuum testing shall conform to the latest
edition of the ISPWC standards, section 502, Manholes.
         c.   Final Sewer Cleaning:
            (1) Prior to final acceptance and final televised manhole to
manhole inspection of the sewer system by the engineer, flush and clean all
parts of the system both pressure and gravity. Remove all accumulated
construction debris, rocks, gravel, sand, silt, and other foreign material from
the sewer system at or near the closest downstream manhole. If necessary, use
mechanical rodding or bucketing equipment.
            (2) Upon the engineer's final manhole to manhole inspection of the
sewer system, if any foreign matter is still present in the system, clean the
sections and portions of the lines as required.
         d.   TV Inspection: The city shall perform a televised inspection of
the installed sewer main upon twenty four (24) hour notice from the contractor.
A dye will be introduced into the pipe during the videotaping. Any sag in the
pipe greater than one-half inch (1/2") shall be corrected.
      5.   Connection To Existing Manholes: Pipes connected to existing
manholes will not be allowed to enter above the shelf such that sewage will
flow across the shelf prior to entering the channel of the manhole. The
existing manhole base must be core drilled such that the new pipe will enter
the manhole with the invert of the new pipe 0.1 foot above the invert of the
channel. A rubber boot, approved by the city engineer will be required for the
new pipe. A new channel shall be constructed from the new pipe to the existing
channel. The new channel shall be finished with grout to provide smooth flow
into and through the existing manhole.
      6.   Special Manhole: Construct special manholes in conformance with
applicable portions of these specifications and as shown on the Hailey standard
drawing, subsection
18.14.010C2 of this title.
      7.   Interconnection Control:
         a.   There shall be no physical connection between a public or private
potable water supply system and a sewer, or appurtenance thereto, which would
permit the passage of any sewage or polluted water into the potable supply.
         b.   Requirements for a cross connection control program are outlined
in the Idaho regulations for public drinking water system latest edition,
published by the department of environmental quality. (Ord. 1116, 2012)
CHAPTER 18.12
EXCAVATION AND BACKFILL
SECTION:
18.12.010: Excavation And Backfill
18.12.010: EXCAVATION AND BACKFILL:
   A.   General: This section includes the requirements for excavation, pipe
bedding and backfilling for pipelines, services and appurtenances.
   B.   Materials:
      1.   Type I pipe bedding shall be in accordance with type I pipe bedding
per the current edition of the Idaho standards for public works construction,
section 305, Pipe Bedding. Pea gravel and poorly or uniformly graded crushed
stone shall not be allowed.
      2.   Type II pipe bedding shall be in accordance with type II pipe
bedding per the current edition of the Idaho standards for public works
construction, section 305, Pipe Bedding.
   C.   Execution:
      1.   Clearing The Right Of Way: Where clearing of the right of way is
necessary, it shall be completed prior to the start of the trenching. Brush
shall be cut as near to the surface of the ground as practicable and removed to
an approved disposal area. The contractor shall observe all federal and state
laws relating to hauling permits and local regulations relating to burning and/
or otherwise disposing of such materials. Under no conditions shall excavated
materials be permitted to cover brush prior to clearing and removing same.
      2.   Obstructions: This item shall refer to obstructions that may be
removed and do not require replacements. Obstructions to the construction of
the trench, such as, but not limited to, tree roots, stumps, abandoned concrete
structures, and debris of all types shall be removed by the contractor. The
city engineer may, if requested by the engineer, allow changes in alignment to
avoid major obstructions if such alignment changes can be made without
adversely affecting the intended functioning of the facility.
      3.   Removal Of Topsoil:
         a.   In all cases where trenches cross cultivated fields or other
areas on which topsoil exists, the topsoil shall first be removed for the depth
of twelve inches (12") for the full width of the trench to be excavated. This
topsoil shall be stockpiled to one side of the right of way and not mixed with
the remaining excavated material. The topsoil shall be replaced in the top one
foot (1') of the backfilled trench.
         b.   The surface of the trench and other disturbed areas shall be
brought to a true and even grade to match the adjacent lawn or cultivated
areas. All rocks, debris, roots, clods and deleterious material unearthed or
encountered shall be removed and disposed of. The finished surface shall be
free from humps, depressions and other irregularities.
      4.   Trenches:
         a.   Trench excavation shall be to line and grade as established by
the engineer. The bottom width of the trench shall be as shown on the city of
Hailey standard drawings for the size of pipe installed.
         b.   The trenches shall be adequately and properly timbered or shored
and constructed in conformance with all applicable regulations. It shall be the
contractor's responsibility to provide and install all shoring, sheeting and
bracing, and he shall be responsible for the adequacy of the same. Where the
bottom of the trench encounters a material which, in the opinion of the city
engineer or his representative, is unstable and not adequate to provide a
suitable foundation for the pipe, the trench shall be over excavated to remove
the unstable material and then backfilled with an approved pipe bedding
material to bring the bottom of the trench back up to grade. Excavation shall
extend to at least four inches (4") below the line of the pipe bell and then
backfilled with an approved pipe bedding material to form a cradle for the
pipe. The final or finished grade, including bell holes, shall be made just
ahead of pipe laying. All irregularities in the trench bottom shall be removed
by appropriate excavation and backfilled to provide a minimum of four inches
(4") of pipe bedding material under the pipe. Bell holes shall be excavated for
bell and spigot pipe of sufficient dimensions to permit pipe laying to work
freely and to positively avoid the bell carrying any weight or loading stresses
and so that the pipe shall have a firm bearing of not less than three-fourths
(3/4) of the length of the barrel. Trenches shall be kept free of water until
the pipe is laid, joints completed, and thereafter until jointing material is
adequately set.
      5.   Location Of Excavated Materials: During trench excavation, the
contractor shall locate the excavated material so it will not completely
obstruct a traveled street or roadway. Unless otherwise approved by the city
engineer, all streets and roadways shall be kept open to at least one-way
traffic.
      6.   Removal Of Water: The contractor shall provide and maintain ample
means and devices with which to promptly remove and dispose of all water
entering the trench excavation during the time the trench is being prepared for
the pipe laying, during the laying of the pipe, and until the backfill at the
pipe zone has been completed. The contractor shall dispose of the water in a
suitable manner without damage to adjacent property, drainageways or irrigation
ditches.
      7.   Gravel Bedding For Foundation Stabilization: If trenches are
hampered by unstable, wet parent material or excessive water on the bottom, the
trench shall be over excavated and material that meets the requirements of type
II pipe bedding per the current edition of the Idaho standards for public works
construction, section 305, Pipe Bedding, shall be placed for pipe subgrade.
Once the pipe is placed on the bedding and the compaction and stability of the
bedding material approved by the city engineer, initial backfill may commence.
      8.   Initial Backfill: After the pipe lengths have been jointed and
jointing material has been properly set to the city engineer's or his
representative's approval for backfilling, the bell holes and sides of the pipe
shall be carefully backfilled with pipe bedding material and thoroughly
compacted with approved tampers. The contractor shall exercise care in placing
the initial backfill to ensure the pipe remains centered in the trench. Initial
backfill material shall contain no particle larger than one inch (1") for all
sizes of pipe. The initial backfill shall be continued in layers of not to
exceed six inches (6") in thickness until the backfill is six inches (6") above
the top of the pipe using approved pipe bedding material. Each layer of
backfill shall be compacted to a minimum of ninety five percent (95%) of
maximum density as determined by ASTM D698, as shown on the city of Hailey
standard drawings. A copy of the soil inspection report from a certified
inspector for this requirement shall be provided to the city engineer. A
minimum of one test per two hundred fifty feet (250') of installed pipe shall
be performed. Compaction tests shall be performed at the contractor/developer's
expense. Under no conditions will puddling be permitted for this initial
backfill.
      9.   Trench Backfill: After initial backfill, trenches may be backfilled
with the material excavated provided rocks larger than eight inches (8") and
other deleterious material, if present in the excavated material, are removed.
Material containing frost shall not be used for backfill. The first one foot
(1') of backfill above the initial backfill shall be given careful attention as
to composition. The backfill shall be placed in horizontal lifts. The entire
backfill shall be firmly compacted by mechanical methods approved by the city
engineer or his representative. Compaction shall be to a minimum of ninety five
percent (95%) of the maximum density as determined by ASTM D698. A copy of the
soil inspection report from a certified inspector for this requirement shall be
provided to the city engineer. A minimum of one test per two hundred fifty feet
(250') of installed pipe shall be performed per lift. Compaction tests shall be
performed at the contractor/developer's expense.
      10.   Excess Excavated Material: All excess excavated materials from
excavation and backfill operations shall be hauled and disposed of by the
contractor at locations obtained by the contractor.
      11.   Surface Runoff Water: The contractor shall at all times protect any
open trench from the entrance of surface runoff water within the work area. In
the event that water does enter a trench, the city engineer or his
representative may require the contractor to furnish foundation stabilization
gravel to provide a suitable foundation for laying the pipe. (Ord. 1116, 2012)
