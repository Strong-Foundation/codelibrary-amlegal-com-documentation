All buildings previously constructed outside the City limits for which a
building permit would have to have been issued had the construction been within
the City originally, which buildings are to be moved within City limits of the
City must meet the requirements of the existing City codes applicable to
buildings, including the codes set forth in chapter 1 of this title. (1982
Code; amd. Ord. 448, 12-18-2002)
2-3-2: BUILDING PERMITS AND INSPECTIONS:
Further, the owner of such a building, prior to moving the same into or within
the City, must obtain a building permit and submit the structure to inspection
so that it can be determined that the building meets the requirements of said
codes as applicable. Any travel expenses necessary for an official of the City
to conduct such inspection or, in the discretion of the City (should the City
determine to hire an inspector in the locality of the building), such expense
for such inspector shall be borne by the person bringing the building into the
City or moving it within the City. In the case of buildings that are subject to
the standards of the Building Code, as defined in section
2-1-1 of this title, the inspection will be conducted by an official certified
by the International Conference of Building Officials. In the case of
manufactured homes, as defined in section
8-2-2 of this Code, the inspection will be conducted by a licensed engineer,
who shall certify in writing that the manufactured home meets the requirements
of a manufactured home Class A or manufactured home Class B, as defined in
section
8-2-2 of this Code. Such certification shall also expressly certify the
structural integrity of any modification to the manufactured home made since
its original manufacture. However, homes which meet the specifications of
manufactured home Class A and which are of the current year's manufacture or
have never been sold and used as a dwelling since new from the factory are
exempt from this requirement. Also, manufactured home Class B which has
received a certificate of compliance within the last ninety (90) days by the
Administrator of the Division of Building Safety that the home complies with
the requirements of Idaho Code section 44-2503 is also exempt from this
requirement, as long as such home has not been modified since issuance of the
certificate. (Ord. 488, 9-13-2006)
2-3-3: BOND IN LIEU OF COMPLIANCE:
In the event that the building does not comply with any portion of the codes
above referred to, such building must be modified, altered, repaired or
otherwise changed to comply with such codes; or, in the sole discretion of the
City, the City may determine the expense necessary for such modification and
the person wishing to bring the building into the City or move it within the
City may post a cash bond for the amount of funds reasonably anticipated to
hire a contractor to make such changes and/or remove the building and any
foundation; or, to post a bond in the same amount with a surety to the City. A
bond in the amount of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) for manufactured homes
or a bond in the sum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) for all other types
of single-family dwellings shall be presumed to be reasonable minimum amounts.
For all other buildings, the amount shall be set by the Community Development
Director. The owner of the building may appeal the decision of the Community
Development Director to the City Council if the owner believes the bond amount
to be excessive. Such appeal shall be in writing, delivered to the Municipal
Services Director. (Ord. 488, 9-13-2006; amd. Ord. 2018-596, 6-27-2018, eff. 7-
1-2018; Ord. 2025-703, 8-27-2025)
2-3-4: BOND FORFEITURE:
In the event that the owner of the building posts such a bond and fails within
one hundred eighty (180) days to make the corrections, changes, repairs or
improvements as required, such bond shall be forfeited to the City. (Ord. 488,
9-13-2006)
2-3-5: CITY'S REMEDIES:
Bond forfeiture does not prevent the City from taking such other legal action
as is necessary to abate any private or public nuisance or otherwise require
removal of the structure from the City at the expense of the owner or person
bringing the structure within the City. (1982 Code)

2-5-3: CONTROL AND USE OF EASEMENTS:
   A.   Exclusive Control. All City easements are and at all times hereafter
remain under the exclusive control of the City, unless otherwise herein
provided. The City's consent or other permission to use an easement does not
negate the City's continuing right of control or supervision of the easement
and its use.
   B.   Use. No structure use restriction of any kind is permitted upon a City
easement except as herein provided. Access over a City easement shall be only
as permitted by the City as herein provided or as established by policy of the
City.
   C.   Sheds, doghouses, and other structures not requiring a building permit.
Sheds, doghouses, and other similar structures (like fences, etc.), which do
not require a building permit, may be placed on a City easement upon the
following conditions:
      1.    Such sheds or doghouses, etc., must be placed on skids or are
otherwise not permanently affixed or anchored to the ground or to concrete or
other permanent foundation.
      2.   Any fence constructed on an easement must, in the opinion of the
City, not be burdensome for the City to negotiate around to use or access the
easement and also, must have an unlocked access gate or doorway to the easement
of the size and type approved by the City.
      3.   The owner of the encroaching structure must sign an acknowledgement
with the City, in a form approved by the City, that provides for a hold
harmless covenant in favor of the City in the event that the City, in its
discretion, decides that the shed or structure must be moved or destroyed in
order to make use of the easement. Such agreement shall cover the items in or
with the structure as well. The agreement will also provide for the removal of
the structure by the City will occur at the cost of the owner and in case of
emergency, could occur without prior notice.
      4.   The structure must be used for a lawful purpose and may not
constitute a private or public nuisance.
      5.   The structure cannot store hazardous or toxic substances or any
other substance if the intentional or inadvertent release of such would violate
any environmental protection laws.
      6.   The structure cannot be used for human occupancy.
      7.   Consent to allow a structure to be placed on an easement lies in the
sole discretion of the City and can be revoked at any time.
   D.   Structures Requiring a Building Permit. Unless otherwise herein
permitted, a structure which requires a building permit to be built or which is
placed on or attached to a foundation or otherwise anchored to the ground or
any other encroaching structures not described in subsection C of this section
may not be placed on a City easement. If the encroaching structure is not
removed voluntarily by the landowner, then the City may undertake legal
proceedings to have it removed, unless an emergency occurs which, in the City's
opinion, requires its immediate removal, at which point the City will
accomplish the removal without notice and at the expense of the owner of the
structure.
   E.   Public Utility Structures:
      1.   Access. Public utilities or other utility providers, as contemplated
in Idaho Code 50-329A or other persons, are granted access to City's easements
as herein provided.
      2.   Multiple uses. Easements can, as the City permits, be used for
multiple utility uses, such as for access and also to provide for more than one
buried or overhead utilities services or other facilities. In the case of
multiple uses, consent for uses will generally be on a "first come, first
served" basis, unless determined otherwise by the City, in its sole discretion,
as to the needs of the City. Multiple users of utility easements are expected
to use the facilities cooperatively and with due consideration to other uses
and to make accommodations as needed to permit multiple uses of an easement.
      3.   City is sole arbiter. The City is the sole arbiter of use of the
easement and also as to questions of joint use between lawful users.
   F.   No prescriptive rights. No party may gain prescriptive rights as to the
use or occupancy of an easement nor any change or use or expansion of use.
   G.   Consent not implied. Consent to use or encroach upon an easement shall
not be implied. All use of an easement must be by consent or other permission
or grant of use and must be made in writing from the City.
   H.   Agreement for use. Other than use of an easement by the City itself,
use of an easement must be by written agreement approved by the City.
Abandonment of use of an easement for more than two (2) years shall require a
new written agreement to establish use.
   I.   Consent to permit encroachments. On occasion the City, in its sole
discretion, may consent to an encroachment on an easement. The following
minimum considerations will apply:
      1.   The structure must have been in continuous use for at least the last
ten (10) years.
      2.   The structure must be in good repair and not otherwise abandoned.
      3.   If the structure is either destroyed or becomes dilapidated, it must
be removed and a replacement structure cannot be erected in its place unless
the replacement structure is qualified for use under this section.
      4.   At the end of the useful life of the structure, no replacement
structure may be erected in its place.
   J.   Lawful uses. Lawful uses of easements for public utility, video
telecommunications or broadband purposes shall be deemed to be uses consented
to by the City and no new written application is required; however, a permit is
required and must be paid for by the provider. (Ord. 2023-681, 2-14-2024; amd.

shall complete such removal or modification in accordance with a schedule as
set by the City. Until such time as removal or modification of the facility
occurs as directed by the City, or until the rights to and responsibility for
the facility are accepted by another person having authority to construct and
maintain such facility, the provider shall be responsible for all necessary
repairs and relocations of the facility, as well as maintenance of the
easement, in the same manner and degree as if the facility were in active use,
and shall retain all liability for such facility. If the provider abandons its
facilities, the City may choose to use such facilities for any purpose
whatsoever.
   F.   If the provider fails to complete any required work to the satisfaction
of the City, the City may cause the work to be done, and the provider shall
reimburse the City for the reasonable costs and expenses incurred within thirty
(30) days after receipt of an itemized list of the City's expenses and costs,
or the City may recover its expenses and costs from the bonds or pursue any
other judicial remedies for the collection thereof. Any expenses incurred in
the collection by the City of such obligation shall be included in the monies

work conducted by City staff or its agents. (Ord. 2023-681, 2-14-2024)

2-5-24: INSURANCE:
   A.   Each provider shall secure and maintain the following insurance
policies insuring both the provider and the City against claims for death or
injuries to Persons or damage to property which may arise from or in connection
with the acts, omissions, or exercise of the rights, privileges, and authority
granted to the provider:
      1.   Comprehensive general liability insurance, written on an occurrence
basis, with limits not less than: a) three million dollars ($3,000,000) for
bodily injury or death to each Person; and b) three million dollars
($3,000,000) for property damage resulting from any one accident;

dollars ($5,000,000) per occurrence and in the aggregate.
   B.   Insurance shall be placed with insurers licensed to do business in the

policies required by this subsection shall be maintained by the provider
throughout the term of the permit, and such other period of time during which
the provider has facilities in the public easement or is engaged in the removal
of its facilities. Failure to maintain such insurance shall be grounds for
cancellation of the permit, Franchise, or Agreement. The provider shall furnish
acceptable certificate(s) of insurance, together with the endorsement naming
the City to the City prior to the commandment of any work or installation of
any facilities pursuant to any permit.
   C.   The provider's insurance shall be primary and noncontributory insurance
as respects the City. Any insurance maintained by the City shall be in excess
of the provider's insurance and shall not contribute with it. Maintenance of
insurance shall not be construed to limit the liability of the provider to the
coverage provided by such insurance or otherwise limit the City's recourse to
any remedy available at law or in equity.
   D.   In addition to the coverage requirements set forth in this subsection,
the provider must notify the City in writing of any cancellation or reduction
in coverage at least forty-five (45) days in advance. At least fifteen (15)
days prior to cancellation or reduction in coverage, the provider shall obtain
and furnish to the City replacement insurance and certificate(s) of insurance
meeting the requirements of this section.

the City for any claims arising out of the provider's work or service. The
provider shall be responsible for all deductibles under the policies. (Ord.

   A.   A provider shall indemnify, protect, defend, and hold harmless the City
from any and all actions, causes of action, suits, claims, costs, damages,
expenses, attorney fees, judgments, settlements, awards, or liability to any
Person or entity arising from injury, sickness, or death of any Person or
damage to property arising out of the acts or omissions of the provider, its
contractors of any tier, agents, servants, officers, or employees with regard
to a permit, Franchise, Agreement, or operations.
   B.   Inspection or acceptance by the City of any work performed by the
provider at the time of completion of construction shall not be grounds for
avoidance of any of these covenants of indemnification. Provided, that the
provider must be given written notice by the City of any such claim, and said
indemnification obligations shall also extend to claims which are not reduced
to a suit and any claims which may be compromised prior to the culmination of
any litigation or the initiation of any litigation. The City has the right to
defend or participate in the defense of any such claim and has the right to
approve any settlement or other compromise of any such claim.
   C.   In the event that the provider refuses the tender of defense in any
suit or claim, said tender having been made pursuant to this subsection, and
said refusal is subsequently determined by a court having jurisdiction (or such
other tribunal that the parties agree to decide the matter), to have been a
wrongful refusal on the part of the provider, then the provider shall pay all
of the City's costs for defense of the action, including all expert witness
fees, attorney fees, and expenses.
   D.   The obligations of the provider under the indemnification provisions of
this subsection shall apply regardless of whether liability for damages arising
out of bodily injury or death to Persons or damages to property were caused or
contributed to by the negligence of the City, its officers, agents, employees
or contractors. The court shall apportion liability accordingly. (Ord. 2023-
681, 2-14-2024)

Ownership or change in control of a permit, Franchise, or Agreement granted
hereunder may not occur, directly or indirectly, or be transferred, assigned or

withheld. (Ord. 2023-681, 2-14-2024)
2-5-30: ADDITIONAL DUCTS OR CONDUITS:
City may require a provider that is constructing, relocating, or placing ducts
or conduits in the public easement provide the City with additional ducts or

681, 2-14-2024)
2-5-31: CITY APPROVAL:
Upon completion of any construction, installation, maintenance, repair or
replacement work, the permittee shall, to the satisfaction of the City,
promptly repair and restore any and all public ways, City property and private
property including improvements, fixtures, structures, and other facilities in
the public easement, to as nearly as practicable their condition before the
start of such work. All providers shall warrant such work for a period of at
least one (1) year. (Ord. 2023-681, 2-14-2024)
2-5-32: ABOVE-GROUND FACILITIES:
Installation in the public easement of above-ground wires and facilities by
providers may create safety hazards and adverse visual effects. Consequently,
the City is authorized to impose reasonable conditions in order to mitigate
those potential adverse effects. (Ord. 2023-681, 2-14-2024)
2-5-33: UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION AND BORING TECHNIQUES:
All underground construction and boring techniques are subject to the pre-
approval of the City Engineer. In the event of non-compliance by a provider,
the City Engineer shall give written notice and the provider shall have ten
(10) days to cure the deficiency. If the deficiency is not cured to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer, a written stop work order will be sent to
the provider and no new permits will be issued until the deficiency or default
is cured to the satisfaction of the City. (Ord. 2023-681, 2-14-2024)

3-1-11: PERMITS AND SERVICE CONNECTION FEES:

3-1-12: EXTENSION OF WATER MAINS WITHIN CITY:
The Water Department or the Council may extend water mains within the City at
City's expense whenever, in their sole discretion, such extension is necessary

624, 5-13-2020)
3-1-14: WATER SYSTEM CONNECTION FEES:
   A.   Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to establish an equitable
system of charging new customers for the effect, impact, or burden created
whenever they enlarge an existing water service or connect a new water service
to the existing wells, storage tanks, pumps, outbuildings, or appurtenances of
the City water system. The City recognizes the inherent inequity of requiring
existing customers or taxpayers to bear the entire cost of acquiring or
building new facilities, or of utilizing excess capacity with existing
facilities, in order to meet the needs of such new development. The Council
hereby finds and recognizes the relationship between the nature of the uses of
property and the impact thereof upon the City water system. The Council also
finds that customers who connect to a water main located adjacent to their
property receive a direct benefit from such water mains, including fire
protection, which benefits are directly proportional to the frontage of the
water main along their property. The Council further finds that it is fair and
equitable to charge a main connection fee to customers who connect to such
mains in order to fund a portion of the cost incurred by the City in installing
such mains.
   B.   Water System Connection Fees. A water system connection fee shall be
collected from any person requesting connection to the water system for any new
or existing building or structure or for any existing building for which a
change in occupancy or use, as defined under the International Building Code,
as currently adopted by the City, is made and for which a new or larger water
service line is installed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no system connection
fee shall be charged for connection of water service solely for fire protection
services. Such system connection fee shall be in an amount set from time to
time by Resolution of the Council.
   C.   Water Main Connection Charge. Before connecting to any water main, all
persons desiring such connection shall pay a water main connection fee in an
amount based upon the estimated costs of connection depending on the length,
property characteristics, and needs. If costs exceed the estimate, City shall
recover the excess from the customer by billing. Any amounts recovered that
exceed the actual cost shall be refunded to customer. All water mains within
the City shall be deemed to have been constructed in whole or in part at City
expense. (Ord. 2020-624, 5-13-2020)
3-1-15: INSTALLATION CHARGES:
Service lines between the main line and the meter shall be installed by the
City. Customer lines should be installed by the customer at their cost. Such
installation shall comply with City standards with inspection and approval by
the City before use. (Ord. 2020-624, 5-13-2020)
3-1-16: LENGTH OF SERVICE LINE:
Where a water main is located in a public right of way, the maximum length of
service line furnished and installed by the City for the standard installation
fee set forth above shall be fifty feet (50'). Where the main is on private
property, the maximum length of service line furnished and installed by the
City for the standard installation fee shall be thirty feet (30'). If the
length of the service line exceeds the maximums stated above, an additional
charge shall be made, based on the actual cost to the City to furnish and
install the extra pipe. (Ord. 2020-624, 5-13-2020)
3-1-17: OWNERSHIP, MAINTENANCE, AND CONTROL OF SERVICE LINE:
All service lines and connections from the main to and including the meter
shall be installed, owned, maintained, and exclusively controlled by the Water
Department. (Ord. 2020-624, 5-13-2020)
3-1-18: ARRANGEMENT OF SERVICE LINE PIPES:
The service lines must be so arranged that the water supply to each building,
place of business, or tract of land shall be controlled by a separate meter
placed near the property line, unless a different arrangement is first
authorized in writing by the Water Department. (Ord. 2020-624, 5-13-2020)
3-1-19: BRANCH SERVICE:
   A.   No service connection serving more than one customer shall be made,
except with written permission granted by City only for good cause. Such
permission may only be granted where exists common ownership of the multiple
connections and billing is made to that owner, not any tenants or other parties
in possession of the property. If common ownership is terminated, then each
connection must be separately connected.
   B.   Where an existing water service provides service to several customers
without written permission, the City may provide a 45 day notice that City will
terminate water service until separate service connections are provided at the
owner's expense. If the City permits such existing services to continue, the
established base rate shall be charged for each potential individual customer
receiving service from the existing line and an additional pro rata portion for
usage for each customer. (Ord. 2020-624, 5-13-2020)
3-1-20: PERMIT REQUIRED:
No person shall dig into the streets or under the sidewalk for the purpose of
laying, removing, or repairing any customer line without first obtaining a
permit with at least 24-hour notice having been given to City Clerk. Such
permit will only be granted after existing utility lines are previously clearly
marked. (Ord. 2020-624, 5-13-2020)
3-1-21: CUSTOMER LINE MAINTENANCE:
All water users shall at their own expense keep their customer lines,
connections, and other apparatus in good repair and in a condition that avoids

No plumber or other person shall make any connections to a City water main or
service line. No plumber or other person shall make alterations in any conduit,
pipe, or other fixture connecting to the City mains or service lies, or connect
pipes, without first obtaining a plumbing permit, if required. If a permit was
required, all such work shall be inspected and approved before service is
restored. If such work requires excavation within a public right of way, such
person shall notify the City and also obtain a plumbing permit. (Ord. 2020-624,
5-13-2020)
3-1-23: SERVICE CALL CHARGE:
The Water Department Head may assess and collect a service charge, in an amount
not to exceed the actual cost to the City, for service calls which are
requested on a weekend, a legal holiday, or during a time other than normal
working hours and which are only for the convenience and benefit of the
customer, or which are necessitated because of plumbing which does not meet the
requirements of the Uniform Plumbing Code. (Ord. 2020-624, 5-13-2020)

The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the
POTW (end of the owner’s pipe). All concentrations for metallic substances are
for “total” metal unless indicated otherwise. The Director may impose mass
limitations in addition to, or in place of, the concentration-based limitations
above. Where a User is subject to a categorical pretreatment standard and a
local limit for a given pollutant, the more stringent limit or applicable
pretreatment standard shall apply.
POTW may develop BMPs to implement paragraphs as listed in 40 CFR 403.5(c)(1)
and (2). Such BMPs shall be considered local limits and Pretreatment Standards
for the purpose of this Chapter and Section 307(d) of the Act. (Ord. 2025-703,
8-27-2025)
3-4-13: RIGHT OF REVISION:
City reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater discharge
permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW.
(Ord. 2025-703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-14: DILUTION:
No User shall ever increase the use of processed water, or in any way attempt
to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with an applicable pretreatment standard or
requirement unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard
or requirement. The Director may impose mass limitations on Users believed may
be using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or
in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. (Ord.
2025-703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-15: SPECIAL AGREEMENTS:
City reserves the right to enter into special agreements with Users setting out
special terms under which they may discharge to the POTW. In no case will a
special agreement waive compliance with a categorical pretreatment standard or
federal pretreatment requirement. However, the User may request a net gross
adjustment to a Categorical Standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. They may
also request a variance from the categorical pretreatment standard from the
approval authority in accordance with 40 CFR 403.13. (Ord. 2025-703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-16: APPROVAL REQUIRED FOR WASTEWATER:

permit to discharge wastewater into the POTW.
   B.   In completing the application, the applicant shall provide sufficient
information concerning the nature, concentration and quantity of their waste or
such other information as may be reasonably necessary for the Director to
assure compliance with this Chapter. Upon receipt of the application, the
Director shall review the same and, if necessary, inspect the property and
facilities of the applicant to determine if said facilities are in compliance
with the provisions of this Chapter.
   C.   Upon making such determination, the Director may issue a permit to the
applicant authorizing discharge of waste to the POTW. All Industrial Users who
meet the criteria of a SIU will be required to obtain and operate under a
pretreatment permit.
   D.   Such permit may be issued only upon conditions reasonably necessary to
assure compliance with this Chapter, including Sections
3-4-38 and
3-4-39.
   E.   Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge
permit shall be deemed a violation of this Chapter and the violator is subject
to the sanctions set forth in this Chapter. Obtaining a wastewater discharge
permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with all
federal and state pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other
requirements of Federal, State, or local law. (Ord. 2025-703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-17: PRETREATMENT FACILITIES:
Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with
this Chapter and shall achieve compliance with all applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements set out in this Chapter within the time limitations
specified by the EPA, the State, or the Director, whichever is more stringent.
Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to City
shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the User’s expense. Detailed
plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be
submitted to City for review, and shall be acceptable to City before
construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures
will in no way relieve the User from the Responsibility of modifying the
facility as necessary to produce an acceptable discharge to the City under the
provisions of this Chapter. (Ord. 2025-703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-18: DEADLINES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Compliance by existing Users covered by categorical pretreatment
standards shall be accomplished within three (3) years of the date the Standard
is effective unless a shorter compliance time is specified in the appropriate
Standard. The City shall establish a final compliance deadline date for any
existing User not covered by categorical pretreatment standards or for any
categorical User when the local limits for said User are more restrictive than
the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards.
   B.   New Source Dischargers and New Users are required to comply with
applicable pretreatment standards within the shortest feasible time not to
exceed ninety (90) days from the beginning of discharge. New Sources and New
Users shall install and have in operating condition, and shall start-up all
pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards
before beginning to discharge.
   C.   Any wastewater discharge permit issued to a Categorical User shall not
contain a compliance date beyond any deadline date established in EPA’s
Categorical Pretreatment Standards. Any other existing User or a categorical
User that must comply with a more stringent local limit, which is in non-
compliance with any local limits shall be provided with a compliance schedule
placed in an industrial wastewater permit to ensure compliance within the
shortest time feasible. (Ord. 2025-703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-19: ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT MEASURES:
   A.   Whenever deemed necessary, the Director may require Users to restrict
their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be
discharged only into specific wastewater lines, relocate and/or consolidate
points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams,
and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine
the User’s compliance with the requirements of this Chapter.
   B.   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Director, they are necessary for the proper handling of
wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand, except that
such interceptors shall not be required for residential Users. All interception
units shall be of type and capacity approved by the Director and shall be so
located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors
shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the User at
its expense.
   C.   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.

the User’s cost and expense. An accidental spill prevention plan or slug
control plan showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this
protection shall be submitted to City for review and approval before
implementation. City shall determine which User is required to develop a plan
and require said plan to be submitted within thirty (30) days after
notification by City. Each User shall implement its ASPP as submitted or as
modified after such plan has been reviewed and approved by City. Review and
approval of such plans and operating procedures by City shall not relieve the
User from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this Chapter.
   A.   Any User required to develop and implement an accidental spill
prevention plan shall submit a plan which addresses, at a minimum, the
following:
      1.   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
      2.   Description of stored chemicals;
      3.   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental or
slug discharge. Such notification must also be given for any discharge which
would violate any of the standards in Sections
3-4-9 through

unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
chemicals (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
   B.   Users shall notify the Director immediately after the occurrence of a
slug or accidental discharge of substances regulated by this Chapter. The
notification shall include location of discharge, date and time thereof, type
of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. Any affected User
shall be liable for any expense, loss, or damage to the POTW, in addition to
the amount of any fines imposed on the City on account thereof under State or
Federal law.
   C.   Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge, the User shall
submit to the Director a detailed written report describing the cause of the
discharge and the measures to be taken by the User to prevent similar future
occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the User of any expense, loss,
damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property nor shall such
notification relieve the User of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability
which may be imposed by this Chapter or other applicable law.
   D.   Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on the User’s
premises advising employees whom to call in the event of a slug or accidental
discharge. Employers shall instruct all employees who may cause or discover
such a discharge with respect to emergency notification procedures. (Ord. 2025-

   A.   Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance of an
existing Significant Industrial User with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements set forth in this Chapter, in Federal Categorical Standards, or in
a wastewater discharge permit, or in the case of a New Source or a New User
considered by City to fit the definition of an SIU, within ninety (90) days
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, the
affected User shall submit to the Director a report containing the information
outlined in paragraphs (D) through (F) of Section 3-4-36 of this Chapter.
   B.   For Users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established by City in accordance with procedures established in 40 CFR 403.6
(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the User’s long-term
production rate. For all other Users subject to Categorical Pretreatment
Standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the
User’s actual production during the appropriate sampling period. (Ord. 2025-
703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-47: PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORT:
   A.   Any User that is required to have an industrial waste discharge permit
and performs self-monitoring shall submit to City during the months of June and
December, unless required on other dates or more frequently by City, a report
indicating the nature of the effluent over the previous reporting period. The
frequency of monitoring shall be as prescribed within the industrial waste
discharge permit. At a minimum, Users shall sample their discharge at least
twice per year.
   B.   The report shall include a record of the concentrations (and mass if
specified in the wastewater discharge permit) of the pollutants listed in the
wastewater discharge permit that were measured and a record of all flow
measurements (average and maximum) taken at the designated sampling locations,
and shall also include any additional information required by this Chapter or
the wastewater discharge permit. Production data shall be reported if required
by the wastewater discharge permit. Both daily maximum and average
concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. If a User sampled
and analyzed more frequently than what was required by City or by this Chapter
using methodologies in 40 CFR Part 136, it must submit all results of sampling
and analysis of the discharge during the reporting period.
   C.   Any User subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established
by City or by unit production limits specified in the applicable Categorical
Standards, shall report production data as outlined in Section
3-4-46(B) of this Chapter.
   D.   If City calculated limits to factor out dilution flows or non-regulated
flows, the User will be responsible for providing flows from the regulated
process flows, dilution flows, and non-regulated flows.
   E.   Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement, provided,
however, City may accept reports of average and maximum flows estimated by
verifiable techniques if City determines that an actual measurement is not
feasible.
   F.   Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement, provided,
however, the City may accept reports of average and maximum flows estimated by
verifiable techniques if the City determines that an actual measurement is not
feasible.
   G.   Discharges sampled shall be representative of the User’s daily
operations and shall be taken in accordance with the requirements specified in
Sections
3-4-56 through
3-4-58 of this Chapter.
   H.   City may require reporting by Users that are not required to have an
industrial wastewater discharge permit if information or data is needed to
establish a wastewater charge, determine the treatability of the effluent or
determine any other factor which is related to the operation and maintenance of
the POTW.
   I.   City may require self-monitoring by the User or, if requested by the
User, may agree to perform the periodic compliance monitoring needed to prepare
the periodic compliance report required under this Section. Self-monitoring
shall be subject to the approval of the City. If City agrees to perform such
periodic compliance monitoring, it may charge the User for such monitoring,
based upon the costs incurred by City for the sampling and analyses. Any such
charges shall be added to the normal wastewater charge and shall be payable as
part of the User’s wastewater billing statement. City shall be under no
obligation to perform periodic compliance monitoring for a User. (Ord. 2025-
703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-48: COMPLIANCE SCHEDULES FOR APPLICABLE PRETREATMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the User to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing

components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc.).
   B.   No increment referred to in paragraph (A) of this Section shall exceed
nine (9) months.
   C.   Not later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule
and the final date for compliance, the User shall submit a progress report to
City including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of
progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to
comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps
being taken by the User to return the construction to the schedule established.
In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such progress
reports. (Ord. 2025-703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-49: NOTIFICATION OF MATERIAL PRODUCTION CHANGES:
Any User operating under a wastewater discharge permit incorporating equivalent
mass or concentration limits shall notify City within two (2) business days
after the User has a reasonable basis to know that its production level will
materially change within the next calendar month. Material changes that require
this notice will be identified on individual permits issued. Any User not
providing a notice of such anticipated change will be required to comply with
the existing limits contained in its wastewater discharge permit. (Ord. 2025-
703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-50: HAZARDOUS WASTE NOTIFICATION:
   A.   Any User that is discharging more than fifteen (15) kilograms of
hazardous wastes as defined in 40 CFR 261 (listed or characteristic wastes) in
a calendar month or any facility discharging any amount of acutely hazardous
wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) is required to provide a
one-time notification in writing to City, the EPA Region 10, Office of Air,
Waste and Toxic Chemicals and, to the extent required by law and, the Idaho
Department of Health and Welfare Division. Any existing User exempt from this
notification, shall comply with the requirements contained herein within thirty

to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months.
   C.   These notification requirements do not apply to pollutants already
reported under the self-monitoring requirements.
   D.   Whenever the EPA publishes final rules identifying additional hazardous
wastes or new characteristics of hazardous waste, a User shall notify City of
the discharge of such a substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date
of such regulations.
   E.   In the case of any notification made under this paragraph, an
industrial User shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the
volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical. (Ord. 2025-703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-51: NOTICE OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS, INCLUDING ACCIDENTAL SPILLS, SLUG
LOADINGS:
Any User shall notify City immediately of all discharges that could cause
problems to the POTW, including any slug loads, or a change in potential for
slug discharge, as defined in this Chapter. The notification shall also include
the concentration and volume of the discharge, corrective action being taken or
proposed to be taken, and steps being taken to reduce any adverse impact on the
POTW. Any User who discharges a slug load of pollutants shall be liable for any
expense, loss, or damage to the POTW, in addition to the amount of any fines
imposed on City under State or Federal law. (Ord. 2025-703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-52: NON-COMPLIANCE REPORTING:
If sampling performed by a User indicates a violation, the User shall notify
City within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The User
shall also repeat the sampling within five (5) days and submit the results of
the repeat analysis to City within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the
violation. Where City has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the
Industrial User, City must perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it
notifies the User of the violation and requires the User to perform the repeat
analysis. Resampling is not required if:
   A.   City performs sampling at the Industrial User’s location at a frequency
of at least once per month; or
   B.   City performs sampling at the Industrial User’s location between the
time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the User
receives the results of this sampling. (Ord. 2025-703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-53: NOTIFICATION OF CHANGED DISCHARGE:
All Users shall promptly notify City in advance of any substantial change in
the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including significant
manufacturing process changes, pretreatment modifications, and the listed or
characteristic hazardous wastes for which the User has submitted initial
notification under 40 CFR 403.12 (p). (Ord. 2025-703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-54: REPORTS FROM UNPERMITTED USERS:
All Users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide
appropriate reports to City as the Director may require. (Ord. 2025-703, 8-27-
2025)
3-4-55: RECORDKEEPING:
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this Chapter shall retain, and
make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained
pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this Chapter and any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the User independent of such requirements, including
documentation associated with BMP. Records shall include the date, exact place,
method, and time of sampling and the name of the person(s) taking the samples;
the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical
techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records
shall be kept and made available to the City for a period of at least five (5)
years after their creation. This period shall be automatically extended for the
duration of any litigation concerning the User or POTW, or where the User has
been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Director. (Ord.
2025-703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-56: SAMPLING REQUIREMENTS FOR USERS:
   A.   Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and
grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other pollutants,
twenty-four (24) hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-
proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Director. The samples must be
representative of the Discharge and the decision to allow the alternative
sampling must be documented in the Industrial User file for that facility or
facilities. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in
40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected
during the twenty-four (24) hour period may be composited prior to the analysis
as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be
composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected
by compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the Control Authority, as appropriate.
   B.   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety (90)
day compliance reports, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH,
cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds
for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities
for which historical sampling data are available, the Director may authorize a
lower minimum. For the reports required by 40 CFR 403.12 (e) and (h), the
Director shall require the number of grab samples necessary to assess and
assure compliance by Industrial Users with Applicable Pretreatment Standards
and Requirements.
   C.   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated or
manufacturing process if no pretreatment exists or as determined by City and
contained in the User’s wastewater discharge permit. For categorical Users, if
other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment
the User should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of
the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate
compliance with the applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standards. For other
SIUs, for which the City has adjusted its local limits to factor out dilution
flows, the User should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to
evaluate compliance with the adjusted pretreatment standards. In cases where
the Standard requires compliance with a Best Management Practice or pollution
prevention alternative, the User shall submit documentation as required by City
or the applicable Standard to determine compliance with the Standard.
   D.   All sample results shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling
and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is
representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges from the
User. If a User samples and analyzes more frequently than what was required in
its wastewater discharge permit, using methodologies in 40 CFR Part 136, it
must submit all results of sampling and analysis of the discharge as part of
its self-monitoring report. (Ord. 2025-703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-57: ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS:
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, shall be performed in
accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise
specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part
136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures
approved by the EPA. (Ord. 2025-703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-58: MONITORING OF USER’S WASTEWATER:
City will follow the same procedures as outlined in Sections 3-4-56 and 3-4-57
of this Chapter whenever it deems City monitoring is appropriate to ensure
compliance with this Chapter. (Ord. 2025-703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-59: INSPECTION AND SAMPLING:
Free access for inspection of wastewater facilities shall, upon such reasonable
notice as the circumstances permit, be allowed to the City of all places
related to wastewater. All pretreatment applications and permits include
express consent for such wastewater inspections. Failure to consent to a
legitimate and reasonable request may provide reason for City to turn off all
utilities to the premises. City shall have the right to enter the facilities of
any User to ascertain whether the purposes of this Chapter, and any wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, are being met and whether the User
is complying with all requirements thereof. Users shall allow the Director
ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any
additional duties.
   A.   Where a User has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the User shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the Director will be permitted to enter without
delay for the purpose of performing specific responsibilities.
   B.   The Director shall have the right to set up on the User’s property, or
require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling or
metering of the User’s operations.
   C.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected or sampled shall be promptly removed by the User at
the written or verbal request of the Director and shall not be replaced. The
costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the User.
   D.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Director access to the User’s
premises shall be a violation of this Chapter. (Ord. 2025-703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-60: MONITORING FACILITIES:
   A.   Each User shall provide and operate at its own expense a monitoring
facility to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurements of each
wastewater discharge to City. Each monitoring facility shall be situated on the
User’s premises, except where such a location would be impractical or cause
undue hardship on the User and City approves such alternate location in
writing.
   B.   Ample room shall be provided in or near such sampling facility to allow
accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility,
including the sampling and measuring equipment, shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the User.
   C.   The Director may require the User to install monitoring equipment as
necessary. All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in
accordance with all applicable local construction standards and specifications.
All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy. (Ord. 2025-703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-61: SEARCH WARRANTS:
If the Director has been refused access to a building, structure or property,
or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that
there may be a violation of this Chapter, or that there is a need to inspect as
part of a routine inspection program of the City designed to verify compliance
with this Chapter or any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder,
or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community,
then the Director may seek issuance of a search or seizure warrant from a court
of competent jurisdiction. Such warrant shall be served in the manner allowed
by law. (Ord. 2025-703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-62: CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:
Information and data on a User obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring
programs, and from City inspection and sampling activities, shall be available
to the public without restriction, unless the User specifically requests, and
is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of City, that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable State law. When
requested and demonstrated by the User furnishing a report that such
information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might
disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for
inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request
to governmental agencies for uses related to the IPDES program or pretreatment
program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the
report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other “effluent data”
as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information
and will be available to the public without restriction. (Ord. 2025-703, 8-27-

3-4-63: PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NON-COMPLIANCE:
City shall publish annually, on its website, a list of the Users which, during
the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant non-compliance with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. For the purposes of this
Chapter, a Significant Industrial User (or any Industrial User which violates
Subsections (C), (D), or (H) of this Section) is in significant noncompliance
if its violation meets one (1) or more of the following criteria;
   A.   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of wastewater measurements taken
for the same pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period exceed (by any
magnitude) a numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, including
instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(l);
   B.   Technical Review Criteria (“TRC”) violations, defined here as those in
which thirty-three percent (33%) or more of all of the measurements taken for
each pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period equal or exceed the
product of the numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, including
instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(l) multiplied by the
applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil, and grease, and 1.2 for all
other pollutants except pH);
   C.   Any other violations of a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement as
defined by 40 CFR 403.3(l) (daily maximum, longer-term average, instantaneous
limit, or narrative Standard) that the POTW determines has caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including
endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;
   D.   Any discharge of pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to
human health, welfare or to the environment, or has resulted in POTW’s exercise
of its emergency authority under Section 3-4-70 of this Chapter to halt or
prevent such a discharge;
   E.   Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a local control mechanism or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or
attaining final compliance;
   F.   Failure to provide within forty-five (45) days after the due date,
required reports, such as baseline monitoring reports, ninety (90) day
compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports and reports on compliance
with compliance schedules;
   G.   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
   H.   Any other violation or group of violations, which may include a
violation of Best Management Practices, which the POTW determines will
adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local Pretreatment
program. (Ord. 2025-703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-64: NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION:
When the Director finds that a User has violated or continues to violate any
provision of this Chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director may
serve upon that User a written Notice of Violation. Such Notice shall be
conclusively deemed served upon its deposit in the United States mail, postage
prepaid, certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the address
specified in the User’s application, or such other address which has been
delivered to City in writing. Within thirty (30) days after service of this
notice, User shall similarly serve upon the Director an explanation of the
violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to
include specific required actions. Submission of this plan in no way relieves
the User of liability for any violation occurring before or after receipt of
the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this Section shall limit the authority of
City to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement
action, without first issuing a Notice of Violation. (Ord. 2025-703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-65: CONSENT ORDERS:
The Director may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance,
or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any User responsible
for non-compliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by
the User to correct the non-compliance within a time period specified by the
document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the
administrative orders issued pursuant to Sections 3-4-67 and 3-4-68 of this
Chapter and shall be judicially enforceable. Use of a Consent Order shall not
be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
User. (Ord. 2025-703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-66: SHOW CAUSE HEARING:
The Director may order a User which has violated or continues to violate, any

hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before
the Director and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. Notice shall be served on the User specifying the time and place for the
meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a
request that the User show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not
be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered
or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least fifteen (15) days prior
to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any Authorized Representative of
the User. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the User. (Ord. 2025-703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-67: COMPLIANCE ORDERS:
   A.   When the Director finds that a User has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this Chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Director may issue an order to the User responsible for the discharge directing
that the User come into compliance within a time specified in the order. If the
User does not come into compliance within the time specified in the order,
wastewater service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities,
devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated.
Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to address the non-
compliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the POTW.
   B.   Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User. (Ord. 2025-703, 8-
27-2025)
3-4-68: CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS:
   A.   When the Director finds that a User has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this Chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that
the User’s past violations are likely to recur, the Director may issue an order
to the User directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing
the User to:
      1.   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      2.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   B.   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User. (Ord. 2025-703, 8-
27-2025)
3-4-69: ADMINISTRATIVE FINES; ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS:
   A.   When the Director finds that a User has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this Chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Director may fine such User in an amount set from time to time by Resolution of
the Council. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In
the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits, fines shall be
assessed for each day during the period of violation.
   B.   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the Director to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount
within fifteen (15) days of being notified of the fine. Upon receipt of such
request, the Director shall convene a hearing on the matter within fifteen (15)
days thereafter. In the event the User’s appeal is successful, the payment,
together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the User.
City may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as
notices and orders, to the fine.
   C.   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.
   D.   To the fullest extent permitted by law, City shall be entitled to
recover its reasonable attorney fees, court costs, and other expenses
associated with enforcement of this Chapter, including without limitation,
sampling and monitoring expenses and all other damages sustained by City as a
direct result of a User’s violation of the provisions of this Chapter. (Ord.
2025-703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-70: EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS:
   A.   The Director may immediately suspend a User’s discharge, after informal
notice to the User, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or which causes an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of the public.
The Director may also immediately suspend a User’s discharge, after notice and
opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the
POTW, or which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment.
      1.   Any User notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its discharge into the POTW. In the event of a User’s failure
to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Director shall
take steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the wastewater
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or
endangerment to any individuals. The Director shall allow the User to
recommence its discharge when the User has demonstrated to the satisfaction of
City that the period of endangerment has passed, unless termination proceedings
under Section
3-4-71 of this Chapter are initiated against the User.
      2.   A User that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit to the Director a detailed
written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the
measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, prior to the date of any show
cause or termination hearing under sections 3-4-66 and 3-4-71 of this Chapter.
   B.   Nothing in the Section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing

proof that the User has corrected its violation of the provisions of this
Chapter and has provided satisfactory assurances that such violation will not
recur. (Ord. 2025-703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-75: PUBLIC NUISANCES:
A violation of any provision of this Chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, is
hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed
by the Director. Any User or person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be
subject to the provisions of this Code or State law governing such nuisances,
including reimbursing City for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or
remedying said nuisance. (Ord. 2025-703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-76: INFORMANT REWARDS:
City may pay a reward in an amount set from time to time by Resolution of
Council for information leading to the discovery of non-compliance by a User.
In the event that the information provided results in an administrative fine or
civil penalty levied against the User, City may, upon similar Resolution,
authorize the disbursement of up to ten percent (10%) of the collected fine or
penalty to the informant, provided however, a single reward payment may not
exceed in an amount set from time to time by Resolution of the Council. (Ord.
2025-703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-77: CONTRACTOR LISTING:
Users which are not compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements are not eligible to receive a contractual award for the sale of
goods or services to City. Existing contracts for the executory sale of goods

with pretreatment standards or requirements may be terminated at the discretion
of City. (Ord. 2025-703, 8-27-2025)
3-4-78: AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS:
The following affirmative defenses may be established by a User against whom
any enforcement action or remedy is sought.
   A.   Upset:
      1.   For the purposes of this Section, “upset” means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary non-compliance with
applicable pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the User. An upset does not include non-compliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
      2.   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards if the
requirements of paragraph C of this Section are met.
      3.   A User who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or
other relevant evidence that:
         a.   An upset occurred and the User can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
         b.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
         c.   The User has submitted the following information to the POTW and
treatment plant operator within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the
upset [if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be
provided within five (5) days]:
            (1)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
            (2)   The period of non-compliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the non-compliance is expected to
continue; and
            (3)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the non-compliance.
      4.   In any enforcement proceeding, the User seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
      5.   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for non-compliance with
applicable pretreatment standards.
      6.   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with applicable pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of their treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
   B.   Prohibited Discharge Standards. A User shall have an affirmative
defense to an enforcement action brought against it for non-compliance with the
prohibitions in Section
3-4-9 of this Chapter if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to
know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other
sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: (a) a local
limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the User was in compliance with
each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or
(b) no local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in
nature or constituents from the User’s prior discharge when City was regularly
in compliance with its IPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in
compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
   C.   Bypass.
      1.   For the purposes of this Section:
         a.   “Bypass” means the intentional diversion of waste streams from
any portion of a User’s treatment facility.
         b.   “Severe property damage” means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
      2.   A User may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provision of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this Section.
      3.   a.   If a User knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the POTW, at least ten (10) days before the date of the
bypass, if possible.
         b.   A User shall submit oral notice to City of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24)
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five (5) days of the time the User becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on a case-by-
case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours.
      4.    a.    Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take an enforcement
action against a User for a bypass, unless:
            (1)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
            (2)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as
the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
            (3)   The User submitted notices as required under paragraph three
(3) of this Section.
      5.   The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three (3)
conditions listed in paragraph (4)(a) of this Section. (Ord. 2025-703, 8-27-
2025)
3-4-79: WASTEWATER USER SERVICE CHARGE:
   A.   A monthly service charge for wastewater service shall be charged to all
Users on a monthly basis. All charges to Users, shall be calculated in a manner
that ensures each User will pay a fair share of the costs of operation,
maintenance, and capital equipment replacement based upon proportional usage of
the POTW. The rates established shall generate sufficient revenue to defray the
costs of operating and prudently managing the wastewater system, including but
not limited to: (a) capital costs; (b) operation and maintenance costs; (c)
replacement costs and reserves, and (d) debt service on bonded indebtedness.
Premises occupied for any portion of a month shall be charged a pro rata
portion of the month.
   B.   For billing purposes, wastewater users shall be classified and billed
as Residential, Commercial, and Industrial.
   C.   City shall establish monthly rates for wastewater service supplied by
City in an amount set from time to time by Resolution of the Council for the
following:
      1.   Monthly Non-Metered Residential Wastewater Rates (Inside City):

         c.   Apartment unit - Per unit.
      2.   Monthly Non-Metered Commercial Wastewater Rates (Inside City): Non-
Metered Commercial properties shall be assessed on a water-in/water-out basis
which presumes that the water discharge volume is approximately equal to the
potable water consumed.
      3.   Monthly Metered Wastewater Rates. The wastewater for Users receiving
metered water service shall be a monthly base metered wastewater of three
thousand (3,000) gallons plus a monthly volumetric rate per each one thousand
(1,000) gallons of water used; in an amount set from time to time by Resolution
of the Council. Each class of Residential, Commercial, and Industrial shall
have separate rates. Users outside the City shall have a separate rate as set
by Resolution of the Council.
         a.   New installations without sufficient metered data shall be
charged as non-metered wastewater as defined above until such time that
sufficient metered data is available.

(1982 Code)
3-7-9: PROCEDURE FOR TERMINATION OF SERVICES:
The City will follow the procedure set forth below in terminating service of
utilities to a customer in the event of nonpayment:
   A.   Customer accounts for utility service are delinquent if not paid in
full after the tenth day of the month.
   B.   The City, in its delinquency notice, shall inform the customer of the
right of pretermination hearing, application for which must be made within
three (3) days. The notice may be mailed or delivered to the customer. If there
has not been payment in full of the delinquent account or if no application for
a hearing has been made, utility service may be terminated. If application is
appropriately made within the stated time period, the City will not discontinue
utility service until the hearing has been convened. The hearing will be
conducted in front of the City Clerk and the customer shall have the right to
be represented by counsel. In the hearing, the City Clerk may deal with billing
errors, failures to credit payments or other accounting matters. The City Clerk
also has authority to make arrangements, in the Clerk's discretion, for
payments by the customer over time in order to restore service prior to payment
in full. In making such arrangements, the City Clerk shall give consideration
to the customer's past account delinquencies, the financial abilities and
resources of the customer, the commercial reasonableness of the proposal and
the likelihood of such delinquency not reoccurring. Decisions adverse to the
utility customer of the City may be appealed to the City Council within ten
(10) days of the adverse determination of the hearing before the City Clerk.
The City Clerk will provide the appropriate written applications for the
hearing before the Clerk and the appeal before the City Council and will inform
the utility customer of the customer's right of appeal to the City Council in
the event of adverse decision. Decisions adverse to the consumer by the City
Council will also inform the consumer of the right of appeal of the decision
pursuant to the Idaho State Administrative Procedures Act to the appropriate
court of jurisdiction.
   C.   Persons who have a past due or delinquent utility account with the City
and who desire new or renewed service must pay with the deposit all of past due
account balance in full in cash. In the case of residential service locations,
whether single-family, multi-family, rented or owned, a utility customer with a
past due account shall be deemed to be all adults who were residing in the
household of the former location where the delinquent utility service was
provided. This shall be irrespective whether the account was in the name of
such person or not. The customer receiving the new service shall be deemed to
be all of the adults in the household to receive the service irrespective of
who applies for the service. The applicant for new service shall give the names
of all adult persons who reside at the new service location or are anticipated
to reside at the location as a condition of service. The applicant shall
expressly identify all adults who have a past due or delinquent utility account
with the City on the application for new service. If an applicant has changed
his or her or their names for any reason and has a past due or delinquent
account with the City, such shall be divulged at the time of application. It
shall be considered prima facie evidence of fraud or deception on an
application for utility service to give a false name, apply in the name of
another person, fail to give former names, fail to identify all adults who will
reside at the location of the new service, fail to identify all persons who
reside or will reside at the service location who have past due or delinquent
utility accounts with the city, or to apply for service in the name of a minor.
The obtaining of utility service by fraud or deception as herein defined shall
be punishable as a misdemeanor.
   D.   The city shall not deny or discontinue service of any utility prior to
any requested hearing before the city clerk. The city may, in its discretion,
continue service in the event of appeal to the city council. However, in the
case of denying service initially where no service has been delivered for good
cause, the city is not required to provide any service during the hearing
pendency. The city shall honor hearing requests as soon as possible giving
expeditious calendaring to all hearing requests. (Ord. 469, 8-25-2004)
3-7-10: LATE PAYMENT FEE:
Commencing sixteen (16) days after the first day of the month there shall be
imposed a one-time late payment fee of ten percent (10%) of the then balance
due on all residential and commercial utility and service account billings with
a minimum fee of two dollars fifty cents ($2.50) per month. Also, interest at
the rate of 1.75 percent per month on the unpaid balance shall be charged
commencing thirty (30) days after the mailing of the utility billing. These
provisions are in addition to any other remedies of the city including the
termination of service. For purposes of this section, utility and service
accounts shall include: domestic water, irrigation water, sewer, electricity,
and garbage collection. Such one time late penalty shall be applied each month
to any newly past due amount on any utility account for which a one time ten
percent (10%) late penalty has not yet been assessed. (Ord. 469, 8-25-2004;
amd. Ord. 2023-671, 4-26-2034)
3-7-11: TERMINATION OF SERVICE TO DECEASED UTILITY CUSTOMERS:
Thirty (30) days after the death of a utility customer of the city, the utility
account or accounts shall be closed and service, pursuant to that account or
accounts, shall be terminated, except as follows:
   A.   The estate, personal representative or heir may apply to the city to
have the accounts transferred into the name of the estate, personal
representative or heir upon completing the application for new service and
payment of the required new service deposit.
   B.   In any event, service may not be provided to the estate or personal
representative of the deceased account holder for more than six (6) months from
the utility account holder's death, at which time the account must be
transferred into the name of an appropriate successor in interest.
   C.   The estate, personal representative or heir may apply to the city
council upon appropriate showing of hardship.
   D.   These provisions shall not apply when there is a surviving spouse to
the utility account holder, as long as the said surviving spouse applies to
have the account transferred into his or her name. Such transfer may be
accomplished without payment of a new deposit. (Ord. 547, 8-8-2012)

      2.   A fence at least eight feet (8') in height must be constructed
around the perimeter of the proposed junkyard out of some substantial material
which prevents observation of any and all junk and other material or objects to
be located and placed within the confines of said junkyard. Such fence will be
of such substantial quality as to reasonably discourage unauthorized entrance,
particularly by minor children. Also, to the extent possible, such fence shall
be as reasonably aesthetic in appeal as possible. If a fence which otherwise
complies with this subsection is constructed of wood but over time natural
shrinkage allows some gaps to form so that some amount of observation through
the fence of the material beyond the fence is permissible, such fence shall,

existing junkyard already licensed under the provisions herein.

disapproved if such location would, in the reasoned and considered opinion of
the city council, frustrate economical, safe, orderly and well planned present
or future development of the city, regardless of present city layout and/or
city or county zoning requirements.
      7.   In the case of new junkyards, the proposed site must be
appropriately zoned prior to license issuance.
      8.   The clerk of the city must have previously received the license fee
in full. This fee is nonrefundable.
   C.   Renewals: Renewals of the license as herein described will be issued
only upon full compliance with the above provisions except as hereinafter
provided.
   D.   Waiver Of Full Compliance:
      1.   In the case of already operating and licensed junkyards which were
operating as such and duly licensed and in otherwise full compliance with the
previously enacted and partially herewith repealed junkyard ordinances, such
junkyards are granted waiver of compliance as to the following requirements as
herein provided:
         a.   The minimum size of ten (10) acres;
         b.   Minimum and maximum frontage of the junkyard;
         c.   The requirement that the fence be a minimum of eight feet (8') in
height and be constructed of such material as to prevent observation from and
outside of the junk or material stored on the inside; however, it shall remain
a requirement of such junkyards operating as herein described, and eligible for
the exception herein contained that such a junkyard maintain either a chain
link or solid wood fence of at least eight feet (8') in height around the
entire perimeter of the junkyard. In no event, however, may a junkyard have any
other fence surrounding its perimeter other than a solid fence which prevents
observation of the junk beyond the fence after five (5) years of the enactment
of this chapter.
   E.   Exception To Above Waiver Of Compliance:
      1.   The waivers to compliance to subsection D of this section applying
to junkyards operating, licensed and in full compliance with the prior chapter
applies only to junkyards which remain owned by the original prior owner as of
the date of enforcement of this chapter. Further, any sale of the business, or
any change in ownership of such junkyard revokes the above waiver and evokes
the full requirements of compliance with all provisions of this chapter. Also,
any renovation of the facilities of the junkyard as herein provided
specifically including a change in the fence, either as to type of material or
raising its height, revokes the waiver of using anything but a solid fence,
which prevents observation of junk stored behind such fence.
      2.   A "sale" is defined for purposes herein as any sale whatsoever,
private or public, voluntary or judicial, or otherwise.
      3.   A "change of ownership" is defined for purposes herein as any change
of ownership, including, but not limited to, bankruptcy, judicial or other
foreclosure, reorganization, including merger, sale of the junkyard on contract
regardless of whether title passes at the date of contract or not, any
acquisition of the junkyard by inheritance, testate or intestate, or otherwise.
      4.   However, the following shall not be construed as a sale or a change
of ownership: the mere change of name of a business with no other change; the
giving of mortgages, security interests, or the like in the land or the
property; the adding or deleting of partners, if the junkyard is owned by a
partnership, so long as at least one of the original general partners remains a
general partner, and such general partner remains at all times a managing
general partner conducting daily business of the junkyard, or, in the case of a
corporation, the sale of stock or the creation of a new class of stock and sale
of same. (1982 Code)

display, exhibit, food or drink concession, yard sale or any activity at which

conducted by a person or a group "for profit", nonprofit organization or by a
public and charitable organization, which is not otherwise exempted herein.
   COMMUNITY USE: Use by a group or organization which is a not for profit
organization and the use of the park is a not for profit event, but does not
have charitable use status. This would include family reunions, school reunion
(where no commercial activities are present) and other group gathering for
which no admission is charged, or admission charged only to defray actual
expenses and which gathering has a largely public purpose. If there is
incidental sale of items or concessions, either as a convenience to the public
attending the event or to raise money for a legitimate public purpose, then in
such event, in the sole discretion of the city council, may be permitted
without full compliance with the requirements of a commercial activity.
Otherwise the event shall be deemed a commercial event and must comply with all

for a legitimate political activity, but a cleanup deposit is required, as
provided in this chapter. Political use is limited to four (4) continuous hours
in a single day, and may not commence before nine o'clock (9:00) A.M. and must
conclude no later than ten o'clock (10:00) P.M. The event must comply with all
other rules for use of the park. All signs, posters, brochures or other
materials associated with the rally, protest or demonstration must be removed
by the event organizers, or participants immediately after the conclusion of
the event. The application will not be granted if another application for use
has been already granted for the same date and time.

      3.   Applications For Group Use: Applications for group use of a park
shall be considered by the city council at its next regular city council
meeting following the date of the submission of the completed application to
the city clerk. Should the council approve the application, a permit shall be
issued to the applying entity to conduct the commercial activity which permit
shall provide:
         a.   The date, and the name of the person or entity to which the
permit is issued.
         b.   The time, place and date at which the activity may be conducted.
         c.   The exact nature of the activity which may be conducted,
including what commercial activities are permitted.

not to exceed the single limit coverage of at least one million dollars
($1,000,000.00) of which policy the city has been made an additional insured.
         f.   A permit shall further be issued subject to the understanding by
the applicant that by obtaining the permit it agrees to hold harmless and
indemnify the city from all liability which may arise from, touch or concern
the commercial activity permitted by the city.
      4.   Fee Exemption:
         a.   The city council may, in its discretion, waive the requirement of
paying a permit fee to any bona fide, charitable or public organization
proposing to conduct a charitable or nonprofit activity, as long as all
proceeds, excluding direct costs of the goods or services to be sold, will be
devoted to the charitable or other public purposes. Charitable activities shall
include any and all purposes for which organizations may qualify for tax exempt
status pursuant to internal revenue code section 501(c)(3) as it now exists or
as it may hereafter be amended. Community uses may be considered for a fee
waiver, as long as the activity to be conducted is devoted exclusively to
charitable or other public purposes as above provided.
         b.   There is no fee exemption for commercial activities.
      5.   Preference: Charitable, public activities or community uses or
events, in that order, shall be given preference over other uses.
      6.   Assumption Of Risk: The applicant must agree in writing to save and
hold the city harmless from any claim arising out of the applicant's use or
applicant's invitees or guests at the city park. Use of the park by the
applicant and applicant's guests and invitees is an assumption of any risk.
      7.   Immediate Termination Of Event: Issuance of the permit is not an
exemption or waiver of enforcement of any applicable law, rules, ordinances,
regulations or statutes nor is it a waiver of any public or private nuisance
law. If the city's mayor, chief of police or their designated representatives
determine that the event has become too noisy, unruly, out of control, poses
danger to persons or property or that crowd and traffic control is inadequate
or the event and participants are otherwise a private or public nuisance, then
they may order the immediate termination of the event and dispersal of all
persons at the site. This provision is applicable to events at the amphitheater
as well. (Ord. 551, 6-25-2014)
5-7-5: PARK OPERATING POLICY:
   A.   Hours: Except for unusual and unforeseen emergencies, parks shall be
open to the public every day of the year from six o'clock (6:00) A.M. to ten
o'clock (10:00) P.M. Thereafter, visitors and vehicles shall be excluded during
the hours of closure.
   B.   Closed Areas: Any section or part of any park may be declared closed to
the public by the City Council or duly authorized representative at any time
and for any interval of time, either temporarily or at regularly and stated
intervals (daily or otherwise) and either entirely or merely to certain uses,
as the City Council or a duly authorized representative shall find reasonably
necessary.
   C.   Effect Of A Permit: The permittee shall be bound by all park rules and
regulations and all applicable ordinances as fully as though the same were
inserted in said permit. The person or persons to whom a permit is issued shall
be liable for any loss, damage or injuries sustained by any person or persons
to whom such permit shall have been issued. The City Council, or a duly
authorized representative, shall have the authority to revoke a permit upon a
finding of violation of any rule or ordinance, or upon good cause. (Ord. 551,
6-25-2014)
   D.   Reservations: Special prior reservations for exclusive use of an entire
City park or a certain portion of any City park may be made with the Municipal
Services Director in writing on the form provided. The Public Works Department
has sole discretion as to whether such reservation shall be granted. Use of the
area must be made during the time specified in the permit issued by the
Department and subject to this chapter and other conditions reasonably imposed
by the Department for the protection of the park and the public. At the time
the application is made, the applicant must tender a deposit fee in the amount
set by resolution of the City Council. The applicant is personally responsible
for all use of the reserved facilities and consequently any littering or damage
to the City facilities during the time of exclusive use. Such deposit shall be
returned to the applicant after the Department has determined that the
applicant made adequate cleanup of all garbage, refuse and things brought by
the applicant or his group to the park and has not caused or suffered any
person to damage any of the facilities. If the Department determines that
either the applicant or any member of his group has left garbage or debris or
caused damage, he may cause the deposit to be immediately forfeited to the
City, which action does not preclude the City from seeking additional
compensation for cost of cleanup or repair of damage.
   E.   Exclusive Use Of Some Park Facilities: The City may grant temporary
permission for exclusive use of City parks for organized community athletic

minimal light industrial uses capable of being operated under such standards as
to location and appearance of buildings and treatment of land around them that
they will be unobtrusive and not detrimental to surrounding commercial or
residential uses. The light industrial uses permitted in this zone are
manufacturing and wholesale business establishments which are clean, quiet and
free of hazardous or objectionable elements such as noise, odor, dust, smoke or
glare operated entirely within enclosed structures which generate little
industrial traffic. This zone or district is further designed to accent a
transitional use between industrial uses and other less intense business and
residential uses. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)
8-4-9: INDUSTRIAL LIGHT ZONE (IL):
The purpose of this zone is to provide for the location of manufacturing or
other industrial uses which are duly controlled operations that do not generate
smoke, noise, vibration, dust, odor, glare, gas, light, air pollution or water
pollution beyond the district boundary. This zone is characterized by
warehouses, wholesale storage areas, packaging and assembling plants. The
district is further designed to accent a transitional use between heavy
industrial uses and less intense general commercial uses. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)
8-4-10: INDUSTRIAL HEAVY ZONE (IH):
The purpose of this zone is to provide for the location of manufacturing and
other industrial uses which usually contain heavy manufacturing, processing,
assembling, storing, testing and similar industrial uses which are generally
major operations and extensive in character requiring large sites where the
byproducts of such use include emittance of nuisances such as smoke, noise,
vibration, dust, odor, glare, gas, light, air pollution or water pollution
beyond the district boundaries which may have a detrimental effect on
neighboring property. These uses require extensive community facilities and
isolation from residential and commercial uses and also require reasonable
access to arterial thoroughfares. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)

not impair the present or potential use of properties in the surrounding areas
and shall not have any different or more detrimental effect upon the adjoining
neighborhood areas or districts than the specifically listed buildings and
uses. When several combined uses exist, or are proposed, the most intensive
shall be considered as the primary activity.
Where a use is proposed and ambiguity exists concerning the appropriate
district or procedure for the establishment of that particularly proposed use,
said use may be established by obtainment of a special use permit in accordance
with the provisions of this title until such time as this section is amended to
specifically include such use.

(RMP) for approval by the city of Heyburn demonstrating that a release of the
hazardous substance(s) does not pose a threat to the public and must be
submitted with any construction documents or submittals that are presented for
any zoning and/or building permit application.
As a minimum, the hazard assessment shall include the preparation and reporting
of worst case release scenarios for each structure under consideration, showing
the potential effect on the public for each. As a minimum, the worst case event
shall include the complete failure (instantaneous release of entire contents)
of a vessel, piping system, or other storage structure. A worst case event
includes, but is not limited to, a release during the design wind or design
seismic event as well as accidental damage caused by equipment or vehicles
either by impact or failure. In this assessment, the evaluation of the
effectiveness of subsequent measures for accident mitigation shall be based on
the assumption that the complete failure of the primary storage structure has
occurred. The off site impact must be defined in terms of population within the
potentially affected area.
As a minimum, the prevention program shall consist of the comprehensive
elements of process safety management, which is based upon accident prevention
through the application of management controls in the key areas of design,
construction, operation, and maintenance. Secondary containment of the
hazardous substances (including, but not limited to, double wall tank, dike of
sufficient size to contain a spill, or other means to contain a release of the
hazardous substances within the property boundary of the facility and prevent
release of harmful quantities of contaminants to the air, soil, groundwater, or
surface water) are permitted to be used to mitigate the risk of release. The
hazard assessment shall demonstrate that a release of the hazardous material
from a worst case event does not pose a threat to the public outside the
property boundary of the facility.
As a minimum, the emergency response plan shall address public notification,
emergency medical treatment for accidental exposure to humans, and procedures
for emergency response to releases that have consequences beyond the property
boundary of the facility. The emergency response plan shall address the
potential that resources for response could be compromised by the event that
has caused the emergency.
   J.   Enforcement Provisions: The administrator, prior to granting zoning
approval as set forth in section
8-13-1 of this title, may require the submission of statements and plans
indicating the manner in which dangerous and objectionable elements involved in
processing and in equipment operations are to be eliminated or reduced to
acceptable limits and tolerances; and

FLOODPLAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT (FP)
SECTION:
8-7-1: Purpose And Location Of District
8-7-2: Definitions
8-7-3: General Provisions
8-7-4: Establishment Of Permit And Administration
8-7-5: Provisions For Flood Hazard Reduction
8-7-6: Nonliability Clause
8-7-7: Restrictions
8-7-8: Prohibited Uses
8-7-1: PURPOSE AND LOCATION OF DISTRICT:
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
   A.   To protect human life and health;
   B.   To minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control
projects;
   C.   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   D.   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   E.   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   F.   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
   G.   To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
The floodplain overlay (FP) district is created to designate areas of the
county or cities needing such consideration and is superimposed over other
districts. The FP district is the same area as the area of the county or cities
identified by the federal insurance administration/emergency management agency
flood insurance rate map (FIRM) promulgated for the county or the city, which
map is adopted by reference and declared to be part of this chapter and which
map shall be maintained on file in the records of the county or city clerk of
the county or city at all times hereafter. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)
8-7-2: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall
be interpreted so as to give them the meanings they have in common usage and to
give this chapter its most reasonable application.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
Designation on maps always includes the letters A or V.
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. Also referred to as the 100-year flood. Designation
on maps always includes the letters A or V.
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations located within the
area of special flood hazard.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): The official map on which the federal
insurance administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard
and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY: The official map on which the federal insurance
administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the
risk premium zones applicable to the community.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
   A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
   B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any
source.
FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot (1').
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable nonelevation design requirements found at subsection 8-7-5B1b of
this chapter.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is connected to the required utilities. For
floodplain management purposes the term "manufactured home" also includes park
trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for
greater than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days. For insurance purposes
the term "manufactured home" does not include park trailers, travel trailers,
and other similar vehicles.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on
or after the effective date of this chapter.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty
(180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first
placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings, piers, or foundation or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure.
STRUCTURE: Anything constructed or erected, the use of which requires location
on the ground or attachment to something having a fixed location on the ground.
Among other things, structures include buildings, mobile homes, walls, gas or
liquid storage tanks and billboards.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure either:
   A.   Before the improvement or repair is started, or
   B.   If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the
damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition "substantial improvement"
is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor,
or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that
alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. (Ord. 441, 7-24-
2002)
8-7-3: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Lands To Which This Chapter Applies: This chapter shall apply to all
areas designated on the map referred to in section
8-7-1 of this chapter designated as the floodplain overlay (FP) district.
   B.   Basis For Establishing The Areas Of Special Flood Hazard: The areas of
special flood hazard identified by the federal insurance administration in a
scientific and engineering report entitled the "Flood Insurance Study" for the
applicable jurisdiction, which is most current at the time of the adoption of
this title, with accompanying flood insurance maps is hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The "Flood Insurance
Study" is on file at the office of the county or city clerk. (Ord. 441, 7-24-
2002)
8-7-4: ESTABLISHMENT OF PERMIT AND ADMINISTRATION:
   A.   Development Permit Required: A development permit shall be obtained
before construction or development begins within any area of special flood
hazard established in subsection 8-7-3B of this chapter. The permit shall be
for all structures, including manufactured homes, as set forth in the
definitions, and for all development including fill and other activities, also
as set forth in the definitions.
   B.   Designation Of The Building Official: The building official is hereby
appointed to administer and implement this title by granting or denying
development permit applications in accordance with its provisions. This process
may be combined with any building permit process otherwise required by the
city.
   C.   Duties And Responsibilities Of The Administrator: Duties of the
administrator shall include, but not be limited to:
      1.   Permit Review:
         a.   Review all development permits to determine that the permit
requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
         b.   Review all development permits to determine that all necessary
permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local governmental
agencies from which prior approval is required.
         c.   Review all development permits to determine if the proposed
development is located in the floodway. If located in the floodway, assure that
the encroachment provisions of subsection
8-7-5C1 of this chapter are met.
      2.   Use Of Other Base Flood Data: When base flood elevation data has not
been provided in accordance with subsection
8-7-3B, "Basis For Establishing The Areas Of Special Flood Hazard", of this
chapter, the administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any
base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other
source, in order to administer subsections
8-7-5B, "Specific Standards", and C, "Floodways", of this chapter.
      3.   Information To Be Obtained And Maintained:
         a.   Where base flood elevation data is provided through the flood
insurance study or required as in subsection C2 of this section, obtain and
record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, and
whether or not the structure contains a basement.
         b.   For all new or substantially improved floodproofed structures:
            (1)   Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean
sea level),
            (2)   Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in
subsection
8-7-5B of this section, and
            (3)   Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the
provisions of this chapter.
      4.   Alteration Of Watercourses:
         a.   Notify adjacent communities and the Idaho department of water
resources prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit
evidence of such notification to the federal insurance administration.
         b.   Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or
relocated portion of watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity is not
diminished.
      5.   Interpretation Of FIRM Boundaries: Make interpretations where
needed, as to exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood
hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped
boundary and actual field conditions). The person contesting the location of
the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation. Such appeals shall be granted consistent with the standards of
section 60.6 of the rules and regulations of the national flood insurance
program (44 CFR 59-76). (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)
8-7-5: PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION:
   A.   General Standards: In all areas of special flood hazard, the following
standards are required:
      1.   Anchoring:
         a.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure.
         b.   All manufactured homes must likewise be anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement, and shall be installed using methods
and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but
are not limited to, use of over the top or frame ties to ground anchors
(reference FEMA's "Manufactured Home Installation In Flood Hazard Areas"
guidebook for additional techniques).
      2.   Construction Materials And Methods:
         a.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
         b.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
         c.   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning
equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or otherwise
elevated or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within
the components during conditions of flooding.
      3.   Utilities:
         a.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
         b.   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and
discharge from the systems into floodwaters; and
         c.   On site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
      4.   Subdivision Proposals:
         a.   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
         b.   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage;
         c.   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided
to reduce exposure to flood damage; and
         d.   Where base flood elevation data has not been provided or is not
available from another authoritative source, it shall be generated for
subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which contain at least
fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres (whichever is less).
      5.   Review Of Building Permits: Where elevation data is not available
either through the flood insurance study or from another authoritative source
(subsection
8-7-4C2 of this chapter), applications for building permits shall be reviewed
to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The
test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data,
high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Failure
to elevate at least two feet (2') above grade in these zones may result in
higher insurance rates.
   B.   Specific Standards: In all areas of special flood hazard where base
flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in subsection
8-7-3B, "Basis For Establishing The Areas Of Special Flood Hazard" or
8-7-4C2, "Use Of Other Base Flood Data", of this chapter, the following
provisions are required:
      1.   Residential Construction:
         a.   New construction and substantial improvements of any residential
structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
base flood elevation.
         b.   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to
flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:
            (1)   A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
            (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
(1') above grade.
            (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices, provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters. Any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated to or above base flood elevation.
      2.   Nonresidential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the level
of the base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, shall:
         a.   Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure
is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
         b.   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effect of buoyancy;
         c.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted
standards of practice for meeting provisions of this subsection based on their
development and/or review of the structural design. Such certifications shall
be provided to the administrator as set forth in subsection
8-7-4C3b of this chapter.
         d.   Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed,
must meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in
subsection B1b of this section.
         e.   Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be
notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot
(1') below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building constructed to the base
flood level will be rated as 1 foot below that level).
      3.   Manufactured Homes: All manufactured homes to be placed or
substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH and AE shall be elevated on a
permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at
or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system in accordance with the provisions of subsection A1b
of this section.
   C.   Floodways: Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
subsection
8-7-3B of this chapter are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is
an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwater which carries
debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions
apply:
      1.   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development unless certification by a
registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that
encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      2.   If subsection C1 of this section is satisfied, all new construction
and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this section. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)
8-7-6: NONLIABILITY CLAUSE:
The granting of approval of any structure or use shall not constitute a
representation, guarantee or warranty of any kind or nature of the city or its
governing body or by any officer or employee thereof, of the practicality or
safety of any structure or use proposed and shall create no liability upon or
cause action against such public body, officer or employee for any damage that
may result pursuant thereto. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)
8-7-7: RESTRICTIONS:
Restrictions regarding height, rear yards, side yards, front yard setback,
minimum lot area, signs, vision clearance and parking space shall be the same
as set forth in each specific district located within the floodplain overlay
zone area. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)
8-7-8: PROHIBITED USES:
It shall be unlawful to erect, alter, maintain or establish in a floodplain
overlay zone any building, use or occupancy not permitted or allowed in the
foregoing provision, except existing nonconforming uses may continue as herein
provided. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)

8-9-1: PURPOSES:
It shall be the policy to guide a major development of land construction by
encouraging planned unit development (PUD) to achieve the following:
   A.   A maximum choice of living environments by allowing a variety of
housing and building types and permitting an increased density per acre and a
reduction in lot dimensions, yards, building setbacks and acre requirements;
   B.   A more useful pattern of open space and recreation areas and if
permitted as part of the project, more convenience in location of accessory
commercial uses, industrial uses and services;
   C.   A development pattern, which preserves and utilizes natural topography
and geological features, scenic vistas, trees and other vegetation and prevents
the disruption of natural drainage patterns;
   D.   A more efficient use of land than is generally achieved through
conventional development resulting in substantial savings through shorter
utilities and streets; and
   E.   A development pattern in harmony with land use density, transportation
and community facilities' objectives of the comprehensive plan. (Ord. 441, 7-
24-2002)
8-9-2: PROVISIONS GOVERNING PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT:
Whenever there is a conflict or difference between the provisions of this
chapter and those of the other chapters of this title, the provisions of this
chapter shall prevail. Subjects not covered by this chapter shall be governed
by the respective provisions found elsewhere in this title. (Ord. 441, 7-24-
2002)
8-9-3: MINIMUM AREA:
A PUD for the following principal uses shall contain an area of not less than:
   A.   Two (2) acres for residential development;
   B.   Two (2) acres for residential use with subordinate commercial or
industrial uses;
   C.   Two (2) acres for commercial use; and
   D.   Ten (10) acres for industrial use. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)
8-9-4: USES PERMITTED:
All uses that may be allowed within the land use district are permitted within
a PUD. Also, up to ten percent (10%) of the gross land area may be directed to
other commercial, industrial, public and quasi-public uses that are not allowed
within the land use district; provided, there is a favorable finding by the
commission:
   A.   That the uses are appropriate with the residential uses;
   B.   That the uses are intended to serve principally the residents of the
PUD;
   C.   That the uses be located and so designed as to provide direct access to
a collector or an arterial street without creating congestion or traffic
hazards; and
   D.   That a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the proposed residential
development occur prior to the development of the related commercial or
industrial land uses. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)
8-9-5: OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS:
An application for approval of a PUD may be filed by a property owner or a
person having an existing interest in the property to be included in the PUD.
The PUD application shall be filed by the holder(s) of an equitable interest in
such property.
Before approval is granted to the final development plan, the entire project
shall be under single ownership or control and legal title must be presented
with the final development plan. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)
8-9-6: COMMON OPEN SPACE:
A minimum of ten percent (10%) of the gross land area developed in any
residential PUD project shall be reserved for common open space and
recreational facilities for the residents or users of the area being developed.
The required amount of common open space land reserved under a PUD shall either
be held in corporate ownership by owners of the project area for the use of
each owner who buys property within the development or be dedicated to the
public and retained as common open space for parks, recreation and related
uses. Public utility and similar easements and rights of way for watercourses
and other similar channels are not acceptable for common open space dedication
unless such land or right of way is usable as a trail or other similar purpose
and approved by the commission.
The responsibility for the maintenance of all open space shall be specified by
the developer before approval of the final development plan.
Every property developed under the PUD approach should be designated to abut
upon common open space or similar areas. A clustering of dwellings is
encouraged. In areas where townhouses are used, there shall be no more than
eight (8) townhouses in any contiguous group. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)
8-9-7: UTILITY REQUIREMENTS:
Underground utilities, including telephone and electrical systems, are required
within the limits of all PUDs. Appurtenances to these systems, which can be
effectively screened, may be exempted from this requirement if the commission
finds that such exemption will not violate the intent or character of the
proposed PUD. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)
8-9-8: INCREASED RESIDENTIAL DENSITY:
To provide for an incentive for quality PUD, the commission may authorize an
increased residential density of up to fifteen percent (15%) of the allowable
number of dwelling units. Character, identity and architectural and siting
variation incorporated in a development shall be considered cause for density
increases, provided these factors make a substantial contribution to the
objectives of the PUD which are as follows:
   A.   Landscaping (a maximum increase of 5 percent), streetscape, open spaces
and plazas, use of existing landscaping, pedestrianway treatment and
recreational areas;
   B.   Siting (a maximum increase of 5 percent), visual focal points, use of
existing physical features such as topography, view, sun and wind orientation,
circulation pattern, physical environment, variation in building setbacks and
building grouping (such as clustering); and
   C.   Design features (a maximum increase of 5 percent), street sections,
architectural styles, harmonious use of materials, parking areas broken by
landscaping features and varied use of housing types. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)
8-9-9: ARRANGEMENT OF COMMERCIAL USES:
When PUD includes commercial uses, commercial buildings and establishments
shall be planned as groups having common parking areas and common ingress and
egress points in order to reduce the number of potential accident locations at
intersections. Planting screens or fences shall be provided on the perimeter of
the commercial areas abutting residential areas.
The plan of the project shall provide for the integrated and harmonious design
of buildings, and for adequate and properly arranged facilities for internal
traffic circulation, landscaping and such other features and facilities as may
be necessary to make the project attractive and efficient from the standpoint
of the adjoining and surrounding noncommercial areas.
All areas designed for future expansion or not intended for immediate
improvement or development shall be landscaped or otherwise maintained in a
neat and orderly manner. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)
8-9-10: ARRANGEMENT OF INDUSTRIAL USES:
PUDs may include industrial uses if it can be shown that the development
results in a more efficient and desirable use of land.
Industrial uses and parcels shall be developed in parklike surroundings
utilizing landscaping and existing woodlands as buffers to screen lighting,
parking areas, loading areas or docks and/or outdoor storage of raw materials
or products. A planned industrial area shall provide for the harmony of
buildings and a compact grouping in order to economize in the provision of such
utility services as is required. Thoroughfares shall be kept to a minimum
throughout a planned industrial area in order to reduce through traffic.
Project side yards of forty feet (40') and a rear yard of fifty feet (50')
shall be required if the project is located adjacent to any residential uses.
All intervening spaces between the right of way line and project building line
and intervening spaces between buildings, drives, parking areas and improved
areas shall be landscaped with trees and plantings and properly maintained at
all times. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)
8-9-11: PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF A PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT:
When the PUD also qualifies as a subdivision, the processing of the special use
permit and subdivision application shall occur at the same time. The granting
of a special use permit for PUD shall require a preapplication, the submission
of a preliminary development plan and approval by the commission of a final
development plan as specified within this title. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)
8-9-12: PREAPPLICATION MEETING:
The developer shall meet with the administrator prior to the submission of the
preliminary development plan. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss early
and informally the purpose and effect of this title and the criteria and

Within twenty eight (28) days after the public hearing the commission shall
review the preliminary development plan to determine if it is consistent with
the intent and purpose of this title; whether the proposed development advances
the general welfare of the community and neighborhood and whether the benefits,
combination of various land uses and the interrelationship with the land uses
in the surrounding area justify the deviation from standard district

Upon approval in principle of the development plan, an application for approval
of the final development plan may be filed with the administrator by at least
one property owner or person having a presently existing interest in the
property for which the PUD is proposed. Each application shall be signed by the
applicant, attesting to the truth and exactness of all information supplied on
the application for final development plan. Each application shall clearly
state that the approval shall expire and may be revoked if construction on the
project has not begun within two (2) years from the date of issuance of the
approval. At a minimum, the application shall contain the following

8-9-17: RECOMMENDATION BY COMMISSION:
Within sixty (60) days after receipt of the final development plan, the
commission shall recommend to the board or council that the final development
plan be approved as presented, approved with supplementary conditions or
disapproved. The commission shall then transmit all papers constituting the
record and the recommendations to the board or respective council. (Ord. 441,
7-24-2002; amd. Ord. 562, 5-22-2013)
The commission shall find that the facts submitted with the application and
presented to them establish that:
   A.   The proposed development can be initiated within two (2) years of the
date of approval;
   B.   Each individual unit of the development, as well as the total
development, can exist as an independent unit capable of creating an
environment of sustained desirability and stability or that adequate assurance
will be provided that such objective will be attained; the uses proposed will
not be detrimental to present or potential surrounding uses, but will have a
beneficial effect which would not be achieved under standard district
regulations;
   C.   The streets and thoroughfares proposed are suitable and adequate to
carry anticipated traffic, and increased densities will not generate traffic in
such amounts as to overload the street network outside the PUD;
   D.   Any proposed commercial development can be justified at the locations
proposed; (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)
   E.   Any exception from standard district requirements is warranted by the
design and other amenities incorporated in the final development plan; in
accordance with the PUD and the adopted policy of the board or council; (Ord.
441, 7-24-2002; amd. Ord. 562, 5-22-2013)
   F.   The area surrounding said development can be planned and zoned in
coordination and substantial compatibility with the proposed development;
   G.   The PUD is in general conformance with the comprehensive plan; and
   H.   The existing and proposed utility services are adequate for the
population densities and nonresidential uses proposed. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)
8-9-18: ACTION BY THE BOARD OR COUNCIL:
Within sixty (60) days after receipt of the final recommendation of the
commission, the board or council shall either approve, approve with
supplementary conditions or disapprove the application as presented. Upon
granting or denying the application, the board or council shall specify:
   A.   The ordinance and standards used in evaluating the application;
   B.   The reason for approval or denial; and
   C.   The actions, if any, that the applicant could take to obtain a permit.
Once the application is either approved or approved with conditions, then the
applicant may seek zoning review as set forth in the definition of "zoning
review and certificates" in section
8-2-2 of this title, but only in accordance with the approved final development
plan and the supplementary conditions attached thereto. (Ord. 562, 5-22-2013)
8-9-19: EXPIRATION AND EXTENSION OF APPROVAL PERIOD:
The approval of a final development plan for a PUD shall be for a period not to
exceed two (2) years to allow for preparation and recording of the required
subdivision plat and the development of the project. If no construction has
begun within two (2) years after approval is granted, the approval of the final
development plan shall be void. An extension of time limit or modification of
the approved final development plan may be granted if the commission finds that
such extension or modification is not in conflict with the public interest.

SECTION:
8-10-1: Intent
8-10-2: Incompatibility Of Nonconforming Uses
8-10-3: Avoidance Of Undue Hardship
8-10-4: Single Nonconforming Lots Of Record

8-10-6: Nonconforming Uses Of Structures Or Of Structures And Land In
Combination
8-10-7: Repairs And Maintenance
8-10-8: Uses Under Special Use Provisions Not Nonconforming Uses
8-10-1: INTENT:
It is the intent of this chapter to permit nonconforming uses to continue until
they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent
of this chapter that nonconforming uses shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or
extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited
elsewhere in the same district. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)
8-10-2: INCOMPATIBILITY OF NONCONFORMING USES:
Nonconforming uses are declared by this title to be incompatible with permitted
uses in the district in which such use is located. A nonconforming use shall
not be extended or enlarged after passage of this title by expansion of the
existing use or by alterations or additions to the existing buildings or
premises, or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be generally
prohibited in the district in which such use is located. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)
8-10-3: AVOIDANCE OF UNDUE HARDSHIP:
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this title shall be deemed to require a
change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which
actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption
of this title or adoption of a more restrictive amendment which would be
otherwise applicable to a previously permitted use and upon which actual
building construction has been carried on diligently. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)
8-10-4: SINGLE NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD:
In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family
dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of
record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this title,
notwithstanding limitations imposed by the other provisions of this title. Such
lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other
lots in the same ownership (see section
8-10-5 of this chapter). This provision shall apply even though such lot fails
to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally
applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements
other than those applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform
to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. (Ord. 441, 7-
24-2002)
8-10-5: NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD IN COMBINATION:
If two (2) or more lots or a combination of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership area of record at the time of passage
or amendment of this title and if all or part of the lots with no buildings do
not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands
involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of this
title and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which
diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this
title, nor any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with a width
or area below the requirements stated in this title. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)
8-10-6: NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES OR OF STRUCTURES AND LAND IN
COMBINATION:
If a lawful use involving individual structures, or a structure and land in
combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
title that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this title,
the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject
to the following provisions:
   A.   An existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this title in
the district in which it is located shall not be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located;
   B.   A nonconforming use shall not be extended to occupy any additional land
area;
   C.   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure or structure and land may, upon the issuance of a special use permit
by the commission, be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the
commission shall find that the proposed use is at least as appropriate to the
district as the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the
commission may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with
other provisions of this title;
   D.   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter
be resumed;
   E.   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and land in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned for more than two (2) years (except
when government action impedes access to the premises), the structure, or
structure and land in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in
conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located; and
   F.   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure, or a structure
and land in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall
eliminate the nonconforming status of the land, and the nonconforming use shall
not be resumed. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)
8-10-7: REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE:
On any nonconforming structure, or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs or on repair or
replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, provided that,
the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased.
Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety upon order of
such official. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)
8-10-8: USES UNDER SPECIAL USE PROVISIONS NOT NONCONFORMING USES:
Any use which is permitted as a special use in a district under the terms of
this title shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such a district, but
shall, without further action, be considered a conforming use for the duration
of the special use permit. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)

   A.   The owner of property used for parking and/or loading areas shall
maintain such area in good condition without holes and free of all
obstructions, trash and other debris.
   B.   All parking and loading areas shall provide for all weather use and
proper drainage of surface water to prevent the drainage of such water onto
adjacent properties or walkways.
   C.   Any parking area, which is intended to be used during nondaylight
hours, shall be properly illuminated to avoid accidents. Any lights used to
illuminate a parking lot shall be so arranged as to reflect and shield the
light away from adjoining property.
   D.   Any parking area shall be designed in such a manner that any vehicle
leaving or entering the parking area from or onto a public or private street
shall be traveling in a forward motion. Access driveways for parking areas or
loading spaces shall be located in such a way that any vehicle entering or
leaving such area shall be clearly visible by a pedestrian or motorist
approaching the access or driveway from a public or private street for a
reasonable distance considering the normal speed of such traffic.
   E.   Whenever a parking area is located in or adjacent to a residential
district, it shall be effectively screened on all sides which adjoin or face
any property used for residential purposes by an acceptably designed wall,
fence or planting screen. Such fence, wall or planting screen shall be not less
than four feet (4') or more than six feet (6') in height and shall be
maintained in good condition. The space between such fence, wall or planting
screen and the lot line of the adjoining premises in any residential district
shall be landscaped with grass, hardy shrubs or evergreen ground cover, and
maintained in good condition. In the event that terrain or other natural
features are such that the erection of such fence, wall or planting screen will
not serve the intended purpose, then no such fence, wall or planting screen and
landscaping shall be required.
   F.   Whenever a parking lot extends to a property line, wheel blocks or
other suitable devices shall be installed to prevent any part of a parked
vehicle from extending beyond the property line.
   G.   No part of any parking area for more than ten (10) vehicles shall be
closer than twenty feet (20') to any dwelling unit, school, hospital or other
institution for human care located on an adjoining lot unless separated by an
acceptably designed screen. If on the same lot with a one-family residence, the
parking area shall not be located within the front yard required for such
building. In no case shall any part of a parking area be closer than four feet
(4') to any established street or alley right of way.
   H.   The parking of a disabled vehicle within a residential or commercial
district for a period of more than two (2) weeks shall be prohibited, unless
such vehicle is stored in an enclosed garage or other accessory building.
   I.   Two (2) or more nonresidential users may jointly provide and use
parking spaces when their hours of operation do not normally overlap, provided
that a written agreement executed by each owner of the properties involved, and
duly recorded, establishes the unconditional right of each owner to use the
designated parking area during the permitted hours as long as each structure to
which the parking pertains remains in existence. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002; amd.
Ord. 2022-664, 9-14-2022)

record upon which the appeal is based. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)
8-14-3: STAY OF PROCEEDINGS:
An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action taken unless the
administrator certifies to the commission after the notice of appeal is filed

8-14-4: VARIANCE:
The commission may authorize in specific cases such variance from the terms of
this title as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to
special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this title would
result in unnecessary hardship. No nonconforming use of the neighboring lands,
structures or buildings in the same district and no permitted or nonconforming
use of lands, structures or buildings in other districts shall be considered
grounds for issuance of a variance. Variances shall not be granted on the
grounds of convenience or profit, but only where strict application of the
provisions of this title would result in unnecessary hardship. (Ord. 441, 7-24-

   B.   Legal description of property;
   C.   Description of nature of variance requested; and
   D.   A narrative statement demonstrating that the requested variance
conforms to the following standards:
      1.   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are not
applicable to other lands, structures or buildings in the same district;
      2.   That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this title would
deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the
same district under the terms of this title;
      3.   That special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant; and
      4.   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this title to other lands,
structures or buildings in the same district.
A variance shall not be granted unless the commission makes specific findings
of fact based directly on the particular evidence presented to it, which
supports conclusions that the above mentioned standards and conditions have
been met by the applicant. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)
8-14-6: SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS:
Under no circumstances shall the commission grant an appeal or variance to
allow a use not permissible under the terms of this title in the district
involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of
this title in said district. In granting any appeal or variance, the commission
may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this
title. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the
terms under which the appeal or variance is granted, shall be deemed a
violation of this title. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)
8-14-7: PUBLIC HEARING:

and shall include the specific legal basis for appeal and the results sought.
The commission will render a written decision that will be communicated to the
appellant and applicant.
   B.   Procedure: Appeals of decisions made by the commission shall be
determined by the city council. The procedure for an appeal shall be as
follows:
      1.   Fees governing appeals must be paid at the time of the filing of the
appeal. The legal basis for the appeal must be stated in writing before an
appeal will be deemed accepted for consideration. The written notice of appeal
shall contain name, address and phone number of appellant and, if different,
the name, address and phone number of the property owner; and it shall include
the street address and legal description of property which is the subject of
the appeal. The record of the proceedings before the commission shall be
transmitted by the commission to the city clerk before consideration of the
appeal by the city council.
      2.   Appeals of final decisions made by the commission may only be
appealed to the city council if a written request for reconsideration has been
previously submitted to the commission within fourteen (14) days of the final
decision of the commission. The request for reconsideration shall state the
issues to be considered on reconsideration and the legal basis for the relief
sought. The commission shall respond in writing to any request for
reconsideration within fourteen (14) days of its filing, either modifying its
original decision or affirming its prior action. Only following issuance of the
commission's written decision regarding reconsideration, may the appeal process
proceed before the city council. The appeal to the city council must also
include a copy of the request for reconsideration of the appeal before the
commission and the commission's decision on reconsideration. Any appeal to the
city council for which there is no request for reconsideration before the
commission shall be dismissed by the city clerk.
      3.   A request for appeal to the city council shall include the
explanation of the basis for appeal and the result sought and must be filed no
more than fourteen (14) days after the reconsideration decision of the

the request for reconsideration submitted to the commission.
      4.   After considering the written decision of the commission, the
decision on reconsideration, the record on appeal and the written appeal
submitted by the applicant, the city council may determine that the appeal has
no legal basis and dismiss it, may rule upon the appeal based upon the written
record placed before it or schedule an appeal hearing to allow oral
presentation of the issues associated with the appeal. Following conclusion of
the procedures it chooses to invoke, the city council will render a written
decision that will be communicated to the appellant and applicant.
   C.   Review Of Final Decision: An aggrieved party may seek judicial review
of a decision of the city council of any final decision of the council.
      1.   A decision of the city council is not a final decision until it has
been rendered in writing and delivered to the applicant. Also, it is not a
final decision, subject to review, until a written request for reconsideration
has been submitted to the city clerk within fourteen (14) days of the final
decision of the council, stating the issues to be reconsidered and specific
legal basis for the relief sought.
      2.   The council shall respond in writing to any request for
reconsideration within fourteen (14) days of its filing, either modifying its
original decision or affirming its prior action. The city council may determine
that the request for reconsideration has no legal basis and dismiss it, may
rule upon the request based upon the written record placed before it, or
schedule a hearing to allow oral presentation of the issues associated with the
request. The city council will render a written decision that will be
communicated to the appellant and applicant.
      3.   A failure to request reconsideration is a failure of the appellant
to exhaust administrative remedies.
   D.   Fees: During the process of appeal or of reconsideration, should either
the commission or the council determine that new or additional public hearings
must be held, requiring new notice of hearing to be sent or published, the cost
of such shall be borne by the applicant. The cost of such shall be paid in

utilities, and equipment enclosures) shall be constructed out of nonreflective
materials (visible exterior surfaces only). Telecommunications support
facilities shall be designed to blend in with existing architecture in the area
or shall be screened from sight by mature landscaping, and shall be located or
designed to minimize their visibility.
      7.   Telecommunications towers, facilities and antennas shall be designed
and constructed in accordance with the uniform building code and other
applicable state and federal requirements.
      8.   The maximum height of an antenna platform located on a rooftop shall
be twenty feet (20') above the roof.
      9.   Telecommunication facilities shall not interfere with the signals of
or physically obstruct existing or proposed public safety, fire protection or
supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) operations. The facilities
owner, at no cost to the city, shall correct any actual interference and
obstruction.
   B.   Height: In the case of building mounted towers the height of the tower
includes the height of the portion of the building on which it is mounted.
   C.   Security Lighting: Security lighting for the equipment shelters or
cabinets and other on the ground ancillary equipment is permitted, as long as
it complies with the city Code.
   D.   Current Standards: All towers, poles, antennas and related equipment
must meet current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other
agency of the federal or state government with the authority to regulate
towers, poles, antennas and related equipment.
   E.   Structural Integrity: To ensure the structural integrity of towers and
poles, the towers and poles must be maintained in compliance with industry
standards and applicable codes.
   F.   Signage: No facilities may bear any signage or advertisement(s) other
than signage required by law or expressly permitted or required by the city.
   G.   Visual Impact: All towers, poles, facilities, and equipment in or near
residential zones shall be sited and designed to minimize adverse visual
impacts on surrounding properties and the traveling public to the greatest
extent reasonably possible, consistent with the proper functioning of the
towers, poles, facilities and equipment. Such towers, poles, facilities and
equipment shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with the
existing characteristics of the site. Such towers, poles, facilities, and
equipment shall also be designed to either resemble the surrounding landscape
and other natural features where located in proximity to natural surroundings,
or be reasonably compatible with the built environment, through matching and
complementary existing structures and specific design considerations such as
architectural designs, height, scale, color, and texture or be reasonably
consistent with other uses and improvements permitted in the relevant zone.
   H.   Antenna Arrays: Antenna arrays are permitted in any zone as long as
they are located upon an existing structure (except on single family houses,
apartments, or duplexes) that provides sufficient elevation for the array’s
operation without the necessity of constructing a tower, pole, or other
apparatus to extend the antenna array more than twenty feet (20') above the
structure. If any tower, pole, or other apparatus exceeding the height
extension of twenty feet (20') is needed to achieve the desired elevation, then
a special use permit, and if applicable, height variance is required from the
City Council.
   I.   Site Design Flexibility. Individual sites vary in the location of
adjacent buildings, existing trees, topography, and other local variables. By
mandating certain design standards, there may result a project that could have
been less intrusive if the location of the various elements of the project
could have been placed in more appropriate locations within a given site.
Therefore, the tower, pole, equipment, and facilities may be installed so as to
best camouflage, disguise, or conceal them to make them more closely compatible
with and blend into the setting or host structure, upon approval by the city.
   J.   Lighting: Telecommunication towers shall not be artificially lighted
unless required by the FAA or other applicable regulatory authority.
   K.   Site Development And Roads:

commission.
      3.   All sites must be served by an easement with a turnaround. The City
planning and zoning commission may modify the easement and turnaround
requirement after public hearing and review. All sites shall use existing
access points and roads whenever possible. The applicable road jurisdiction
shall approve the access point to the site.
   L.   Vegetation Protection And Facility Screening:
      1.   All telecommunications facilities shall be installed in such a
manner so as to minimize disturbance to existing native vegetation and shall
include suitable mature landscaping to screen the facility, where necessary to
be compatible with adjoining and surrounding areas. For purposes of this
section, “mature landscaping” shall mean trees, shrubs or other vegetation of a
size that will provide the appropriate level of visual screening.
      2.   Upon project completion, the owner(s)/operator(s) of the facility
shall be responsible for maintenance and replacement of all required vegetation
and landscaping.
   M.   Fire Prevention: All telecommunication facilities shall be designed and
operated in accordance with all applicable codes regarding fire prevention.
   N.   Noise And Traffic: All telecommunication facilities shall be
constructed and operated in such a manner as to minimize the amount of
disruption caused to nearby properties. To that end all the following measures
shall be implemented for telecommunication facilities:
      1.   Noise producing construction activities shall only take place on
weekdays (Monday through Friday, nonholidays) between the hours of seven
o’clock (7:00) A.M. and five o’clock (5:00) P.M., except in times of emergency

8-19-24: PUBLIC NUDITY PROHIBITED:
   A.   The United States supreme court decision in Barnes v. Glen Theater,
Inc., 501 U.S. 560, 111 S. Ct. 2456, 115 L. Ed.2d 504 (1991) and Erie v. Pap's
A.M., 120 S. Ct. 1382, 146 L. Ed.2d 265, upheld the rights of cities to
prohibit public nudity at any sexually oriented businesses, regardless of
whether or not a permit has been issued to said businesses, including
businesses where no alcoholic beverages are sold, served, or consumed at the
premises. The city expressly finds that the secondary effects associated with
live adult entertainment and public nudity adversely impact and threaten to
impact the public health, safety and welfare by providing an atmosphere
conducive to violence, sexual harassment, public intoxication, prostitution,
the spread of sexually transmitted disease and other deleterious effects.
Accordingly, consistent with such decisions, the city intends by this chapter
to prohibit public nudity within the city.

business shall permit, allow, hire, sponsor or employ any other person for the
purpose of appearing in a state of nudity at any public building, public park

not apply to:
      1.   Any child under ten (10) years of age;

infant less than two (2) years of age;
      3.   Any person while performing any excretory function within a public
restroom;
      4.   Any person changing his or her clothing in a dressing room, the sole
purpose of which is to provide personal privacy for such purposes; or
      5.   Any person while receiving medical or therapeutic treatment from any

of Idaho. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)

this chapter for any applicable classification;
      2.   The business has a permit which is under suspension;
      3.   The business has a permit which has been revoked; or

person appearing in a state of nudity did so in a modeling class operated:
      1.   By a college, junior college, or university supported entirely or
partly by taxation;
      2.   By a private college or university which maintains and operates
educational programs in which credits are transferable to a college, junior

   B.   Nothing herein contained shall prevent or restrict the city from taking
such other lawful action in any court of competent jurisdiction as is necessary
to prevent or remedy any violation or noncompliance. Such other lawful actions
shall include, but shall not be limited to, an equitable action for injunctive
relief or an action at law for damages.
   C.   All remedies and penalties provided for in this section shall be
cumulative and independently available to the city and the city shall be
authorized to pursue any and all remedies set forth in this section to the full
extent allowed by law. (Ord. 441, 7-24-2002)

percent (110%) of the total estimated cost for completing construction of the
specific public improvements, as estimated by the developer's consulting
engineer and approved by the City Engineer.
         c.   Term Length: The term length in which the bond is in force, for
the duration of that phase of the project, shall be for a period to be
specified by the Council for the specific public improvement.
         d.   Bonding Or Surety Company: The bond shall be with a bonding or
surety company authorized to do business in the State of Idaho, acceptable to
the Council.

         e.   Removal Of The Cash Deposit: Removal of the cash deposit by
anyone other than the City, revocation of the letter of credit, cancellation or
removal of the certified check, negotiable bond or such surety allowed by the
City, voids approval of the final plat; and no building permits may be issued
for any further construction in the subdivision.
   B.   Conditional Approval Of Final Plat: With respect to financial
guarantees, the approval of all final subdivision plats shall be conditioned on
the accomplishment of one of the following:
      1.   The construction of improvements required by this title shall have
been completed by the subdivider and approved by the City Engineer.

of a cash deposit, certified check, negotiable bond, irrevocable bank letter of
credit or surety bond.
   C.   Developer's Agreement: Unless waived by the City Council, before
approving a final plat and construction plans and specifications for public
improvements, an agreement between the developer or subdivider and the Council
shall be made to provide for checking or inspecting the construction and its
conformity to the submitted plans. The owner, if different from the developer
or subdivider, shall be made a party to the agreement.
   D.   Action In Case Of Failure To Complete The Construction Of A Public
Improvement: In the event the subdivider shall fail to complete such work

Council shall reimburse itself for the cost and expense thereof by
appropriating the cash deposit, certified check, irrevocable bank letter of
credit, or negotiable bond which the subdivider may have deposited in lieu of a
surety bond, or may take such steps as may be necessary to require performance
by the bonding or surety company, and as included in a written agreement as
above provided. In addition to all other remedies, the City will not issue
further building permits for the subdivision until the improvements are
provided or the matter is otherwise resolved. If no improvements have been
made, the City may void the approval of the final plat.
   E.   Security: The City will hold ten percent (10%) of security for a two
(2) year warranty period from date of acceptance of said improvements. At the
completion of the two (2) year warranty period a final inspection will be
conducted. Any noted deficiencies in said final inspections must be corrected
prior to the release of the remaining security held by the City. Balance of
security will be paid within thirty (30) days of acceptance by City. Interest
will not be paid on any security held by the City.
   F.   Final Plat And Covenants: Final plat and covenants, if any, shall be
filed by the subdivider/developer with the County Recorder within ninety (90)
days after written approval by the Council; otherwise, such approval shall
become null and void unless prior to said expiration date an extension of time
is applied for and granted by the commission. No building permits may be issued
for the subdivision until such recording has occurred. A copy of the recorded
plat, as recorded, shall be given by the developer to the City. (Ord. 579, 10-

subdivision: It is unlawful for any owner of a lot in this subdivision to
further subdivide any lot in this subdivision without further formal compliance
with the requirements of the City of Heyburn's subdivision ordinance for
approval of amended subdivision plats. The terms "further subdivide" shall
include all definitions in the Heyburn City Code and Idaho state law, as well
as any form of transfer of ownership of less than the entire lot or interest in
a lot to any other person or entity, other than the granting of lawful and
appropriate easements, lawful pledges or liens.
      2.    Variance To Prohibition Of Further Subdivision Of Lots: A lot owner
who, because the prohibition against further subdivision, is placed in a
position of hardship due to the unique circumstances of the lot in question as
defined in title 8 of this code, may make written application to the city for a
variance in the same manner and providing the same information as required in
title 8 of this code. In addition thereto, the application shall provide the
following:

plat is either not feasible or impractical which shall include a statement as
to why the request either does or does not affect other lot owners in the
subdivisions and whether, in the opinion of the applicant, there are other lots
in the subdivision that require similar variance or further subdivisions.
      3.    Procedure: The procedure for granting such a variance shall be as
follows: The written petition, accompanied with payment of a fee in the amount
set by resolution of the council, shall first be presented to the city council.
The council shall then hold a public hearing on the petition, after giving
notice by mail to the last known address to all owners of lots and persons
using or occupying buildings or residences within the subdivision as well as
giving notice as provided in subsection 9-3-3G of this title. If the council
determines that it will waive the requiring of submission and approval of an
amended subdivision plat, then it shall refer the matter to the planning and
zoning commission. The procedure set forth in title 8 of this code, shall then
apply to the consideration and granting of such application for variance by the
planning and zoning commission. (Ord. 359, 7-13-1994)
9-4-11: PLANTING STRIPS AND RESERVE STRIPS:
   A.    Planting Strips: Planting strips shall be required to be placed next

Public sites and open spaces shall conform to the following:
   A.   Public Uses: Where a proposed park, playground, school or other public
use shown on the comprehensive development plan is located in whole or part
within a subdivision, a suitable area for this purpose shall be dedicated to
the public or reserved for public purchase. If within two (2) years of plat
recording, the purchase is not agreed on, the reservation shall be canceled or
shall automatically cease to exist; and
   B.    Natural Features: Existing natural features which add value to
residential development and enhance the attractiveness of the community (such
as trees, watercourses, historic spots and similar irreplaceable assets) shall
be preserved, insofar as possible, in the design of the subdivision. (1982
Code)
9-4-13: LARGE SCALE DEVELOPMENTS:
Large scale developments shall be governed by the following provisions:
   A.   Modification: This title may be modified in accordance with the
variance provisions of this title in the case of a subdivision large enough to
constitute a complete community or neighborhood, consistent with the
comprehensive development plan which provides and dedicates adequate public
open space and improvements for circulation, recreation, education, light, air
and service needs of the track when fully developed and populated; and
   B.    Neighborhood Characteristics: A community or neighborhood under this
provision shall be consistent with the comprehensive development plan, bounded
