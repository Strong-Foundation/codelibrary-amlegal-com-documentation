clearly stated. In the event an appeal of a suspension is denied by the City
Council, the suspension period shall commence at one minute after twelve
o'clock (12:01) A.M. on the day immediately following issuance of the denial by
the City Council.

working days to rectify. If the deficiency or violation is not corrected within

the City Clerk shall reconsider the determination and, if the person so
requests in the petition, grant the person an oral hearing and give said person
ten (10) days' notice of the time and place of the hearing personally or by

be no right of review to the City Council nor to the District Court on the
determination of taxes due made by the City Clerk unless a redetermination has

cost thereof.
F.   Purpose; Indemnification:
   1.   Purpose: By this section, it is not the intent of the city to oversee

access will have no appreciable impact on any of the foregoing criteria, a
permit shall issue.
   2.   Material Impact:
      a.   Notice To Applicant: If in the judgment of the city engineer the
access will materially impact one or more of the foregoing criteria, then he
shall, in writing, state in what respect said items are impacted and state the
manner which if possible such impact may be cured or reduced to an acceptable
level.

10-3-15: ANNUAL REVIEW/SEWER STUDY:
A.   Authority: The city shall have authority to perform a yearly analysis of
its sewer usage and appropriately charge customers their proportionate share on
the system. In doing so the city shall establish a number of equivalent
dwelling units (EDU’s) assigned to each sewer customer so that a billing rate
can be multiplied by the EDU's to derive the total monthly charge for each
customer. The city shall also have authority to establish volumetric water
usage value for non-residential customers, that is delivered to the City's
wastewater treatment plant outside of typical irrigation months.
B.   EDU Count: One (1) EDU shall be the minimum unit assignment to any
customer in any class. Monthly sewer EDU's will be assigned as described below
for each customer class listed. One (1) EDU is defined as 4,500 gallons of
water use.
C.   EDU Assignment:
   1.   Residential: Includes all single-family, duplex and multifamily
residential structures. These assignments will be charged one (1) EDU per
dwelling unit. Accessory dwelling units are considered separate dwelling units
for the purposes of this chapter.

usage as described in subsection D of this chapter. Businesses that contain
residential structures or units shall be considered commercial for the purposes
of this chapter.
D.   EDU Establishment: All customers listed in subsection C2 of this section
shall be charged based the following EDU's method:
   1.   Based on the average water volume used within the months of November,
December, January and February. The exact dates for usage for these months vary
slightly based on billing cycles and timing of meters reads.
   2.   The average water use in gallons will be divided by 4,500, which is the
number of gallons used to define one EDU, as shown in the following equation:
   Average Water Use
         EDU's =    ________________________
   4,500 Gallons
   3.   The resulting EDU number as formulated in subsection D2 of this section
shall be used for sewer billings beginning in the month of May and will
continue until the end of April of the following year.
E.   Water Leaks:
   1.   If high water usage occurs during the months of November, December,
January and February and is determined by the City to be caused by a leak that
may or may not have entered the sewer system, the City may adjust the EDU value
established for those customers whose rates are based on water volume. if the
leak is repaired prior to the next cycle in which the sewer study is conducted.
      a.   If the City is unable to assign a base line EDU value because of a
leak in the EDU establishment period (November through February) the City may
look at data from other non-irrigation months to establish the customer's EDU
number.
   2.   If high water usage occurs is not corrected prior to the survey study
being completed, the city may cause EDU values to be established for those
customers whose rates are based on volume to be in effect for the entirety of
the survey period, per subsection D3 of this section.
   3.   Residential: Any residential customer which a water leak occurs and is
determined by the City to enter the sewer system, shall be charged based on the
number of EDU's calculated on water usage during the period that the leak
occurs and continues. That shall remain in effect for the rate period
established with subsection D3 of this section.
F.   Customer Assignment: The city reserves the right to determine the type of
customer receiving sanitary service and to classify the type of customer within
the foregoing categories. In the event of a dispute relative to the type of
customer receiving sewer service and accordingly the applicable sewer rate, the
city's determination as to the type of customer shall be binding upon the
customer in the absence of apparent error. A customer disputing the
classification shall have the right to appeal the determination of the city by
making a written request to the city council for a redetermination, the
determination of the city council shall be likewise binding on the customer in
the absence of apparent error.
G.   Grievances: Any customer aggrieved by a decision made by City staff is
entitled to an appeal pursuant to section
10-1-22  of this chapter. Any customer who does not timely file for appeal

10-4-1: WATER SHORTAGE POLICY:
Purpose: The council finds that it is essential for the health and safety of
the public and property that the integrity of the water system be protected to
maintain its continued availability to deliver water as necessary to protect
the health and safety of the persons and property within the service area to
establish procedures, authority, and criteria to allocate restricted or limited
water supplies in times of emergency or shortage.
In the exercise of this authority, it shall be recognized that protecting the
integrity of the system from damage or destruction is of primary importance to
enable the city to continue, with minimal disruption, the delivery of water to
the users as is necessary for the protection of the health and public safety of
the persons or property within the city and served by the system. (Ord. 608, 6-
6-2023)
10-4-2: AUTHORITY:
A.   The mayor and council do, therefore, by the enactment hereof, establish an
official policy for:
   1.   The protection of the water system from damage in times of emergency.
   2.   For the redirecting of the system's resources to the highest priority
use in times of emergency.
   3.   For the establishment of priority uses in times when the demand for
water service exceeds the capacity of the system to deliver water to the users
served by the system; and
   4.   To grant authority to the mayor or, if unavailable, the president of
the council, to establish an orderly system to ration or limit the delivery of
water to users in the event of emergency or inability of the system to supply
the expected demand for water. (Ord. 608, 6-6-2023)
10-4-3: POWERS OF SUPERINTENDENT AND/OR CITY ADMINISTRATOR:
A.   In circumstances of emergency, the superintendent of water and sewer and/
or city administrator may, without prior notice, immediately take such action
as is necessary to:
   1.   Protect the system from further damage or harm; and/or
   2.   Prevent the system from causing damage or harm to persons or property;
and/or
   3.   Limit and direct the system's capacity to deliver water both in
sufficient quantity and at sufficient pressure to any portion of the system as
they deem necessary to protect persons or property from events threatening
their health and safety.
B.   Shutoff Without Notice: This authority shall include the authority to
summarily, without prior notice, shut off service to all or any portion of the
system or any user without prior notice as they shall deem necessary or
redirect the capacity of the system to deliver water to avoid or minimize the
anticipated or occurring damage or hazard to the system and/or persons or
property in the service area.
C.   Report To Mayor And Council: The person exercising this emergency
authorization shall, as promptly as reasonably possible, report these events
and the action taken to the mayor or president of the council, who shall report
such to the council at the next regular or special meeting of the council.
(Ord. 608, 6-6-2023)
10-4-4: PROCEDURE IN EVENT OF SHORTAGE OR ANTICIPATED SHORTAGE:

shortage of water, the superintendent of water and sewer and/or city
administrator shall report the shortage or anticipated shortage to the mayor,
or if he or she is unavailable, the president of the council, who is empowered
to establish a system of rationing or limiting the delivery of water to the
users.
B.   Use Priorities: In establishing such system of rationing, priority shall
be given to the use of water for the following purposes stated in order of
descending priority:
   1.   Sufficient reserves for emergency use and emergency facility, i.e.,
firefighting, fire stations hospitals, nursing homes, etc.
   2.   Residential inside building use and residential outside potable and

   The system of rationing may either restrict or limit lower priority uses in
favor of higher priority uses or rationing may be applied to more than one
class of users to permit continued but reduced usage by several levels of
priority uses. Any rationing system may provide that a class of use may be
restricted to use on certain days of the week, times of the day, or quantities
of water as may be determined to be fair and equitable and in consideration of
the use priorities herein established. (Ord. 608, 6-6-2023)
10-4-5: CLASSES OF SERVICE:
Because of the potential for larger diameter service connections to draw a
disproportionate quantity of water from the system each diameter size of
service connection shall constitute a separate class of service connection and
the larger service connection may be shut off or otherwise restricted to limit
or stop the flow of water to ensure adequate quantity and pressure is
maintained to users with smaller diameter connections applying the water to
uses of an equal or higher priority. (Ord. 608, 6-6-2023)
10-4-6: NOTICE OF SYSTEM LIMITATIONS:
Notice of the system for limitation or rationing of service shall be given as

special or regular meeting. After considering the facts, the council shall, by
resolution, take action either:
   1.   Terminating the rationing system; or
   2.   Continue the rationing system as established; or
   3.   Continue the rationing system with modification to the policy as
established by the mayor or president of the city council.
B.   Failure of the council to take such action shall result in automatic
termination of the policy of rationing. A modification or termination by vote
or inaction of the council shall not bar the mayor or president of the council,
upon a finding of additional facts and circumstances, from again exercising
their authority to again establish a system of rationing following such meeting
of the council. (Ord. 608, 6-6-2023)

10-5-22: ROUTING AND MAINTENANCE OF TRAFFIC DURING CONSTRUCTION:
A.   Maintaining Traffic; Closing: During construction, traffic shall be
maintained at all times so as to cause as little inconvenience as possible to
the occupants of abutting property and to the general public; provided, that
the city engineer may permit the closing of public properties to all traffic
for a designated period of time, if, in his/her opinion it is necessary. Before
any public property may be closed or restricted to traffic the permittee must
obtain the approval of the city engineer and notify the chief of the fire
department and the chief of the police department. The permittee shall route
and control all traffic, including its own vehicles, as directed by the chief
of the police department. Upon completion of construction work, the chief of
the police department and the chief of the fire department shall again be
notified before traffic is returned to its normal route.
B.   Through Traffic; Detour: Through traffic shall be maintained without
detours if possible. When it is necessary to construct a detour, the permittee

least one million dollars ($1,000,000.00), verification of such a program will
be an acceptable substitute to the insurance requirement. Permittee by working
under this chapter does thereby indemnify and hold harmless the city against
all actions, claims and suits. (1959 Code § 4-7-23)
10-5-24: PLANS FOR CONSTRUCTION:
Plans for construction and other work in public ways shall be provided in
advance through completion and submittal of the city excavation permit

trust holds the lease on the land but allows separate purchase of the
residence. A condominium plat or a subdivision and planned unit development are
required.
   E.   Density: Due to design requirements and reduced house sizes, a bonus
density multiplier of 1.5 is allowed for cottage house development. (For
example, if the underlying zone permitted five (5) dwelling units, the bonus
density of 1.5 allows eight (8) cottage dwellings.) Fractional density
calculations ending in 0.5 or greater may be rounded up to the next whole
number. Where there is no minimum lot/parcel size for the zoning district, a
minimum of five thousand (5,000) square feet of land per dwelling is the basis
to be used for the calculation.
   F.   The following development standards and design criteria shall apply to
proposed cottage developments:

(Ord. 621, 5-20-2025)
11-12-5: DESIGN:
   A.   Lot Design: Lots may deviate from the minimum zoning district lot
width. Lots within the residential districts may deviate from the minimum lot
area standard, so long as the total number of lots do not exceed the units
allowed based on the lot area minimum for the entire subject area. Lots within
the commercial, medical, or industrial districts are not subject to the minimum
lot area standards, provided lots are sized to accommodate the use, required
parking, and other applicable zoning standards.
   B.   Clustering: The clustering of lots and housing units to allow greater
open space and reduced infrastructure costs is encouraged.
   C.   Setbacks: Reduced or zero setbacks may be permitted where structures
adjoin common areas, courtyards, open spaces, private streets, or common walls.
Setbacks to the exterior property lines of the subject property shall meet the
zoning district minimums. The setback reductions must be requested in the PUD
application and shown on the final plan.
   D.   Variations: The city may approve variations to design and construction
standards, where the applicant demonstrates that an alternative design would
better serve the proposed development due to topography, service connections,
existing development patterns, or other unique features. The variations shall
not adversely affect city or public services and shall not be detrimental to
public health, safety, or welfare.
   E.   Access: Connections to public rights-of-way shall be consistent with
the city transportation plan and standards. Interior streets shall be designed
to meet minimum fire code standards.
   F.   Parking: Off-street parking shall meet the minimum standards of Chapter
14 of this title unless variations to the standards are approved through the
PUD process.

appropriate to the scale and location of the project, which may include any of
the following, subject to a negotiated agreement with the city:
      1.   A minimum ten percent (10%) of the gross acreage of the subject
property, dedicated as common or open space. The land may be dedicated to a
homeowners' association or to the city or other public entity through mutual
agreements. Proposed common/open space must be appropriate in scale, use, and
character to the planned unit development. The land shall be designed,
constructed, and maintained for recreational, community gardens, green belts,
courtyards, open space, or parkland.

11-12-6: MIXED USE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT:
   A.   Purpose: This subsection provides an option for an administrative site
plan review for a planned unit development within the mixed use zoning district
to create an incentive for a wider array of permitted uses and flexible design
and parking standards, provided certain standards are met to create a variety
of housing options, commercial uses, walkable and biking opportunities, and
public amenities.
   B.   Application: Application requirements for a mixed use planned unit
development shall be as provided in section
11-12-3, except that a site plan review application rather than a special use
permit application is required.
   C.   Requirements: A mixed use planned unit development shall include the
following minimum standards and features:
      1.   A plan to develop and construct walkable and bikeable public
connections within the development and leading to other public places and
recreational opportunities;
      2.   A mixture of housing options, optional mixed-use buildings
containing at least one (1) floor developed for non-residential uses, and
appropriately scaled commercial development as identified in the table of uses
in Appendix A of this title;
      3.   Public open space accompanied by a specific plan for the
construction, use, and maintenance of the area, which may include public art
and seating area, bandstand, small water feature or fountain and bench areas,
or other such amenities; and
      4.   A design to provide for clustered, cohesive development, allowing
for a more compact arrangement of buildings and fewer extensions of accesses
and infrastructure.
   D.   Allowances: The mixed use planned unit development may vary from
parking and zoning standards as set forth in the design standards section
11-12-5. There is no set maximum for the number of structures allowed per
parcel or lot for a mixed-use planned unit development. Design and density
shall be sufficient to accommodate required parking, utilities, setbacks,
coverage, and other applicable zoning standards of this title.
   E.   Process: A mixed use planned unit development meeting the requirements
of this subsection shall be reviewed pursuant to the administrative site plan
review procedures of section
11-13-5 of this title. The remaining sections of
11-12-4 of this title, paragraphs B through G shall apply to mixed use planned
unit developments.

11-13-3: Zoning Permit Reviews
11-13-4: Compliance Reviews
11-13-5: Administrative Site Plan Review
11-13-1: PURPOSE:
   This chapter establishes the types of applications and permits the zoning
administrator has the authority to act upon and sets forth the procedures for
consideration. The zoning administrator shall have the authority to make final
decisions on the applications and permits provided in this chapter, subject to
the right of appeal for any written final administrative decision made pursuant
to this title, as set forth in Chapter 3 of this title.
(Ord. 621, 5-20-2025)
11-13-2: ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PROCEDURES:
   Administrative reviews are authorized for applications, permits, petitions,
requests for reviews or interpretations, and zoning reviews that do not require
a public hearing, pursuant to this title and the state local land use planning
act. The following process shall be followed for administrative reviews:
   A.   Upon receipt of an application and fees to the city clerk, the zoning
administrator shall have a reasonable time, generally not to exceed thirty (30)
days, to examine the application for completeness with application requirements
and standards of this title. If the application is determined to be incomplete,
the zoning administrator shall notify the applicant in writing of the
deficiencies and specify the information needed to complete the application.
   B.   The zoning administrator shall conduct a review of the complete
application for compliance with applicable standards of this title. The zoning
administrator shall provide a written decision either approving, approving with
conditions, or denying the application, and citing the reasons for the
decision, the evidence of record, and standards used to reach the decision. If
denied, the zoning administrator shall state the actions, if any, that can be
taken to obtain approval and the rights of appeal.
(Ord. 621, 5-20-2025)
11-13-3: ZONING PERMIT REVIEWS:
   Zoning permit reviews are associated with building permit applications and
applications for placement or construction of exempt structures. Prior to the
construction or placement of any structure or the remodel or modification of a
structure that requires a building permit, the zoning administrator shall
review the application for compliance with the city's zoning regulations. If
the proposed structure and use are determined to be in compliance, the zoning
administrator may sign the permit application and need not provide a reasoned
statement as required by section
11-13-2B of this chapter. No zoning permit shall be issued for the
construction, remodel, modification, or placement of any structure that is not
in conformance with the use or development standards of this title.
(Ord. 621, 5-20-2025)
11-13-4: COMPLIANCE REVIEWS:
   A landowner may submit an application to the city to determine whether a
parcel of land or lot was created, divided, adjusted, or consolidated in
conformance with the city's land use laws in effect at the time of its
creation, interpretations of this title, or whether an established land use
meets zoning code. The application shall include a chain of title prepared by a
title company, unless the zoning administrator determines chain of title is not
necessary based upon the type of determination requested. If the zoning
administrator determines the land in question is not in compliance with the
land use laws in effect at the time of creation, the written decision shall
include actions that may need to be taken to bring the land into compliance.
The required actions shall be limited to the requirements of the laws in effect
at the time of the parcel or lot creation.
(Ord. 621, 5-20-2025)
11-13-5: ADMINISTRATIVE SITE PLAN REVIEW:
   A.   Purpose: The site plan review process allows the city to
administratively review proposed development in a timely manner without
requiring a public hearing. The administrative review ensures that future
development meets the applicable standards and requirements of city code and
addresses potential development impacts by setting conditions to mitigate those
impacts.
   B.   Applicability: Certain uses and proposed development, which are not
subject to the public hearing process as set forth in this title, are subject
to the administrative site plan review application process. Approval of the
site plan application is required prior to issuance of building permits,
encroachment approval, or any other such permits allowing the development to
commence. The following uses and developments require a site plan review:
      1.   Those specified in Appendix A of this title as requiring a site plan
review;
      2.   Residential developments of four (4) dwelling units or more on a
single lot or parcel;
      3.   Commercial, industrial or light industrial new development that
requires a building permit for construction, conversion, or enlargement and is
greater than four thousand (4,000) square feet.

area.
         b.   When two (2) identical sign faces are placed back to back so that
both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and are part of
the same sign structure, the sign area shall be computed as the measurement of
one of the two (2) faces.

12-1-1: TITLE:
These regulations shall officially be known and cited as the SUBDIVISION
ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF BONNERS FERRY. (Ord. 495, 12-20-2005)
12-1-2: PURPOSE:
These provisions are adopted to provide for the orderly division of land within
the City, and:
A.   To protect and provide for the public health, safety, and general welfare
of Bonners Ferry;
B.   To guide the future growth and development of the City in accordance with
the Comprehensive Plan;
C.   To encourage the order and beneficial development of the community's land;
D.   To guide public and private policy in order to provide adequate and
efficient streets, sewerage, drainage, parks and public facilities;
E.   To establish standards for development and installation of improvements
for subdivisions, including water, sewer, streets and drainage;
F.   To further the orderly layout and use of land, and to ensure proper legal
description and monumentation of subdivided land;
G.   To ensure that public facilities and services are available concurrent
with development and will have sufficient capacity to serve the subdivision;
H.   To ensure that the community will bear no more than its fair share of any
cost of providing services by requiring the developer to pay fees, furnish
land, or establish mitigation measures to provide a fair share of capital
facilities needs generated by the development;
I.   To assure the adequacy of drainage facilities to safeguard the water
table, and to encourage the wise use and management of natural resources to
preserve the stability and beauty of the community and the value of the land;
J.   To provide open space through the most efficient design and layout of
land, while preserving the density of development as established in the zoning
ordinance of Bonners Ferry. (Ord. 495, 12-20-2005)
12-1-3: AUTHORITY:
A.   This title is adopted pursuant to the authority delegated to the City
pursuant to article 12, section 2 of the Idaho Constitution, Idaho Code, title
67, chapter 65 and title 50, chapter 13.
B.   The provisions of this title shall be administered to ensure orderly
growth and development and shall supplement and implement provisions of the
Bonners Ferry Comprehensive Plan, this Code and the capital improvements plan.
By virtue of this title the City Council, Planning Commission and
administrative staff of Bonners Ferry are vested with the authority to review,
approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove applications for subdivision of
land. (Ord. 495, 12-20-2005)
12-1-4: FEES AND MITIGATION:
A.   The City Council may, by resolution, adopt reasonable fees related to the
cost of services associated with review, processing and inspection of
subdivision of land.
B.   The City may, as a condition of approval of a subdivision, require
mitigation of the effects of development on the ability of the City, and other
political subdivisions, to deliver services without compromising quality or
imposing substantial additional costs to current residents. (Ord. 495, 12-20-
2005)
12-1-5: ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES:
A.   No building permit will be issued for the construction or development of
any building or structure located on a lot or plat subdivided or sold in
violation of the provisions of these regulations or State Platting Statutes,
nor shall the City have any obligation to issue any certificates of occupancy
or to provide utility services to any parcel created or established in
violation of these provisions.
B.   Violations of the provisions of this title are subject to compliance or
remedy measures as outlined in section
12-1-8 of this chapter. The City shall have recourse to such civil remedies in
law and equity as may be necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of
these regulations. (Ord. 570, 9-19-2017)
12-1-6: INTERPRETATION AND CONFLICT:
A.   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this title
shall be held to be the minimum requirements. More stringent provisions may be
required if it is demonstrated that such standards are necessary to protect the
public health, safety and welfare.
B.   Where any provision of these regulations imposes restrictions different
from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision
of law, the provision which is more restrictive or imposes the standards most
likely to protect the public health, safety and general welfare shall control.
(Ord. 495, 12-20-2005)
12-1-7: CONDITION BASED EXCEPTIONS:
A.   Where strict compliance with these regulations and/or the purposes of
these regulations may be better served by an alternative proposal, the City
Council may approve condition based exceptions to these regulations. The
granting of an exception shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and
purpose of these regulations. The City Council will not permit exceptions to
conditions unless it finds, based upon the evidence presented to it in each
specific case, that:
   1.   The granting of the condition based exception shall not be detrimental
to the public safety, health or welfare or injurious to other property; and
   2.   The conditions upon which the condition based exception request is
based are unique to the lands for which the relief is sought and are not
applicable generally to other lands; and
   3.   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical
conditions of the specific lands involved, a particular and unnecessary
hardship to the owner or the public would result if these regulations are
strictly applied; and
   4.   The change sought shall not have the effect of increasing cost or
burdens on the City; and
   5.   The change sought shall not be contrary to the zoning ordinance or
Comprehensive Plan.
B.   In approving condition based exceptions, the City Council may require
conditions that will secure the purposes of this title. A condition based
exception is any alternative design, or deviation from subdivision ordinance
requirements that is requested by the developer. The exception requested must
be in writing and must be included in the notice to be given pursuant to
chapter 3 or 5 of this title and reviewed as an integral part of the overall
review process as outlined in this title and the recommendation and decision
made on the requested exception should be at the time the subdivision is
reviewed by the Planning Commission. (Ord. 495, 12-20-2005)
12-1-8: REMEDIES:
A.   The provisions of this section shall not apply to the following conveyance
of any lot or parcel of real property:
   1.   Exempt from the definition of "subdivision", as provided for in this
chapter;
   2.   Identified in a recorded final plat after the date of recording.
B.   This section shall not bar any legal, equitable or summary remedy to which
the City, other public agency or any person may otherwise be entitled. The City
or other public agency or any person may file suit to restrain or enjoin any
attempted or proposed subdivision for sale, lease, financing or gift of any lot
or parcel, or portion thereof, contrary to the provisions of this title. The
provisions of this section shall not limit or affect in any way the rights of a
grantee or successor in interest under any other provision of law.
C.   The City shall not issue a permit or grant any approval necessary to
develop or use any lot or parcel which has been divided, or which has resulted
from a division, contrary to the provisions of this title.
D.   For the purposes of the administration of this section, the following
shall be considered in compliance:
   1.   Any lot or parcel which is described on a recorded legal instrument of
conveyance prior to December 29, 2005;
   2.   Any lot or parcel for which a valid building permit has been issued by
the City, where on development has occurred and a use has been established in
reliance on that permit;
   3.   Any lot or parcel which is described on a recorded legal instrument of
conveyance prior to April 27, 2017, that does not meet lot size or lot
dimensional standards.
E.   Any division of land determined by the City to be in violation of this
title shall either seek remedy as outlined within this section or shall seek
compliance with the laws in affect at the time the division occurred.
Compliance with current subdivision laws shall be considered compliance with
the law. (Ord. 570, 9-19-2017)

13-1-2:    Findings Of Fact
13-1-3: Statement Of Purpose
13-1-4:    Objectives And Methods Of Reducing Flood Losses
13-1-1: STATUTORY AUTHORITY:
The Legislature of the State of Idaho, pursuant to Idaho Code sections 46-1020,
46-1023, and 46-1024, authorizes local governments to adopt floodplain
management ordinances that identify floodplains and minimum floodplain
development standards to minimize flood hazards and protect human life, health,
and property. (Ord. 605, 12-6-2022)
13-1-2: FINDINGS OF FACT:
A.   The flood hazard areas of the City of Bonners Ferry are subject to
periodic inundation that results in:
   1.   Loss of life and property;
   2.   Health and safety hazards;
   3.   Disruption of commerce and governmental services;
   4.   Extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection; and
   5.   Impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety, and general welfare.
B.   These flood losses may be caused by development in flood hazard areas,
which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from
flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains
causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
C.   Local government units have the primary responsibility for planning,
adopting, and enforcing land use regulations to accomplish proper floodplain
management. (Ord. 605, 12-6-2022)
13-1-3: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
The purpose of this title is to promote public health, safety, and general
welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in
specific areas by provisions designed to:
A.   Protect human life, health, and property;
B.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
purification and sewage treatment plants, water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in floodplains;
C.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas;
D.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
E.   Minimize the need for rescue and emergency services associated with
flooding, generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
F.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
G.   Ensure potential buyers are notified the property is in an area of special
flood hazard; and
H.   Ensure those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 605, 12-6-2022)
13-1-4: OBJECTIVES AND METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
In order to accomplish its purpose, this title includes methods and provisions
to:
A.   Require that development which is vulnerable to floods, including
structures and facilities necessary for the general health, safety, and welfare
of citizens, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
B.   Restrict or prohibit development which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights,
velocities, or erosion;
C.   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage or erosion;
D.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert flood waters or that may increase flood hazards to other
lands;
E.   Preserve and restore natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural
protective barriers which carry and store flood waters. (Ord. 605, 12-6-2022)

                            A determination by the Federal Insurance
                            Administrator of the water surface elevations of
                            the base flood, that is, the flood level that has a
                            one percent or greater chance of occurrence in any
                            given year. When the BFE has not been provided in a
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): Special Flood Hazard Area, it may be obtained from
                            engineering studies available from a Federal,
                            State, or other source using FEMA-approved
                            engineering methodologies. This elevation, when
                            combined with the Freeboard, establishes the Flood
                            Protection Elevation.

CRITICAL FACILITIES:        nursing home, school, vehicle and equipment storage
                            facility, or shelter; and facilities that, if
                            flooded, would make the flood problem and its
                            impacts much worse, such as a hazardous materials
                            facility, power generation facility, water utility,
                            or wastewater treatment plant.
                            The vertical datum is a base measurement point (or
                            set of points) from which all elevations are
                            determined. Historically, that common set of points
DATUM:                      was the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929
                            (NGVD29). The vertical datum currently adopted by
                            the federal government as a basis for measuring
                            heights is the North American Vertical Datum of

                             A general term used to refer to the several types
                             of revisions and amendments to FIRMs that can be
LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC): accomplished by letter. They include Letter of Map
                             Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision (LOMR),
                             and Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F).
                             An official amendment, by letter, to an effective
                             National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) map. A
                             LOMA establishes a property's or structure's
   LETTER OF MAP          location in relation to the Special Flood Hazard
   AMENDMENT              Area (SFHA). LOMAs are usually issued because a
   (LOMA):                property or structure has been inadvertently
                             mapped as being in the floodplain but is actually
                             on natural high ground above the base flood
                             elevation.
                             FEMA's modification to an effective Flood
                             Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or a Flood Boundary and
                             Floodway Map (FBFM) or both. LOMRs are generally
                             based on the implementation of physical measures
                             that affect the hydrologic or hydraulic
                             characteristics of a flooding source and thus
                             result in the modification of the existing
   LETTER OF MAP          regulatory floodway, the effective Base Flood
   REVISION (LOMR):       Elevations (BFEs), or the Special Flood Hazard
                             Area (SFHA). The LOMR officially revises the Flood
                             Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or Flood Boundary and
                             Floodway Map (FBFM), and sometimes the Flood
                             Insurance Study (FIS) report, and when
                             appropriate, includes a description of the
                             modifications. The LOMR is generally accompanied
                             by an annotated copy of the affected portions of
                             the FIRM; FBFM, or FIS report.
                             FEMA's modification of the Special Flood Hazard
   LETTER OF MAP          Area (SFHA) shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
   REVISION BASED         (FIRM) based on the placement of fill outside the
   ON FILL (LOMR-F):      existing regulatory floodway. The LOMR-F does not
                             change the FIRM, FBFM, or FIS report.

                 A formal review and comment as to whether a proposed flood protection
                 project or other project complies with the minimum NFIP requirements
   CONDITIONALfor such projects with respect to delineation of special flood hazard
   LETTER OF Mareas. A CLOMR does not revise the effective Flood Insurance Rate Map
   REVISION   (FIRM) or Flood Insurance Study (FIS). Upon submission and approval of
   (CLOMR):   certified as-built documentation, a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) may
                 be issued by FEMA to revise the effective FIRM. Building permits and/
                 or Flood Development Permits cannot be issued based on a CLOMR,
                 because a CLOMR does not change the NFIP map.
                 A man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
LEVEE:           constructed according to sound engineering practices, to contain,
                 control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from

                 unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of
                 vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement
LOWEST FLOOR:    area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such
                 enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of
                 the applicable non-elevation design requirements of 44 CFR § 60.3 and
                 this title.

                                       down a hillside usually as a result of a
                                       dual condition of loss of brush cover
                                       and the subsequent accumulation of water
                                       on the ground preceded by a period of
MUDSLIDE (I.E., MUDFLOW):              unusually heavy or sustained rain. A
                                       mudslide (i.e., mudflow) may occur as a
                                       distinct phenomenon while a landslide is
                                       in progress, and will be recognized as
                                       such by the Administrator only if the
                                       mudflow, and not the landslide, is the
                                       proximate cause of damage that occurs.
                                       The operation of an overall program of

13-5-4:    Standards For Riverine Floodplains With Base Flood Elevations But
Without Established Floodways
13-5-5:    Standards For Floodways
13-5-1: GENERAL STANDARDS:
In all Special Flood Hazard Areas, the following provisions are required:
A.   All new construction, substantial improvements, and development shall be
designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse,
and lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and
hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
B.   All new construction, substantial improvements, and development shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage in
accordance with the Technical Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant Materials
Requirements, and available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
C.   All new construction, substantial improvements, and development shall be
constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages.
D.   All new and replacement electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air
conditioning equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding to the Flood Protection Elevation.
These include, but are not limited to, HVAC equipment, water softener units,
bath/kitchen fixtures, ductwork, electric/gas meter panels/boxes, utility/cable
boxes, hot water heaters, and electric outlets/switches.
E.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
F.   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into flood waters.
G.   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
H.   A fully enclosed area, of new construction and substantially improved
structures, which is below the lowest floor used solely for parking, access,
and storage shall:
   1.   Be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials at least to the
Flood Protection Elevation; and
   2.   Include, in Zones A and AE flood openings to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must either be certified by
a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum
design criteria:
      a.   A minimum of two (2) flood openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
      b.   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one (1)

PREVENTION ORDINANCE:
This title, in part, comes forward by re-enactment of some of the provisions of
the Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance enacted August 13, 1974, as amended, and
it is not the intention to repeal but rather to re-enact and continue to

date of the community's initial Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance, and the
Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance #357 adopted August 6, 1985, as amended,
which are not reenacted herein are repealed. (Ord. 605, 12-6-2022)
13-6-2: EFFECT UPON OUTSTANDING FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT PERMITS:
Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the plans, construction,
size, or designated use of any development or any part thereof for which a
Floodplain Development Permit has been granted by the Floodplain Administrator
or his or her authorized agents before the time of passage of this ordinance.
Provided, however, that when construction is not begun under such outstanding
permit within a period of one hundred eighty (180) days subsequent to the date
of issuance of the outstanding permit, construction or use shall be in
conformity with the provisions of this ordinance. (Ord. 605, 12-6-2022)
