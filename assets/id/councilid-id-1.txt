approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces, and conical
surfaces as they apply to the Council airport. Such zones are shown on the
Council airport zoning map consisting of one sheet, prepared by the airport
commission, which is attached to the ordinance codified herein and made a part
hereof. An area located in more than one of the following zones is considered
to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various
zones are hereby established and defined as follows:
   A.   Utility Runway Visual Approach Zone: The inner edge of the utility
runway visual approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and
is two hundred fifty feet (250'). The approach zone expands outward uniformly
to a width of one thousand two hundred fifty feet (1,250') at a horizontal
distance of five thousand feet (5,000') from the primary surface. Its
centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.

created by this chapter to a height in excess of the applicable height limit
herein established for such zone. Such applicable height limitations are hereby
established for each of the zones in question as follows:
   A.   Utility runway visual approach zone: Slopes twenty feet (20') outward
for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the
primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of five thousand feet
(5,000') along the extended runway centerline.
   B.   Transitional zones: Slope seven feet (7') outward for each foot upward
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and
the approach surface, and extending to a height of one hundred fifty feet
(150') above the airport elevation which is two thousand nine hundred sixty
eight feet (2,968') above mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing, there
are established height limits sloping seven feet (7') outward for each foot
upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach
surface, and extending to where they interest the conical surface.

   B.   Existing Uses: No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use,
structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on
the effective date hereof or any amendments hereto or than it is when the
application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for
such a permit shall be granted.
   C.   Nonconforming Uses Abandoned Or Destroyed: Whenever the City Council
determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more
than eighty percent (80%) torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no
permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the
applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from these regulations.
   D.   Variances: Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any
structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property not in accordance
with the regulations prescribed in this chapter may apply to the City Council
for a variance from such regulations. The application for variance shall be
accompanied by a determination from the federal aviation administration as to
the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and
the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed
where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of these
regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief granted, will not be
contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation,
will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this
chapter. A completed application for a variance will be forwarded to the
Airport Commission for review and a recommendation before it is heard by the
City Council.
   E.   Obstruction Marking And Lighting: Any permit or variance granted may,
if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this chapter
and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the
owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate, and maintain,
at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed
proper by the airport commission, this condition may be modified to require the
owner to permit the city council, at its own expense, to install, operate, and
maintain the necessary markings and lights. (Ord. 355B, 6-8-1999; amd. Ord.

city council to be retained by the city. Upon termination of service or twelve
(12) months after such deposit is paid and if the applicant has not, during
such period, ever been delinquent in the monthly payments due under this
section, such deposit shall be refunded to the applicant. Upon any default in
payment of water service charges, such deposit may be applied to the
applicant's account. Any default in payment of more than two (2) months will
cause the service to be disconnected with a charge as established by resolution
of the city council for reconnection of service.
   B.   User Rates:
      1.   Established: A minimum charge as established by resolution of the
city council per calendar month shall be made for each noncommercial, single
occupancy metered user, which base charge shall be in payment of the first one
thousand (1,000) cubic feet of water consumed and no less rate than such
minimum charge shall be fixed or charged; provided further, that the base
charge shall be separated into categories of use called classes with the base
category (class) being the equivalent user. Each of the classes will then be

(Ord. 129, 7-17-1951; amd. Ord. 271, 4-13-1990, eff. 4-13-1990)
Whenever the city council, in any regular or special session assembled, shall
determine that further control, limitation, regulation or prohibition of the
use of city water for any purpose other than domestic use is required in order
to provide an adequate supply of water for domestic use, or for conservation of
health, or for the safety of the inhabitants and property from the hazards of
fire, it may, by order or resolution, spread upon its minutes to:

rotation of use, in equitable manner, at and for such period of time and in
such manner as may be determined necessary; or
      2.   Provide for the use of city water for sprinkling and/or irrigation
only during fixed hours or periods of time; or
      3.   Further restrict, or absolutely prohibit, the use of city water for
sprinkling and/or irrigation for such period or periods time as may be required
to restore an adequate reserve of water; or
      4.   Limit, regulate, or prohibit the use of any city water for any
commercial or other use not required by public health and safety;
and on the adoption of any such order or resolution, shall give one day's
notice thereof, either by publication in the official newspaper of the city, or
by notice mailed to each water user within the city, or by personal notice to
be given by the public works supervisor, or other city employee, to each water
user within the city, and from and after such notice, any violation of the
provisions of such order or resolution shall constitute a misdemeanor,
punishable as provided in section
1-4-1 of the city code. If any fire, breakage of mains or failure of water
supply shall create any sudden emergency endangering persons, health or
property, the city council or public works supervisor may declare such
emergency condition and may forthwith make effective any regulation concerning
the use of city water as may be deemed necessary, and after notice thereof
shall be given by any of the means before provided, a violation of the terms of

dollars ($25.00) for the second offense and forty dollars ($40.00) for each
subsequent offense. (Ord. 271, 4-13-1990, eff. 4-13-1990; amd. 2015 Code)
8-2-4: IRRIGATION SYSTEMS; CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL:
   A.   Every lot, parcel or piece of land upon which a residential unit will
be constructed shall construct, install, or connect to a pressurized irrigation
system. In the case of residential subdivision developments, a pressurized
irrigation system shall be constructed and installed simultaneously with the
domestic water lines, but not in the same trenches. There shall be no cross
connections between the domestic water lines and the irrigation lines.
   B.   All buildings, lots, or parcels of land within a subdivision which are
connected to a common landscape sprinkler irrigation system may be permitted to
utilize a single connection to the city's domestic water system. Any system
which is allowed a single connection shall have a backflow prevention device
which is approved by the city. This single or joint use connection shall be
limited to providing irrigation water during the time the common landscape
irrigation system has no water supply. However, a joint use connection shall
not be allowed for any subdivision, building, lot or parcel which is supplied
with irrigation water from a groundwater well. If irrigation water is available
from another source, city water will not be used for irrigation purposes. The
off-on control valve of this joint use connection shall be under the control of
the city public works supervisor.
   C.   Backflow prevention devices shall be installed at any location on the
premises or in the system where, in the judgment of the city public works
supervisor, the nature and extent of the activities, or the materials stored on
the premises, would present an immediate and dangerous hazard to health and/or
be deleterious to the quality of the water should a cross connection occur.
Even though a cross connection may not exist at any particular time, backflow
prevention devices shall be installed under the following circumstances. This
list is meant to be illustrative and not exhaustive:
      1.   Backflow prevention devices shall be installed on premises having an
auxiliary water supply.
      2.   Backflow prevention devices shall be installed on premises having
internal cross connections that are not correctable, or intricate plumbing
arrangements which make it impractical to ascertain whether or not cross
connections exist.
      3.   Backflow prevention devices shall be installed on premises where
entry is restricted so that inspections for cross connections cannot be made
with sufficient frequency or at sufficiently short notice to assure that cross
connections do not exist.
      4.   Backflow prevention devices shall be installed on premises having a
repeated history of cross connections being established or reestablished.
      5.   Backflow prevention devices shall be installed on premises on which
any substance is handled under pressure so as to permit entry into the public
water supply, or where a cross connection could reasonably be expected to
occur. This shall include the handling of process waters and cooling waters.
      6.   Backflow prevention devices required by this section shall be
installed at the meter, at the property line of the premises when meters are
not used, or at a location approved by the city public works supervisor. The
device shall be located where it is readily accessible for maintenance and
testing and where no part of the device will be submerged.
      7.   Backflow prevention devices required by this section shall be
installed under the supervision of and with the approval of the city public
works supervisor.
      8.   Any protective device required by this section shall be of a model
approved by the city public works supervisor. A device shall include a double
check valve assembly or a reduced pressure valve. A principal backflow
prevention device will be approved if it has successfully passed performance
tests of the state of Idaho or other testing laboratories satisfactory to the
state of Idaho and the city public works supervisor. These devices shall be
furnished and installed by and at the expense of the customer.
      9.   Backflow prevention devices installed pursuant to this section shall
be inspected and tested annually, or more often if necessary. Inspections,
tests and maintenance shall be at the customer's expense. Whenever the devices
are found to be defective, they shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced at
the customer's expense. Inspections, tests, repairs, and records thereof shall
be accomplished under the city's supervision by certified testers.
      10.   No underground sprinkling device shall be installed without
adequate backflow prevention devices at the point from which the water for
irrigation is taken from the public water supply.
      11.   Failure of the customer to cooperate in the installation,
maintenance, testing or inspection of backflow prevention devices required by
this section shall be grounds for terminating water service to the premises or,
in the alternative, the installation of an air gap separation at the customer's
expense.
   D.   Any violation of this section shall be a misdemeanor punishable in
accordance with the misdemeanor statutes of the state of Idaho. (Ord. 424, 4-
10-2007)
8-2-5: PROHIBITED ACTS:
   A.   It shall be unlawful for any person other than the public works
supervisor to tap or make any connections with any water main or distribution
line of the city water system.
   B.   Except as authorized by the public works supervisor or city council, it
shall be unlawful for any person to molest, tamper with, obstruct, injure or
change any part of the city water system, including the springs, well, pump,
reservoir, mains, laterals, lines, meters or other parts thereof.
   C.   It shall be unlawful for any person to obstruct the flow of water in
the system, or to take, steal, conduct or carry away any of the waters thereof,
except as by this chapter expressly authorized. (Ord. 129, 7-17-1951)
8-2-6: VIOLATION; PENALTY:
Violation of any provision of this chapter or any provision of any order or
resolution shall be deemed a misdemeanor which shall subject the violator
thereof to the penalties provided in section
1-4-1 of this code. (Ord. 204, 2-10-1976; amd. 2015 Code)

The purpose of this section is to establish standards and regulations governing
the location and approval of manufactured housing in the City. It is the intent
of these regulations to allow a mix of housing types and living styles.
However, this should occur in a manner which will not adversely affect existing
neighborhoods. For this reason, standards have been set that will regulate the
appearance of the manufactured home, allowing only those that are acceptably
similar in appearance to site-built dwellings on individual lots in the
residence district. Any such manufactured home and the lot on which it is
placed to is subject to the same development standards to which any single-
family residential dwelling on the same lot would be subject, including, but
not limited to, building setback standards, side and rear yard requirements,
standards for enclosures, access, and vehicle parking and architectural and
aesthetic requirements. (Ord. 533, 6-17-2024)

                                      section of a factory-built house to which
                                      wheels may be attached for the purpose of
                                      moving it to a permanent location where
                                      it becomes affixed to the real property.

general welfare of its citizenry. (Ord. 335, 1-23-1997)
9-7-2: FINDINGS OF FACT:
   A.   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditure for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   B.   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities
and, when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are
inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. 335, 1-23-1997)
9-7-3: PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
   A.   To protect human life and health;
   B.   To minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control
projects;
   C.   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   D.   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   E.   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   F.   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   G.   To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an
area of special flood hazard; and
   H.   To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 335, 1-23-1997)
9-7-4: METHODS OF ACCOMPLISHING PURPOSE:
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   A.   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   B.   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   C.   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
   D.   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   E.   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or may increase flood hazards in other areas.

chapter or a request for a variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO or AH zone on the flood insurance
rate map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet (3'); a
clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable
and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. AO is characterized as
sheet flow, and AH indicates ponding.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: The land in the floodplain within the city
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
Designation on maps always includes the letters A or V.

exceeded in any given year; also referred to as the "100-year flood".
Designation on maps always includes the letters A or V.
BASEMENT: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
BREAKAWAY WALL: A wall that is not part of the structural support of the
building and is intended, through its design and construction, to collapse
under specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated
portion of the building or supporting foundation system.
CRITICAL FACILITY: A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding might
be too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to, schools;
nursing homes; hospitals; police, fire and emergency response installations;
and installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or hazardous
waste.

including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations located within the
area of special flood hazard.
ELEVATED BUILDING: For insurance purposes, a nonbasement building which has its
lowest elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear
walls, posts, piers, pilings, or columns.
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
hereof.
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The preparation
of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of
utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the
pouring of concrete pads).
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): The official map on which the federal
insurance administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard
and the risk premium zones applicable to the city.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY: The official report provided by the federal insurance
administration that includes flood profiles, the flood boundary-floodway map,
and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
   A.   The overflow of inland waters; and/or
   B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any

damage occurred.
   B.   For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is
considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the structure.
   C.   The term does not, however, include either:
      1.   Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      2.   Any alteration of a structure listed on the national register of
historic places or the state inventory of historic places.
VARIANCE: A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits
construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.
WATER DEPENDENT: A structure for commerce or industry which cannot exist in any
other location and is dependent on the water by reason of the intrinsic nature

diminished.
   E.   Interpretation Of FIRM Boundaries: Make interpretations where needed as
to exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for
example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and
actual field conditions). The persons contesting the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in section
9-7-11 of this chapter. (Ord. 335, 1-23-1997)
9-7-8: BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD:

      5.   Review Of Building Permits: Where elevation data is not available
either through the flood insurance study or from another authoritative source
(subsection
   B.   Specific Standards: In all areas of special flood hazard where base
flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in subsection
      1.   Residential Construction:
         a.   New construction and substantial improvement of any residential
structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot
(1') above the base flood elevation.
         b.   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to
flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must be either certified
by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:
            (1)   A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
            (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
(1') above grade.
            (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit
of floodwaters.
      2.   Nonresidential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot (1')
above the base flood elevation or, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, shall:
         a.   Be floodproofed so that below one foot (1') above the base flood
level, the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water.
         b.   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
         c.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect

standards of practice for meeting provisions of this subsection B2 based on
their development and/or review of the structural design, specifications and
plans. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in
subsection
         d.   Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed,
must meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in
subsection B1b of this section.
         e.   Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be
notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot
(1') below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building floodproofed to the base
flood level will be rated as 1 foot below).
      3.   Manufactured Homes:
         a.   All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved
within zones A1-A30, AH, and AE on the city's FIRM on sites:
            (1)   Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision;
            (2)   In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;
            (3)   In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision; or
            (4)   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which
a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood;
shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is elevated one foot (1') above the base flood elevation and
be securely anchored to an adequately designed foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
         b.   Manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on
sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones A1-30,
AH, and AE on the city's FIRM that are not subject to the above manufactured
home provisions shall be elevated so that either:

elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes.
   C.   Floodways: Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
section
9-7-8 of this chapter are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is
an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry
debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions
apply:
      1.   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development unless certification by a
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments
shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the
base flood discharge.
      2.   If subsection C1 of this section is satisfied, all new construction
and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this section.
   D.   Encroachments: The cumulative effect of any proposed development, where
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not
increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot (1')
at any point.
   E.   Critical Facilities: Construction of new critical facilities shall be,
to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the special flood hazard
areas (SFHA) (100-year floodplain). Construction of new critical facilities
shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is
available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated three feet (3') or more above the level of the base flood
elevation (100-year) at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be
taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into
floodwaters. Ingress and egress routes elevated to or above the base flood
elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.
(Ord. 335, 1-23-1997)
9-7-11: VARIANCES:
   A.   General Provisions:
      1.   The planning and zoning commission, as established by the city
council, shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the
requirements of this chapter.
      2.   The planning and zoning commission shall hear and decide appeals
when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the building inspector in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
      3.   In passing upon such applications, the planning and zoning
commission shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors,
standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and: (Ord. 335, 1-23-
1997; amd. 2015 Code)
         a.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         b.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         c.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         d.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the city;
         e.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         f.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         g.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         h.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
         i.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         j.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effect of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         k.   The cost of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   B.   Certain Variances Permitted; Conditions:
      1.   Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the
elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one- half (1/2) acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, provided subsections A3a through A3k of this section have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
      2.   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or
restoration of structures listed on the national register of historic places or
the state inventory of historic places without regard to the procedures set
forth in this section.
      3.   Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      4.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      5.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         a.   Showing of good and sufficient cause.
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant. (Ord. 335, 1-23-1997)
         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. (Ord. 335, 1-23-
1997; amd. 2015 Code)
      6.   Variances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are
based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece
of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the
structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances. They primarily
address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such,
variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare.
      7.   Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited
circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry
floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage
potential, complies with all other variance criteria except subsection B1 of
this section, and otherwise complies with subsection
      8.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation. (Ord. 335, 1-23-1997)
9-7-12: VIOLATIONS; PENALTIES:
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations. Violations of the provisions of this chapter
by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of
conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall
constitute an infraction punishable by a fine as provided in section
1-4-1 of this code. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city council
from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation. (Ord. 335, 1-23-1997; amd. 2015 Code)
9-7-13: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee
thereof, or the federal insurance administration for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made hereunder. (Ord. 335, 1-23-1997)

person designated by the zoning administrator, shall serve a notice of
violation upon the owner, tenant or other person responsible for the condition.
The notice of violation shall state separately each standard or requirement
violated; shall state what corrective action, if any, is necessary to comply
with the standards or requirements; and shall set a reasonable time for
compliance. The notice shall state that any further violation may result in

      1.   The zoning administrator may grant a reasonable extension of time
for compliance with any notice or order, whether pending or final, upon finding
that substantial progress toward compliance has been made and that the public
will not be adversely affected by the extension. Such extension of time shall
not exceed one hundred eighty (180) days.

it is shown that any of the following are true:
         a.   The conditions at the time the extension was granted have
changed;
         b.   The zoning administrator determines that a party is not
performing corrective actions as agreed; or
         c.   If the extension creates an adverse effect on the public.
      3.   The date of revocation shall then be considered as the compliance

   F.   Revocation Of Permits:
      1.   Zoning, General: The procedure for revocation of permits for other
than commercial and industrial development is as follows:
         a.   In the event of any violation of any condition, term or
prerequisite which has been set as a requirement, basis or condition precedent
for the issuance, continuance or land use of a conditional use permit, a
hardship permit or any other permit which is subject to revocation, any person
may bring that violation to the attention of the zoning administrator. The
information presented to the zoning administrator may be informal in nature,
but it shall be in written form. After receipt of the information, the zoning
administrator shall commence a cursory investigation to determine if the
factual allegations made in support of the asserted violation are true, and if
the allegations are true, if the conduct complained of constitutes a violation
of the terms of the permitted use.
         b.   In the event the zoning administrator determines that the
allegations are not true or, that even if true, the facts do not constitute a
violation of the permitted use, the zoning administrator may dismiss the
allegations and notify the complaining party. The complaining party shall have
fifteen (15) days to file a notice of appeal with the City Council. In the
event the administrator determines that the allegations are true and constitute
a violation of the permitted use, the zoning administrator shall send notice of
the violation to the permit holder. The notice shall inform the permit holder
of the terms and conditions of the permit, the substance of the allegations
which constitute the violation and inform the holder that the matter shall be
placed on the agenda before the city council. At the time the matter is
scheduled before the city council, the permit holder shall appear and shall
either admit or deny the substance of the allegations. In the event the
allegations are denied, the city council may set a hearing on the matter. At
the public hearing, the city council shall hear evidence presented to support
the allegations that the holder has violated the terms of the permit and shall
hear evidence which rebuts the allegations. After the public hearing has been
conducted, the city council shall make a determination whether or not the facts
giving rise to the allegations of a violation of the permit are true, and if
true, whether the conduct complained of constitutes a violation of the permit.
In the event the city council makes a finding that there is no substance to the
allegations or that the permit holder’s conduct does not constitute a violation
of the terms of the permit, the matter shall be dismissed. In the event the
city council makes a finding that there has been a violation of the terms of
the permit, or in the event the holder admits to a violation thereof, the city
council shall take one of the following courses of action:
            (1)   The city council may revoke the permit.
            (2)   The city council may extend the permit for a set period on a
probationary status, subject to such terms and conditions as the city council
may deem appropriate, with the prerequisite that if there is a violation of the
conditions underlying the permit while it is in probationary status, the permit
may be revoked upon a showing by affidavit of any violation without the
necessity of further hearing.
            (3)   It may modify the terms and conditions of the permit and
allow it to continue subject to the new terms.
            (4)   It may allow the conditional use to continue under the same
terms and conditions.
         c.   All notices required by this section may be sent by regular U.S.
mail, postage prepaid. In the event a permit holder fails to appear at any

pool unless accompanied by a responsible older person. Owners of swimming pools
must accept responsibility for any liability incurred due to the presence of
such pools.
   G.   A portable canopy is considered an accessory structure and requires a
siting permit, pursuant to this section. Portable canopies are only allowed in
the rear yard of residential properties. They are not allowed in the front or

established grade is constructed to shield the canopy from neighboring
properties and public streets. Portable automobile canopies may encroach into
the front setback area of the property provided they do not obstruct traffic
line of sight or encroach into the sidewalk.

The owner of a portable automobile canopy or the owner of real property on
which any portable automobile canopy is located shall maintain such portable
automobile canopy in a state of good appearance, safety, and repair, including,

constructs an accessory building without first obtaining a siting permit as
required by this subsection shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, subject to
penalty as provided in section
1-4-1  of this Code. (Ord. 536, 6-10-2025)
10-4-9: TREATMENT OF LOT LINE ADJUSTMENTS:

lot will be created, or
      3.   Where the reorientation of existing lots does not increase the
number of buildable lots.
      4.   The procedure may not be used where it creates or expands
nonconformity with land use ordinances.
   C.   Application: The application for a lot line adjustment shall consist of
the following:
      1.   Applicant Name, Owner Name, Purchaser Name, Representative Name,
Applicant Name and Phone Numbers, Email Addresses, Mailing Addresses for all

shall provide adequate utility easements before a lot line adjustment will be
granted. (Ord. 536, 6-10-2025)
CHAPTER 5
CONDITIONAL USES, VARIANCES, REZONING, AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS
SECTION:
10-5-1: Conditional Uses
10-5-2:    Variances
10-5-3:    Rezoning; Zoning Map Amendments
10-5-4:    Development Agreements And Conditional Rezoning
10-5-1: CONDITIONAL USES:
The term “conditional use”, as used in this chapter, means a use within a
district, identified by the letter “C” in the Land Use Table in Section
10-4-5  of this Code, and allowed only after public hearing and after issuance
of a permit approved by the city council after following the procedures set
forth in this Section.
   A.   General Provisions:
      1.   It is recognized that an increasing number of new kinds of uses
frequently appear, and that many of these and some other more conventional uses
possess characteristics of such unique and special nature relative to location,
design, size, method of operation, circulation and public facilities that each
specific use must be considered individually. The zoning administrator will
consult with the City Attorney and the City Engineer to interpret existing
definitions regarding proposals to determine whether an amendment to the Land
Use table or definition section would be required to consider the proposed use,
or if the proposed use is sufficiently similar to listed uses or definitions to
proceed without amendment.
   B.   Application For Permit: An application for a conditional use permit
shall be filed with the zoning administrator. At a minimum, the application
shall contain the following information:
      1.   Name, address and phone number of the applicant;
      2.   Legal description of the property;
      3.   Description of the existing use;
      4.   Zone classification;
      5.   Description of the proposed conditional use;
      6.   Names and addresses of adjoining property owners within three
hundred feet (300') of the land being considered;
      7.   A plan of the proposed site for the conditional use showing the
location of all the building, parking and loading areas, traffic access,
traffic circulation, open spaces, landscaping, refuse and service areas,
utilities, signs, yards and other such information as the commission may
require to determine if the proposed conditional use meets the intent and
requirements of this chapter;
      8.   A description of surrounding uses and a narrative statement
evaluating the effects on adjoining property of such elements as noise, glare,
odor, fumes and vibration; a discussion of the general compatibility with
adjacent and other properties in the zone; and the relationship of the proposed
use to the comprehensive plan; and
      9.   A filing fee shall accompany the application. (See section
10-5-1 -C of this chapter.)
   C.   Permit Fees: A fee as established by resolution of the city council and
as provided by Section
2-2-1  of the Council City Code shall accompany an application for a permit,
which fee will not be refunded if the application is denied.
   D.   General Standards Applicable To All Conditional Uses: The city council
shall review the particular facts and circumstances of each proposed
conditional use in terms of the following standards and shall find adequate
evidence showing that such use at the proposed location:
      1.   Will not be in conflict with the general objectives or with any
specific objectives of the comprehensive plan or this title;
      2.   Will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained to be
harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity and that such use will not change the
essential character of the same areas;
      3.   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or neighboring uses;
      4.   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and

designed as not to create any interference with traffic on surrounding public
thoroughfares; and
      9.   Will not result in the destruction, loss or damage of a natural,
scenic or historic feature of major importance.
   E.   Public Sites And Open Spaces: Public sites and open spaces shall
conform to the following:
      1.   Public Uses: Where it is determined that a proposed park,
playground, school or other public use is located in whole or in part within a
proposed development, the city council shall notify the appropriate public
agency concerning the land proposed to be acquired. Within thirty (30) days of
the date of notice, the public agency may request the governing body to suspend
consideration on the permit for sixty (60) days from the date of the request;
however, if an agreement is not reached within sixty (60) days, the city
council shall resume consideration of the conditional use application.
      2.   Natural Features: Existing natural features which add value to
residential development and enhance the attractiveness of the community such as
trees, watercourses, historic spots and similar irreplaceable assets shall be
preserved in the design of the development.
   F.   Supplementary Conditions And Safeguards: In granting any conditional
use, the city council may prescribe appropriate conditions, bonds and
safeguards which are in conformity with this chapter. Violation of such
conditions, bonds or safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the
conditional use is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter.
   G.   Hearing And Notice Requirements: Prior to granting a special use
permit, the City Council shall hold at least one public hearing in which
interested persons shall have an opportunity to be heard. At least fifteen (15)
days prior to the hearing, notice of the time and place, and a summary of the
proposal shall be published in the official newspaper of the city. Notice shall
be posted on the premises not less than one week prior to the hearing.
Notwithstanding jurisdictional boundaries, notice shall also be provided to
property owners or purchasers of record within the land being considered, three
hundred feet (300') of the external boundaries of the land being considered,
and any additional area that may be substantially impacted by the proposed
special use as determined by the commission; provided, that in all cases,
notice shall be provided individually by mail to property owners or purchasers
of record within the land being considered and within three hundred feet (300')
of the external boundaries of the land being considered; and provided further,
that where a special use permit is requested by reason of height allowance,

height of the allowed height of a structure when more than one hundred feet
(100') and within no less than one mile when the peak height of a structure in
an unincorporated area is four hundred feet (400') or more, and when four
hundred feet (400') or more, the structure’s proposed location and height shall
be stated in the notice. Any property owner entitled to specific notice
pursuant to the provisions of this section shall have a right to participate in
public hearings before the planning and zoning commission. Denial of a special
use permit or approval of a special use permit with conditions unacceptable to
the landowner may be subject to the regulatory taking analysis provided for by
Idaho Code section 67-8003, consistent with requirements established thereby.
   H.   Procedure For Approval Or Denial Of Permit:
      1.   After holding its public hearing, the city council may approve,
conditionally approve or deny a conditional use permit under the conditions as
herein specified and considering such additional safeguards as will make the
use consistent with the objectives of this title and not in conflict with the
comprehensive plan. If the application is approved or approved subject to
conditions, the council shall direct the city clerk-treasurer to issue a
conditional use permit listing the specific conditions specified by the council
as prerequisites for approval.
      2.   Conditions Of Permit: Upon the granting of a conditional use permit,
conditions may be attached to the permit including, but not limited to, the
following:
         a.   Minimizing adverse impact on other developments;
         b.   Controlling the sequence and timing of the development;
         c.   Controlling the duration of the development;
         d.   Assuring that the development is maintained properly;
         e.   Designating the exact location and nature of the development;
         f.   Requiring the provision for on site or off site public facilities
or services;
         g.   Requiring more restrictive standards than those generally
required in this chapter; and
         h.   Minimizing the impact on schools, irrigation districts or water
delivery systems.
      3.   Additional Information: Prior to making a recommendation or granting
a conditional use permit, the city council may require additional information
concerning social, economic, fiscal and environmental effects of the proposed
conditional use.
      4.   Statement Of Standards: Upon granting or denying an application, the
council shall specify:
         a.   The provisions and standards used in evaluating the application;
         b.   The reasons for approval or denial; and
         c.   The actions, if any, the applicant could take to obtain a permit.
      4.   Takings: Denial of a special use permit or approval of a special use
permit with conditions unacceptable to the landowner may be subject to the
regulatory taking analysis provided for by Idaho Code section 67-8003
consistent with requirements established thereby.
   I.   Notice To Applicant; Right to Appeal: Within thirty (30) days after a
decision by the city council has been rendered, the zoning administrator shall
provide the applicant with written notice of the action on the request. The
applicant or any adversely affected person who appears in person or in writing
before the city council may appeal the decision of the city council.
   J.   Automatic Termination For Nonuse: In the event the use which is
permitted pursuant to a conditional use permit as granted by the city council
is not commenced within one year from the date of issuance, the conditional use
permit shall terminate automatically, as a stated condition of approval on the
face of the permit, and shall become null and void and without any force or
effect one year from the date of issuance. In addition, in the event that the
use which is permitted pursuant to the conditional use permit is abandoned for
a period of one year, the provisions of Idaho Code 67-6538(2) shall apply.
   K.   Violation; Penalties: Any person who violates any term of a conditional
use permit shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and may be punishable in accordance
with the general misdemeanor statutes of the state of Idaho. In addition, any
work done in violation of a conditional use permit shall be subject to
abatement. (Ord. 536, 6-10-2025)
10-5-2: VARIANCES:
The City Council may authorize in specific cases such variance from the terms
of this title as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to
special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this title would
result in unnecessary hardship. No nonconforming use of neighboring lands,
structures or buildings in the same zone and not permitted or nonconforming use
of lands, structures or buildings in other zones shall be considered grounds
for issuance of a variance. A variance shall not be considered a right or
special privilege, but may be granted to an applicant only upon showing of
undue hardship.
   A.   Application And Standards For Variances:
      1.   Information Required: A variance from the terms of this title shall
not be granted by the City Council unless and until a written application for a
variance is submitted to the Zoning Administrator, which application contains
the following information:
         a.   Name, address and phone number of applicant.
         b.   Legal description of property.
         c.   A filing fee as set forth by resolution of the City Council.
         d.   A narrative statement demonstrating that the requested variance
conforms to the following standards:
            (1)   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land, structure or building involved and which are not
applicable to other lands, structures or buildings in the zone;
            (2)   That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this title
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same zone under the terms of this title;
            (3)   That special conditions and circumstances do not result from
the actions of the applicant; and
            (4)   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this title to other lands,
structures or buildings in the same zone. A variance attaches to the realty and
is transferable with the title to the property.
      2.   Findings Required: A variance shall not be granted unless the City
Council makes specific findings of fact based directly on the particular
evidence presented to it which support conclusions that the above mentioned
standards and conditions have been met by the applicant.
   B.   Supplementary Conditions And Safeguards: Under no circumstances shall
the City Council grant a variance to allow a use not permissible under the
terms of this title in the zone involved, or any use expressly or by
implication prohibited by the terms of this title in said zone. In granting any
variance, the City Council may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards
and, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, any
deviation shall be deemed a violation of this title.
   C.   Public Hearing: Upon receipt of the application for a variance, the
City Council shall publish notice in the official newspaper of the City, and
give written notice to all parties as required by this title, and hold a public
hearing.
   D.   Decision; Appeal:
      1.   After the public hearing, the City Council shall either approve,
conditionally approve or disapprove the request for a variance.
      2.   Upon granting or denying an application, the City Council shall
specify:
         a.   The ordinance and standards used in evaluating the application;
         b.   The reasons for approval or denial; and
         c.   The actions, if any, that the applicant could take to obtain a
permit
      3.   Within thirty (30) days after a decision has been rendered, the
Zoning Administrator shall provide the applicant with written notice of the
action on the request. The applicant or any affected person may appeal the
decision of the City Council, in accordance with section
10-2-8  of this title. (Ord. 536, 6-10-2025)
10-5-3: REZONING; ZONING MAP AMENDMENTS:
The purpose of this chapter is to set forth the procedure for securing a zone
change.
   A.    Zone Changes: Any change, modification or reclassification of zones
may be initiated by the city council or by application of one or more property
owners, purchasers, or holders of valid options to purchase property. When the
application for change, modification, or reclassification is initiated by a
property owner, purchaser, or holders of valid options to purchase property,
the procedure set forth herein shall be followed, except that the City Council
may, subject to the provisions for notice and publication of hearing, enlarge,
expand and amplify a petition for change in reclassification of a zone or
planned use classification.
   B.   Application Required: Every person seeking a reclassification of any
land regulated by this title shall file with the zoning administrator an
application therefor, upon a form prescribed by the planning and zoning
commission, accompanied by a filing fee as specified by the schedule of fees.
All applications for rezone shall conform to the requirements of Idaho Code
section 67-6511, as it may be amended, modified, altered or changed.
   C.   Content: Every application shall contain or be accompanied by all
information, plans and maps to scale and other data necessary to assure full
presentation of pertinent facts for the records and to assist in making a
determination in harmony with the objectives of this title. No application
shall be accepted by the zoning administrator unless it is complete and in
compliance with all such requirements and contains a designation of the
proposed zone classification.
   D.   Notice And Publication of Hearing: Notice of time, place and purpose of
each public hearing held by the City Council shall be given by publication in
the official newspaper of the city at least fifteen (15) days prior to such
hearing. When the public hearing is before the planning and zoning commission
on a proposed change, modification or reclassification, notice shall be given
by the zoning administrator to the last known owners of each parcel of land
within three hundred feet (300') to the exterior boundary, by regular U.S.
mail. In any hearing before the planning and zoning commission or the city
council, where notice must be given to more than two hundred (200) persons,
notice by publication, published at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
hearing, setting out the time and place and a summary of the action requested
to be taken, shall be published in the official newspaper or a paper of general
circulation within the jurisdiction. Notice shall also be posted on the
premises not less than one week prior to the hearing. In the event the planning
and zoning commission originates, enlarges, extends and amplifies the
application for the change, modification or reclassification of property, zone
or land use classification, the zoning administrator shall be required to
ascertain the names and addresses of the last known owners as the same appear
on the records of the county assessor’s office of each parcel of land within
three hundred feet (300') to the exterior boundaries of the land area sought to
be enlarged, extended or amplified. The notice shall give the date, time and
place of hearing, the name of the applicant and relief sought, and
identification of the property, and such other facts as may be prescribed by
the planning and zoning commission. In any public hearing, the presiding
officer may order the hearing to be continued by publicly announcing the time
and place of continuance, and no further notice thereof shall be required.
   E.   Standards Applicable To Zone Changes: The city council shall review the
particular facts and circumstances of each proposed zone change and take the
following factors into consideration:
      1.   The compatibility of the proposed zone with surrounding uses and
zones.
      2.   Availability of power, water, sewer, fire protection, police
protection and school facilities.
      3.   Access to highways.
      4.   Burdens imposed upon taxing entities for services which will have to
be provided.
      5.   Location in relation to floodplain and airport approaches.
      6.   Easements, encumbrances, adverse interests.
      7.   The opinions of surrounding landowners entitled to notice.
      8.   Availability of drainage structures and refuse disposal.
      9.   Opinions of other local or state agencies required to provide
services or issue permits.
      10.   Zone change will not set a precedence for future uses incompatible
with existing uses.
      11.   Compatibility or conflict with the comprehensive plan.
      12.   Any other factors relevant to the suitability of rezoning the
property.
   F.   Action By City Council: The city council shall hold a public hearing in
accordance with this chapter. At every hearing before the City Council, the
Council shall hear all persons interested in the subject matter. Not later than
sixty (60) working days after the conclusion of the hearing, city council shall
act upon the application by either approving, disapproving, or approving as a
conditional rezone with a development agreement as provided in Section
10-5-4  of this Title.
   G.   Ordinance Required: In the event the city council shall have approved
or modified the application, the city council shall cause to be prepared the
appropriate ordinance of amendment.
   H.   Resubmittal: No application for the change or reclassification of any
property, zone or land use classification, which has been denied by the city
council, shall be resubmitted in either the same or substantially the same
form, with reference to substantially the same premises or the same purpose,
within one year from the date of final action thereon. Any party adversely
affected by any action of the planning and zoning commission or city council
may appeal pursuant to the appellant procedures contained in section
10-2-8  of this title. (Ord. 536, 6-10-2025)
10-5-4: DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS AND CONDITIONAL REZONING:
The purpose of a development agreement is to provide a vehicle for development
in areas and for uses where, in the opinion of the city council or the planning
and zoning commission, approval of a requested rezone by itself does not
satisfy the requirements set forth in this title for rezone approval; but, that
use of a development agreement will assure compliance with the required rezone
findings and conclusions. Development agreements can be used after a
determination has been made that the proposed rezone by itself is not
appropriate, unless the use of a development agreement could allow development
to proceed under stricter restrictions than those imposed generally in the
proposed zoning district. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as
relieving the property which is subject to development agreement restrictions
from further compliance with all other permit and code requirements applicable
because of the zoning designation of the property. Restrictions imposed upon
property as a result of a development agreement are in addition to all other
requirements of this title.
   A:   Submittal: After an application for rezone has been received by the
zoning administrator, a request to enter into a development agreement for that
parcel may be submitted by the rezone applicant; or a development agreement may
be required by the city council at the city council’s rezone hearing.
      1.   In the event of the City Council determines that a development
agreement should be entered into, the City Council may remand the matter back
to the applicant requiring an application for a development agreement to be
submitted by the applicant, unless the applicant has already done so and a
public hearing was held under this section. If the applicant agrees to submit
an application for a development agreement, then the City Council shall defer
its decision on the rezone application until a public hearing is held on the
development agreement application. After the public hearing on the development
agreement application is held, the City Council shall render its decision on
both the rezone and development agreement requests.
      2.   In the event of a determination by the city council that a
development agreement should be entered into, the city council shall remand the
matter back to the planning and zoning commission, with the city council
requiring an application for a development agreement to be submitted by the
applicant, unless the applicant has already done so and a public hearing was
held under subsection A of this section. The city council shall, upon remand,
direct the planning and zoning commission on the specific issues to be
addressed by the development agreement. The planning and zoning commission
shall then proceed as specified in this section.
      3.   In the event a developer seeks to enter into a development
agreement, the developer’s application for a development agreement shall be
taken up by the City Council at the time of the scheduled rezone hearing. The
City Council shall, following consideration of the rezone and development
agreement applications, render its decision regarding each of the applicant’s
requests.
   B.   Time Limits: Upon request for a development agreement, all time limits
required by this title may be stayed upon affirmative vote of the city council.
   C.   Form Of Development Agreement Application: All applications for
development agreements shall be in a form as required by the city clerk or the
zoning administrator. No application shall be accepted which does not include
the following:
      1.   An affidavit by the owner of the property agreeing to submission of
the use and property for a development agreement.
      2.   The specific use or uses of the property upon which the development
agreement is sought.
      3.   The concept plan, which shall include at a minimum:
         a.   Three (3) site plans and eleven inch by seventeen inch (11" x
17") reduction showing:
            (1)   Existing structures which will remain, labeled as to existing
and proposed uses.
            (2)   Building footprint, height, number of stories, proposed uses
(office, retail, restaurant, etc.), and square footage of proposed structures.
If residential, overall density and number of dwelling units per building. (If
single-family residential, information on proposed structures is not
necessary.)
            (3)   North arrow.
            (4)   Scale.
            (5)   Property boundary.
            (6)   Names of applicant, owner (if different than applicant), plan
preparer and project.
            (7)   Size of project.
            (8)   Existing vegetation, labeled as to remain or be removed.
            (9)   Existing and generalized proposed grades for hillside
developments.
            (10)   Parking areas with total number of parking spaces shown.
            (11)   Locations and widths of rights of way, easements, canals,
ditches and property lines.
            (12)   Drainage features.
            (13)   Conceptual landscape plan.
      4.   The time period for which the agreement is requested to be valid,
including the time period with which the development or use must commence and
the time period within which the development and the terms of the agreement are
to be completed.
      5.   A statement that failure to comply with all commitments in the
approved development agreement shall be deemed a consent to rezone the property
to the preexisting zone, or in the case of an initial zone at annexation, a
zone deemed appropriate by the city council.
      6.   If the development agreement is being requested by the rezone
applicant, as opposed to having been required by the city council, a statement
must be included that all time limits required by this title are waived.
      7.   Phasing plan and proposed phasing schedule.
   D.   Process: Upon receipt of an application for development agreement, the
zoning administrator shall work with the applicant to prepare a development
agreement. The development agreement shall include the requirements of section
10-5-4 -C of this chapter and any other matter which, in the discretion of the
zoning administrator, would address the concerns for the development which has
been proposed by the applicant. Such concerns addressed may include, but shall
not be limited to, density, bulk, site design, mitigation of impacts on the
surrounding neighborhood, appearance, provision of utilities or public
facilities, and restrictions on use. The draft of the development agreement
shall be reviewed by the city attorney and design review committee prior to
being sent to the planning and zoning commission.
   E.   Approval: The city council shall hold a public hearing on the draft
agreement and the rezone request, and shall review the recommendation from
staff, and consider any relevant testimony and evidence provided at the public
hearing. The city council may approve, deny, and may add conditions, terms,
duties or obligations to the development agreement. Development agreements may
be approved at the sole discretion of city council.
   F.   Recording: Upon approval of a development agreement or any modification
thereto by the city council and the applicant, it shall be recorded at the
expense of the applicant and prior to the rezone approval. Proof of recording
must be submitted by the applicant prior to the adoption of the rezone
ordinance by the city council. The development agreement, or any modification
thereto, and all conditions, terms, duties or obligations included therein,
shall run with the land and shall be considered continuing obligations of the
owner, co-owners and each other person acquiring an interest in the property.
An owner, co-owner, each subsequent owner or other person acquiring an interest
in the property which is restricted by a development agreement or modification
adopted pursuant to this chapter, shall comply with the terms, conditions,
obligation and duties contained in the development agreement or modification.
   G.   Modification: Development agreements may only be modified after public
hearing by the city council.
   H.   Termination:
      1.   Development agreements may be amended or terminated by the city
council, after public hearing, for failure to comply with the commitments
expressed in the development agreement.
      2.   Upon termination of the development agreement, the city council
shall revert the property to the prior zone, or in the case of an initial zone
at annexation, to a zone deemed appropriate by the city council. All uses of
the property which are not consistent with the subsequently designated zone
following termination of the development agreement shall cease. The owner of
the property shall apply for a conditional use permit for the property if the
use is conditionally allowed within the subsequently designated zone.
      3.   Development agreements may be enforced by the city through any means
deemed to be appropriate, including, but not limited to, specific enforcement,
injunctive relief, damages or criminal penalty for violation of this chapter.
The enforcement options available to the city shall not be considered
exclusive. (Ord. 536, 6-10-2025)
