the city clerk shall collect an adjusted fee reasonably related to the cost of
such extraordinary services. Provided, however, that such adjusted fees shall
be uniform with respect to classes of business imposing similar extraordinary
demands for services; and, provided further, that no such adjusted fee shall be
fixed or collected until the proposed licensee has been furnished notice and an
opportunity to be heard before the city council with respect to such fee. (Ord.

5.04.030: BUSINESS DEFINED:
Each business, trade, occupation, performance or amusement referred to in the
provisions of this chapter must have a license; provided, however, that a
"business" is defined as any activity conducted under one roof having one
management and having access to all parts of the business from the interior of
the building and, if a business is conducted in a building having more than one
room and if all the above required unities are present, then one license will
be sufficient. (Ord. 33 §C, 1956)
5.04.040: APPLICATION; REQUIRED:
No person, persons, copartnerships, corporations or other association of
individuals shall conduct or operate any activity or business within the

the applicant having first signed and filed with the city clerk accompanied by
the license fee required, a form of application provided by the city containing
such information as may be required by the city in order to enable it to
determine whether or not
such licenses should be granted. Any business which conducts sales door to door
must have any of its employees or contractors that will be conducting such
solicitations licensed and the background checks required by this chapter
conducted on any such individuals, including any individuals that are
subsequently employed after the issuance of the initial license or any renewals
thereof. The application shall be reviewed by the city clerk or the clerk's
designee as well as by the chief of police or the chief's designee and other
department heads as the clerk deems appropriate and each may perform additional
investigation into the applicant, the applicant's proposed employees, the
location and any other facts deemed relevant to determine whether or not the
license should be issued. If approved, the city clerk or the clerk's designee
shall issue the license. If the application is rejected and the license denied
by the city clerk or the clerk's designee, the applicant may, within twenty
five (25) days of the denial, request a hearing before the city council to
offer evidence why the application should be considered. A majority vote of the
governing body is sufficient to issue or deny said applicant a license after
said hearing.
Grounds for rejection of an application include, but are not limited to, a
record of criminal convictions, association with criminal elements of the
community which give rise to the potential for criminal activities, drug
crimes, fencing of stolen property or laundering of funds and/or drugs, history
of aggressive solicitations or product misrepresentations, complaints with
consumer protection agencies, better business bureaus or other similar agencies
in other jurisdictions, has given false or misleading information on the
application or in response to subsequent inquiries, or any other facts or
history that indicates an applicant may engage in conduct inimical to the
health, safety, welfare, or business interests of members of the general public
with whom applicant may come in contact in the course of carrying out the
enterprise for which the application is sought. (Ord. 691, 2010)

the city council after a hearing by the council upon reasonable notice to the
licensee or his agent in immediate charge of the business mentioned in such
license, of any charge of misconduct or violation of the city ordinances
charged against him; provided, however, that nothing contained in this chapter
shall in any way interfere with the effect of a judgment of conviction by any
court of competent jurisdiction operating to revoke any license when such
judgment of conviction is based upon the violation of any ordinance relating to
the conduct of the business mentioned in such license.
   B.   When any person to whom a license has been issued pursuant to any city
ordinance has been convicted in any court of competent jurisdiction of a
violation of any ordinance relating to the operation or conduct of the business

unanimous vote of the city council; provided, however, that in the event that
the person so convicted duly perfects an appeal from the judgment of
conviction, the operation of the judgment in revoking the license shall thereby
be stayed until the determination of the appeal; provided, further, that
nothing in this section shall be construed in any way to prohibit the city
council from revoking the license upon proceedings before it as provided by
ordinance. (Ord. 33 §H, 1956)

5.36.010: PURPOSE AND FINDINGS:
   A.   Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually
oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals and general
welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually
oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this chapter have
neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the
content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.
Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny
access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first
amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually
oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor
effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
material.
   B.   Findings: Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of
adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available
to the council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v.
Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v. American Mini Theatres,
426 U.S. 50 (1976); FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990); Barnes
v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); City of Erie v. Paps A.M., 120 S.
Ct. 1382 (2000), and on studies in other communities, including, but not
limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; St. Paul, Minnesota;
Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove,
California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas;
Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; Beaumont, Texas;
Dallas, Texas; Newport News, Virginia; Bellevue, Washington; New York, New
York; and St. Croix County, Wisconsin; and also on findings from the "Report Of
The Attorney General's Working Group On The Regulation Of Sexually Oriented
Businesses" (June 6, 1989, state of Minnesota) and the "2004 Idaho
Epidemiologic Profile", the council finds:
      1.   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are often uncontrolled by the operators of the
establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of
these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their
premises.
      2.   Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses, defined in this
chapter as adult theaters and adult cabarets, engage in higher incidence of
certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other
establishments.
      3.   Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at
sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing videos, or live sex shows.
      4.   Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which
creates unhealthy conditions.
      5.   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades and other
sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such sexually oriented businesses.
      6.   At least fifty (50) communicable diseases may be spread by
activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not
limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-
AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, non A, non B amebiasis, salmonella
infections and shigella infections.
      7.   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome) caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United
States: six hundred (600) in 1982; two thousand two hundred (2,200) in 1983;
four thousand six hundred (4,600) in 1984, eight thousand five hundred fifty
five (8,555) in 1985, and two hundred fifty three thousand four hundred forty
eight (253,448) through December 1992. Cumulatively, there are forty thousand
(40,000) new cases reported per year.
      8.   Idaho's first case of HIV was reported in 1985. Since then, one
thousand seventy four (1,074) unduplicated cases of HIV/AIDS have been
reported. Of the one thousand seventy four (1,074) unduplicated HIV/AIDS cases
reported, five hundred fifty seven (557) have received an AIDS diagnosis. Most
AIDS cases were in the category of men who have sex with other men (MSM)
exposure. Three (3) AIDS cases were pediatric. Among HIV cases (not yet AIDS),
the most frequently reported exposure category is also MSM. Six (6) HIV cases
were pediatric cases. Over three-fourths (3/4) of HIV cases were aged twenty
(20) to thirty nine (39) years when their infection was diagnosed. Thirty three
(33) Idaho residents were newly diagnosed with HIV infection (including AIDS at
diagnosis) in 2003. A majority of males diagnosed in 2003 were MSM.
      9.   HIV/AIDS is tied for the tenth leading cause of death for Idahoans
aged twenty five (25) to forty four (44) years of age. However, new reported
HIV/AIDS cases have outnumbered HIV/AIDS deaths each year, resulting in an
increase in the number of persons living with HIV/AIDS in Idaho.
      10.   The number of cases of early (less than 1 year) syphilis in the
United States reported annually has risen, with thirty three thousand six
hundred thirteen (33,613) cases reported in 1982, and forty five thousand two
hundred (45,200) through November 1990. In Idaho, syphilis cases have increased
dramatically from 1999 to 2003. Much of this increase is among persons
considered to be part of a statewide outbreak. Rates and cases of early
syphilis increased dramatically during 2002 to 2003, indicating ongoing
transmission of the disease.
      11.   Idaho's gonorrhea cases and rates show a slightly downward trend
from 1999 to 2003. Total cases reported from 1999 to 2003 ranged from sixty
eight (68) in 2003 to ninety eight (98) in 2000. Rates ranged from five (5) per
one hundred thousand (100,000) in 2003 to eight (8) per one hundred thousand
(100,000) in 2000.
      12.   In his report of October 22, 1986, the surgeon general of the
United States advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
      13.   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
      14.   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and in
part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the
owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities
and maintain those facilities.
      15.   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in
the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented
films.
      16.   The findings noticed in subsections B1 through B15 of this section
raise substantial governmental concerns.
      17.   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which
should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      18.   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators
of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will
place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business
is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its
patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate
to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of
the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises
and activities occurring therein.
      19.   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting
on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in
curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters.
      20.   Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help
reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the
identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from
working in such establishments.
      21.   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of the sexually
oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the
significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in
preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
      22.   In the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases, it is
desirable to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees
who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent, or who
are likely to be witnesses to such conduct.
      23.   The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been
convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the
applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter.
      24.   The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses
for a period of years serves as a deterrent to, and prevents conduct which
leads to, the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
      25.   The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of
the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter. (Ord. 616, 2006)

intent to deny, suspend or revoke the license, including the grounds therefor,
by personal delivery or by certified mail. The notification shall be directed
to the most current business address on file with the enforcement officer.
Within five (5) working days of receipt of such notice, the respondent may
provide to the city clerk, in writing, a response that shall include a
statement of reasons why the license or permit should not be denied, suspended
or revoked. Within three (3) days of the receipt of respondent's written
response, the city clerk shall notify respondent in writing of the hearing date
on respondent's denial, suspension or revocation proceeding.
Within thirty (30) working days of the receipt of respondent's written
response, the city council, or an independent hearing officer appointed by the
council, shall conduct a hearing at which respondent shall have the opportunity
to be represented by counsel and present evidence and witnesses on his or her
behalf. If a response is not received by the city in the time stated or, if
after the hearing, the city council finds that grounds as specified in this
chapter exist for denial, suspension or revocation, then such denial,
suspension or revocation shall become final five (5) days after the city clerk
sends, by certified mail, written notice that the license has been denied,
suspended or revoked. Such notice shall include a statement advising the
applicant or licensee of the right to appeal such decision to a court of
competent jurisdiction.
If the city council finds that no grounds exist for denial, suspension or

clerk shall withdraw the intent to deny, suspend or revoke the license, and
shall so notify the respondent in writing by certified mail of such action and

right to appeal such action to a court of competent jurisdiction. Upon the
filing of any court action to appeal, challenge, restrain or otherwise enjoin
the city's enforcement of the denial, suspension or revocation, the city shall
immediately issue the aggrieved party a provisional license. The provisional
license shall allow the aggrieved party to continue operation of the sexually
oriented business or to continue employment as a sexually oriented business
employee, as the case may be, and will expire upon the court's entry of a
judgment on the aggrieved party's action to appeal, challenge, restrain or
otherwise enjoin the city's enforcement. (Ord. 616, 2006)

not rendered a nonconforming use by the location, subsequent to the grant or
renewal of the sexually oriented business license, of a use listed in
subsection B of this section within two thousand feet (2,000') of the sexually
oriented business. This provision applies only to the renewal of a valid

of the same is posted in a conspicuous place upon the property and duplicate
copies of the notice are sent by certified mail to the owner of the vehicle and

may introduce such witnesses and evidence as either party deems necessary. The
city council shall decide whether or not the vehicle in question should be
impounded (unless impoundment has already occurred as authorized in section

owner or occupant of property on which it is found, and shall personally serve
upon such person a written demand that the vehicle be removed within twenty
four (24) hours.
   B.   If the identity of such person cannot be readily ascertained, or if
there is a failure to comply with the demand for removal, the director of
traffic may remove and impound the vehicle as provided in section

for violation of this chapter. The notice shall specify the location where the
vehicle is stored, and state the costs incurred by the city for its removal and
storage. Notice shall be delivered personally or sent by ordinary mail. (Ord.
179 §5, 1977)
8.12.070: DISPOSITION OF IMPOUNDED VEHICLES:
   A.   If sixty (60) days elapse after removing a vehicle and giving notice as
authorized above, during which the vehicle has not been claimed and the city's
costs paid, the city shall cause the vehicle to be appraised.
   B.   If the vehicle is appraised at less than the costs incurred (including
the advertising costs that would be incurred if the vehicles were sold at
public auction), the director of traffic may then summarily dispose of the
vehicle and execute an appropriate certificate of sale or destruction. One copy
of such certificate shall be filed with the city clerk and another copy shall
be forwarded to the appropriate office of the Idaho transportation department.
   C.   If the vehicle is appraised in excess of costs as described in

its employees or agents shall be strictly limited to the amount of the purchase
price received.
   F.   Costs recovered in the course of any sale or distribution shall be
deposited to the appropriate law enforcement budget of the city by the city
treasurer and any surplus proceeds shall be paid to the owner of the vehicle,
or party holding a valid lien or security interest, if known. (Ord. 179 §6,

8.12.080: REDEMPTION OF IMPOUNDED VEHICLES:
The owner of, or person asserting a lien or secured interest in, any vehicle
impounded under the provisions of this chapter may redeem such vehicle at any
time after its removal but prior to its sale or destruction upon proof of
ownership, lien, or secured interest, and payment to the city clerk of such sum
as the director of traffic shall determine and fix for the actual and
reasonable expense of removal and storage, plus any preliminary sale
advertising expenses already incurred. Usual removal, storage and advertising
expenses, reflecting the city's pattern of actual costs, shall be posted in the
office of the director of traffic and shall be made available for public
inspection. (Ord. 179 §7, 1977)

discloses that the vehicle has been repaired by the permittee, the fee herein
specified shall be refunded, but if such vehicle has not been repaired within
the specified time period, the director of traffic or his designee shall issue
a notice to remove as provided in section

8.24.070: VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES:
   A.   Any owner, occupant, lessor, lessee, manager, or other person having
lawful control over a structure or parcel of land who causes, permits,
facilitates, or aids or abets any violation of any provision of this chapter or
who fails to perform any act or duty required by this chapter or who permits a
lessee or a tenant to violate this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
Each day any violation of any provision of this chapter or the failure to
perform any act or duty required by this chapter exists shall constitute a
separate violation.
   B.   The owner of record, as recorded in the records of Bannock County, of
the property upon which a violation of this chapter exists shall be presumed to
be the person having lawful control over a structure or parcel of land. If more
than one person shall be recorded as the owner of the property, said persons
shall be jointly and severally presumed to be persons having lawful control
over a structure or parcel of land. This presumption shall not prevent
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter against any person specified in
subsection A of this section.
   C.   It shall not be a defense for an owner of record to plead that any act
or omission made punishable by this chapter was at the time the violation
occurred within the control of a lessee or tenant pursuant to a lease or rental
agreement.
   D.   Prosecution of an offense, under this section, shall not preclude the
city from seeking a civil remedy as provided in section
8.24.074 of this chapter for failure to comply with this chapter. (Ord. 346 §2,
1990)
8.24.072: ENFORCEMENT INDEPENDENT OF OTHER OFFICIALS:

fees and such other or further relief including judgment for site clearing
expenses, as the court may deem just. (Ord. 346 §2, 1990)
8.24.078: OTHER ABATEMENT:
   A.   If the property owner or other person served a notice or order by the
city pursuant to this chapter fails to comply with such notice or order, the
council may adopt a resolution finding that a violation of this chapter exists,
that there has been a failure of compliance with a notice to remove, abate, or
destroy the problem and that action by the city is required to protect the
public health, safety, and welfare in the area affected. Following adoption of
such a resolution, the mayor may direct that employees of the city, or the
city's contractors or agents, go upon the premises in question and remove,
abate, or destroy the problem. The city shall be entitled to recover its
expense by civil action filed in a court of competent jurisdiction, together
with costs and a reasonable attorney fee. The expense may also be certified to
the city clerk and transmitted to the county treasurer, and be collected by
special assessment upon the property to the extent provided by law. If the
certificate is recorded at the office of the county recorder, it shall become a
lien against the property to the extent provided by law. (Ord. 346 §2, 1990)
8.24.080: RECORDING A VIOLATION:
The notice of violation described in section
 8.24.066 of this chapter shall run with the land. If a violation remains
uncorrected, the city, at its sole option, may record a notice of violation
with the Bannock County recorder and thereby cause compliance by an entity
thereafter acquiring such property. The nonfiling of any notice of violation
shall in no way affect the validity of such notice as to the entities so
notified. When the property is brought into compliance by the owner, occupant
or lessee, a satisfaction of notice of violation shall be filed. (Ord. 346 §2,
1990)
8.24.090: VARIANCES:
The mayor or his designee may grant a minor variance to this chapter when there
exists an unusual or unreasonable hardship resulting from a literal
interpretation of this chapter; provided, that the method of work or repair
offered conforms to the intent of this chapter. (Ord. 333 §1, 1990)
8.24.100: FAILURE TO APPEAL:
Failure of a person entitled to appeal under this code to timely request an
appeal with the city council pursuant to section
8.24.066 of this chapter shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
before the city council or a court of competent jurisdiction and such person
shall be estopped to deny the validity of any order or action of the city which
could have been timely appealed. (Ord. 346 §2, 1990)
8.24.110: CONFLICT OF ORDINANCES:
   A.   In any case where a provision of this chapter is found to be in
conflict with a provision of any zoning, building, fire, safety or health
ordinance or code of the city existing on the effective date hereof, the
provision which establishes the higher standard for the promotion and
protection of the health and safety of the people shall prevail.
   B.   It is not intended by this chapter, to repeal, abrogate, annul or in

appurtenances. This exemption is not a relief from provisions of this chapter
which control activities that impact public or private property.
      10.   Crushing and screening operations exceeding one hundred eighty
(180) calendar days of operation. These sites are subject to zoning and
conditional use permit requirements, and any other requirements specified by
this code. This exemption does not relieve such operations from provisions of
this chapter which control activities that impact public or private property.
   G.   Approval of an erosion control plan and issuance of a permit does not
relieve a person from the duty to ensure continuous compliance with all
conditions of the approved plan or permit, as well as all of the applicable
provisions of this chapter and appropriate federal requirements.
   H.   The permit may be suspended or revoked by the city at any time if the
site of the construction activity is not in full compliance with the conditions
of the approved erosion control plan, the permit, and all applicable provisions
of this chapter; the permit was issued in error; or the permit was based on
incorrect information.
   I.   Written notice shall be given by the city to the permittee of the
suspension or revocation of a permit, and this decision may be appealed in
accordance with the provisions of section
8.44.140 of this chapter.
   J.   A permit shall automatically expire and become null and void if the
project for which the permit was issued is not commenced within a period of one
hundred eighty (180) days from the date of issuance, the project for which the
permit was issued is suspended or abandoned for any reason within the permit
holder's control, or the time frame for conditions of a violation order has
elapsed without compliance. The project shall not recommence until the permit
has been renewed. Such renewal will require submittal of intent to renew the
permit, payment of the applicable fee, and approval of the city.
   K.   Once final landscaping and all of the requirements or conditions have
been completed and a certificate of occupancy has been issued by the city of
Chubbuck building official, the conditions of the permit shall cease. The
building official may require all denuded soil to be permanently stabilized
prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. In addition, any
charges, fees, cleanup costs and penalties must be paid before issuance of a
certificate of occupancy. The certificate of occupancy for a phased development
permit will not be issued until all lots have been completed or a legal
transfer of ownership has occurred. Notification for a legal transfer of
ownership must be made to the city within five (5) working days of the
transfer.
   L.   In cases where another person wishes to continue or complete work
previously commenced under a permit, said person shall either obtain a new
permit or gain transfer of the previous permit. The original permit holder will
be released from the permit once another person has become responsible for the
conditions for erosion and sediment. Such transfers must be approved by the
city.
   M.   Permits may be transferred to other persons upon approval of the city
after receiving a request for transfer and payment of the applicable fee. The
request must contain the name, address, and telephone number of the person to
whom the permit will be transferred. The involved parties shall be notified of
the decision of the city within ten (10) working days. If approved, all

modification on a field report or correction notice, and the approved plans,
with a dated signature.
   H.   If the city's authorized representative determines the facilities or
techniques of an erosion control plan are not effective or are not sufficient
after prior approval, and such insufficiencies are having an impact on public
property or private property not controlled by the permit holder, or is placing
the city of Chubbuck in violation of its NPDES permit, the city may order a
revised plan be submitted within a reasonable time period. If the revised plan
is not acceptable or is not immediately implemented upon approval, the permit
may be suspended or revoked. Any decision of the authorized representative or
director of public works regarding said revised plan may be appealed pursuant
to section
8.44.140 of this chapter.
   I.   Emergency control measures may be ordered when erosion products are
actually leaving the site or sediment deposition is occurring. These emergency
control measures will not relieve permit holders or applicants of the duty to
file a revised plan if required by the city. (Ord. 664, 2009)

related to said discharges.
      3.   The director of public works shall have the right to set up on any
permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the
authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
facility's stormwater discharge.
      4.   The director of public works has the right to require the discharger
to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to
measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated as required by the
manufacturer's operation manual to ensure their accuracy.
      5.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the director of public works and
shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the
operator.
      6.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the director of public works access
to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of
this chapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with an NPDES permit
to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits a
misdemeanor offense if the person denies the director of public works access to
the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this chapter.
      7.   If the director of public works has been refused access to any part
of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter
or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety,
and welfare of the community, then the director of public works may seek
issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. (Ord.
665, 2009)
8.48.110: BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES:
The city shall adopt requirements identifying best management practices (BMPs)
for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to
pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of
the U.S. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment
shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm
drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and
nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premises,
which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to
implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural
BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate
storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES
permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial
activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the
provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution
prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the
applicable NPDES permit. (Ord. 665, 2009)
8.48.120: WATERCOURSE PROTECTION:
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, shall keep and
maintain that part of the watercourse within said person's property free of
trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute,
contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse.
In addition, the owner shall maintain existing privately owned structures
within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a
hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse. (Ord.
665, 2009)
8.48.130: NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS:
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation, has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, the municipal separate
storm sewer system, or waters of the U.S., said person shall take all necessary
steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the
event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately
notify emergency response agencies and the Idaho department of environmental
quality of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized
enforcement agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next
business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written
notice addressed and mailed to the city director of public works within three
(3) business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials
emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator
of such establishment shall also retain an on site written record of the
discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall
be retained for at least three (3) years from the date of the discharge. (Ord.
665, 2009)
8.48.140: VIOLATIONS CONSTITUTE MISDEMEANORS:
The knowing violation of any provision or failure to comply with any
requirement of this chapter shall constitute a misdemeanor and may be
punishable by a fine up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), imprisonment in
the county jail up to six (6) months, or both. Each day on which a violation
occurs may constitute a separate criminal offense. (Ord. 665, 2009)
8.48.150: ACTS RESULTING IN VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS:
Any person who violates any provision of this chapter, or discharges any
pollutant or causes pollution, may also be in violation of federal laws or
regulations, and may be subject to the sanctions of those laws or regulations,
including civil or criminal penalties, notwithstanding any legal action taken
by the city. (Ord. 665, 2009)
8.48.160: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on scientific, engineering, and other relevant
technical considerations. The standards set forth herein are minimum standards
and this chapter does not imply that compliance will ensure against all
unauthorized discharge of pollutants. This chapter shall not create liability
on the part of the city, any agent or employee thereof for any damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made hereunder. (Ord. 665, 2009)

   B.   Submittal Process: The stormwater site plan shall be submitted to the
city as part of the land development application. The city may charge a fee in
an amount set by council resolution for the permit. The plans shall be reviewed
by the city for compliance with the PVSDM, this chapter, and other applicable
rules and standards prior to approval.
   C.   Conditions Of Approval: The following conditions apply to all approved
stormwater site plans:
      1.   Any modifications to the stormwater site plan shall be submitted to
the city for approval. A new stormwater site plan shall be submitted on request
of the city.
      2.   Approval of the stormwater site plan submittal does not relieve the
owner or responsible party from the duty to ensure the systems and their safety
measures function as designed.
      3.   Approval may be suspended or revoked at any time if conditions are
not as stated or shown in the approved application or if implementation of the
stormwater site plan submittal is not proceeding in the approved manner.
      4.   Approval of a stormwater site plan submittal may be suspended if the
project is not completed within a two (2) year period. However, a one year
extension may be granted upon written request that provides the reason(s) for
the delay or cessation of development and specifies a time frame for completion
or commencement of development activities.
      5.   If a stormwater site plan submittal approval is suspended or
revoked, the owner shall be required to submit a new plan for approval, with
the requisite fee, prior to starting or continuing the planned project or
development. (Ord. 746, 2015)
8.56.090: STORMWATER DESIGN CRITERIA:
   A.   General: The design of stormwater BMPs shall consider public health,
safety, and general welfare of the city and its citizens. These considerations
include, but are not limited to: preventing flooding of structures and
travelways; preventing standing water in facilities, manholes, inlets, and
other structures in a manner that promotes the breeding of mosquitoes;
preventing attractive nuisance conditions and dangerous conditions due to
velocity or depth of water and/or access to orifices and drops; and preventing
aesthetic nuisances due to excessive slopes, cuts and fills, and other
conditions. All stormwater facilities and conveyance systems shall be designed
in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws and regulations,
including the federal clean water act and all applicable erosion and sediment
control and floodplain regulations. All development and redevelopment shall
apply source control BMPs selected, designed, and maintained in accordance with
the PVSDM.
   B.   Entire Project Considered: Residential, commercial or industrial
developments shall apply these stormwater criteria to land development as a
whole. Individual residential lots in new subdivisions shall not be considered
separate land development projects, but rather the entire subdivision shall be
considered a single land development project.
   C.   Ownership Of Facilities: Stormwater facilities within residential
subdivisions that serve multiple lots and/or a combination of lots and roadways
shall be on a lot owned and maintained by an entity of common ownership.
Stormwater practices located on individual lots shall be maintained by the lot
owner, or, at the discretion of the public works director, be placed within an
easement and maintained by an entity of common ownership.
   D.   Floodplains, Critical Areas, And Jurisdictional Waters: Construction of
stormwater measures or facilities within a federal emergency management agency
(FEMA) designated floodplain shall be avoided to the extent possible. To the
extent practical, stormwater facilities shall not be located in areas
determined to be jurisdictional waters through section 404 of the federal clean
water act and/or applicable state regulations.
   E.   Ultimate Land Development Considered: Hydrologic parameters used in
calculations shall reflect the runoff conditions for the ultimate land
development and shall be used in all engineering calculations. All
predevelopment calculations shall consider open space, woods and fields to be
in good condition, regardless of actual conditions at the time of application.
   F.   Passage Of Upland Flow And Site Runoff: All development and
redevelopment shall provide the passage of upland flow and site runoff.
Conveyance of upland flow shall maintain natural drainage patterns. Discharges
from project sites should occur at the natural location to the maximum extent
or, where altered, must be situated or directed to where it would have
overflowed under the conditions existing prior to proposed development.
Capacity of the drainage course downstream of the development may not be
exceeded. Design calculations for passage of upland flow and site runoff shall
use the 100-year, 24-hour design storm.
   G.   Site Runoff And Flow Control: Discharges from all new development and
redevelopment must not cause a significant adverse impact to downstream
receiving waters and down gradient properties. Stormwater site plans shall
provide for the on site detention and/or retention of the total water
intercepted and collected by the development and the areas (improved or
unimproved) lying and draining presently to and through the proposed
development, for the design storm unless other natural or manmade systems are
available for use. Flow control facilities shall be selected, designed,
constructed, operated and maintained consistent with guidance found in the
PVSDM, and criteria herein.
      1.   Site runoff design and flow control facility design calculations for
peak flow and peak volume detention requirements shall be based on detention of
the postdevelopment condition for the stated design storm, and the contributing
basin size, where contributing basin size refers to the total area above the
inlet or hydraulic element. Peak discharge rates for the postdevelopment
condition must be reduced to at least predevelopment rates of the 50-year, 24-
hour design storm, and to at least the predevelopment rates of the 100-year,
24-hour design storm with a maximum discharge of 0.1 cfs/acre in special
drainage areas, as designated by the PVSDM.
   H.   Treatment: Treatment is required for discharges to all surface waters
of the state, including perennial and seasonal streams, lakes and wetlands
where the impervious threshold is met. Runoff treatment is also required for
discharges of stormwater to ground where the vadose zone does not provide
adequate treatment capacity as identified in the PVSDM. Stormwater site plans
shall provide for the treatment of site runoff for the design storm, as
described in the PVSDM. Treatment facilities shall be selected, designed,
constructed, operated and maintained consistent with guidance found in the
PVSDM, and criteria herein.
   I.   Wetlands: Stormwater treatment facilities are not allowed within a
wetland or its natural vegetated buffer, or to provide treatment, except for:
      1.   Necessary conveyance systems approved by the local government; or
      2.   As allowed in a wetland mitigation plan. (Ord. 746, 2015)
8.56.100: DRAINAGE EASEMENTS:
Drainage easements shall be required where a development or redevelopment is
traversed by a drainageway, channel or stream. The following conditions shall
apply to all easements:
   A.   A stormwater easement or drainage right of way shall conform
substantially with the lines of the drainageway, channel or stream.
   B.   Measures shall be taken to prevent down gradient impacts as a result of
new development or redevelopment where no conveyance system exists at the
adjacent down gradient property line or stream, and the discharge was
previously unconcentrated flow or significantly lower concentrated flow.
   C.   Easements may not be obstructed by structures, including fences, or
filled.
   D.   Easements shall be of a width for construction, or maintenance, or
both, as will be adequate for the purpose. Width must be able to convey the
100-year, 24-hour storm and shall be no less than twenty feet (20') wide.
Parallel streets or parkways may be required in connection therewith.
   E.   The costs of repairs, maintenance, removing structures or other
drainage impediments shall be the responsibility of the grantor. Should the
grantor neglect to do so, easement terms must allow for the city of Chubbuck to
perform maintenance and repairs on said stormwater management facility(ies).
For the purpose of inspection, maintenance and repair, the easement must ensure
access from public right of way to stormwater facilities and drainageways.
   F.   Easements shall be approved by the city of Chubbuck prior to approval
of a final plat or issuance of a certificate of occupancy and shall be recorded
with Bannock County and on all property deeds.
   G.   A deed of easement shall be recorded prior to the stormwater
certificate of completion. (Ord. 746, 2015)
8.56.110: INSPECTIONS:
   A.   The property owner shall notify the city of Chubbuck when construction
has started. Regular inspections of the stormwater management system
construction shall be conducted by public works director or her/his designee.
All inspections shall be documented. If any violations are found, the property
owner shall be notified in writing of the nature of the violation and the
required corrective actions. No added work shall proceed until any violations
are corrected and all work previously completed has received approval by the
public works director. (Ord. 746, 2015)
8.56.120: OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE (O&M):
   A.   Responsible Party: Owners are responsible for the operation and
maintenance of stormwater facilities on their property.
   B.   Requirement For O&M Agreement: If a project requiring a stormwater site
plan requires structural or nonstructural measures, the owner shall execute an
O&M agreement prior to the city granting final approval of any development plan
or other development for which a permit is required under this title. The
stormwater O&M agreement shall be recorded in the office of the Bannock County
clerk and shall run with the land.
   C.   Required Elements For Stormwater O&M Agreement: The O&M agreement shall
be in a form approved by the city, and shall, at a minimum require the owner of
the property, including successor owners, to maintain the stormwater system on
the property so that the system continues to function as planned. It shall
include a city approved O&M plan detailing inspection, maintenance and
reporting responsibilities.
   D.   Maintenance Responsibility: In accordance with the city approved O&M
plan, property owners shall maintain in good condition and promptly repair and
restore all structural and nonstructural stormwater BMPs, and all necessary
access routes and appurtenances (e.g., graded surfaces, walls, drains, check
dams and structures, UICs, catch basins, pipes, vegetation adjacent to the
inlets and within the facility, erosion and sedimentation controls, and other
protective devices).
   E.   Maintenance Records Required: The owner or other responsible party
shall make at least annual inspections of the facilities and maintain records
of such inspections. Most O&M plans will require more frequent inspections.
Stormwater BMP inspection, maintenance and repair records shall be retained by
the owner or their designee for a period of five (5) years, and shall be made
available to the city upon request.
   F.   Maintenance Inspection By City: The city shall retain the right to
conduct periodic inspections for all stormwater BMPs, which shall be documented
in writing. The inspection shall document any maintenance and repair needs, and
any discrepancies from the stormwater system maintenance agreement.
   G.   Failure To Provide Adequate Maintenance: If the property owner,
operator, or successor, fails or refuses to meet the maintenance requirements
specified in the O&M plan, the public works director may issue a correction
notice and with a minimum of thirty (30) days' written notice, complete the
necessary maintenance at the owner's/operator's expense. In the event that the
violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety,
twenty four (24) hour notice shall be sufficient. (Ord. 746, 2015)
8.56.130: ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT:
   A.   Correction Notice: When the city of Chubbuck determines that an
activity is not being carried out in accordance with the requirements of this
chapter, the public works director shall issue a written correction notice to
the owner of the property. The correction notice shall contain a description of
the remedial measures necessary to bring the development activity into
compliance with this chapter and a time schedule for the completion of such
remedial action;
   B.   Stop Work Order: Persons receiving a correction notice may be required
to halt all construction activities. This "stop work order" will be in effect
until the public works director confirms that the development activity is in
compliance and the violation has been satisfactorily addressed. Failure to
address a "stop work order" in a timely manner can result in civil, criminal,
or monetary penalties in accordance with the enforcement measures authorized in
this chapter. (Ord. 746, 2015)
8.56.140: VIOLATIONS CONSTITUTE MISDEMEANORS:
The violation of any provision or failure to comply with any requirement of
this chapter shall constitute a misdemeanor and may be punishable by a fine up
to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), imprisonment in the county jail up to six
(6) months, or both. Each day on which a violation occurs may constitute a
separate criminal offense. (Ord. 746, 2015)
8.56.150: VIOLATIONS DEEMED A PUBLIC NUISANCE:
   A.   In addition to the criminal penalties provided in section
8.56.140 of this chapter, any condition caused or permitted to exist in
violation of this chapter shall be considered a threat to the public health,
safety, welfare, and environment, and may be declared and deemed a nuisance by
the city.
   B.   Any condition deemed a nuisance by the city or other authorized
enforcement agent may be summarily abated and/or restored by the city. The cost
of abatement and/or restoration shall be borne by the owner of the property
and/or the permit holder for the work done on the property, which liability
shall be joint and several. Whereupon the city is authorized, pursuant to Idaho
Code 50-334, to lien the subject property and/or pursue a civil action in
district court to recover the costs incurred by the city to abate the nuisance
and/or enjoin or otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance. (Ord. 746,
2015)
8.56.160: NONEXCLUSIVE REMEDIES:
All remedies and penalties under this chapter are in addition to, and do not
supersede or limit, any and all other remedies and penalties, both civil and
criminal. The remedies and penalties provided for herein shall be cumulative
and not exclusive. (Ord. 746, 2015)
8.56.170: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on scientific, engineering, and other relevant
technical considerations. The standards set forth herein are minimum standards
and this chapter does not imply that compliance will ensure against all
unauthorized discharges of pollutants. This chapter shall not create liability
on the part of the city, any agent or employee thereof for any damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder, except as otherwise provided and limited pursuant to the Idaho
tort claims act. (Ord. 746, 2015)

remove street trees within the lines of all streets, alleys, avenues, lanes,
squares and public grounds, as may be necessary to ensure public safety or to
preserve or enhance the symmetry and beauty of such public grounds.
   B.   Adjacent property owners, or homeowners' associations as agreed to by
the City, shall be responsible for public tree care. Such duties include:
      1.   Ensuring landscaping compliance with section
8.60.040 of this chapter and, where applicable, ensuring that landscaping
conforms to the development's approval standards.
      2.   Provide water sufficient to keep trees located on public rights-of-
way adjacent to the owner's real property in a healthy, growing condition.
      3.   Control pests on trees located on public rights-of-way adjacent to
the owner's real property.
      4.   Routine cutting, trimming, pruning and maintenance of public trees
to provide sufficient public travel clearance on public rights-of-way and to
remove dead limbs or other limbs that would constitute a hazard.
      5.   Obtaining written consent from the City for non-routine or major
public tree care. For purpose of this chapter, "topping" or "heading" of any
public tree is not considered routine or minor. However, on those public
properties between sidewalks and roads, adjacent property owners may perform
any level of care, including removal and/or replacement of trees or shrubs
without the consent of the City provided that the landscaping complies with
section
8.60.040 of this chapter and, where applicable, the development's approval
standards. (Ord. 792, 2019)
8.60.060: VIOLATIONS:
It shall be unlawful:
   A.   For any person, corporation, or utility to perform non-routine or major
care of public trees without the express written consent of the City unless
exempted by this chapter; if a person questions whether a project would
constitute a non-routine or major action, they shall contact the City for
advice.
   B.   For any person, corporation, or utility to fasten any sign, card,
poster, wire, rope or other material to or around or through any public tree,
shrub, or its protective barrier, except authorized personnel in the event of
an emergency.
   C.   For any person, corporation, or utility to deposit, place, store, or
maintain upon any public area of the City, any stone, brick, sand, concrete, or
other materials which may impede the free passage of water, air, and/or
fertilizer to the roots of any tree or shrub growing thereon.
   D.   For any person, or their pet, corporation, or utility to take any
action which would break, injure, mutilate, kill or destroy any public tree,
shrub or other vegetation in any public park or public place, nor permit any
toxic chemical or other injurious substance to seep, drain, or be emptied on or
about any public tree, public place, or public park.
   E.   For any person, corporation, or utility to fail to notify the City when
any part of a public tree is damaged or destroyed, including the critical root
zone. (Ord. 792, 2019)
8.60.070: PUBLIC NUISANCES - URBAN FOREST:
The following are declared to be public nuisances:
   A.   Public or private trees whose roots are lifting up into the right-of-
way or upraising and cracking sidewalks or paths, curbs, or gutters.
   B.   Public or private trees that are infested with diseases, pests, or
insects that are detrimental to the health of the tree and any and all
surrounding trees due to the spread of the disease. Examples of such
infestations include, but are not limited to: any living or standing private or
public elm tree or part thereof infected with the Dutch elm disease fungus
Ceratocystis ulmi (Buisman) or which harbors any of the elm bark beetles
Scolytus multistriatus (Marsham) or Hylurgopinus rufipes (Eichoff); any public
or private dead elm tree or part thereof, including logs, branches, stumps,
firewood, or other elm material not burned, sprayed with an effective elm bark
beetle-destroying insecticide, or from which the bark has not been removed.
   C.   Public or private trees whose branches and leaves which overhang any
sidewalk or path, parkway or roadway present in such a manner to create a
hazard to, or impediment to the progress or vision of, any person traveling on
any right-of-way, street, sidewalk, or roadway, or which covers or impairs the
view of any traffic control device by a person operating a motorized vehicle on
a roadway. These nuisance hazards generally exist when the following conditions
are met:
      1.   Except as otherwise determined by the City for cause, branches that
overhang sidewalks or paths or streets and are not pruned to provide sufficient
vertical clearance of eight feet (8') above sidewalks or paths and twelve feet
(12') above streets and alleys so as not to interfere with public travel, or on
designated arterials and collectors, are not pruned to provide vertical
clearance of fourteen and one-half feet (14.5') above streets. Horizontal
clearance shall be the width required to provide clearance for the entire
sidewalk, street, or path.
      2.   Trees and other landscaping at uncontrolled local classified
intersections which obstruct corner visibility and which, at a minimum, do not
conform to Idaho Code section 49-221, which requires an unobstructed vision
triangle measured forty feet (40') along each roadway from the intersection of
the curb lines extended or the intersection of the property lines if no curbs
exist, and/or sight triangles at intersections on streets classified other than
residential which do not conform to the standards as set out in the "Bannock
Transportation Planning Organization - Access Management Guidelines".
   D.   Public or private trees that may endanger the security and usefulness
of any public right-of-way, public sewer, water main, or other public utility.
(Ord. 792, 2019)
8.60.080: ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES - URBAN FOREST:
The following are the prescribed means of abating public nuisances under this
chapter:
   A.   Any tree or alternate host plant or part thereof (public or private)
declared to be a public nuisance as set forth in section
8.60.070 of this chapter shall be pruned, removed, or otherwise treated in
accordance with the requirements of this chapter. All costs for nuisance
abatement are the responsibility of the property owner (private trees) or
adjoining property owner (public trees).
   B.   The City may cause a written notice to be personally served or sent by
mail to the owner of the particular property.
   C.   In the event the nuisance is not abated by the date specified in the
notice, the City is authorized to cause the abatement of said nuisance. The
reasonable cost of such abatement may be charged to the subject property owner.
Monies which have not been recovered through the City bill-collection
procedures may result in a lien against the property or assessed on taxes as
provided for in Idaho Code title 50. In addition, the property owner upon which
the nuisance is located may be subject to prosecution under this chapter, or
any other chapter of this Code or the Idaho Code for maintaining a public
nuisance.
   D.   The City is empowered to cause the immediate abatement of any nuisance
if it is determined to be an emergency or immediate hazard to public safety.
   E.   If the City determines that disposal of the wood, branches and soil
from removal or pruning of a nuisance tree is required to complete abatement,
such disposal shall be done as required by the City. All costs associated with
the disposal of material from trees shall be the responsibility of the property
owner (private trees) or the adjoining property owner (public trees).
   F.   No tree growing near a sidewalk or path shall be cut down or removed
solely because of the interference it causes or may cause with a sidewalk,
unless the City in coordination with the City Engineer finds that the sidewalk
cannot reasonably be reconstructed without removal of the tree. When feasible,
sidewalks shall be reconstructed around trees so that trees are not removed
solely to facilitate construction of sidewalks. The cost for the reconstruction
of the sidewalk shall be the responsibility of the property owner (private
trees) or the adjoining property owner (public trees). (Ord. 792, 2019)
8.60.090: APPEAL:
   A.   Any person affected by an order, grant, denial, or revocation of a
license or permit by the City may appeal such order, grant, denial, or
revocation to the City Council.
   B.   Appeals for the granting, denial, or revocation of a license or permit
shall be filed in writing and be submitted to the City within ten (10) calendar
days of the date of notification of the City's ruling. Appeals for orders shall
be filed in writing and be submitted to the City at least forty eight (48)
hours prior to the ordered deadline.
   C.   The appeal shall be heard by the City Council. Action by the City and
the appellant shall be delayed until the decision of the City Council is
rendered.
   D.   The City Council may, in conformity with the provisions of this
chapter, reverse or affirm or modify wholly or partly, the order, grant, denial
or revocation of any permit and the decision of the City.
   E.   The decision of the City Council shall be final. (Ord. 792, 2019)
8.60.100: PENALTIES:
   A.   A violation of any provision of this chapter may be a misdemeanor
punishable by a fine of up to three hundred dollars ($300.00) and/or six (6)
months in the County Jail. Additionally, the City may seek civil remedies for
damages and to enjoin the continued violation of this chapter.
   B.   In the event that any person removes, destroys, or damages any public
tree except as otherwise required by law, that person shall be required to
replace such tree with a tree(s) of equivalent dollar value on public property
as determined with accepted plant appraisal methods set forth in the 10th
edition of the Guide for Plant Appraisal published by the International Society
of Arboriculture or the same as may be amended from time- to-time. If no
suitable location exists in the vicinity of the tree removed or if the
replacement tree(s) is of lesser value, the person causing the tree to be
removed shall make a compensatory payment to the City of Chubbuck equal to the
difference in value between the tree removed and any replacement tree(s). Any
public tree that is determined by the City to be damaged, but not sufficiently
to justify its removal, shall be considered to be devalued. The amount of
devaluation shall be paid to the City by the person causing the damage.
Compensatory payments shall be paid into a fund established for that purpose
and restricted to use for community forestry programs. Nothing in this chapter
shall prohibit the City of Chubbuck from negotiating agreements with other
governmental entities regarding penalties and compensatory payment for removal,
damage or destruction of public trees. (Ord. 792, 2019)

time such injury or damage was sustained, was committing a wilful trespass or
other tort upon the premises occupied by the owner of the animal, or was

All such licenses shall be valid for a period of one year from June 1 to May 31
of the following year. It shall be the responsibility of the owner, or
custodian in the absence of the owner, of each and every dog to obtain a new

chief's designee shall furnish with such license a metal tag which shall be
stamped with a number corresponding to the number of such license and the year
for which it is issued. Such tag shall be appended to a collar to be worn by
the dog at all times. If a dog tag is lost or destroyed, a duplicate tag shall
be issued upon a showing of payment of the license fee for the current year and
the payment of one dollar ($1.00) or such fee as from time to time is adopted

   C.   It shall be a condition of the issuance of any dog license that any
police officer or animal control officer shall be permitted to inspect all
dogs, at any reasonable time, and refusal to give permission to such inspection
shall be grounds for revocation of a license which has been issued. (Ord. 314

charges shall be set by resolution as adopted from time to time by the Chubbuck
city council. Charges may be set that double each time an animal is impounded

ANIMALS TO CITY:
   A.   It shall be the duty of the animal control officer to keep, or arrange

(60) hours following the giving of personal notice. If, at the expiration of
such time, such animal shall not have been reclaimed, the animal control
officer may place the animal in a suitable home or cause the animal to be
humanely euthanized. Animals not reclaimed after the expiration of sixty (60)
hours may be released to any person other than the owner desiring to take the
animal and provide it with shelter and care, upon obtaining a license as
provided by this chapter, payment of boarding charges, and an adoption fee set
by resolution as adopted from time to time by the Chubbuck city council. If the
animal is released to any person other than the owner, the person to whom the
animal is released shall be deemed a purchaser of such animal from the city,
and all rights and interest of the former owner in said animal shall terminate.
It shall be unlawful for any owner of an impounded animal to seek the release
of said animal under this section as a way of avoiding the impoundment charges
set forth in the preceding section. Animals cannot be claimed or adopted by a
person under age eighteen (18), unless accompanied by a parent or guardian.

or keeper upon receipt of the fees as set by resolution adopted from time to

manner shall be held for adoption for sixty (60) hours but no notice need be
given to the owner under this section.

found dead within the city limits. Any owner, custodian or keeper of a dead
animal whose carcass is disposed of by the animal control officer shall pay the
city a fee as set from time to time by resolution of the Chubbuck city council
or the actual cost of disposal, whichever is greater, as a fee for the disposal
of the carcass. (Ord. 716, 2012)
9.20.046: DISPOSITION OF IMPOUNDED ANIMALS; HEARING:
   A.   Notwithstanding the provisions of section
9.20.044 of this chapter, the chief of police or the animal control officer,
acting under the direction of the chief of police, may refuse a claim for an
impounded animal which is vicious, which has caused property damage or personal
injury of any kind other than to the owner or the owner's property, which has
been impounded on at least one prior occasion in the preceding twenty four (24)
months, or whose owner or keeper has been issued a citation, on at least one
prior occasion in the preceding twenty four (24) months, because of a violation
of the provisions of this chapter. In such event, the animal shall not be
destroyed if its owner, or other person seeking to claim it, files with the
city clerk during the claim period, a written request that such destruction be
postponed pending review by the city council at its next regular meeting. Such
written request shall be accompanied by payment in the amount which would be
required by the time of the meeting in order to claim the animal as provided in
section
9.20.044 of this chapter.
   B.   When such request and payment have been made, the animal shall not be
destroyed pending a hearing by the city council. When the hearing is conducted,
the person making the request must appear and show good cause why he should be
allowed to claim the animal and how he will care for it in order to avoid
further violations of the provisions of this chapter. Following the hearing,
the city council shall determine whether or not the animal should be destroyed.
   C.   If the council approves the destruction, the animal shall be destroyed
in a humane fashion and the payment made by the party requesting the hearing
shall be retained by the city to defray its costs of impounding the animal
pending the hearing. If the council decides that the animal should not be
destroyed, the animal shall be released from impoundment upon such terms as the
council may reasonably impose; and the payment made by the person requesting
the hearing shall be retained as the fee for claiming the animal. (Ord. 314 §1,
1989)
9.20.047: DETERMINATION OF A VICIOUS ANIMAL:
If the chief of police or the animal control officer has probable cause to
believe that an animal is vicious, the chief of police or his designee, shall
be empowered to convene a hearing for the purpose of determining whether or not
the animal in question should be declared vicious. The animal control officer
or chief of police shall conduct or cause to be conducted an investigation and
shall notify the owner of the animal that a hearing will be held, at which time
he may have the opportunity to present evidence why the animal should not be
declared vicious. The hearing shall be held promptly within no less than five
(5) nor more than ten (10) days after service of notice upon the owner of the
animal. The hearing shall be informal and shall be open to the public.
After the hearing, the owner of the animal shall be notified in writing of the
determination. If a determination is made that the animal is vicious, the owner
shall comply with the provisions of this chapter in accordance with a time
schedule established by the chief of police, but in no case more than thirty
(30) days subsequent to the date of the determination. If the owner of the
animal contests the determination, he may, within five (5) days of such
determination, bring a petition in the magistrate court in the sixth judicial
district of the state of Idaho, in and for the county of Bannock, wherein the
animal is owned, praying that the court conduct its own hearing on whether or
not the animal should be declared vicious. After service of notice upon the
city the court shall conduct a hearing de novo and make its own determination
as to viciousness. Said hearing shall be conducted within fourteen (14) days of
the service of the notice upon the city. The issue shall be decided upon the
preponderance of the evidence. If the court rules the animal to be vicious, the
court may establish a time schedule to ensure compliance with this chapter, but
in no case more than thirty (30) days subsequent to the date of the court's
determination.
The court may decide all issues for or against the owner of the animal
regardless of the fact that said owner fails to appear at said hearing.
The determination of the magistrate court shall be final and conclusive upon
all parties thereto. However, the chief of police or animal control officer
shall have the right to declare an animal to be vicious for any subsequent
actions of the animal.
If the chief of police or the animal control officer or the designees have
probable cause to believe that the animal in question is vicious and may pose a
threat of serious harm to human beings or other domestic animals, the animal
control officer or law enforcement officer may seize and impound the animal
pending the aforesaid hearings. The owner of the animal shall be liable to the
city for the costs and expenses of impoundment of such animal. (Ord. 314 §1,
1989)
9.20.048: IMPOUNDMENT FACILITY:
The mayor is authorized to provide for the creation and maintenance of one or
more facilities capable of providing animal impoundment services. In addition,
or in the alternative, with the concurrence of a majority of the council, the
mayor may enter on behalf of the city into an intergovernmental agreement with
any other public entity for the provision of such services. (Ord. 314 §1, 1989)
9.20.050: QUARANTINE:
Any animal which bites any person shall be quarantined for ten (10) days if
ordered by the animal control officer. At the discretion of the animal control
officer, the quarantine may be on the premises of the owner. The owner shall be
responsible for all costs of quarantine. Such animal shall be securely confined
within an enclosure from which it cannot escape and which is not accessible to
the public. The animal control officer shall maintain a record of every animal
which bites a person without provocation. (Ord. 314 §1, 1989)
9.20.051: DESTRUCTION OF DISEASED ANIMALS:
Any animal which has bitten any person and, after examination by a
veterinarian, is found to have rabies or other disease rendering said animal
dangerous to persons, shall be destroyed. (Ord. 314 §1, 1989)
9.20.060: CRIMINAL PENALTIES:
The violation of any provision of this chapter shall be a misdemeanor. (Ord.
630 §1, 2006)

domestic animal, belonging to or in the possession of any person, or shall,
when unprovoked, attack, assault, bite or otherwise injure any human being or
assist in attacking, assaulting, biting or otherwise injuring any human being
while out of or within the enclosure of the owner or keeper of such vicious
animal, or while otherwise on or off the property of the owner whether or not
such vicious animal was on a leash and securely muzzled or whether the vicious
animal escaped without fault of the owner or keeper, the owner or keeper of
such animal shall be liable to the person aggrieved as aforesaid, for all
damage sustained, to be recovered in a civil action, with costs of suit. It is
rebuttably presumed as a matter of law that the owning, keeping or harboring of
a vicious animal in violation of this chapter is a nuisance. It shall not be
necessary, in order to sustain any such action, to prove that the owner of such
vicious animal knew that such vicious animal possessed the propensity to cause
such damage or that the vicious animal had a vicious nature. Upon such attack
or assault, the police or the animal control officer in the city is hereby

9.20.090: COMPLIANCE WITH ZONING PROVISIONS; FACILITY STANDARDS:
   A.   No livestock shall be kept on property less than fifteen thousand
(15,000) square feet in size, if such property was subdivided after September
1972. A preceding ordinance provided for phase out of nonconforming animals
over a period of one year from September 1972.
   B.   Livestock may be kept on property of fifteen thousand (15,000) square
feet or more, but less than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet in size, if:
      1.   The property was zoned for livestock under Chubbuck ordinance 98.
      2.   The owner of the property is and has continuously been the same
owner since the passage of ordinance 98 in 1971.
      3.   The owner of the property has kept livestock upon the property since
the passage of ordinance 98 in 1971 with no continuous period of livestock
being not on the property of greater than twelve (12) months. Sale or leasing
for a period of greater than one year of said property or failure to have
livestock upon the property for a period greater than twelve (12) months by the
owner of the property at the time of passage of ordinance 98 in 1971 will
result in the loss of right to have livestock upon the property.
Livestock on the property in the above circumstances is a nonconforming use. If
the property is sold by the individual who owned the property at the time of
passage of ordinance 98 in 1971 or if that owner of the property fails to have
livestock upon the property for a period of greater than twelve (12) months,
then the permitted nonconforming use of the property for purposes of keeping
livestock terminates.
   C.   Two (2) or more platted lots in a subdivision cannot be combined to
attain a twenty thousand (20,000) square foot or greater parcel of property for

   E.   All pens or corrals required under section
9.20.080 of this chapter and all sheds, stables, coops or other structures used
for keeping animals, shall be located not less than fifty feet (50') from any
structure used for human habitation. Fences or pens, corrals or similar
enclosures must be of sufficient height and strength to retain the animals. All
structures, including sheds, corrals and stables, shall be constructed and
maintained in a manner consistent with the structures located on surrounding
properties. Standings under roofed stables or sheds, and pens or corrals, shall

breeding and other nuisances.

apply to animals being treated or kept at a duly licensed veterinary hospital
or commercial kennel, nor shall they apply to special and temporary events such
as rodeos and livestock expositions.

chapter shall be the joint and several obligation of the owner of the property
where the animal in question is located and of the owner or person having
charge of the animal.
   H.   All zoning provisions of title 18 of this code in general and section
18.08.040 of this code in particular shall be followed. Any conditional use
permits, if required, shall be acquired prior to the placement of livestock in
any area. (Ord. 322 §2, 1989: Ord. 314 §1, 1989)
9.20.100: FEES FOR GENERAL ANIMAL CONTROL:

   C.   Quarantine of an animal after a bite;
   D.   Adoption of a cat or dog; and
   E.   Such other animal control services for which the city council may enact
a fee. (Ord. 716, 2012)
9.20.110: CHICKENS:
Notwithstanding any of the provision of this chapter, the keeping of not more
than six (6) domestic hen chickens (but no roosters) is permitted within the
rear yard of any single-family dwelling or duplex located in a residential
zone, provided the following requirements are observed:
   A.   Such hens shall not be slaughtered on the premises or raised or sold
for slaughter or pecuniary gain or profit.
   B.   For the purposes of this section, the term "rear yard" means a
residential yard lying between the rear lot line and the nearest foundation
line of the main building and extending across the full width of the lot. In
the case of a corner lot where the building fronts on a side street, the rear
yard may be established from the rear of the house to the side property line.
   C.   Chickens shall be kept in an enclosed area within fences, corrals,
barns, pens, coops, or other similar enclosure which shall serve to contain
them, both on the sides and from flying out the top.

   E.   Chickens shall be kept so as to not cause adverse impacts on
neighboring properties. This includes, but is not limited to, such impacts as
odor, noise, drainage, erosion, and insects. The presence of such impacts can
constitute a public nuisance that the city may cause to be abated. (Ord. 719,
2013)
9.20.120: BEES:
Bees shall not be considered "animals" or "livestock" as defined in this
chapter and the keeping of the same shall be governed by the provisions of this
code regarding nuisances. (Ord. 719, 2013)

GRAFFITI REMOVAL
SECTION:
9.28.010: Graffiti Deemed Nuisance
9.28.020: Definitions
9.28.030: Graffiti Prohibited
9.28.040: Graffiti; Notice Of Removal

9.28.010: GRAFFITI DEEMED NUISANCE:
   A.   Graffiti and other defacement of public and private property, including
walls, rocks, bridges, buildings, fences, gates and other structures, trees,
and other real and personal property within the city constitutes a nuisance.
   B.   Although it is appropriate, where possible, to request that the courts
require people who are convicted of acts of defacement and vandalism involving
application of graffiti to public or private property to restore the property
so defaced, damaged or destroyed, obtaining convictions for such acts is
difficult because the offenses involved can be committed so very quickly and
secretively that witnesses to the acts are frequently nonexistent.
   C.   Although the public should be encouraged to cooperate in the
elimination of graffiti by reporting the same to proper authorities, it is also
important to eliminate the presence of graffiti from the community so that the
product of illegal acts of those involved in application of graffiti is not
visible and the property on which the graffiti is located and surrounding
properties do not suffer diminution of value. (Ord. 394 §1, 1993)
9.28.020: DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this chapter, the following words shall have the following
meanings:
GRAFFITI: The defacing, damaging or destroying by spraying of paint or marking
of ink, chalk, dye or other similar substances on public or private buildings,
structures and places, not including markings placed by authorized personnel
for utility, police or other authorized purposes.

graffiti, issues notice to the landowner to abate the graffiti, and cures in
absence of response.

remove graffiti. (Ord. 394 §1, 1993)
9.28.030: GRAFFITI PROHIBITED:

rock, bridge, building, fence, gate, or other structure, tree, or other real or
personal property, either publicly or privately owned, any drawing,

as "graffiti" within the city. (Ord. 394 §1, 1993)
9.28.040: GRAFFITI; NOTICE OF REMOVAL:
   A.   Whenever the police chief or the chief's designated representative
determines that graffiti exists on public or private buildings, structures and
places which are visible to any person utilizing any public road, parkway,

temperatures permit the painting of exterior surfaces, the police chief or the
chief's designated representative shall cause a notice to be issued to abate
such nuisance. The property owner shall have fifteen (15) days after the date

Idaho. If there is no known address for the owner, the notice shall be sent in
care of the property address. The notice required by this section may be served
in any one of the following manners:
      1.   By personal service on the owner, occupant or person in charge or
control of the property.
      2.   By registered or certified mail addressed to the owner at the last
known address of said owner. If this address is unknown, the notice will be
sent to the property address.
      3.   The notice shall be substantially in the following form:
               Notice of Intent to Remove Graffiti
   Date:
 
To:
   NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that you are required, by ordinance of the City of
Chubbuck, at your own expense, to remove or paint over the graffiti located on
the property commonly known as  (address) , Chubbuck, Idaho, which is visible
to public view, within fifteen (15) days after the date of this notice; or, if
you fail to do so, the City requires the nuisance to be abated by removal or
painting over of the graffiti. The cost of the abatement by the City or private
contractors employed by the City to abate the nuisance will be assessed upon
your property pursuant to Idaho Code §50-1008 and such costs will constitute a
lien upon the property until paid.
   All persons having any objection to, or interest in said matters, are hereby
notified to submit any objections or comments to the Police Chief of the City
of Chubbuck or the Chief's designated representative, within ten (10) days from

9.28.060: APPEAL:
Within ten (10) days from the mailing or from personal service of the notice of
intent to remove graffiti, the owner or person occupying or controlling the

by the city to abate the graffiti nuisance. (Ord. 394 §1, 1993)
9.28.070: REMOVAL BY CITY:
   A.   Upon failure of persons to comply with the notice by the designated
date, or such continued date thereafter as the police chief or the chief's
designated representative approves, the police chief is authorized and directed
to cause the graffiti to be abated by city forces or by private contract, and
the city or its private contractor is expressly authorized to enter upon the
premises for such purposes. All reasonable efforts to minimize damage from such
entry shall be taken by the city, and any paint used to obliterate or cover
graffiti shall be as close as practicable to background color(s). If the police
chief provides for the removal of the graffiti, the chief shall not authorize
nor undertake to provide for the painting or repair of any more extensive area
than the area where the graffiti is located.

disturb or interfere with the peace, comfort and repose of owners or possessors
of real property;
      4.   The creation of frequent, repetitive or continuous sounds which
emanate from any building, structure, apartment, or condominium, which
unreasonably interfere with the peace, comfort, and repose of owners or
possessors of real property, such as sounds from audio equipment, musical
instruments, band sessions, or social gatherings;

CHAPTER 9.34
AGGRESSIVE SOLICITATION
SECTION:
9.34.010: Findings And Intent
9.34.020: Definitions
9.34.030: Prohibited Acts
9.34.040: Penalties
9.34.050: Construction And Severability
9.34.010: FINDINGS AND INTENT:
   A.   The council finds that aggressive solicitation throughout the city has
become or may become extremely disturbing and disruptive to residents and
businesses, and has contributed or may contribute not only to the loss of
access to and enjoyment of public places, but also to an enhanced sense of
fear, intimidation and disorder.
   B.   Aggressive solicitation usually includes approaching or following
pedestrians, repetitive soliciting despite refusals, the use of abusive or
profane language to cause fear and intimidation, unwanted physical contact, or
the intentional blocking of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. The council
further finds that the presence of individuals who solicit money from persons
at or near banks, automated teller machines, or in public transportation
vehicles is especially troublesome because of the enhanced fear of crime in
those confined environments. Motorists may also find themselves confronted by
persons seeking money who, without permission, wash their automobile windows at
traffic intersections, despite explicit indications by drivers not to do so.
Such activity carries with it an implicit threat to both persons and property.
   C.   The council is enacting this chapter pursuant to its police power and
statutory authority as set forth in Idaho Code title 50. This law is timely and
appropriate because current laws and city regulations are insufficient to
address the aforementioned problems.
   D.   The law is not intended to limit any persons from exercising their
constitutional right to solicit funds, picket, protest or engage in other
constitutionally protected activity. Rather, its goal is to protect citizens
from the fear and intimidation accompanying certain kinds of solicitation that
have become an unwelcome and overwhelming presence in the city. (Ord. 494 §1,
1998)
9.34.020: DEFINITIONS:
For purposes of this chapter:
AGGRESSIVE MANNER: Means and includes:
   A.   Intentionally or recklessly making any physical contact with or

city park in which the current violation occurred for a period not exceeding

should not be enforced. The exclusion shall be stayed upon filing of a notice
of appeal. The City Council shall hear the appeal at the second regular council
meeting following the date the appeal is filed with the City Clerk. The City

dedicated public right of way areas and shall extend the full length of the
frontage of the property being served. The city may require or allow water
mains to be installed in utility easements if it is deemed necessary for the
good of the water delivery system. All water main extensions/installations
shall conform in all respects to the standards, specifications, and material
requirements set forth in this chapter.
   C.   No such installation shall be deemed complete until inspected,
approved, and accepted by the public works department for maintenance by the
city; provided, however, that final acceptance shall not occur until the city
council has adopted an acceptance of offer of dedication certificate for
subdivision developments or other similar certificate for installations not in
such developments. Thereafter, the water mains shall be considered to have been
dedicated to the city by said person as part of the public water system and
shall be maintained by the city.
   D.   All water main extensions and appurtenant equipment which have been
installed in private roadways or property, shall be and remain the private
property of the persons, their heirs, successors or assigns, owning said
property, and shall be maintained by them, unless a specific written agreement
with the city makes other provisions. Provided, however, that the director may
authorize repair or maintenance work by the water department on private
sections only in an emergency situation where the public welfare may be
endangered. (Ord. 744, 2015)
13.08.230: WATER SUPPLY CONSERVATION AND PROTECTION:
The following sections are intended to maximize the ability of the city to
provide an adequate water supply for essential services in time of drought,
natural disasters, or other emergencies. All persons whose premises are
connected to city water service shall be required to comply with regulations
set out below during a declared period of water shortage or water emergency.
(Ord. 744, 2015)
13.08.240: DETERMINATION OF NECESSITY FOR DECLARATION:
The public works department shall maintain records and monitor conditions and
resources to enable the city to plan for and provide water to consumers using
the city's water system. Whenever, in the estimation of the department, those
conditions are approaching the level of a water shortage, the director shall
provide a report to so inform the mayor, who may then choose to issue a
declaration of water shortage which will impose those conditions and
restrictions on water usage as set out hereinafter. The report of the director
could include an evaluation of any or all of the following criteria: current
aquifer levels; available groundwater supply; operational condition of city
wells; current storage tank levels; the rate of decline in aquifer levels
compared with the normal operating levels; projected weather conditions as
derived from short and long term weather forecasts; whether prior weather
conditions over the previous year(s) have been particularly dry with lower than
normal rain and snow fall quantities; whether total aquifer storage is
significantly below historical "normal" levels for the current time of year,
and whether data strongly indicate that expected demands may not be met if this
trend continues and/or worsens; whether current operating conditions would
limit the city's ability to provide water; the occurrence of an extended power
failure which limits the city's ability to operate its facilities; and any
state or federally imposed water restrictions which require the city to reduce
the amount of water withdrawn from the aquifer. In the event that an emergency
exists or is imminent the public works department shall so inform the mayor
immediately. (Ord. 744, 2015)
13.08.250: DECLARATION OF SHORTAGE OR EMERGENCY; EFFECT:
In the event the mayor reasonably determines that the situation warrants the
declaration of a water shortage or water emergency, the mayor is authorized to
make an official declaration thereof and to suggest or impose any or all of the
restrictions set forth hereinafter which he deems necessary to safeguard the
safety and health of the general public. The mayor or his/her designee shall
issue a public notification of the declaration which shall specify the nature
and extent of the restrictions. In the event of a declaration of critical water
shortage the restrictions will take effect twenty four (24) hours after
notification. For a water emergency the restrictions shall take effect
immediately upon issuance of the public notification. Notice shall be deemed
given by means of newspaper, radio, television, and internet announcements and
a notice posted on the city's website if operational. The mayor may provide
such other notices as he deems useful. The city clerk shall immediately
transmit the order to the city council and shall make the same available for
public inspection. Alleged lack of notice shall not relieve a water consumer
from the duty to abide by the restrictions. Each order shall have the full
force and effect of law until terminated by the mayor. (Ord. 744, 2015)
13.08.260: CATEGORIES AND RESTRICTIONS FOR SHORTAGE AND EMERGENCIES:
   A.   Minor Shortage; Voluntary Restrictions: If the mayor declares a minor
water shortage, he shall accompany the declaration with a list of recommended
water conservation measures, which shall not be required, but are voluntary on
the part of the consumers. The public works department is hereby authorized to
conduct an intensified public information campaign to encourage such voluntary
conservation measures. Such measures may include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      1.   Discontinuing direct hosing of sidewalks, walkways, driveways,
parking lots, patios, and other exterior paved or prepared surface areas,
except as may be necessary to remove or prevent accumulation of conditions or
materials dangerous to the public health and safety.
      2.   Discontinuing noncommercial washing of privately owned motor
vehicles, trailers, and boats, unless accomplished by using limited amounts of
water through use of a bucket of water for washing and a hose with an automatic
shutoff nozzle for rapid rinsing.
      3.   Discontinuing operation of sprinkler and irrigation systems between
the hours of ten o'clock (10:00) A.M. and six o'clock (6:00) P.M.
      4.   Discontinuing operation of sprinkler and irrigation systems outside
of a suggested conservation rotation schedule.
      5.   Careful and regular monitoring of water use and private water
service and distribution lines to prevent loss of water through leaks or breaks
within the private service or distribution lines.
      6.   Prevention of overspray from irrigation systems beyond the area
intended for watering and prevention of runoff beyond the intended area.
      7.   Discontinuing automatic serving of tap water at restaurants unless
requested by patrons.
   B.   Critical Water Shortage; Mandatory Restrictions: In the event that the
public works department determines that the water shortage is approaching a
critical stage, the department shall prepare a report for the mayor detailing
the problem. The mayor may then declare a critical water shortage and provide
notice to the public of the restrictions being imposed, which may include any
or all of the items set forth above as he/she deems most useful in maintaining
the necessary water supply.
   C.   Water Emergency; Restrictions And Rationing:
      1.   Mandatory Restrictions: In the event that maximum flow reduction is
immediately required, the mayor shall issue a declaration of water emergency,
and may prohibit all nonessential uses of water or impose any other
restrictions he deems appropriate to attempt to maintain a supply of water for
essential services.
      2.   Disaster; Water Rationing: In the event of a local or regional
disaster, the water supply may be jeopardized to the extent that all available
water is needed solely for human consumption, sanitation, and fire protection.
In such circumstances, the mayor may also implement water rationing measures
and emergency water distribution may be necessary for customers without water.
Residential users may be restricted to a certain number of gallons per day per
person residing within the dwelling unit and the amount of water used by
nonresidential users may be restricted to a percentage of their historical
usage as deemed appropriate by the mayor, and/or by any other type of rationing
as he deems necessary and appropriate in the circumstances. The public works
and utility billing departments shall disseminate information to consumers
regarding the rationing plan. (Ord. 744, 2015)
13.08.270: WATER RESTRICTIONS; EXCEPTIONS:
The mayor is further authorized to make exceptions to such restrictions in
specific cases as he/she finds reasonable when necessary to alleviate
unnecessary economic hardship to commercial or industrial activities, or to
prevent possible damage to health, safety or welfare. Such exceptions may
include, but are not limited to, the following:
   A.   Outdoor watering between the hours of twelve o'clock (12:00) midnight
and twelve o'clock (12:00) noon by a bucket not exceeding a capacity of five
(5) gallons, filled without the use of a hose;
   B.   The use of water for construction, commercial or processing purposes;
   C.   The use of water by the person, firm or corporation installing or
repairing sprinkler or irrigation systems for the purposes of testing such
installation or repair; provided, however, that such test shall not exceed two
(2) minutes in duration;
   D.   Any watering or sprinkling with water obtained from a noncity well,
provided that the premises have posted in a conspicuous location upon the
premises a sign stating that noncity well water is being so used. It shall be a
violation of this chapter for any person to post a sign which states or implies
that noncity well water is being used when water is obtained from the water
system of the city;
   E.   The washing of automobiles, trucks, trailers, boats, airplanes or other
types of mobile equipment upon the immediate premises of commercial car washes,
commercial service stations and the washing of commercial motor vehicles used
in the transportation of food, food products and perishables, and the washing
of commercial garbage pick up motor vehicles;
   F.   The watering by commercial nurseries, commercial landscaping companies
and commercial sod farmers with water obtained from their own immediate
premises;
   G.   The watering or sprinkling of foundations of homes or apartments; and
   H.   The use of water to alleviate immediate fire, health or safety hazards.
(Ord. 744, 2015)
13.08.280: VIOLATIONS; ISSUANCE OF INFRACTION CITATIONS:
It is unlawful for any person to violate water use restrictions imposed under
this chapter, unless an exception in writing has been granted by the mayor.
Violation of these provisions shall be an infraction, punishable as provided by
the Idaho Code for nonmoving infractions. Each violation of restrictions issued
under this chapter may result in issuance of a separate infraction citation.
Upon the issuance of the third infraction violation for an account, the utility
billing department is authorized to terminate water service to the premises.
All fees set by city council resolution shall be charged, and water service
shall not be reinstated until all fees have been paid in full.
In the event that repeated violations at the same premises are noted during the
term of any declaration hereunder, and if the police are unable to make contact
with the responsible party due to what appears to be deliberate avoidance of
service rather than absence from the jurisdiction, after the third such
documented instance of violation, the police shall contact the utility billing
department, and the supervisor of that department shall arrange for water
service to the premises to be terminated. All fees set by city council
resolution shall be charged, and water services shall not be reinstated until
all fees have been paid in full. (Ord. 744, 2015)
13.08.290: BILLS, PAYMENTS AND ADJUSTMENTS:
Any bill for water supplied or service rendered will be considered a proper
charge unless protest is made to the water department within ten (10) days
after presentation of the bill. Adjustment will only be allowed when evidence
clearly shows that the excessive charge is due to leaking pipes or fixtures and
not wasteful use and then only when repairs have been made and reported to the
water department within thirty (30) days of leak notification. No allowances
will be made covering more than two (2) consecutive billing periods, including
the billing period in which the protest was made. Adjustments will be made on
the basis of one-half (1/2) of the excess delivery due to leakage during two
(2) consecutive billing periods. No more than one allowance will be made to the
same customer for the same premises in any twelve (12) month period. The city
clerk or the clerk's designee acting with the approval of the mayor shall be
the sole judge in determining the excess consumption due to leakage. (Ord. 744,
2015)
13.08.300: NONMETERED SERVICE PROHIBITED:
No water will be delivered through unmetered services. (Ord. 744, 2015)
13.08.310: CHARGES; COMPUTATION:
   A.   Where an individual consumer is supplied with water through more than
one metered service, charges shall be computed separately for each individual
meter.
   B.   Where more than one individual consumer is supplied with water through
one meter, the individual who applies for service shall be responsible for all
charges, and the bill shall be computed as though there were a separate metered
service for each individual consumer and each used an equal quantity of the
water consumed, and there shall be no deduction for vacant premises. Such
charges for more than one premises supplied through one meter shall be optional
with the water department, which may at its discretion discontinue service in
order to force the installation of separate metered services for each
individual consumer. (Ord. 744, 2015)
13.08.320: CHARGES; DUE DATES AND DELINQUENT PENALTY:
All charges for water service shall be due at the office of the city treasurer
as follows:
   A.   Water rent shall be due and payable on the first of each month and must
be paid on or before the fifteenth of each and every month.
   B.   The city council may by resolution divide the municipality into
subdistricts and require the water rent for each subdistrict to be due and
payable upon a different date of the month. Such resolution and due dates of
water rent may be altered, from time to time, at the discretion of the city
council, provided all water rent in any such subdistrict shall become due and
payable on the same date for all users within that subdistrict upon appropriate
notice placed upon the water bill or otherwise to the user of any change in the
due date for water rent. (Ord. 744, 2015)
13.08.330: CONNECTION FEES:
The administrative fee for service connections and other services provided from
time to time by the city to customers shall be set by resolution of the
Chubbuck city council as from time to time adopted.
Service connections and other services rendered by the city shall be charged on
the basis of materials used and labor, plus overhead expenses, in addition to
the administrative fee set by resolution of the city council. The charge for a
service connection shall be determined by the public works director or his
designee; provided, however, a minimum service charge may be set for routine
jobs. (Ord. 744, 2015)
13.08.340: SEVERABILITY:
The provisions of this chapter are severable. If any section, subsection,
sentence, clause, phrase, part or portion of this chapter is for any reason
held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction,
such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portion of this
chapter. (Ord. 744, 2015)

13.12.050: Installation Permits
13.12.060: Use Of Backflow Prevention Devices
13.12.070: Remedies
13.12.010: PURPOSE AND SCOPE:
The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health of water consumers
by the control of actual and/or potential cross connections. This chapter shall
apply throughout the city and in all other areas served by or connected to the
municipal water system. (Ord. 222 §1, 1980)
13.12.020: DEFINITIONS:
BACKFLOW: The flow, other than the intended direction of flow, of any foreign
liquids, gases or substances into the distribution system of a public water
supply.
CONTAMINATION: The entry into or presence in a public water supply of any
substance which may be deleterious to public health and/or to the quality of
water.
CROSS CONNECTION: Any physical arrangement whereby a public water supply is
connected, directly or indirectly, with any other water supply system, sewer,
drain, conduit, pool, storage reservoir, plumbing fixture, or other device
which contains or may contain contaminated water, sewage, or other waste or
liquids of unknown or unsafe quality which may be capable of imparting
contamination to the public water supply as a result of backflow.
PUBLIC WATER SUPPLY: The Chubbuck municipal water system or any other system
connected to it which is intended to supply water for human consumption or
other domestic uses, including source, treatment storage, transmission and
distribution facilities. (Ord. 222 §2, 1980)
13.12.030: REQUIRED:
No water service connection from the public water supply to any premises shall
be installed or continued in use unless the water supply is protected against
cross connections as required by this chapter. The installation or maintenance
of any cross connection, which may endanger the quality of the public water
supply is unlawful and punishable as provided in this chapter. Any such cross
connection now existing or hereafter installed is declared to be a public
nuisance. The control or elimination of cross connections shall be subject to
direction of the city engineer, who is authorized to enforce the ordinance
codified in this chapter and to establish reasonable time periods for
compliance in cases of existing cross connections. The city engineer may, from
time to time, with approval of the city council set forth by resolution,
promulgate regulations for the implementation of this chapter and adopt
regulations or manuals of standard practice from recognized public health
authorities, consistent with this chapter. (Ord. 222 §3, 1980)
13.12.040: INSPECTIONS:
   A.   No water shall be delivered by the city to any structure where there is
evidence that a cross connection may exist or to any water supply system
serving the structure, until that structure has been determined by the city
engineer to be free of known cross connections.
   B.   The city engineer or his designee(s) is authorized to make such
periodic inspections of structures or water systems receiving water from the
public water supply as he may deem appropriate for the purpose of ascertaining
whether cross connections exist. It is unlawful for any person to deny
reasonable access to any premises for such inspections. Such inspections shall
include (without limitation) the premises of all commercial and industrial
water users in existence at the time of enactment of the ordinance codified in
this chapter.
   C.   The city building official may assist the city engineer or his designee
(s) in such inspections. Prior to issuing any building permit, the city
building official shall notify the city engineer if, in his judgment, a
proposed structure presents substantial potential for the creation of a cross
connection. No building permit shall be issued until the city engineer has
determined that such a cross connection is unlikely or that adequate measures
to prevent a cross connection are proposed, consistent with this chapter. (Ord.
222 §4, 1980)
13.12.050: INSTALLATION PERMITS:
If any cross connection control devices are found by the city engineer to be
necessary the owner of the premises shall apply in writing to the city engineer
for an installation permit, specifying the type and location of such device(s).
Such application and permit may be evidenced by correspondence or memorandum.
No charge shall be imposed for the permit. It is unlawful to install such a
device without a permit, or to remove any such device without written
authorization of the city engineer. (Ord. 222 §5, 1980)
13.12.060: USE OF BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICES:
   A.   The use of backflow prevention devices shall be consistent with
regulations adopted by the city engineer and approved by the city council, as
provided in this chapter.
   B.   Backflow prevention devices shall be installed by the owner of the
premises, at his expense, where the city engineer reasonably determines that
the nature and extent of activities on the premises, or the materials used or
stored on the premises, could present a hazard to health and/or could adversely
affect the quality of water in the public water supply system if a cross
connection should occur. Regardless of whether cross connections are known or
found actually to exist, backflow prevention devices shall be installed under
circumstances including (without limitation):
      1.   Premises having an auxiliary water supply;
      2.   Premises having internal cross connections that cannot be readily
corrected, or having intricate plumbing arrangements making it impracticable to
determine whether cross connections exist;
      3.   Premises where entry is so restricted that inspections cannot be
made with adequate frequency or upon short notice to determine whether cross
connections exist;
      4.   Premises having a history of existence or reestablishment of cross
connections;
      5.   Premises on which any substance is handled under pressure so as to
permit entry into the public water supply, or as to allow a cross connection to
occur. Such premises shall include (without limitation) those where process
waters or cooling waters are handled or used;
      6.   Premises where toxic or hazardous substances are handled in such a
way as to result in danger to health or the quality of water in the public
supply system if a cross connection occurred.
   C.   The city engineer shall approve the device selected and shall inspect
its installation. Selection shall take account of the degree of potential
hazard and availability of qualified maintenance services.
   D.   An air gap separation or a reduced pressure principal backflow
prevention device shall be installed where the public water supply may be
contaminated with sewage, industrial waste of a toxic nature, or other
contaminant which could cause a health or system hazard.
   E.   In the case of a substance which may be objectionable but not hazardous
to health, a double check valve assembly, air gap separation, or a reduced
pressure principal backflow prevention device shall be installed.
   F.   Backflow prevention devices required by this chapter shall be installed
at the meter, at the property line of the premises when meters are not used, or
at a location designated by the city engineer. Each device shall be located so
as to be readily accessible for maintenance and testing.
   G.   Backflow prevention devices installed pursuant to this chapter, except
atmospheric vacuum breakers, shall be inspected and tested annually, or more
often if deemed necessary by the city engineer. Inspections, tests and
maintenance shall be conducted at the property owner's expense. Whenever the
devices are found to be defective, they shall be repaired, overhauled, or
replaced at the owner's expense. Inspections, tests, repairs and records
thereof shall be accomplished by certified testers and written test reports
forwarded to the city engineer.
   H.   No sprinkling device will be installed without adequate backflow
prevention devices at the point from which the water is taken from the public
water supply.
   I.   At any construction site or other location where it is reasonable to
anticipate intermittent cross connections, one or more backflow prevention
devices shall be installed at the point(s) of service from the public water
supply, or at any other location designated by the city engineer. (Ord. 222 §6,
1980)
13.12.070: REMEDIES:
   A.   In the event that a cross connection is created or found to exist, and
is not promptly corrected following written notice from the city engineer, or
in the event the city is refused access to any property for the purpose of
determining whether or not cross connections exist, the city may:
      1.   Abate any nuisance at the owner's expense,
      2.   Terminate water service until the cross connection is satisfactorily
corrected and any water service resumption fee imposed by ordinance has been
paid,
      3.   Bring a civil action for injunctive or other relief, and/or
      4.   Commence a criminal prosecution.
   B.   Violation of this chapter by the property owner or any person managing
or controlling the premises shall be punishable as a misdemeanor and each day
that violation exists shall constitute a separate offense.
   C.   In any proceeding to enforce this chapter, the court shall be
authorized to award the city its costs, including a reasonable attorney fee.

13.16.080: NOTICE OF INSPECTION:
Notice shall be given the approving authority by any person desiring to make
connection with any public sewer at least five (5) hours previous to the time
of making such connection, stating when such work will be ready for inspection.
The connection must be made to the satisfaction of the approving authority
before the trench is filled. When any person desires to lay or drive any pipe
in a street, alley or easement in which a public or private sewer is laid, he
shall give at least twenty four (24) hours' notice to the approving authority.
(Ord. 251 §12, 1984)
13.16.090: RIGHT TO ENTER PREMISES FOR INSPECTION:
   A.   The approving authority shall have the right to enter upon any premises
connected with any public sewer at all reasonable hours to determine that there
is compliance with the provisions of this chapter. If conflict is noted, the
owner of said premises or his agent shall be directed to alter, repair or
reconstruct to conform to the requirements of this chapter within fifteen (15)
days.
   B.   The owner or occupant of a house, building or property shall allow the
approving authority at all reasonable hours to inspect the nature of wastewater
discharging into a public sewer. The approving authority shall be permitted to
enter all properties for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement,
sampling and testing, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord.
251 §15, 1984)
13.16.100: PRIVATE SEWER REPAIR; PERMIT REQUIRED:
   A.   When any private sewer connected with any public sewer becomes
obstructed, broken or out of order, the owner, agent or tenant of such premises
shall repair same at the owner's expense. This cost shall include the service
tap or connection to the main public sewer as well as the total length of
service line or private sewer from such service tap or connection to the point
at which sewage is introduced into the service for the premises. This cost
shall also include the replacement of street, curb and gutter, sidewalk or any
other improvement disturbed by the repair of any private sewer or service
connection. No person shall construct, relay, repair or extend any private
sewer until the person making the same shall obtain a private sewer permit from
the proper issuing agency or department of the city.
   B.   It shall be unlawful for any person to extend any private sewer beyond
the limits of the building or property for which a permit has been given
without obtaining an additional permit for the desired extension. The existence
of a private sewer permit shall in no way be construed as making permissible
any work for which an excavation permit may be required as set forth in this
code. (Ord. 251 §10, 1984)
13.16.110: PROHIBITED DISCHARGES TO SANITARY SEWER:

liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, high concentration of
blood, fruit, vegetable or grain liquors, milk wastes, sand, and other harmful
ingredients. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the
approving authority and shall be so located as to be readily accessible for
cleaning and inspection. Where installed, all grease, oil and sand interceptors
shall be maintained by the owner or occupant, at his expense, in continuously
efficient operation at all times. (Ord. 251 §8, 1984)
13.16.140: RIGHT TO REVOKE PERMISSION:
Permission given to connect sewers and drains shall be upon the express
condition that the approving authority may at any time revoke the same and the
person making such connection, or his successor in interest, shall have no
right to claim any damage in consequence of such permission being revoked. Once
service has been connected, permission to connect may be revoked and water/
sewer service suspended for any violation of this chapter. (Ord. 251 §13, 1984)
13.16.150: NOTICE, HEARING:
   A.   Written notice of such revocation of permission shall be served or
mailed at least seven (7) days prior to suspending water/sewer service. Such
notice shall state the date on which service is to be suspended and the right
to request in writing a pretermination hearing. In the event water service has
not begun, notice shall be sent in accordance with this section and no water
service shall be started. This hearing will be held before the director of
public works, or in his/her absence, the mayor; provided, said written request
is received by the public works director at least one day prior to the proposed
suspension date.
   B.   Upon receipt of such a timely request, the director of public works, or
the mayor shall give written notice to the party requesting the hearing as to
the date, time and place of said hearing, which hearing shall be held not
sooner than five (5) days from date of request. The director of public works or
mayor shall make a record of any pretermination hearing which either of them
conducts and shall within ten (10) days of the hearing render a decision in
writing, giving reasons for the determination.
   C.   In the absence of a request for a pretermination hearing or if an
adverse decision is rendered against the party requesting the hearing, the city
shall revoke permission to connect sewers and drains and shall not begin and/or
reinstate water service. Permission to connect sewers and drains shall not be
reinstated until the violation(s) has/have been corrected and the person(s)
seeking permission to connect is again complying with this chapter. (Ord. 251
§13, 1984)
13.16.160: SPECIAL AGREEMENTS:
No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as prohibiting any
special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial user
whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be admitted to
the wastewater treatment facility provided that there is no impairment of the
functioning of the wastewater treatment facilities by reason of the admission
of such wastes, and no extra costs are incurred by the city without recompense
by the person; except that no agreement or arrangement will relieve the
industrial user of obligation under pretreatment regulations 40 CFR 403 or any
promulgated categorical pretreatment standards. (Ord. 251 §7, 1984)
13.16.170: INJURY TO SEWERAGE SYSTEM UNLAWFUL:

13.18.040: DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTES PROHIBITED:
The discharge of toxic or hazardous wastes as defined in section 1004 of the
resource conservation and recovery act (RCRA) into the POTW is prohibited,
including discharge to the headworks of the treatment plant by truck, dedicated
pipeline or rail. (Ord. 338 §1, 1990)
13.18.050: OTHER PROHIBITED DISCHARGES:
Waste haulers are also prohibited from discharging wastes into the POTW with
the following characteristics, as set forth in 40 CFR 403.5(b):
   A.   Pollutants that will create a fire or explosion hazard.
   B.   Pollutants that will cause corrosive structural damage, and in no case

that will cause interference with the operation of the POTW.
   D.   Oxygen demanding pollutants discharged at a concentration or volume
that will cause interference with the operation of the POTW.
   E.   Heat in amounts that will inhibit biological activity at the POTW; in
no case should discharges cause POTW influent to exceed one hundred four
degrees Fahrenheit (104°F).
   F.   Any other type of waste that may not be treatable by the public sewer
system, or which will interfere with the operation of the public sewer system,
including oil and grease, or radioactive wastes. (Ord. 338 §1, 1990)
13.18.060: PERMIT REQUIRED:
Any waste hauler engaged in the hauling and discharge of domestic septage
wastes to the POTW shall obtain a septage hauler discharge permit from the
public works director of the city of Chubbuck ("director"), or his designee,
prior to any such discharge. Waste haulers shall be responsible for complying
with all the terms and conditions contained in the permit, in addition to all
regulations and procedures set forth in this chapter. Any person discharging to
the POTW without a permit will be subject to the penalties provided in this
chapter. This permit shall not be transferable and the permittee shall notify
the director of any change in control or ownership of partnerships, companies,
corporations, or entities (where applicable), and a new application must be
made for a new permit. (Ord. 338 §1, 1990)

No fee shall be charged for issuance of the septage hauler discharge permit.
However, a use fee shall be charged each time a waste hauler delivers or causes
to be delivered a domestic septage load for discharge at the designated
disposal point, based on tank size. Such fees shall be set from time to time by
resolution of the city council. If the Chubbuck city council does not set such
fees, then the fees charged by the city of Pocatello for that type of use shall
be charged by the city of Chubbuck. Failure to pay said fees within thirty (30)
days of the billing date shall be cause for revocation of the septage hauler
discharge permit. (Ord. 338 §1, 1990)
13.18.090: DESIGNATED DISPOSAL POINT:
The director shall designate the specific point at which waste haulers may
discharge domestic septage waste into the POTW. Discharge may not occur without
prior notice to the director and without inspection and/or supervision by
authorized city personnel. (Ord. 338 §1, 1990)
13.18.100: USE OF WASTE TRACKING SYSTEM:
Waste haulers must use an authorized waste tracking form to record every load
that is pumped or delivered to the POTW. Failure to accurately record every
load, falsification of data or failure to transmit the form to the director
prior to discharge into the POTW may result in revocation of this permit. The
director may authorize use of an alternative form provided by the waste hauler
on a case by case basis. (Ord. 338 §1, 1990)
13.18.110: DISCHARGE LIMITATIONS:
The discharge limitations set forth in section
13.18.110 of the revised and compiled ordinances of the city of Pocatello,
1983, and as adopted in any subsequent ordinance or code of the city of
Pocatello are hereby adopted as the discharge limitations for the city of
Chubbuck. Waste haulers are prohibited from discharging wastes into the POTW
which exceed those limitations. (Ord. 582 §3, 2003)
13.18.120: SAMPLING OF WASTE:
Prior to discharge of domestic septage waste, waste haulers shall allow the
director or authorized city personnel to sample the waste to ensure compliance
with discharge limits and requirements. Waste haulers may be required to
suspend the discharging of waste until the analysis is complete. The director
reserves the right to refuse permission to dump any load that is suspected of
being incompatible or that is determined to be incompatible with the POTW
through sampling and analysis, or sound professional judgment. (Ord. 338 §1,
1990)
13.18.130: NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES:
The permittee must notify the director of any substantial change in pollutants
being discharged into the POTW. Such notification must include the source of
the waste, identification of the waste being discharged, the nature and
concentration of pollutants in the discharge, and the time, date and cause of
the change. (Ord. 338 §1, 1990)

permit or the provisions of this chapter may subject the waste hauler to
suspension or revocation of the permit by the director and to prohibition from
further discharge into the POTW until a new permit is issued. The basis of the
suspension or revocation shall be set forth in writing and may be appealed to
the city council. Upon a public hearing before the council, the council shall
issue a written decision which shall be final. (Ord. 338 §1, 1990)

13.20.010: PURPOSE AND POLICY:
This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for direct and indirect discharges
of pollutants from nondomestic sources into the publicly owned treatment works
(POTW), including wastewater collection and treatment system, hauled septage
waste and stormwater drainage system; and enables the city to comply with the
administrative provisions of the clean water act (33 USC 1251 et seq.), as
amended, the general pretreatment regulations (40 CFR 403), and the applicable
effluent limitations, national standards and any other discharge criteria which
are required or authorized by state or federal law. The objectives of this
chapter are:
   A.   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will
interfere with the operation of the POTW;
   B.   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will pass
through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or otherwise be
incompatible with the POTW;
   C.   To ensure that the quality of the wastewater treatment plant sludge is
maintained at a level which allows the use and disposal in compliance with
applicable statutes and regulations;
   D.   To protect POTW personnel who may be affected by wastewater and sludge
in the course of their employment and to protect the general public;
   E.   To preserve the hydraulic capacity of the POTW;
   F.   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and sludge
from the POTW.
This chapter shall apply to all users of the POTW. This chapter provides for
the regulation of direct and indirect discharge to the POTW through the
issuance of discharge permits to certain nondomestic users and through
enforcement of general requirements for other users, authorizes monitoring and
enforcement activities, establishes administrative review procedures, requires
user reporting, and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable
distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein. (Ord. 659,
2008)
13.20.015: ADMINISTRATION:
Except as otherwise provided herein, the public works director shall
administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this chapter. Any powers
granted to or duties imposed upon the public works director may be delegated by
the public works director to other city personnel. (Ord. 659, 2008)

                involved in operating and maintaining said POTW.
CLEAN WATER     The federal water pollution control act, as amended (33 USC 1251 et seq.).
ACT:
                The optical density at the visual wavelength of maximum absorption relative to
COLOR:          distilled water. One hundred percent (100%) transmittance is equivalent to zero (0.0)
                optical density.
                A sample made up of a mixture of discrete samples (minimum 12) collected at the same
                sampling point at equal intervals over a twenty-four (24) hour period, with each
                interval not to exceed two (2) hours. In a flow proportioned composite sample, the
                discrete portions are varied according to flow. Where the flow is not continuous over
                a twenty-four (24) hour period, portions shall be collected at equal intervals over
COMPOSITE       the period of discharge.
SAMPLE:         Each aliquot shall be a grab sample of not less than one hundred milliliters (100 ml)
                and shall be collected and preserved in accordance with 40 CFR 136, and amendments.
                Sample volume at the completion of each twenty-four (24) hour period shall include
                enough sample volume to perform all analyses required by the city.
                The city interprets a "day" to be a twenty-four (24) hour period and does not require
                that it occur within a calendar day. This is consistent with the definition for
                "daily discharge" in the NPDES regulations at 40 CFR 122. 2.
CONTAMINANT:    Any substance that is discharged to the POTW other than clean drinking water and/or
                storm and surface water runoff.
CONTROL         The city of Chubbuck, the city council, the POTW, the city public works director, the
AUTHORITY:      Pocatello water pollution control superintendent, or the superintendent's duly
                authorized deputy, representative or agent.

                refrigeration to which the only pollutant added is heat.
                The maximum allowable discharge limit of a pollutant during a calendar day. Where the
                daily maximum limits are expressed in units of mass, the daily discharge is the total
DAILY MAXIMUM   mass discharged, over the course of the day. Where the daily maximum limits are
LIMIT:          expressed in terms of concentration, the daily discharge is the arithmetic average
                measurement of the pollutant concentration derived from all measurements taken that
                day.
                Any person who contributes, causes or allows the contribution of wastewater into the
                POTW that is of a similar volume and/or chemical makeup as that of a residential
                dwelling unit. Discharges from single- or multi- family dwellings, from office

(Ord. 659, 2008; amd. Ord. 829, 2021)
13.20.035: FEDERAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS:
The national categorical pretreatment standards as amended and promulgated by
EPA pursuant to the act and as found at 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N, parts
405-471, are hereby incorporated and shall be enforceable under this chapter.
(Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.040: STATE REQUIREMENTS:
State requirements and limitations on discharges to the POTW shall be met by
all users which are subject to such standards in any instance in which they are
more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those in this
chapter or in other applicable ordinances. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.045: LOCAL LIMITS:
   A.   The following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass-
through and interference. No significant industrial user shall discharge
wastewater containing pollutant levels in excess of the following daily maximum
allowable discharge limits:
Pollutant Daily Maximum (mg/l)1
Pollutant                                   Daily Maximum (mg/l)1
Arsenic                                     0.05

H maximum (S.U.)                            10.0
   Notes:
      1.   Pollutants are total and in mg/l unless otherwise speecified.
   B.   The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged
to the POTW (end of pipe). The superintendent may impose mass limitations in
addition to (or in place of) the concentration based limitations above. Where a
user is subject to a categorical pretreatment standard and a limit for a given
pollutant, the more stringent limit of applicable pretreatment standard shall
apply.
   C.   The following limits shall apply to wastewaters that are discharged
from the groundwater cleanup of petroleum or gasoline underground storage tanks
or other remediation wastewaters containing these pollutants or where these
pollutants are appropriate surrogates. It shall be unlawful for any industrial
user to discharge or cause to be discharged any waste or wastewater to the POTW
that exceeds the following limits, as applicable:
   D.   Where possible and appropriate, the city may establish and implement
industry-specific BMP's (best management practices) in conjunction with or in
lieu of numerical local limits. Such BMP's shall be considered pretreatment
standards and fully enforceable under this chapter. Based upon assessment of
need and on a user specific basis the City may incorporate pollutant specific
BMP's or concentration or mass limits into indirect discharge permits. Wherever
a user is subject to both a categorical pretreatment standard and a local limit
for a given pollutant, the more stringent limit or pretreatment standard may
apply.
 
Pollutant Daily Maximum Limit (mg/l)1
Benzene   0.050
BTEX2     0.750
   Notes:
      1.   All pollutants shown in the table above are total.
      2.   BTEX shall be measured as the sum of benzene, ethyl benzene, toluene
and xylenes. (Ord. 730, 2014; amd. Ord. 829, 2021)
13.20.050: RIGHT OF REVISION:
The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater
discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to
the POTW. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.055: SPECIAL AGREEMENTS:
The city reserves the right to enter into special agreements with users setting
out special terms under which they may discharge to the POTW. In no case will a
special agreement waive compliance with a categorical pretreatment standard or
a federal pretreatment requirement. However, the user may request a net/gross
adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. Users
may also request a variance from the categorical pretreatment standard from the
approval authority in accordance with 40 CFR 403.13. Such a request will be
approved only if the user can prove that factors relating to its discharge are
fundamentally different from the factors considered by the EPA when
establishing that pretreatment standard. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.060: DILUTION:
No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to
dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment
to achieve compliance with an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement
unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or
requirement. The superintendent may impose mass limitations on users which he
believes may be using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is
appropriate. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.065: LIMITATIONS ON POINT OF DISCHARGE:
No user shall discharge any waste or wastewater directly into a manhole or
other opening unless they have been issued a permit by the city. If a permit is
issued for such discharge, the user shall pay the applicable charges and fees
and shall meet all conditions required by the permit. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.070: PRETREATMENT FACILITIES:
Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with
this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements set out in this chapter within the time limitations
specified by the EPA, the state, or the superintendent, whichever is more
stringent. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable
to the city shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense.
Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures
shall be submitted to the city for review and shall be acceptable to the city
before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating
procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying
the facility as necessary to produce an acceptable discharge to the city under
the provisions of this chapter. Additional pretreatment measures may include,
but are not limited to, those set forth in section
13.20.080 of this chapter. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.075: DEADLINE FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS:
Compliance by existing sources covered by categorical pretreatment standards
shall be within three (3) years of the date the standard is effective unless a
shorter compliance time is specified in the appropriate standard. The city
shall establish a final compliance deadline date for any existing user not
covered by categorical pretreatment standards or for any categorical user when
the local limit for said user is more restrictive than the federal categorical
pretreatment standard.
New sources and new users are required to comply with applicable pretreatment
standards within the shortest feasible time, not to exceed ninety (90) days
from the beginning of discharge. New sources and new users shall install, have
in operating condition, and shall start up all pollution control equipment
required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to
discharge.
Any wastewater discharge permit issued to a categorical user shall contain a
compliance date beyond any deadline date established in EPA's categorical
pretreatment standards. Any other existing user or categorical user that must
comply with a more stringent local limit which is in noncompliance with any
local limits shall be provided with a compliance schedule included in the
wastewater discharge permit to ensure compliance within the shortest time
feasible. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.080: ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT:
   A.   Whenever deemed necessary, the superintendent may require users to
restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sanitary sewers, relocate and/or
consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial
waste streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the
POTW and determine the user' s compliance with the requirements of this
chapter.
   B.   The superintendent may require any person discharging into the POTW to
install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable
storage and flow control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater
discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
   C.   A grease interceptor or a grease trap is not considered to be properly
maintained if for any reason it is not in good working condition with all
internal required plumbing of proper design and length in place, or if the
operational fluid capacity has been reduced by more than twenty-five percent
(25%) by the accumulation of floating and settled solids, oils, and greases.
The owner of any premises required to install a grease interceptor; the lessee
and sublessee, if there be such; and any proprietor, operator, or
superintendent of such facility are individually and severally liable for any
failure of proper maintenance of such grease interceptor.
   If the grease interceptor is not maintained adequately under the conditions
of use, the grease interceptor shall be resized and the user shall install one
which is effective in accomplishing the intended purpose.
   When a grease interceptor/trap is cleaned, the sidewalls should be scraped
and hosed down, while all the solids and liquids contained are removed. All
wastes removed from any grease interceptor/trap shall be legally disposed of
other than to the sewer. The city of Chubbuck specifically prohibits the
following grease interceptor/trap practices;
      1.   Pumping to remove only accumulated sediments or floating materials;
      2.   Pumping operations which specifically separate floating or sediment
interceptor solid wastes from wastewater and then return or decant the
separated wastewater back into the grease interceptor/trap;
      3.   Transporting any hauled pollutants from another location for
discharge into a grease interceptor/trap.
      4.   Use of grease interceptor/trap treatment products, including
bacteria, designed to digest the grease, is specifically prohibited.
   D.   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
(Ord. 668 § 2, 2009: Ord. 659, 2008; Ord. 829, 2021)
13.20.085: ACCIDENTAL SPILL PREVENTION PLANS:
The superintendent may require any user to develop and implement an accidental
spill prevention plan (ASPP) or slug control plan. Where deemed necessary by
the city, facilities to prevent accidental discharge or slug discharges of
pollutants shall be provided and maintained at the user's cost and expense. An
accidental spill prevention plan or slug control plan showing facilities and
operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city
for review, and approval before implementation. The city shall determine which
user is required to develop a plan and require said plan to be submitted within
sixty (60) days after notification by the city. Each user shall implement its
ASPP as submitted or as modified after such plan has been reviewed and approved
by the city. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures by the
city shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify its facility
as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter.
   A.   Any user required to develop and implement an accidental spill
prevention plan shall submit a plan which addresses, at a minimum, the
following:
      1.   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
      2.   Description of stored chemicals;
      3.   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of accidental or slug
discharges. Such notification must also be given for any discharge which would
violate any of the standards in sections
13.20.030 through 13.20.045 of this chapter; and
      4.   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental or slug
discharges. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
chemicals (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
   B.   Users shall notify the Pocatello wastewater treatment plant immediately
after the occurrence of a slug or accidental discharge of substances regulated
by this chapter. The notification shall include location of discharge, date and
time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions.
Any affected user shall be liable for any expense, loss or damage to the POTW,
in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the city on account thereof
under state or federal law.
   C.   Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge, the user shall
submit to the superintendent a detailed written report describing the cause of
the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar
future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property nor
shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or
other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or other applicable law.
   D.   Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on the user's
premises advising employees whom to call in the event of a slug or accidental
discharge. Employers shall instruct all employees who may cause or discover
such a discharge with respect to emergency notification procedures. (Ord. 659,
2008)
13.20.090: SEPTIC TANK WASTE:
   A.   Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at the
designated receiving structure within the treatment plant area, located at
10733 N. Rio Vista Road, and at such times as are established by the
superintendent of the POTW. No other point of discharge within the city's
collection system will be allowed without the expressed written permission of
the superintendent. The discharge of any hauled waste to a point in the city's
collection system, other than as specifically designated by the superintendent,
shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and shall be subject to
enforcement action. Such wastes shall not violate any section of this chapter
or any other requirements established or adopted by the city.
   B.   All domestic septic tank waste, portable toilet waste or other hauled
waste deemed acceptable by the superintendent will be subject to the terms and
conditions contained in the city's general regulations of waste haulers,
incorporated herein and made a part thereof.
   C.   Discharges of nondomestic hauled waste shall be subject to the
applicable prohibited discharges as set forth in sections
13.20.030 through
13.20.045 of this chapter, as well as any applicable Federal, state and local
regulations governing hauled waste or any conditions the superintendent deems
necessary for protection of its treatment works.
   D.   Nothing contained in these regulations shall be construed as being
preemptory of any other regulations governing hauled waste, or waste haulers,
or any business activities pertaining to hauled waste, or as set forth in any
Federal, state or local guidance governing hauled waste.
   E.   Any waste hauler seeking to discharge hauled waste to the POTW, or to
any designated point within the city collection system, must have a city
approved waste hauler's permit. No load may be discharged without prior consent
of the superintendent of the POTW. The superintendent may collect samples of
each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards.
The superintendent may require the hauler to provide a waste analysis of any
load prior to discharge. The superintendent reserves the right to refuse
permission to dump any load that is suspected of being incompatible or that is
determined to be incompatible with the POTW through sampling and analysis, or
sound professional judgment. Waste haulers mustprovide a waste tracking form
for every load. A waste tracking form approved by the POTW shall be used to
record every load that is delivered to the POTW. Failure to accurately record
every load, falsification of data or failure to transmit the form to the
superintendent prior to discharge into the POTW may result in revocation of
this permit. (Ord. 659, 2008; amd. Ord. 829, 2021)
13.20.095: WASTEWATER ANALYSIS:
When requested by the superintendent, a user must submit information on the
nature and characteristics of its wastewater within thirty (30) days of the
request. The superintendent is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose
and may periodically require users to update this information. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.100: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT REQUIREMENTS:
No significant industrial user shall discharge wastewater into the POTW without
first obtaining a wastewater discharge permit from the superintendent; the
permit must be enforceable and contain all the elements as required by 40 CFR
403.8(f)(1)(iii)(B). Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater
discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and subjects the
wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set forth in this chapter.
Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of its
obligation to comply with all federal, state and local standards and
requirements or with any other requirements of federal, state and local law.
The superintendent may require other users to obtain wastewater discharge
permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter. (Ord. 659,
2008)
13.20.105: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITTING; EXISTING SOURCE AND EXISTING USER:
Any user required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit who was discharging
wastewater into the POTW prior to the effective date hereof and who wishes to
continue such discharges in the future shall, within sixty (60) days after
notification by the superintendent, submit a wastewater discharge permit
application to the city in accordance with section
13.20.120 of this chapter. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.110: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITTING; NEW SOURCE AND NEW USER:
Any user required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit who proposes to begin
or recommence discharging into the POTW must obtain such permit prior to
beginning or recommencing of such discharge. An application for a wastewater
discharge permit, in accordance with section
13.20.120 of this chapter, must be filed ninety (90) days prior to the date
upon which any discharge will begin or commence. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.115: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITTING; MULTIJURISDICTIONAL USERS:
Any existing user who is located beyond the city limits and who is required to
obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall submit a wastewater discharge permit
application as outlined in section
13.20.105 of this chapter. New sources and new users who are located beyond the
city limits and who are required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall
comply with section
13.20.110 of this chapter.
If another municipality, or user located within another municipality,
contributes wastewater to the POTW, the superintendent shall enter into a
multijurisdictional agreement with the contributing municipality. Prior to
entering into said agreement, the superintendent shall request a description of
the quality and volume of wastewater discharging to the POTW, an inventory of
all users located within the contributing municipality, and such other
information as the superintendent may deem necessary from the contributing
municipality.
A multijurisdictional agreement, as required above, shall contain at a minimum
the following conditions:
   A.   A requirement for the contributing municipality to adopt a sewer use
ordinance which is at least as stringent as this chapter, the requirement shall
specify that such ordinance and limits must be revised as necessary to reflect
changes made to this chapter and/or local limits;
   B.   A requirement for the contributing municipality to submit a revised
user inventory on at least an annual basis;
   C.   A provision specifying which pretreatment implementation activities,
including individual wastewater discharge permit, inspection and sampling, and
enforcement, will be conducted by the contributing municipality; and which of

existing significant industrial user with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements set forth in this chapter, in federal categorical standards, or in
a wastewater discharge permit, or within thirty (30) days following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW by a new source,
or a new user considered by the city to fit the definition of SIU, any user
subject to this chapter shall submit to the city a report containing the
information outlined in sections
13.20.120 and
13.20.170 of this chapter.
   B.   For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established by the city in accordance with procedures established in 40 CFR
403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long
term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the
user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. (Ord. 659,
2008)
13.20.180: PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORT:
Any users may be required to submit periodic compliance reports by permit or at
the request of the superintendent.
   A.   All significant industrial users shall comply with all applicable
requirements under 40 CFR 403.12 and submit to the city during the months of
June and December, unless required on other dates or more frequently by the
city, a report indicating the nature of the effluent over the previous
reporting period. The frequency of monitoring shall be as prescribed within the
industrial waste discharge permit. At a minimum, users shall sample their
discharge at least twice per year. In cases where best management practice
(BMP) or pollution prevention alternatives are required, the user must submit
documentation required by the superintendent or the applicable pretreatment
standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
   B.   The report shall include a record of the concentration (and mass if
specified in the wastewater discharge permit) of the pollutants listed in the
wastewater discharge permit that were measured and record of all flow
measurements (average and maximum) taken at the designated sampling locations
and shall also include any additional information required by this chapter or
wastewater discharge permit. Production data shall be reported if required by
the wastewater discharge permit. Both daily maximum and average concentration
(or mass, where required) shall be reported. If a user sampled and analyzed
more frequently than what was required by the city or by this chapter, using
methodologies in 40 CFR 136, it must submit all results of sampling and
analysis of the discharge during the reporting period.
   C.   Any user subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established
by the city or by unit production limits specified in the applicable
categorical pretreatment standards shall report production data as outlined in
section
13.20.175 of this chapter.
   D.   If the city calculated limits to factor out dilution flows or
nonregulated flows, the user will be responsible for providing flows from the
regulated process flows, dilution flows, and nonregulated flows.
   E.   Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement, provided,
however, that the city may accept reports of average and maximum flows
estimated by verifiable techniques if the city determines that an actual
measurement is not feasible.
   F.   Discharges sampled shall be representative of the user's daily
operation and samples shall be taken in accordance with the requirements
specified in sections
13.20.225 and
13.20.230 of this chapter.

an industrial wastewater discharge permit if information or data is needed to
establish a sewer charge, determine the treatability of the effluent, or
determine any other factor which is related to the operation and maintenance of
the sewer system.
   H.   The city may require self-monitoring by the user or, if requested by
the user, the city may agree to perform periodic compliance monitoring needed
to prepare the periodic compliance report required under this section. If the
city agrees to perform such periodic compliance monitoring, it may charge the
user for such monitoring, based upon the costs incurred by the city for the
sampling and analyses. Any such charges shall be added to the normal sewer
charge and shall be payable as part of the sewer bills. The city is under no
obligation to perform periodic compliance monitoring for a user. (Ord. 659,
2008)
13.20.185: COMPLIANCE SCHEDULES FOR MEETING APPLICABLE PRETREATMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing
preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major
components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc.).
   B.   No increment referred to in subsection A of this section shall exceed
nine (9) months.
   C.   Not later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule
and the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to
the city including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment
of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to
comply with this increment of progress, the reason for the delay, and the steps
being taken by the user to return the construction to the schedule established.
In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such progress
reports. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.190: NOTIFICATION OF SIGNIFICANT PRODUCTION CHANGES:
Any user operating under a wastewater discharge permit incorporating equivalent
mass or concentration limits shall notify the city within two (2) business days
after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will
significantly change within the calendar month. Any user not providing a notice
of such anticipated change will be required to comply with the existing limits
contained in its wastewater discharge permit.
   A.   The superintendent may require the user to submit such information as
may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the
submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under section
13.20.120 of this chapter.
   B.   The superintendent may issue a wastewater discharge permit under
section
13.20.165 of this chapter or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit
under section
13.20.150 of this chapter in response to changed conditions or anticipated
changed conditions. (Ord. 659, 2008)

wastes as defined in 40 CFR 261 (listed or characteristic wastes) in a calendar
month or any facility discharging any amount of acutely hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) is required to provide notification
in writing to the city and a onetime notification in writing to the EPA region
10 office of air, waste, and toxics director, and to the state of Idaho
department of environmental quality hazardous waste manager within ten (10)
days of discovery that said discharge occurred. Any existing user exempt from
this notification shall comply with the requirements contained herein within
thirty (30) days of becoming aware of a discharge of fifteen kilograms (15kg)
of hazardous wastes in a calendar month or any discharge of acutely hazardous
wastes to the POTW.
Such notification shall include:
   A.   The name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261;
   B.   The EPA hazardous waste number; and
   C.   The type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other).
   D.   If an industrial user discharges more than one hundred kilograms
(100kg) of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall
also contain the following information to the extent it is known or readily
available to the industrial user:
      1.   An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes,
      2.   An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in
the waste streams discharged during that calendar month, and
      3.   An estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream
expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months.
These notification requirements do not apply to pollutants already reported
under the self-monitoring requirements.
Whenever the EPA publishes final rules identifying additional hazardous wastes
or new characteristics of hazardous waste, a user shall notify the city of the
discharge of such a substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of
such regulations.
In the case of any notification made under this section, an industrial user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise
permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit
issued thereunder, or any applicable federal, state and local law. (Ord. 659,
2008)
13.20.200: NOTICE OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS, INCLUDING ACCIDENTAL SPILLS, SLUG

fines imposed on the city under federal, state or local law.
   B.   Within five (5) days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the city, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of
the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar
future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be incurred as a result
of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties,
or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter. A notice
shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent
place advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge described in
subsection A of this section. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who
could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency
notification procedure.
   C.   Users are required to notify the POTW immediately of any changes at its
facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.205: NONCOMPLIANCE REPORTING:
If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user shall notify
the superintendent within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis for two (2)
consecutive days, within five (5) days of becoming aware of the violation. The
results of the repeat analysis shall be submitted to the city within thirty
(30) days after becoming aware of the violation. Where the city has performed
the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the city must perform
the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation
and requires the user to perform the repeat analysis. Resampling is not
required if:
   A.   The city performs sampling and analysis at the user's expense at a
frequency of at least once per month, or
   B.   The city performs sampling and analysis at the user's expense between
the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or
the city receives the results of this sampling analysis. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.210: NOTIFICATION OF CHANGED DISCHARGE:
All users shall notify the POTW ninety (90) days in advance of any substantial
change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, This
includes significant manufacturing process modifications, pretreatment
modifications, facility expansion, production increase and the listed
characteristic hazardous wastes for which the user has submitted initial
notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p). (Ord. 659, 2008; amd. Ord. 829, 2021)
13.20.215: REPORTS FROM UNPERMITTED USERS:
All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide
appropriate reports to the city as the superintendent may require. (Ord. 659,
2008)
13.20.220: RECORD KEEPING:
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain, and
make available for inspection and copying all records of information obtained
pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter and any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include
the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the name of the person
(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the
analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such
analyses including documentation associated with best management practices.
These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years.
This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation
concerning the user or the POTW, or where the user has been specifically
notified of a longer retention period by the superintendent. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.225: SAMPLING REQUIREMENTS:
Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data
obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period
covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions
occurring during the reporting period.
   A.   Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and
grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other pollutants,
twenty four (24) hour composite samples must be obtained through flow
proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city, the samples must be
representative of the discharge and the decision to allow the alternative
sampling must be documented in the industrial user file for that facility or
facilities. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in
40 CFR 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during
a twenty four (24) hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as
follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited
in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease,
the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other
parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved
EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition,
grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
   B.   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety (90)
day compliance reports, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH,
cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds
for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities
for which historical sampling data are available, the superintendent may
authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by 40 CFR 403.12(e) and
403.12(h), the user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary
to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements.
   C.   Samples shall be taken immediately downstream from the pretreatment
facilities if such exist, immediately downstream from the regulated or
manufacturing process if no pretreatment exists, or at a location determined by
the city and specified in the user's wastewater discharge permit. For
categorical users, if other waste streams are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user shall measure the flows and
concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of
40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the applicable categorical
pretreatment standards. For other users, for which the city has adjusted local
limits to factor out dilution flows, the user shall measure the flows and
concentrations necessary to evaluate compliance with the adjusted pretreatment
standard(s).
   D.   All sample results shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling
and methods of analysis and shall certify that the waste stream sampled is
representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges from the
user. If a user sampled and analyzed more frequently than what was required in
its individual wastewater discharge permit using methodologies in 40 CFR 136,
it must submit all results of sampling and analysis of the discharge as part of
its self-monitoring report. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.230: ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS:
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, shall be in accordance
with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto, unless
otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40
CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, or where the EPA determines that 40 CFR 136 sampling and analytical
techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA.
(Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.235: CITY MONITORING OF USER'S WASTEWATER:
The city will follow the same procedures as outlined in sections
13.20.225 and
13.20.230 of this chapter. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.245: INSPECTION AND SAMPLING; RIGHT OF ENTRY:
The city shall have the right to enter the facility of any user to ascertain
whether the purpose of this chapter and any wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder is being met and whether the user is complying with all
requirements thereof. Users shall allow the superintendent ready access to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
   A.   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the superintendent will be permitted to enter
without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
   B.   The superintendent shall have the right to set up on the user's
property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
   C.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user
at the written or verbal request of the superintendent and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
   D.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the superintendent access to the user's
premises shall be a violation of this chapter. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.250: MONITORING FACILITIES:
   A.   Each user shall provide and operate at its own expense a monitoring
facility to allow inspections, sampling, and flow measurements of each sewer
discharge to the city. Each monitoring facility shall be situated on the user's
premises, except, where such a location would be impractical or cause undue
hardship on the user, the city may concur with the facility being constructed
in the public street or sidewalk area, providing that the facility is located
so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. The
superintendent, whenever applicable, may require the construction and
maintenance of sampling facilities at other locations (for example, at the end
of a manufacturing line or a wastewater treatment system).
   B.   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to allow
accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility,
including the sampling and measuring equipment, shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
   C.   The superintendent may require the user to install equipment as
necessary. All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in
accordance with all applicable local construction standards and specifications.
If flow measurement is required, the appropriate flow measurement devices and
methods consistent with approved scientific practices must be ensure the
capability of that type of device. All devices selected must be capable of
measuring flows with a maximum deviation of less than ten percent (10%) from
true discharge rates throughout the range of expected discharge volumes. (Ord.
659, 2008; amd. Ord. 829, 2021)
13.20.255: SEARCH WARRANTS:
If the superintendent has been refused access to a building, structure or
property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need
to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
of the city designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety and welfare of the community, the superintendent shall seek
issuance of a search warrant from the district court of the sixth judicial
district in and for the county where the property is situated. Such warrant
shall be served by the superintendent in the company of a uniformed police
officer of the city. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.260: VANDALISM, FALSIFYING, OR TAMPERING:
No person shall willfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover,
deface, tamper with, or prevent access to any structure, appurtenance or
equipment, or other part of the POTW. Any person found in violation of this
requirement shall be subject to the sanctions set out in this chapter.
No person shall make any false statement, representation or certification in
any application, record, report or plan, or other document filed or required to
be maintained pursuant to this chapter. Any person found in violation of this
requirements shall be subject to the sanctions set out in this chapter. (Ord.
659, 2008; amd. Ord. 829, 2021)
13.20.265: CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, and monitoring programs, and from the
superintendent's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the
public without restriction; unless the user specifically requests and is able
to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city, that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such
request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data.
When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such
information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might
disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for
inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately, upon request
to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment
program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the
report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data as
defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and
will be available to the public without restriction. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.270: PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE:
The superintendent shall publish annually, in a newspaper(s) of general
circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction(s)
served by the POTW, a list of the users which, during the previous twelve (12)
months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements. Accordingly, the industrial user shall be apprised
that noncompliance with this chapter and its wastewater discharge permit may
lead to an enforcement action and may result in a publication of its name in
appropriate newspaper in accordance with the section. For the purposes of this
provision, a user is in significant noncompliance it its violation meets one or
more of the following criteria:
   A.   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined herein as
those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of measurements taken for the
same pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period exceed (by any
magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including
instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403. 3(1);
   B.   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined herein as those in
which thirty three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken for
each pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period equals or exceeds the
product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including
instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1) multiplied by the TRC (TRC
= 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants
except pH);
   C.   Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as
defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1) daily maximum, long term average, instantaneous
limits, or narrative standard) that the POTW determines has caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, interference or passthrough, including
endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;
   D.   Any discharge of pollutant that may cause imminent endangerment to the
public or to the environment, or has resulted in the city's exercise of its
emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
   E.   Failure to provide within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or
attaining final compliance;
   F.   Failure to provide within thirty (30) days after the due date, any
required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance
with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self- monitoring
reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
   G.   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
   H.   Any other violation or groups of violations, which may include a
violation of best management practices, which the POTW determines will
adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment
program. (Ord. 659, 2008; amd. Ord. 829, 2021)
13.20.275: NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION:
When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
superintendent may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within
ten (10) days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation
and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include
specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the
superintendent. Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the user of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of
violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city to
take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action,
without first issuing a notice of violation. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.280: CONSENT ORDERS:
The superintendent may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary
compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user
responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to
be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period
specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect
as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections
13.20.290 and
13.20.295 of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable. Use of a consent
order shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the user. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.285: SHOW CAUSE HEARINGS:
The superintendent may order a user which has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear
before the superintendent and show cause why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and
place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such
action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served
personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at
least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any
authorized representative of the user as defined in section
13.20.020 of this chapter. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.290: COMPLIANCE ORDERS:
When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that the user come into compliance within a time specified in the
order. If the user does not come into compliance within the time specified in
the order, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly
operated. Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A
compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a
pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the
user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation.
Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.295: CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS:
When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement; or that
the user's past violations are likely to recur, the superintendent may issue an
order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and
directing the user to:
   A.   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
   B.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.300: ADMINISTRATIVE FINES:
   A.   When the superintendent finds that a user has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
superintendent may fine such user in an amount not to exceed one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00). Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day
basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits,
fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
   B.   Assessments may be added to the user's next scheduled sewer service
charge and the superintendent shall have such other collection remedies as may
be available for other service charges and fees.
   C.   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after thirty (30) calendar
days, be assessed an additional penalty of twenty percent (20%) of the unpaid
balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at the highest legal rate allowed
by law. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges,
fines, and penalties.
   D.   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request to the
superintendent or public works director for reconsideration of the fine along
with full payment of the fine amount within ten (10) days of being notified of
the fine. The superintendent or public works director may convene a hearing on
the matter within thirty (30) days of receiving the request from the user. In
the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any
interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The city may add the
costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and
orders, to the fine.
   E.   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.305: EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS:
The superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge without formal
notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent
or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
superintendent may also immediately suspend a user's discharge after notice,
that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents,
or may present an endangerment to city workers, the general public, and/or to
the environment.
   A.   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the superintendent
shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the
sanitary sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its
receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The superintendent shall
allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to
the satisfaction of the superintendent that the period of endangerment has
passed, unless the termination proceedings in section
13.20.310 of this chapter are initiated against the user.
   B.   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the superintendent prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under sections
13.20.285 and
13.20.310 of this chapter.
   C.   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.310: TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE, NONEMERGENCY:
In addition to the provisions in section
13.20.160 of this chapter, any user that violates the following conditions is
subject to discharge termination:
   A.   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
   B.   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
   C.   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
   D.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of
inspection, monitoring or sampling; or
   E.   Violation of the pretreatment standards in sections
 13.20.030 through
13.20.045 of this chapter.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be
offered an opportunity to show cause under section
13.20.285 of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise
of this option by the city shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking
any other action against the user. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.315: APPEAL OF SHOW CAUSE HEARING DECISION, COMPLIANCE ORDER, CEASE AND
DESIST ORDER, OR NONEMERGENCY TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE:
Any interested person, including the user, may petition to the city council for
reconsideration of a show cause hearing decision, a compliance order, a cease
and desist order, or a nonemergency termination of discharge within ten (10)
days of the issuance of said decision or order.
   A.   Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be deemed to be a
waiver of the administrative appeal.
   B.   In its petition, the appealing party must indicate the decision being
objected to, the reasons for this objection and an alternative proposal, if
any, it seeks to be applied to the wastewater discharge permit.
   C.   The effectiveness of the decision, order or termination regarding the
wastewater discharge permit shall not be stayed pending the appeal.
   D.   If the city fails to act within thirty (30) days from the receipt of a
petition for review, a request for reconsideration shall be deemed to be
denied. Decisions not to reconsider a show cause hearing decision, a compliance
order, a cease and desist order or a nonemergency termination order of a
wastewater discharge permit shall be considered final administrative action for
purposes of judicial review.
   E.   Aggrieved parties seeking review of the final administrative wastewater
discharge permit decision must do so by filing a complaint with the district
court of the sixth judicial district in and for the county of Bannock within
two (2) years from the date of said final decision. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.317: INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:
When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
superintendent may petition the district court of the sixth judicial district
in and for the county of Bannock through the city's attorney for the issuance
of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or
compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or
other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The city
may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable
relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental
remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.320: CIVIL PENALTIES:
   A.   A user who has violated or continues to violate any provision of this
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for a maximum
civil penalty of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day. In
the case of a monthly, or other long term average discharge limit, penalties
shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
   B.   The superintendent may recover reasonable attorney fees, court costs,
and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling
and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the
city.
   C.   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into
account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent
of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic
benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user,
the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires.
   D.   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.325: CRIMINAL PROSECUTION:
   A.   A user which has wilfully or negligently violated or continues to
violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day, or imprisonment for
not more than six (6) months, or both.
   B.   A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the
POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be
guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) and/or be subject to imprisonment for six (6)
months. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for
personal injury or property damage available under state law.
   C.   A user which knowingly made any false statements, representations, or
certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation
filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter, wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or
knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under
this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not
more than six (6) months, or both. (Ord. 659, 2008; amd. Ord. 829, 2021)
13.20.330: REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE:
The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The superintendent
reserves the right to take any, all, or any combination of these actions
against a noncompliant user. Enforcement in response to pretreatment violations
will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan.
However, the city reserves the right to take other action against any user when
the circumstances warrant. Further, the city is empowered to take more than one
enforcement action against any noncompliant user. These actions may be taken
concurrently. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.335: PERFORMANCE BONDS:
The superintendent may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge
permit to any user which has failed to comply with any provision of this
chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first files a
satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum not to exceed a value
determined by the superintendent to be necessary to achieve consistent
compliance. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.340: LIABILITY INSURANCE:
The superintendent may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge
permit to any user which has failed to comply with any provision of this
chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first submits
proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair
damage to the POTW caused by its discharge. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.345: PAYMENT OF OUTSTANDING FEES AND PENALTIES:
The superintendent may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge
permit to any user who has failed to pay any outstanding fees, fines or
penalties incurred as a result of any provision of this chapter, a previous

user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
   B.   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards if the requirements of
subsection C of this section are met.
   C.   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      1.   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      2.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      3.   The user has submitted the following information to the POTW and
treatment plant operator within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the
upset. If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be
provided within five (5) days:
         a.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         b.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         c.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   D.   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   E.   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
applicable pretreatment standards.
   F.   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with applicable pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of their treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.365: PROHIBITED DISCHARGE VIOLATION; AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE:
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section
13.20.030 of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason
to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other
sources, would cause pass-through or interference and that either:
   A.   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass-through or
interference; or
   B.   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. (Ord.
659, 2008)
13.20.370: BYPASS:
   A.   Terms Defined: For the purposes of this section, the following terms
shall be defined as follows:
   BYPASS: The intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a
user's treatment facility.
   SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE: Substantial physical damage to property, damage to
the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial
and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to
occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic
loss caused by delays in production.
   B.   Exception: A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provision of subsections C and D of this section.
   C.   Bypass Notification:
      1.   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit
prior notice to the POTW, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass,
if possible.
      2.   A user shall submit oral notice to the city of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty four (24)
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on a case by
case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty four (24) hours.
   D.   Bypass Conditions:
      1.   Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take an enforcement action
against a user for a bypass, unless:
         a.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         b.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         c.   The user submitted notices as required under subsection C of this
section.
      2.   The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three (3)
conditions listed in subsection D1 of this section. (Ord. 659, 2008)
13.20.375: PRETREATMENT CHARGES AND FEES:
The city may adopt reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and
operating the city's pretreatment program which may include:

The method of allocation provided for in the resolution of the city council or
the city's agreement with the developer shall be the front foot method, a
square foot method, or a combination thereof, or such other method as may
equitably allocate the costs of the extension in proportion to the benefits
derived by each benefited property. (Ord. 435 §1, 1995)
13.24.050: PAYMENT OF ALLOCATED COSTS BY BENEFITED LANDOWNERS:
The owners of all land described in the city council's resolution or the city's

13.32.030: SEWER CHARGES:
   A.   System Of Charges:
      1.   A schedule of rates, fees, deposits and charges for the wastewater
system and services to residential and commercial users shall be set from time
to time by resolution of the CIAWCA board. Copies of such resolutions shall be
kept on file and made available in the office of the CIAWCA administrator.
      2.   Any "industrial discharger", as defined in section
13.16.020 of this title, shall be required to comply with all the provisions of
this chapter,
chapter 13.24 of this title, and in addition, may be required to enter into an
agreement with the CIAWCA known as an industrial user agreement containing
provisions for use of the CIAWCA, city of Chubbuck and city of Pocatello
wastewater treatment systems, and including a formula for establishing the rate
to be charged the particular industry.
      3.   In addition to the sewer service charges provided for herein, a
sewer connection fee will be assessed for each permit granted for each
connection to the CIAWCA sewer system. Said permit fees will be set from time
to time by resolution of the CIAWCA board. Copies of such resolutions shall be
kept on file and made available in the office of the CIAWCA treasurer.
   B.   Fees:
      1.   Permits Required: No person shall install an addition to or alter
any CIAWCA sanitary sewer within the CIAWCA, or tap onto or connect to any
CIAWCA sanitary sewer line, whether lateral, main or interceptor, without first
obtaining permission from the CIAWCA.
      2.   Fees Required:
         a.   Pocatello Treatment Plant Capacity Fee Fees: Before permission is
issued for the installation or alteration of any CIAWCA sanitary sewer or
before any connection is made to any CIAWCA sanitary sewer line, whether
lateral, main or interceptor, the applicant shall pay to the CIAWCA, or
participating entity, a treatment capacity fee. Treatment plant capacity fees
adopted by the city of Pocatello and which are to be paid by new users
connecting to the facility shall be collected by the CIAWCA and remitted to the
city of Pocatello.
         b.   Sewer Connection Fee: Any person or business concern connecting
to any CIAWCA sanitary sewer, whether lateral, main or interceptor, will be
required to pay a sewer connection fee; the rate established by previous
agreement with the group of developer(s) who financed a specific section of
sewer main or at a rate per acre of property served by the main, depending upon
the location of the pertinent main and the subject connection. Such fee shall
be as adopted by resolution of the CIAWCA, and ratified by the participating
entity(ies) having jurisdiction over the physical location of the sewer main,
and may be amended from time to time, and such fee schedule shall be maintained
in the administrative office of the CIAWCA and made available to any interested
party inquiring and seeking a connection. Such fee shall be in addition to any
other permit fee required.
If any person or business concern constructs a sewer main entirely at his or
her expense, or elects to pursue construction of a sewer main in cooperation
with the CIAWCA, the CIAWCA may establish by written agreement, a reimbursement
to such person or business concern a portion of main connection charges
collected by the CIAWCA from any other person who subsequently connects to the
relevant sewer main established in the agreement.
   C.   Sewer Service Charge: A monthly service charge for sewer service shall
be charged to all users. User rates shall be established by resolution of the
CIAWCA board and shall be kept on file in the administrative office of the
CIAWCA. The rates established shall generate sufficient revenue to offset total
costs of the sewerage system which includes:
      1.   Debt Service: Payment of principal and interest on any general
obligation or revenue bond or bonds issued by the CIAWCA or a participating
entity to defray the cost of construction, extension or improvement of the
sanitary sewer system.
      2.   Operation, Maintenance And Replacement Costs: The costs of the
sewerage system shall be reviewed periodically and user rates adjusted, if
necessary, to ensure adequate revenue to cover all costs and to ensure that all
users share equally the cost of operation, maintenance and replacement.
      3.   Capital Improvement Fund: A fee reserved for the capital improvement
fund.
   D.   Miscellaneous Charges: Connection to the regional system requires
submission of an application from the person requesting permission for
connection after which a discharge permit may be issued by the CIAWCA. An
application is required for all connections including individual connections,
subdivisions, and existing entities.
      1.   Administrative Fee: A fee will be assessed for administrative costs
associated with processing the application, establishing a new account and
preparing a discharge permit.
         a.   The fee is assessed and collected at the time the person submits
the application.
         b.   A permit will not be issued by the participating entity until the
fee is paid.
      2.   Review Fee: A new connection is required to submit construction
drawings prepared by a licensed professional, as required, depicting the
intended means of connecting to the regional system including details of the
connection point for the user. The CIAWCA has established construction
standards to the latest version of the Idaho standards for public works
construction with standard revisions with which all new connections must
comply. The CIAWCA will review the construction drawings for conformance with
the standards and specifications required and for consistency with the master
plan for the established service area. A fee will be assessed for costs
associated with reviewing the construction drawings.
         a.   The fee structure is a flat rate for review of the construction
drawings plus an incremental fee for the number of units or ERUs assessed to
the project by the CIAWCA.
         b.   The fee is assessed and collected at the time the user submits
the construction drawings for review.
         c.   The participating entity(ies) will require a signature block on
the recorded plat for the chairman of the CIAWCA.
         d.   A permit will not be issued by the participating entity until the
construction drawings are approved and the fee is paid.
      3.   Inspection Fee: A new connection is required to construct sanitary
facilities according to the established construction standards and
specifications. Any person installing a trunk, lateral or individual service
line shall pay a sewer inspection fee to cover the costs of inspection of the
installation and construction of said trunk, lateral, main or service line, as
well as inspection of the necessary and required service connections, manholes,
related structures, and appurtenances in accordance with the construction
drawings and specifications on file with the CIAWCA.
The person is required to provide the CIAWCA written notice of the construction
schedule two (2) business days in advance with such notice allowing inspection
on a regularly scheduled workday and work hours such that the inspector from
the CIAWCA can observe the materials and construction methods prior to
backfilling or covering and thus preventing visual observation. If written
notice is provided and the CIAWCA inspector fails to make an appearance, the
person may continue construction work. In the event sewer inspection requires
any time other than a normal working day, the person shall reimburse the CIAWCA
at rates established by the CIAWCA for inspection work.
         a.   The fee structure is a flat rate for inspection of the
construction plus an incremental fee for the number of units or ERUs assessed
to the project by the CIAWCA.
      4.   Mapping Fee: Efficient maintenance and operation of the collection
and conveyance system requires maintenance of records that facilitate location
of buried transmission lines, lateral lines, service lines, and service
connections. The CIAWCA maintains such records. A fee will be assessed to the
person for locating facilities during construction, mapping of those
facilities, and subsequent maintenance of the such records.
         a.   The person shall be required to submit construction drawings to
the CIAWCA prior to beginning construction and shall be required to submit
record drawings to the CIAWCA upon completion of construction and prior to
discharging to the regional sewer system.
         b.   The fee structure is a flat rate for locating and mapping of the
constructed facilities plus an incremental fee for the number of units or ERUs
assessed to the project by the CIAWCA.
   E.   Responsible Entity For Payment Of Sewer Service Charge: As the CIAWCA
is a regional sewer system composed of several public agencies, some of which
maintain ownership and control of their own separate wastewater collection or
treatment systems, payment of any separate sewer service charges is the
responsibility of persons utilizing those separate systems, except as provided
for herein.
The owner of property to which sewer services are provided by the CIAWCA shall
be responsible for the payment of the sewer service charge assessed to that
property. Owners of rental properties shall be responsible to pay the sewer
service charge for all rental units. The CIAWCA shall bill the sewer service
charge to the property owner for all rental units where CIAWCA sewer services
are provided. For example, if a property owner owns a duplex, the property
owner shall be billed for the sewer service to both rental units at the duplex
and be responsible to pay the sewer service charge to the CIAWCA. Likewise, if
a property owner owns an apartment building with twenty (20) units in it to
which the CIAWCA provides sewer services, then the property owner shall be
responsible to pay the CIAWCA's sewer service charge for the twenty (20) units.
   F.   Sewer Service Charge Relief:

still owing upon the utility bill for the forfeiture of all deposits, plus a
turn on/off fee, and, if applicable, an additional after hours turn on/off fee
if performed at a time other than normal CIAWCA business hours, as well as the
deposit required by this chapter; provided, however, that payment of the amount
remaining after forfeiture of all deposits shall not be required in the event
that the party whose sewer service has been suspended for nonpayment has filed
a petition for relief under chapter 7, 11 or 13 of title 11 of the United
States Code, and this delinquent bill either has been listed or is eligible to
be listed on the schedule of unsecured creditors. The turn on/off fee and the
after hours turn on/off fee shall be set from time to time by resolution of the
CIAWCA board.
   M.   Amount Of Deposits: At the time of application for sewer service, or of
application for restoration of terminated sewer service, the owner or occupant
of any lot, property, building or residence requesting such service shall
deposit with the CIAWCA the sum of forty dollars ($40.00) for each service
connection to such lot, property, building or residence in order to guaranty

commencement or restoration of such service, the owner or occupant of any lot,
property, building or residence for which such service is requested shall pay
to the city any and all past due amounts for sewer service due to the CIAWCA by
such owner or occupant, whether such past due amounts are attributable to the
property for which service is now sought or are attributable to other property
served by the CIAWCA currently or previously owned or occupied by the
applicant. For purposes of this section, "owner" shall mean any person or
entity who holds legal or equitable title to the property. For purposes of this
section, "occupant" shall mean a person or entity who is physically in

owner of the property upon which the production building is being moved shall
be responsible for assuring the production building will comply with all

applicable codes; and further to determine that the proposed building,
production building or structure will be consistent with the type of buildings,
production buildings or structures in the area to which it will be moved so as
not to depreciate the value of surrounding property and to ensure that it will
meet with applicable zoning regulations of the city. If a building, production
building or other structure is located more than five (5) miles from the city
limits, all inspections shall, at the discretion of the building inspector or
building official, be done when the unit is brought into the city. The owner,
person responsible for moving the building, or the permittee of a permit issued
under this section shall contact the city building department within five (5)
working days of the time the building is moved into the city and arrange for
the appropriate inspection. It shall be a violation of this chapter and a
misdemeanor for failure to notify the city building department. Fees will be
assessed as referenced in table 1-A of the 1997 uniform building code or in the
corresponding table of any later building code adopted by the city council.
(Ord. 520 §1, 1999)

granted additional time to bring a building, production building or structure
into compliance with all applicable codes, including the building code, if
applicable; provided, said extension or extensions shall not extend more than

sufficient surety bond or cash in an amount to be determined by the city from
information furnished by the building inspector or building official, based
upon the estimated cost that will bring the building, production building, or
structure into compliance with all applicable codes, but such surety bond or
cash shall not exceed the sum of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). (Ord. 362
§1, 1991)

issued authorizing the owner to move the building, production building, or
structure from its present location to the future destination provided in the
written notification in section

appeal stays enforcement action by the city. Such notice shall further state
that any one of the responsible parties may, within ten (10) days following the
effective date of the notice, appeal the matter by submitting a written request
for review by the city council. If such request is submitted, the city council
shall conduct a hearing upon the matter at its next regularly scheduled meeting
(unless a later time is mutually agreed upon), and the council shall decide
whether the notice should be modified, withdrawn, or enforced as written. (Ord.
362 §1, 1991)

Any notice of violation permitted or required to be given for any purpose under
this chapter shall be deemed effective on the date when written notice is hand
delivered or sent certified mail, addressed to the building owner, property
owner and/or designated agent. Nothing herein shall preclude the city from
giving additional oral or written notice at its discretion. If the city does
elect to give any additional notice in any instance, it shall not thereby
become obligated to give such additional notice thereafter in the same or other

constitute a separate violation.
   B.   The property owner of record, as recorded in the records of Bannock
County, of the property upon which a violation of this chapter exists shall be
presumed to be the person having lawful control over a building, production
building or structure moved to a parcel of land owned by the record property
owner. If more than one person shall be recorded as the owner of the property,
said persons shall be jointly and severally presumed to be persons having
lawful control over a structure or parcel of land. This presumption shall not
prevent enforcement of the provisions of this chapter against any person
specified in subsection A of this section.
   C.   Prosecution of an offense, under this section, shall not preclude the
city from seeking a civil remedy as provided in section

15.20.140: OTHER ABATEMENT:
If the property owner or other person served a notice or order by the city
pursuant to this chapter fails to comply with such notice or order, the council
may adopt a resolution finding that a violation of this chapter exists, that
there has been a failure of compliance with a notice to remove or abate the
problem and that action by the city is required to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare in the area affected. Following adoption of such a
resolution, the mayor may direct that employees of the city, or the city's
contractors or agents, go upon the premises in question and remove the
offender's building, production building or other structure. The city shall be
entitled to recover its expense by civil action filed in a court of competent

shall be estopped to deny the validity of any order or action of the city which
could have been timely appealed. (Ord. 362 §1, 1991)

convert or demolish, equip, use or maintain any sign structure in this
jurisdiction, or cause or permit the same to be done, contrary to or in
violation of any provision of this ordinance or of this code. Each day that a
sign is allowed to remain out of compliance with this ordinance or the code may
be deemed a separate violation. Any sign which does not conform to this
ordinance or the code is hereby declared to be a nuisance and may be abated as
provided in the Chubbuck criminal code as now in effect and as it may hereafter
be amended. The city may also seek injunctive relief in a court of competent
jurisdiction. In any civil action, the city may request and the court may award
the city its costs, including a reasonable attorney fee.
      Existing nonconforming signs shall be removed within one hundred twenty
days after the effective date of this ordinance; provided, that permanent signs
lawfully in existence on the effective date of this ordinance may be allowed to
remain if within said one hundred twenty day period such signs receive design
review approval upon applications properly made under the Chubbuck land use
ordinance as now in effect and as it may hereafter be amended. Proposals to
place or erect signs after the effective date of this ordinance which do not
conform to this ordinance or the uniform sign code may be processed in the same
manner as applications for variances under the Chubbuck land use ordinance as
now in effect and as it may hereafter be amended."

in area, or six feet in height, nor shall any such sign be fastened or affixed
to the ground.
      A maximum of five temporary signs, other than signs of a political
nature, shall be allowed for any business, person, or entity at any one time.
Any signs of the same or similar type exceeding this limit may be removed by
the city without notice or compensation.
      A permit shall be obtained from the public works director or the
director's designee for any temporary sign other than those of a political
nature. Upon receiving an application for a permit for temporary signs, the
clerk or the clerk's designee shall make the sign regulations available for
review by applicant.
      No sign shall be affixed in any way to any streetlight or power pole, to
any street or traffic control sign or to any stop sign. Any signs so affixed
may be removed by the city without notice or compensation.
      Temporary signs may remain in place in any non-residential zone not
exceeding sixty days and shall not be replaced by any other temporary sign of
the same or similar type on the same premises for at least sixty days.
Provided, further, that political temporary signs may be erected not earlier
than thirty days before the first election in which the candidate or subject of
the sign will be considered, and shall be removed not later than five days
after the date of the last election that year in which the candidate or subject

signs with electric lighting that are temporary or designed to be portable are
prohibited.
      Temporary signs in residential areas shall not be lighted, nor
illuminated by spot lighting."
      3.   Local Codes: Wherever the uniform sign code refers to a local
electrical code or other local code which has not been adopted by the city,
such references shall be deemed to be a reference to the applicable code
adopted by, or other pertinent provisions of, a statute of the state or
regulation duly promulgated by an administrative agency of the state, as now in
effect or as they may hereafter be amended.
   D.   Filing: Three (3) copies of the 1997 edition of the uniform sign code,

The owner of a production building shall obtain an installation permit from the
building department before installing a production building that will be used
as a residence on a building site or in a mobile home park (production building
cluster arrangement). The applicant shall include, with the application, the
minimum fee charged by the city for a building permit. After the permit is
issued, the owner shall contact the city prior to skirting the unit and arrange
for inspection of the setup to assure compliance with section
15.36.030 of this chapter. (Ord. 361 §1, 1991)
15.36.030: STATE SETUP CODE ADOPTED:

manufactured home set up code and specifically in sections 44-2203, 44-2204 and
44-2205 of the Idaho Code, as now in effect or as may be hereinafter amended,
are adopted by the city as the setup code for production buildings; except for
all provisions regarding venting, which are not adopted by the city and which
provisions as to venting will not be enforced by the city. All production
buildings installed subsequent to the effective date of this chapter shall be
set up in accordance with the standards set forth therein; provided, however,

NEW COMMERCIAL USES OF EXISTING PROPERTY
SECTION:
15.40.010: Application
15.40.020: Compliance Required
15.40.030: Noncompliance
15.40.040: Appeal
15.40.050: Deferral Fees
15.40.010: APPLICATION:
This chapter shall apply to all property within the city, which is put into use
for commercial or industrial purposes after March 1, 1992. "Put into commercial
or industrial use" shall not include mere transfer from an existing user to a
new user of property by sale, conveyance, lease or operation of law, so long as
the use of the property after the transfer is the same as the use before the
transfer.
"Put into commercial or industrial use" shall include a new use or any act to
erect, construct, enlarge, alter, move, remove, convert or make significant
repairs or improvements, or demolish any building, structure or, if applicable,
piece of real estate or to make use of a building structure or piece of real
estate for a different purpose than previously used. Any act requiring issuance
of a building permit, whether issued or not, shall be deemed to require
compliance with this chapter.
"Commercial use" and "industrial use" shall be construed as defined in
 chapter 18.08 of this code. (Ord. 407 §1, 1994: Ord. 397 §1, 1993)
15.40.020: COMPLIANCE REQUIRED:
Any property "put into commercial or industrial use" as defined above after
March 1, 1992, shall be required to be brought substantially into compliance
with the city's then existing ordinances for new commercial construction with
respect to curb, gutter, sidewalk, street and landscaping. (Ord. 397 §1, 1993)
15.40.030: NONCOMPLIANCE:
Any party not complying with this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. In
addition to any criminal sanctions, the city may bring an action in a court of
competent jurisdiction to enjoin the use of the property or to require the
property to be brought into compliance. In any such civil action, the city
shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and attorney fees. (Ord. 397
§1, 1993)
15.40.040: APPEAL:
Any party aggrieved by the provisions of this chapter may petition the city
council for relief from this chapter. Petition to the city council shall be
made by an aggrieved party within ten (10) days from the date the aggrieved
party is notified by the city of the need to bring property into compliance
pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. Petition to the city council shall
be in writing indicating the name of the aggrieved party, the location of the
property and the basis for the appeal. The appeal shall be set for the next
readily available city council meeting unless extended by mutual agreement of
the city clerk or clerk's designee and the aggrieved party. Any relief granted
by the city council will be made only after the city council has considered the
burdens and obligations upon the aggrieved party versus the community need for
the city to provide for uniform and well maintained commercial and industrial
areas to enhance the commercial and industrial appeal of the city to consumers
and other commercial and industrial uses. Any relief from the provisions of
this chapter granted by the city council shall be for a maximum period of one
year with no extensions. In lieu of relief from this chapter for one year, the
city council may require the aggrieved party to pay all applicable deferral
fees set forth in section
15.40.050 of this chapter. In certain situations the city council may find it
inappropriate to order strict compliance with the city code provisions then in
effect with respect to curb, gutter, sidewalk, streets or landscaping. In those
instances, the city council may require substantial compliance but not strict
compliance with the ordinances; provided, however, that any such allowance of
substantial compliance shall be subject to the following grounds:
   A.   This deviation from strict compliance will not be granted upon the
grounds of "impossibility" if compliance is merely inconvenient, burdensome or
difficult for the aggrieved party.
   B.   The circumstances causing the need for a deviation from strict
compliance were not created or allowed to occur by the aggrieved party, the
landowner or any of their agents.
   C.   The circumstances requiring a deviation from strict compliance are
serious, immediate and unavoidable.
   D.   Allowing a deviation from strict compliance will not create a possible
present or future hardship upon any other private party, nor will it be
contrary to the public interest.
   E.   In no event shall deviation from strict compliance be granted merely
because strict compliance would diminish the financial return from use of the
lands in question or because it would reduce the market value of the lands in
question. (Ord. 397 §1, 1993)
15.40.050: DEFERRAL FEES:
In certain instances, installation of curb, gutter, sidewalk and landscaping,
or portions thereof, may be inappropriate due to lack of surrounding
development. In those instances the public works director or the director's
designee shall estimate the cost of having a private contractor install
appropriate curb, gutter, sidewalk, streets and landscaping, or the portions
thereof, that the aggrieved party objects to installing. That sum, plus a
fifteen percent (15%) administrative fee, may be paid by the aggrieved party to
the city in lieu of complying currently with the provisions of this chapter.
This sum of money shall be held in trust by the city solely for future
installation of curb, gutter, sidewalk, streets and landscaping, as the case
may be, upon the subject premises or adjacent or similarly situated premises.
At the determination of the city that the circumstances are appropriate for
installation of the items not installed at the time required by section
15.40.020 of this chapter, the city may use the deferral fees to undertake the
installation of the appropriate portions of curb, gutter, sidewalk, streets or
landscaping not installed when otherwise required by this chapter. The
requirement of a deferral fee shall be only at the direction of the city
council and any aggrieved party who seeks to pay said fee in lieu of complying
with the provisions of section
15.40.020 of this chapter shall be deemed to have consented to the future
installation, at the city's discretion, of those portions of curb, gutter,
sidewalk, streets or landscaping that were deferred pursuant to this section.

chief's designee may, upon request of an aggrieved party, be reviewed and

FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
SECTION:
15.54.005: Purpose
15.54.010: Definitions
15.54.020: General Provisions
15.54.030: Administration
15.54.040: Provisions For Flood Hazard Reduction
15.54.050: Legal Status Provisions
15.54.005: PURPOSE:
   A.   Statutory Authority: The Legislature of the State of Idaho, pursuant to
Idaho Code sections 46-1020, 46-1023, and 46-1024, authorizes local governments
to adopt floodplain management ordinances that identify floodplains and minimum
floodplain development standards to minimize flood hazards and protect human
life, health, and property. Therefore, the Council of the City of Chubbuck,
Idaho does hereby ordain as follows.
   B.   Findings Of Fact:
      1.   The flood hazard areas of the City of Chubbuck are subject to
periodic inundation that results in:
         a.   Loss of life and property;
         b.   Health and safety hazards;
         c.   Disruption of commerce and governmental services;
         d.   Extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and
protection; and
         e.   Impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety, and general welfare.
      2.   These flood losses are caused by development in flood hazard areas,
which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from
flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains
causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
      3.   Local government units have the primary responsibility for planning,
adopting, and enforcing land use regulations to accomplish proper floodplain
management.
   C.   Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to promote public health,
safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to
flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      1.   Protect human life, health, and property;
      2.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
purification and sewage treatment plants, water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in floodplains;
      3.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas;
      4.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      5.   Minimize the need for rescue and emergency services associated with
flooding, generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      6.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      7.   Ensure potential buyers are notified the property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
      8.   Ensure those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
   D.   Objectives And Methods Of Reducing Flood Losses: In order to accomplish
its purpose, this chapter includes methods and provisions to:
      1.   Require that development which is vulnerable to floods, including
structures and facilities necessary for the general health, safety, and welfare
of citizens, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      2.   Restrict or prohibit developments which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood
heights, velocities, or erosion;
      3.   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage or erosion;
      4.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert flood waters or that may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and
      5.   Preserve and restore natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which carry and store flood waters. (Ord. 815 § 2,

               Those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated,
               and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in
FLOOD          order to reduce the extent of the area within a community subject to a "special
PROTECTION     flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system
SYSTEM:        typically includes dams, reservoirs, levees, or dikes. These specialized flood
               modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering
               standards.
               The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be

               A facility that cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located or
FUNCTIONALLY   carried out in close proximity to water, such as a docking or port facility
DEPENDENT USE: necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, or
               ship repair facilities. The term does not include long-term storage, manufacture,
               sales, or service facilities.

ADJACENT GRADE to the proposed walls of a structure. Refer to the FEMA Elevation Certificate for
(HAG):         HAG related to building elevation information.
               A structure that is:
               1.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing
               maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the
               Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the
               National Register;
               2.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as
               contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or to
               a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered
HISTORIC       historic district;
STRUCTURE:     3.   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places and determined as
               eligible by states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by
               the Secretary of the Interior; or
               4.   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places and determined as
               eligible by communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
               either:
                  a.   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior;

               programs.
               A general term used to refer to the several types of revisions and amendments to
               FIRMs that can be accomplished by letter. They include letter of map amendment
               (LOMA), letter of map revision (LOMR), and letter of map revision based on Fill
               (LOMR-F).
               1.   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA): An official amendment, by letter, to an
               effective National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) map. A LOMA establishes a
               property's or structure's location in relation to the special flood hazard area
               (SFHA). LOMAs are usually issued because a property or structure has been
               inadvertently mapped as being in the floodplain but is actually on natural high
               ground above the base flood elevation.
               2.   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR): FEMA's modification to an effective flood
               insurance rate map (FIRM) or a flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM) or both. LOMRs
               are generally based on the implementation of physical measures that affect the
               hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in the
               modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood
LETTER OF MAP  elevations (BFEs), or the special flood hazard area (SFHA). The LOMR officially
CHANGE (LOMC): revises the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) or flood boundary and floodway map
               (FBFM), and sometimes the flood insurance study (FIS) report, and when appropriate,
               includes a description of the modifications. The LOMR is generally accompanied by an
               annotated copy of the affected portions of the FIRM, FBFM, or FIS report.
               3.   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F): FEMA's modification of the
               special flood hazard area (SFHA) shown on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) based
               on the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway. The LOMR-F does
               not change the FIRM, FBFM, or FIS report.
               4.   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR): A formal review and comment as to
               whether a proposed flood protection project or other project complies with the
               minimum NFIP requirements for such projects with respect to delineation of special
               flood hazard areas. A CLOMR does not revise the effective flood insurance rate map
               (FIRM) or flood insurance study (FIS). Upon submission and approval of certified as-
               built documentation, a letter of map revision (LOMR) may be issued by FEMA to revise
               the effective FIRM. Building permits and/or flood development permits cannot be
               issued based on a CLOMR, because a CLOMR does not change the NFIP map.
               A man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed
LEVEE:         according to sound engineering practices, to contain, control, or divert the flow of
               water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.
               A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees, and associated
LEVEE SYSTEM:  structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated
               in accordance with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST         The lowest point of the ground level next to the structure. Refer to the FEMA
ADJACENT GRADE elevation certificate for LAG related to building elevation information.
(LAG):
               The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or
               flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
LOWEST FLOOR:  storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest
               floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in
               violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of 44 CFR Part 60.3
               and this chapter.
               A structure, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and
MANUFACTURED   designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the
HOME:          required utilities. The term "Manufactured Home" does not include a "recreational
               vehicle."
MANUFACTURED   A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured
HOME PARK OR   home lots for rent or sale.
SUBDIVISION:
               The building value, not including the land value and that of any accessory
MARKET VALUE:  structures or other improvements on the lot. Market value may be established by
               independent certified appraisal; replacement cost depreciated for age of building
               and quality of construction (actual cash value); or adjusted tax assessed values.
               For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), the National Geodetic
MEAN SEA       Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum (such as North America Vertical Datum
LEVEL:         of 1988 - NAVD88) to which base flood elevations (BFEs) shown on a community's FIRM
               are referenced.
               Describes a condition where there is a river, flow, or inundation of liquid mud down
               a hillside usually as a result of a dual condition of loss of brush cover and the
MUDSLIDE       subsequent accumulation of water on the ground preceded by a period of unusually
(I.E.,         heavy or sustained rain. A mudslide (i.e., mudflow) may occur as a distinct
MUDFLOW):      phenomenon while a landslide is in progress, and will be recognized as such by the
               Administrator only if the mudflow, and not the landslide, is the proximate cause of
               damage that occurs.
MUDSLIDE       The operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for
(I.E.,         reducing mudslide (i.e., mudflow) damage, including but not limited to emergency

REGULATORY     See FLOODWAY.
FLOODWAY:
               To bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local
               floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the
REMEDY A       impacts of its non-compliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting
VIOLATION:     the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the
               enforcement provisions of the chapter or otherwise deterring future similar
               violations, or reducing federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or
               other development.
REPETITIVE     An NFIP-insured structure that has had at least two (2) paid flood losses of more
LOSS           than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) each in any ten (10) year period since 1978.
STRUCTURE:
RIVERINE:      Relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream,
               brook, etc.
SPECIAL FLOOD  The land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent (1%) or
HAZARD AREA    greater chance of flooding in any given year. For purposes of these regulations, the
(SFHA):        term "special flood hazard area" is synonymous in meaning with the phrase "area of
               special flood hazard".
               Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued,
               provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
               addition placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of
               the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
               construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the
               installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
               excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
START OF       construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and
CONSTRUCTION:  filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does
               it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the
               erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
               accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not
               part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of
               construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other
               structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
               dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE:     A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is
               principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
               Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the
               structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%)
               of its market value before the damage occurred. See definition of "substantial
SUBSTANTIAL    improvement." Substantial damage also means flood-related damage sustained by a
DAMAGE:        structure on two (2) separate occasions during a ten (10) year period for which the
               cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or
               exceeds twenty five percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before the
               damage occurred.
               Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure,
               the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
               structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes
               structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair
               work performed. The term does not, however, include either:
SUBSTANTIAL    1.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of
IMPROVEMENT:   state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been
               identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum
               necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
               2.   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not
               preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure" and the
               alteration is approved by variance issued pursuant to this chapter.
TEMPERATURE    Having the temperature regulated by a heating and/or cooling system, built-in or
CONTROLLED:    appliance.
VARIANCE:      A grant of relief by the governing body from a requirement of this chapter.

meeting requirements of section
15.54.040B.7. of this chapter.
      4.   Determinations For Existing Buildings And Structures: For
applications for building permits to improve buildings and structures,
including alterations, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, change of
occupancy, additions, rehabilitations, renovations, improvements, repairs of
damage, and any other improvement of or work on such buildings and structures,
the Floodplain Administrator, in coordination with the Building Official,
shall:
         a.   Estimate the market value, or require the applicant to obtain an
appraisal of the market value prepared by a qualified independent appraiser, of
the building or structure before the start of construction of the proposed
work. In the case of repair, the market value of the building or structure
shall be the market value before the damage occurred and before any repairs are
made;
         b.   Compare the cost to perform the improvement, the cost to repair a
damaged building to its pre-damaged condition, or the combined costs of
improvements and repairs, if applicable, to the market value of the building or
structure;
         c.   Determine and document whether the proposed work constitutes
substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage; and
         d.   Notify the applicant if it is determined that the work
constitutes substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage and that
compliance with the flood resistant construction requirements of the adopted
Idaho Building Code and this Chapter is required.
   D.   Corrective Procedures:
      1.   Violations To Be Corrected: When the Floodplain Administrator finds
violations of applicable State and local laws, it shall be his or her duty to
notify the owner or occupant of the building of the violation. The owner or
occupant shall immediately remedy each of the violations of law cited in such
notification.
      2.   Actions In Event Of Failure To Take Corrective Action: If the owner
of a building or property shall fail to take prompt corrective action, the
Floodplain Administrator shall give the owner written notice, by certified or
registered mail to the owner's last known address or by personal service,
stating:
         a.   That the building or property is in violation of the floodplain
management regulations;
         b.   That a hearing will be held before the Floodplain Administrator
at a designated place and time, not later than ten (10) days after the date of
the notice, at which time the owner shall be entitled to be heard in person or
by counsel and to present arguments and evidence pertaining to the matter; and
         c.   That following the hearing, the Floodplain Administrator may
issue an order to alter, vacate, or demolish the building; or to remove fill as
applicable.
      3.   Order To Take Corrective Action: If, upon a hearing held pursuant to
the notice prescribed above, the Floodplain Administrator shall find that the
building or development is in violation of this chapter, he or she shall issue
an order in writing to the owner, requiring the owner to remedy the violation
within a specified time period, not less than sixty (60) calendar days, nor
more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days. Where the Floodplain
Administrator finds that there is imminent danger to life or other property, he
or she may order that corrective action be taken in such lesser period as maybe
feasible.
      4.   Appeal: Any owner who has received an order to take corrective
action may appeal the order to the local elected governing body by giving
notice of appeal in writing to the Floodplain Administrator and the Clerk
within ten (10) days following issuance of the final order. In the absence of
an appeal, the order of the Floodplain Administrator shall be final. The local
governing body shall hear an appeal within a reasonable time and may affirm,
modify and affirm, or revoke the order.
      5.   Failure To Comply With Order: If the owner of a building or property
fails to comply with an order to take corrective action for which no appeal has
been made or fails to comply with an order of the governing body following an
appeal, the owner shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished at the
discretion of the court.
   E.   Variance Procedures:
      1.   The City Council, hereinafter referred to as the "appeal board,"
shall hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of this
chapter.
      2.   Variances may be issued for:
         a.   The repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon the
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure and that the variance
is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure;
         b.   Functionally dependent facilities, if determined to meet the
definition as stated in section
15.54.020 of this chapter, provided provisions of divisions E.8.b through
E.8.d. of this section, have been satisfied, and such facilities are protected
by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threats to public safety; or
         c.   Any other type of development, provided it meets the requirements
of this section.
      3.   In passing upon variances, the appeal board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and:
         a.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         b.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         c.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         d.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         e.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location as defined
under section
15.54.010 of this chapter as a functionally dependent facility, where
applicable;
         f.   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to
flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
         g.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         h.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
         i.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         j.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         k.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      4.   The applicant shall include a written report addressing each of the
above factors in division E.3. of this section with their application for a
variance.
      5.   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of
this chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this
chapter.
      6.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation (BFE) and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and that such construction
below the BFE increases risks to life and property, and that the issuance of a
variance to construct a structure below the BFE will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty five dollars ($25.00) per one
hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage. Such notification shall be
maintained with a record of all variance actions, including justification for
their issuance.
      7.   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency and the State of Idaho upon request.

structure in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or
ordinances.
         b.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
the variance would result in any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge.
         c.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
         d.   Variances shall only be issued prior to development permit
approval.
         e.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
            (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship; and
            (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      9.   A variance may be issued for solid waste disposal facilities or
sites, hazardous waste management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical
storage facilities that are located in special flood hazard areas provided that
all of the following conditions are met.
         a.   The use serves a critical need in the community.
         b.   No feasible location exists for the use outside the special flood
hazard area.
         c.   The lowest floor of any structure is elevated or floodproofed to
at least the flood protection elevation.
         d.   The use complies with all other applicable federal, state and
local laws.
      10.   The City of Chubbuck will notify the State NFIP Coordinator of the
Idaho Department of Water Resources of its intention to grant a variance at

such decision to the court, as provided in Idaho Code. (Ord. 815 §
15.54.040: PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION:
   A.   General Standards: In all special flood hazard areas the following
provisions are required:
      1.   All new construction, substantial improvements, and development
shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and
hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
      2.   All new construction, substantial improvements, and development
shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood
damage in accordance with the Technical Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant
Materials Requirements, and available from the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
      3.   All new construction, substantial improvements, and development
shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages.
      4.   All new and replacement electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing,
air conditioning equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/
or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding to the flood protection elevation.
These include, but are not limited to, HVAC equipment, water softener units,
bath/kitchen fixtures, ductwork, electric/gas meter panels/boxes, utility/cable
boxes, hot water heaters, and electric outlets/switches.
      5.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
      6.   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
      7.   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
      8.   A fully enclosed area, of new construction and substantially
improved structures, which is below the lowest floor used solely for parking,
access, and storage shall:
         a.   Be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials at least to
the flood protection elevation; and
         b.   Include, in Zones A, AE, AH, and AO flood openings to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the
entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed
the following minimum design criteria:
            (1)   A minimum of two (2) flood openings on different sides of
each enclosed area subject to flooding;
            (2)   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one
(1) square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
            (3)   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed
area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and
exit;
            (4)   The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher
than one foot (1') above the interior or exterior adjacent grade;
            (5)   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or
other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of
floodwaters in both directions; and
            (6)   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or flood resistant wood underpinning, regardless of
structural status, is considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as
outlined above.
      9.   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a
structure, which is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, shall
meet the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this chapter.
      10.   Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the repair, reconstruction,
or replacement of a building or structure existing on the effective date of
this chapter and located totally or partially within the floodway, or stream
setback, provided there is no additional encroachment below the flood
protection elevation in the floodway, or stream setback, and provided that such
repair, reconstruction, or replacement meets all of the other requirements of
this chapter.
      11.   New solid waste disposal facilities and sites, hazardous waste
management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage facilities shall not
be permitted, except by variance as specified in section
15.54.030E.9. of this chapter. A structure or tank for chemical or fuel storage
incidental to an allowed use or to the operation of a water treatment plant or
wastewater treatment facility may be located in a special flood hazard area
only if the structure or tank is either elevated or floodproofed to at least
the flood protection elevation and certified in accordance with the provisions
of section
15.54.030C.3. of this chapter.
      12.   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall be
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and determined to be
reasonably safe from flooding.
      13.   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall
have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water
systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
      14.   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall
have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
      15.   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall
have received all necessary permits from those governmental agencies for which
approval is required by federal or state law, including Section 404 of the
Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 USC § 1334.
      16.   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals greater
than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is the lesser, shall include
within such proposals base flood elevation data.
      17.   When a structure is partially located in a special flood hazard
area, the entire structure shall meet the requirements for new construction and
substantial improvements.
      18.   When a structure is located in multiple flood hazard zones or in a
flood hazard risk zone with multiple base flood elevations, the provisions for
the more restrictive flood hazard risk zone and the highest base flood
elevation (BFE) shall apply.
   B.   Specific Standards: In all special flood hazard areas where base flood
elevation (BFE) data has been provided, as set forth in sections
15.54.020B. of this chapter, or division D. of this section, the following
provisions, in addition to the provisions of division A. of this section, are

improvements, and development of any residential structure (including
manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated
no lower than the flood protection elevation, as defined in section
15.54.020 of this chapter.
      2.   Non-Residential Construction: New construction, substantial
improvements, and development of any commercial, industrial, or other non-
residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated
no lower than the flood protection elevation, as defined in section
15.54.010 of this chapter. Structures located in Zones A, AE, AH, and AO may be
floodproofed to the flood protection elevation in lieu of elevation provided
that all areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below the flood protection elevation are watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural components
having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the
effect of buoyancy. For AH and AO Zones, the floodproofing elevation shall be
in accordance with division F.2. of this section. A registered professional
engineer or architect shall certify that the floodproofing standards of this
subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator as set forth in section
15.54.030C.3. of this chapter, along with the operational plan and the
inspection and maintenance plan.
      3.   Manufactured Homes:
         a.   New and replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that
the lowest floor of the manufactured home is no lower than the flood protection
elevation, as defined in section

anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, either
by certified engineered foundation system, or in accordance with the most
current edition of the Idaho Division of Building Safety's "Idaho Manufactured
Home Installation Standard" in accordance with Idaho Code section 44-2201(2).
Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis
thirty six inches (36") or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall
be supported by reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation
of the chassis is above thirty six inches (36") in height, an engineering
certification is required.
         c.   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the
requirements of division A.8. of this section.
         d.   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved, or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood prone areas. This
plan shall be filed with and approved by the Floodplain Administrator and the
local Emergency Management Coordinator.

the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      5.   Recreational Vehicles: Recreational vehicles shall be either:
         a.   Temporary Placement: Be on site for fewer than one hundred eighty
(180) consecutive days and be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a
recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking
system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities, and
has no permanently attached additions); or
         b.   Permanent Placement: Recreational vehicles that do not meet the
limitations of temporary placement shall meet all the requirements for new
construction, as set forth in division A. of this section.
      6.   Temporary Non-Residential Structures: Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a plan for the removal of such structure
(s) in the event of a flash flood or other type of flood warning notification.
The following information shall be submitted in writing to the Floodplain
Administrator for review and written approval:
         a.   A specified time period for which the temporary use will be

         c.   The time frame prior to the event at which a structure will be
removed (i.e., immediately upon flood warning notification);
         d.   A copy of the contract or other suitable instrument with the
entity responsible for physical removal of the structure; and
         e.   Designation, accompanied by documentation, of a location outside
the special flood hazard area, to which the temporary structure will be moved.
         f.   Temporary structures in the floodway must provide a hydraulic and
hydrology analysis along with a no-rise certification.
      7.   Accessory Structures (Appurtenant Structures): When accessory
structures (sheds, detached garages, etc.) used solely for parking, and storage
are to be placed within a special flood hazard area, elevation or floodproofing
certifications are required for all accessory structures in accordance with

must not be more than two feet (2') below the exterior lowest adjacent grade
(LAG).
         b.   The height of the below-grade crawlspace, measured from the
interior grade of the crawlspace to the top of the crawlspace foundation wall,
must not exceed four feet (4') at any point.
         c.   There must be an adequate drainage system that removes
floodwaters from the interior area of the crawlspace. The enclosed area should
be drained within a reasonable time after a flood event.
         d.   The velocity of floodwaters at the site should not exceed five
feet (5') per second for any crawlspace.
         e.   Buildings that have below-grade crawlspaces will have higher
flood insurance premiums than buildings that have the preferred crawlspace
construction, with the interior elevation of the crawlspace soil at or above
the base flood elevation (BFE).
      10.   Other Development In Regulated Floodways:
         a.   Fences that have the potential to block the passage of
floodwaters, such as stockade fences and wire mesh fences, in regulated
floodways shall meet the limitations of division E. of this section.
         b.   Retaining walls, bulkheads, sidewalks, and driveways that involve
the placement of fill in regulated floodways shall meet the limitations of
division E. of this section.
         c.   Roads and watercourse crossings, including roads, bridges,
culverts, low-water crossings, and similar means for vehicles or pedestrians to

LOMR shall be posted by the mine/property owner with the City of Chubbuck to
cover the estimated costs of a reclamation LOMR as determined by the mine/
property owner and shall provide supporting documentation for the estimated
LOMR cost. A reclamation LOMR shall be completed within one year of the
completion of mining. Upon failure of the property owner to obtain a
reclamation LOMR of the mining site within one year, the reclamation plan bond
for LOMR will be forfeited.
      11.   Subdivision Plats: Flood Zones: A note must be provided on the
final plat documenting the current flood zone in which the property or
properties are located. The boundary line must be drawn on the plat in
situations where two (2) or more flood zones intersect over the property or
properties being surveyed.
         FEMA FIRM panel(s): #160xxxxxxC, & 160xxxxxxE, etc.
         FIRM effective date(s): mm/dd/year
         Flood Zone(s): Zone X, Zone A, Zone AE, Zone AO, Zone, AH, Zone D,
etc.
         Base Flood Elevation(s): AE____.0 ft., etc.
         Flood Zones are subject to change by FEMA & all land within a floodway
or floodplain is regulated by Chapter 15.54 of Chubbuck City Code.
      12.   Critical Facilities:
         As a best practice, FEMA recommends protection that exceeds code
minimums. For example, FEMA 543, Design Guide for Improving Critical Facility
Safety from Flooding and High Winds (2007) recommends protecting critical
facilities to withstand at least a 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood event (often
called the "500-year flood event"). Flood elevations for the 0.2-percent-
annual-chance flood may be greater than the elevation specified by ASCE 24. If
federal funding or other federal action is involved, the requirements of
Executive Order 11988 - Floodplain Management may necessitate protection of
critical actions to the 500-year flood elevation (critical actions may include
the construction and repair of critical facilities).
         In existing facilities that have not been substantially damaged, it
may not be possible to floodproof or elevate to provide protection from the
0.2-percent-annual-chance flood event. In those instances, floodproofing or
elevating as high as practical is recommended.
   C.   Standards For Floodplains Without Established Base Flood Elevations:
      Within the special flood hazard areas designated as Zone A (also known as
Unnumbered A Zones) and established in section
15.54.020B of this chapter, where no base flood elevation (BFE) data has been
provided by FEMA, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of
division A. of this section shall apply:
      The BFE used in determining the flood protection elevation (FPE) shall be
determined based on the following criteria:
      1.   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is available from other
sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas
shall also comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter and shall be
elevated or floodproofed in accordance with standards in divisions A. and B. of
this section.
      2.   When floodway data is available from a federal, state, or other
source, all new construction and substantial improvements within floodway areas
shall also comply with the requirements of divisions B. and E. of this section.
      3.   Require that all new subdivision proposals and other proposed
developments (including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions)
greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is the lesser,
include within such proposals base flood elevation data. Such base flood
elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by reference in accordance with section
15.54.020B. of this chapter and utilized in implementing this chapter. The
applicant/developer shall submit an application for a conditional letter of map
revision (CLOMR) prior to preliminary plat approval and have obtained a letter
of map revision (LOMR) prior to any building permits for structures being
issued.
      4.   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available from a
federal, state, or other source as outlined above, the lowest floor shall be
elevated or floodproofed (non-residential) to two feet (2') above the highest
adjacent grade (HAG) at the building site or to the flood protection elevation
(FPE) whichever is higher, as defined in section
15.54.020 of this chapter. All other applicable provisions of division B. of
this section shall also apply.
   D.   Standards For Riverine Floodplains With Base Flood Elevations But
Without Established Floodways. Along rivers and streams where base flood
elevation (BFE) data is provided by FEMA or is available from another source
but floodways are not identified for a special flood hazard area on the FIRM or
in the FIS report, the following requirements shall apply to all development
within such areas:
      1.   Standards of divisions A. and B. of this section; and
      2.   Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no encroachments,
including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development shall be permitted unless certification with supporting technical
data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the
community.
   E.   Standards For Floodways: Areas designated as floodways located within
the special flood hazard areas established in section
15.54.020B. of this chapter. The floodways are extremely hazardous areas due to
the velocity of floodwaters that have erosion potential and carry debris and
potential projectiles. The following provisions, in addition to standards
outlined in divisions A. and B. of this section, shall apply to all development
within such areas:
      1.   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other developments shall be permitted unless:
         a.   It is demonstrated that the proposed encroachment would not
result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice and presented to the Floodplain Administrator
prior to issuance of floodplain development permit; or
         b.   A conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) has been approved by
FEMA. A letter of map revision (LOMR) must also be obtained within six (6)
months of completion of the proposed encroachment.
      2.   If division E.1. of this section is satisfied, all development shall
comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this chapter.
      3.   Manufactured homes may be permitted provided the following
provisions are met:
         a.   The anchoring and the elevation standards of division B.3. of
this section; and
         b.   The encroachment standards of division E.1. of this section.
   F.   Standards For Areas Of Shallow Flooding (Zone AO, AH, AR/AO, Or AR/AH):
Areas designated as shallow flooding areas have special flood hazards
associated with base flood depths of one foot (1') to three feet (3') where a
clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate. In addition to divisions A. and B. of this
section, all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
following requirements:
      1.   The lowest floor shall be elevated at least as high as the depth
number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), in feet, plus a
freeboard of two feet (2'), above the highest adjacent grade; or at least two
feet (2') above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
      2.   Non-residential structures may, in lieu of elevation, be
floodproofed to the same level as required in division F.1. of this section so
that the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities,
below that level shall be watertight with walls substantially impermeable to
the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
Certification is required in accordance with section
15.54.030C.3. of this chapter, and division B.2. of this section.
      3.   Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around structures on
slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. (Ord. 815
§ 2, 6-3-2020)

16.12.010: APPLICATION:
The following standards shall apply to design, installation, alteration or
repair of any improvements to lands which are open to public use within the
jurisdiction of the city. These standards are applicable to those residential
areas where buildings are small and of low height and where the ratio of the
area occupied by buildings to lot area conforms to the latest city land use
ordinance. For multi-story residential development, design standards shall be
prescribed by the city public works director based upon applicable national
codes. (Ord. 754, 2016)
16.12.020: STREETS:
   A.   The arrangements, character, extent, width, grade and location of all
streets shall conform to the comprehensive plan and, if adopted, the master
street map, shall integrate harmoniously with existing and planned streets,
shall be appropriate to topographical conditions, shall enhance the public
convenience and safety and shall facilitate the proposed uses of the land to be
served by such streets.
   B.   Local residential streets shall be designed to discourage their use by
through traffic. Where a development abuts or contains an existing or proposed
arterial street, railroad or limited access highway, the city may require
frontage streets, reverse frontage streets, or such other treatment for the
appropriate use of the tract.
   C.   There shall be provided rights of way of such width and as provided in
the comprehensive plan; provided, however, that the width of said rights of way
shall in no case be less than the following:
Type Of Street Right Of Way Width Standard Back To Back Swale Section Curb To

               55 feet            -                     37 feet
 
Types of streets within a development shall be determined by the city
consistent with the comprehensive plan, developments that were in process prior
to August 1, 2005, and, if adopted, the master street map.
   D.   Cul-de-sac streets shall terminate in a circular turnaround with the
right of way radius of at least fifty five feet (55'). The city may approve an
equally convenient form of turning space where conditions justify. The maximum
length of a cul-de-sac street shall not exceed one thousand feet (1,000') from
the entrance to the center of the turnaround based upon a design standard of
having not more than thirty (30) single-family residential units. In making
this determination, the use of the property, density of such use, accessibility
to fire hydrants, alternate methods of accessing the property in an emergency,
topography, width of the street, and anticipated volume of traffic and other
such factors as determined by the city to be relevant shall be considered. Cul-
de-sac streets in a commercial development with moderate to high traffic flow
shall generally be shorter than those in a residential development with low
traffic flow.
   E.   Dead end streets will not be approved except in locations designated by
the city as necessary to future extensions in development of adjacent lands. In
any case, a dead end street serving more than four (4) lots shall provide by
easement a temporary turning circle with a forty foot (40') radius or other
acceptable design to accomplish adequate access.
   F.   Temporary dead end streets created by phased development shall not
serve more than ninety (90) residential units without a permanent secondary
access.
   G.   Streets shall be planned to intersect as nearly as possible at right
angles, but in no event at less than seventy degrees (70°). Streets
intersecting an arterial shall do so at a ninety degree (90°) angle.
   H.   Where any street deflects at an angle of ten degrees (10°) or more, a
connection curve shall be required having a minimum centerline radius of three
hundred feet (300') for arterial and collector streets and one hundred twenty
five feet (125') for local streets.
   I.   Streets with centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty five
feet (125') shall be avoided.
   J.   A tangent at least one hundred feet (100') long shall be provided
between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.
   K.   At street intersections, property line corners shall be rounded by a
circular arc, said arc having a minimum tangent length of twenty feet (20').
   L.   Street intersections with more than four (4) legs and Y type
intersections where legs meet at acute angles shall be avoided. "T"
intersections, rather than "cross" intersections, shall be utilized to the
maximum extent possible in residential developments.
   M.   Maximum and minimum grades for all streets shall be as determined by
the city.
   N.   Alleys, twenty feet (20'), when single-family residence units abut both
sides; twenty four feet (24') if abutting multiple- family, commercial, or
industrial districts. Dead end alleys shall be avoided.
   O.   Streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the development,
unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions or unless the city
determines that such extension is not desirable for coordination of the
development with the existing layout or the most advantageous future
development of adjacent tracts. However, streets carrying nonresidential
traffic, especially truck traffic, shall not normally be extended to the
boundaries of adjacent existing or potential residential areas, or connected to
streets intended for predominantly residential traffic.
   P.   Excessively long, straight local streets in residential areas,
conducive to high speed traffic, shall be prohibited according to the
determination of the city. Traffic calming techniques may be used as approved
by the city.
   Q.   Pedestrian walks on both sides of a street, within the street right of
way, together with concrete curbs and gutters approved by the city, and paved
vehicular traffic area, shall be required on all streets in a proposed
development.
   R.   Access to streets shall conform to the "standard approach policy"
promulgated by the division of highways, state department of transportation.
   S.   Any areas in the street right of way or the adjacent area between the
street and the owner's or developer's property line that is not able to be
landscaped shall be covered with sidewalk or other such similar treatment so as
to preserve the area for future expansion of the street or for utility usage
but which will minimize the ongoing maintenance and be aesthetically
acceptable. (Ord. 754, 2016: Ord. 846 § 2, 2022)
16.12.025: ACCESS MANAGEMENT:
All streets and roadways shall be designed to conform with the "Access
Management Guidelines" (hereinafter "guidelines") as adopted by the Bannock
Transportation Planning Organization on February 13, 2012, and as may from time
to time be amended; provided, however notwithstanding any language to the
contrary in the guidelines, within the city, table 3a "General Provisions Of
Access Management Guidelines - Arterials", table 3b "General Provisions Of
Access Management Guidelines - Collectors" and table 3c "General Provisions Of
Access Management Guidelines - Local Streets", shall be applied to all areas,
not just in commercial or multi-unit residential developments of more than one
hundred (100) units. Such guidelines shall be utilized by city staff as well as
the design review committee, land use and development commission and the city
council in planning and coordinating the city street system as well as access
between parcels owned by various entities for purposes of minimizing the need
for access to city streets. Access to properties adjoining Yellowstone Avenue
within the city of Chubbuck shall be designed to conform to the more
restrictive of the guidelines or to "Idaho Transportation Department Access
Management Standards And Procedures For Highway Right-Of-Way Encroachments"
adopted March 2011, and as may from time to time be amended. (Ord. 762, 2016)
16.12.030: BLOCKS AND LOTS:
   A.   Block lengths shall not exceed one thousand five hundred feet (1,500')
nor shall they be less than four hundred feet (400'); except, when the average
lot size is one-half (1/2) acre or more, in which case the maximum block length
may be extended to a dimension reasonably determined by the public works
director.
   B.   Block designs shall provide for two (2) tiers of lots, each facing upon
a street, unless the public works director determines that such layout is not
feasible. In addition to pedestrian walks provided elsewhere in this chapter,
dedicated pedestrianways with right of way width of eight feet (8') or greater
may be required where essential, as determined by the public works director,
for circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers,
transportation and other community facilities.
   C.   The minimum area and dimensions of all lots shall conform to the
requirements of the land use (zoning) ordinance of the city, as now in effect
and as it may hereafter be amended, for the district in which the development
is located.
   D.   The side lines of all lots, as far as possible, shall be right angles
to the street which the lot faces, or approximately radial to the center of
curvatures, if such street is curved. Side lines of lots shall be approximately
radial to the center of curvature of the cul-de-sac on which the lot faces.
   E.   Lot widths shall conform to requirements imposed by the city's land use
ordinance, as now in effect and as it may hereafter be amended; but in no event
shall such widths be less than thirty feet (30') at the street right of way
line. Yard widths for lots located on cul-de-sacs or on curved sections of
roadway may be measured at the front yard setback line.
   F.   Corner lots for residential development shall be so designed as to
permit conformance to the street setback requirements of the land use (zoning)
ordinance.
   G.   No lot shall be divided by a city limit line or the boundary line of a
land use (zoning) district. Each such boundary line shall be made a lot line.
   H.   No remnants of land shall be left in the development which do not
conform to lot requirements, or are not required, unless they are suitable and
actually used for common open space, utility easements or other public purpose.
   I.   Lots having frontage on two (2) nonintersecting streets shall be
prohibited except where made necessary, as determined by the public works

covers in the city. Topsoils are to be stockpiled during rough grading and used
on cut and fill slopes. When slopes too steep to support continuous ground
cover have been permitted and in lieu thereof niches and ledges provided for
planting, such slopes need not be planted with a continuous ground cover, but
may instead be screened with vines and plantings. Cuts and fills along public
roads may be required to be landscaped so as to blend into the natural
surroundings. The existing on site vegetation, including trees with a trunk
diameter of four inches (4") or greater and other natural ground cover, shall
be preserved to the maximum extent possible. (Ord. 207 §3-20(I), 1979)
16.16.110: SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS:
   A.   If, at any stage of grading, the public works director determines by
inspection that the nature of the formation is such that further work is likely
to imperil any property, public way, watercourse or drainage structure, he may
require, as a condition to allowing the work to be done, that such reasonable
safety precautions be taken as is considered advisable to avoid likelihood of
such peril. Such precautions may include, but shall not be limited to,
specifying a more level exposed slope, construction of additional drainage
facilities, berms, terracing, compaction, or cribbing, installation of plant
materials for erosion control, and reports of a registered soils engineer and/
or of an accomplished engineer geologist whose recommendation may be made
requirements for further work.
   B.   Where it appears that storm damage may result from work performed under
this chapter, the public works director may direct that the developer take such
measures as may be necessary to protect adjoining property or the public
safety. On large operations or where unusual site conditions prevail, the
public works director may specify the time at which grading may proceed and the
time of completion or may require that the operation be conducted in specific
stages so as to ensure completion of protective measures or devices prior to
the advent of seasonal rains. (Ord. 754, 2016)
16.16.120: REPAIR OF AND SAFEGUARD AGAINST DAMAGE:
If the public works director determines that public facilities, or facilities
to be dedicated to the public, are being damaged in the course of development,
the public works director may issue a directive to responsible parties that
development work cease until the damage is repaired and safeguards adopted to
prevent further damage. Parties adversely affected by such directive shall be
entitled to hearing under procedures provided with respect to "stop work"
orders in the international building code. The city may enforce the public
works director's directive in the manner provided in said code. (Ord. 754,
2016)
16.16.130: SPECIAL DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION METHODS FOR TERRAIN PROBLEMS:
No development shall be undertaken with respect to land that is subject to
periodic flooding, poor drainage, excessive slopes or other terrain problems,

17.12.020: PLANNING CONFERENCE:
   A.   During the phase described in section
17.12.010 of this chapter, the developer meets with the Community Services
Director and together they review the development proposal for conformity to
the City’s comprehensive plan and for compliance with all applicable laws and
ordinances.
   B.   At least seven (7) calendar days prior to the desired meeting time, the
developer shall submit to the Community Services Director sketch plans and
narrative statement of intentions regarding:
      1.   Nature of land use;
      2.   Municipal services and public utilities;
      3.   Vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      4.   Structures and improvements;
      5.   Lot and block layout;
      6.   Open space for recreation and public facilities;
      7.   Relationship with land use and development on adjoining property;
and
      8.   Proof of ownership, agency for the owner or option or purchase from
the owner, of the land to be developed.
   C.   The Community Services Director shall:
      1.   Review the developer’s proposal and require the submission of such
additional materials as may be needed to determine in general whether the
proposal conforms to the comprehensive plan and complies with applicable laws
and ordinances;
         a.   If the proposal does not encompass all of the land which the
developer ultimately seeks to develop, the developer shall prepare for the
Community Services Director’s review a master plan relating to the entire area,
containing the elements set forth in subsection B of this section,
         b.   The master plan shall serve as a framework for evaluating
specific development proposals within the subject area and shall be updated
whenever required by changing circumstances;
      2.   Advise the developer in writing of his preliminary finding as to
whether the development proposal (together with master plan, if applicable)
appears to conform to the City’s comprehensive plan and to comply with all
applicable laws and ordinances;
         a.   Where there is an apparent lack of such conformity or compliance
the Community Services Director may recommend actions to remedy the problem,
         b.   The Community Services Director’s preliminary finding or
recommendation shall be duly considered but shall not be binding upon the City
in the course of reviewing plats thereafter submitted;
      3.   Determine whether the proposal involves the subdivision of land,
creation of a street or constitutes a subdivision as specified in subsections
17.04.040B1 and B2 of this title;
         a.   If so, the Community Services Director shall direct the developer
to submit a preliminary plat,
         b.   If the proposal neither involves creation of a street nor
constitutes a subdivision, but is governed by this title because it is a
project as provided in subsection
17.04.040B3 of this title, then the Community Services Director shall further
determine, and advise the developer, whether the proposal potentially has a
sufficient impact upon the City’s comprehensive plan and upon the purpose of
this title to require submission of a preliminary plat;
      4.   Inform the developer of the persons or agencies to whom copies of a
preliminary plat shall be distributed by the developer, as provided in section
17.12.030 of this chapter so that the developer may contact them and ascertain

reasonable time set per section 17.16.070.C.4, the Public Works Director, or
their designee, may declare such developer in default and initiate execution of

fifty percent (150%) of the total estimated costs based on the development cost
estimate in this section, for completing construction of the public
improvements, as approved by the Director.
      5.   Term Length: The financial guarantee shall be in force for a minimum
period of twenty-four (24) months with automatic renewal until the improvements
have been deemed completed by the Director and accepted by the City and shall
continue until all contractual warranty periods are completed in accordance
with section
17.16.070 of this title. Once all public improvements have been accepted by the
City, at the Developer’s request, seventy-five percent (75%) of the surety or
guarantee may be released and the remaining twenty-five percent (25%) will
remain in effect for the warrantee period of the public improvements in
accordance with section
17.16.070.
      6.   Development Cost Estimate: The Development Cost Estimate shall be
provided by the developer’s engineer of record for review and approval by the
Director.
      7.   Penalty for Case of Failure to Complete Construction of Public
Improvements: If the developer fails to complete construction of the public
improvements within the period of time required by the conditions of the
guarantee, the city may at the city’s discretion, either enter into longer
terms with the developer or determine and take necessary action in order to
accomplish completion of the required public improvements. The city may
reimburse itself for the cost and expense thereof by appropriating the
financial guarantee in whichever form provided and if costs to complete the
public improvements exceed the financial guarantee, the city may seek
additional monies from the developer or owners of the property through all
legal means. Longer terms to accomplish completion of the required public
improvements will only be considered if all owners within the bounds of the
development provide their written consent to the extension’s term.
      8.   Release of Guarantee for Improvements Not to be Dedicated to a
Public Agency: Public improvements which are not dedicated to a public agency
yet which require a financial guarantee in accordance with this section are not
subject to the section
17.16.070 warranty period. Following completion of the public improvements
which are not to be dedicated to a public agency, the developer may submit a
written request to the Director for final inspection. To receive approval, the
improvements must be fully functional and able to be utilized by lot owners
within the development. If the Director determines that the developer completed
the work in accordance with the development agreement requirements, the
Director may consider the inspection final and authorize release of the
financial guarantee covering those improvements. If the inspection discloses
work not completed in accordance with requirements of the development
agreement, the Director shall not declare that portion of the project complete
until such time that noncompliant issues are addressed to the satisfaction of
the Director.
   B.   Sidewalk Exception: For subdivisions where the City determines it to be
in the best interest of the property owners to install sidewalks at the time of
building rather than at the time of subdivision development, the following
procedure will be followed regarding the installation of sidewalks:
      1.   Building Permit/Certificate of Occupancy: A building permit may be
issued on a building occupying a lot when the required sidewalk has not been
installed under the following conditions:
         a.   The building permit will clearly note that the sidewalks shall be
installed prior to the receipt of a final Certificate of Occupancy.
         b.   Prior to issuance of a temporary Certificate of Occupancy, a
cashier’s check or cash shall be deposited and held in escrow by the City until
such time that the sidewalks are installed. It shall be the responsibility of
the property owner to request an inspection of the installation and request a
refund of the escrowed funds from the City. All refunds of such escrowed funds
shall be subject to the accounts-payable cycle of the city. An inspection by
the Director showing acceptance and compliance of the sidewalks shall be
completed prior to any request for a refund of the escrowed funds.
   c.   From time-to-time, buildable lots may be purchased by an adjoining
landowner, or a non-adjoining landowner, who does not either intend to build on
the lot or who does not intend to build on the lot in a pace consistent with
the development’s build-out. In such cases, to connect the pedestrian
infrastructure in the development, the City may compel construction of the
sidewalk by the property owner within ninety calendar days (90), weather-
permitting, and if not completed, the city may construct the sidewalk and/or
seek remedy in accordance with section
17.20.050. (Ord. 853 § 2, 2022)
17.20.020: SALE OF LAND IN DEVELOPMENT:
No owner, or agent of the owner, of any land located within a development,
shall transfer or sell any such land by reference to, in exhibition of, or by
use of any map, plan or plat of the development before the final plat required
by this title has been approved and recorded. Any sale or transfer contrary to
the provisions of this section is voidable within one year at the option of the
buyer. The description of the land in question by metes and bounds in the
instrument(s) used in the process of selling or transferring such land shall
not exempt the transaction from the provisions of this section. (Ord. 754,
2016)
17.20.030: LOCATION OF STRUCTURES AND IMPROVEMENTS:
No structures or improvements, except those to be dedicated to the public as
provided in this title, shall be built, installed or placed upon any lands
within a development until:
   A.   The final plat of the development has been approved and recorded, and
   B.   All required dedications have been made by the developer and accepted
by the city, or bond, check or line of credit furnished as provided in section
17.16.050 and/or
17.20.010 of this title. (Ord. 754, 2016: Ord. 853 § 2, 2022)
17.20.040: PERMITS AND MUNICIPAL SERVICES:
The city will not maintain streets or furnish water, sewer or sanitation
services within the development, until:
   A.   The final plat (if not waived) of the development has been approved and
recorded, and
   B.   All required dedications have been made by the developer and accepted
by the city.
Neither will the city issue such permits or furnish such services to completed
developments that do not conform to the finally approved and recorded plat.
(Ord. 206 § 4-1(D), 1979: Ord. 853 § 2, 2022)
17.20.050: CIVIL REMEDIES:
Upon failure of compliance with any provision of this title by a developer or
by the owner of land within a development, or by the agent of either of them,
the city may commence injunctive proceedings against any or all of them in a
court of competent jurisdiction, in order to obtain compliance with the title
and to restrain further work from being done with respect to lands in the
development until compliance has been established. In such proceedings, the
city shall request and the court may award the city its costs, according to
court rule, together with a reasonable attorney fee, and such other or further
relief as the court may deem just. (Ord. 206 §4-1(E), 1979)
II. RELIEF
17.20.060: IN GENERAL:
Whenever the lands involved in any development are of such size or
configuration, are subject to such title limitations of record, are affected by
such topographical and location conditions, or will be subject to such land
use, that it would be impossible, or that it would create a private hardship
not required to protect the public interest, to compel a developer to adhere
strictly to certain provisions of this title, the city council may grant relief
from the provisions in question. (Ord. 206 §4-2(A), 1979)
17.20.070: PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING RELIEF:
The developer's request for any relief as provided in this section shall
consist of a written statement, affirmed or given under oath, setting forth in
detail the relief sought and explaining fully the reason(s) for making such
request. This statement shall be filed concurrently with the preliminary plat
or with the request for waiver of the platting requirement, provided in
chapter 17.12 of this title. The request for relief shall be considered
together with the preliminary plat or request for waiver during the hearings
conducted by the city's land use and development commission and city council.
Public notice of such hearings shall refer to the fact that a request for
relief has been made by the developer. If relief is denied, the preliminary
plat (unless waived) and the actual development of the lands in question shall
comply with all provisions of this title. If relief is granted, it shall be
stated with particularity in the minutes of the city council's meeting and
shall be confirmed to the developer by the public works director in writing. In
granting relief, the city council may impose such conditions or additional
requirements as the council deems necessary to secure substantially the
objectives of this title and of the city's comprehensive plan. Such conditions
or additional requirements shall also be stated with particularity in the
minutes of the city council's meeting and confirmed by the public works
director to the developer in writing. These conditions or requirements are
binding upon the developer and may be enforced in the same manner as the
provisions of this title. (Ord. 754, 2016)
17.20.080: LIMITATION UPON GRANTING OF RELIEF:
   A.   No relief shall be granted from the provisions of this title if the
granting of such relief will result in any development inconsistent with the
stated purpose of this title or with the objectives and intent of the city's
comprehensive plan.
   B.   No relief shall be granted upon the grounds of "impossibility", as
provided in this chapter, if compliance is merely inconvenient, burdensome or
difficult.
   C.   No relief shall be granted upon the grounds of "private hardship", as
provided in this chapter, unless:
      1.   The hardship was not created or allowed to occur by the owner, the
developer or any of their agents;
      2.   The hardship was not known or foreseeable at the time when the lands
in question, or an interest therein, were acquired;
      3.   The hardship is serious, immediate and unavoidable; and
      4.   Alleviating the claimed hardship will not create a possible present
or future hardship for any other private party nor will it be contrary to the
public interest.
In no event shall any relief be granted from the provisions of this title
merely because compliance with such provisions will diminish the financial
return from development of the lands in question or because it will restrict
prospective sales or the availability of potential customers. (Ord. 206 §4-2
(C), 1979)
17.20.090: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS:
The criteria of "impossibility" and "hardship" shall not apply to a request for
relief from the provisions of this title if such request is part of a proposal
for establishing a bona fide planned unit development. However, the requested
relief shall not be granted if it appears that the planned unit development
will not be consistent with the stated purpose of this title or with the intent
and objectives of the City of Chubbuck comprehensive plan. The Council, with
the advice of the public works director, shall determine whether a proposal
constitutes a bona fide planned unit development. Such a development must
conform to the definition of a "planned unit development" set forth in
chapter 17.08 of this title and standards set forth in
chapter 18.20 of this title, and the proposal for any such development must be
accompanied by true and accurate copies of the actual legal instruments by
which the development will be controlled and managed, together with such other
information required by this title or as may reasonably be prescribed by the
public works director. (Ord. 754, 2016; amd. Ord. 825, 2021)

17.24.010: LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS:
The City Council of the City of Chubbuck, Idaho, finds that:
   A.   Based on the City of Chubbuck Comprehensive Plan adopted by the City
pursuant to title 67, chapter 65, Idaho Code, including, but not limited to,
the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan, and the general
governmental goal of protecting the health, safety, and general welfare of the
citizens of the City, and its Area of City Impact, it is necessary for: 1)
police public facilities; and 2) emergency services public facilities to
accommodate new development within the City, and its Area of City Impact.
   B.   New residential and nonresidential growth and development imposes and
will impose increasing and excessive demands upon the public facilities.
   C.   The revenues generated from new residential and nonresidential growth
and development often does not generate sufficient funds to provide the
necessary levels of service provided by these public facilities to accommodate
new development.
   D.   New development is expected to continue, and will place ever increasing
demands on the City to provide and expand the public facilities to serve new
development.
   E.   The City has planned for the improvement of the public facilities in
the capital improvements element of the City of Chubbuck Comprehensive Plan and
in the impact fee analysis and the capital improvement plan reviewed and
adopted therewith.
   F.   The creation of an equitable impact fee system in accordance with title
67, chapter 82, Idaho Code enables the City to impose a proportionate share of
the costs of needed improvements to the public facilities to accommodate new
development, and assists the City in implementing the capital improvements
element of the comprehensive plan.
   G.   In order to implement an equitable impact fee system for the public
facilities, the City retained Zions Public Finance, Inc. (“Zions”) to prepare
impact fee studies for these types of facilities five (5) years after adopting
impact fees originally in 2019. The resulting documents are titled:
      Police Capital Improvement Plan and Impact Fee Analysis, and
      Fire and Emergency Services Capital Improvement Plan and Impact Fee
Analysis, and
   all dated 2023 (the “Impact Fee Study”), and recommended for approval by the
Impact Fee Advisory Committee. The studies are on file in the Office of the
City Clerk of the City of Chubbuck. Any reference herein to the Impact Fee
Study shall be to the respective study for that service.
   H.   The Impact Fee Study is consistent with the capital improvements
element of the City of Chubbuck Comprehensive Plan, and uses the levels of
service set forth in the Comprehensive Plan for these public facilities. The
Impact Fee Study sets forth reasonable methodologies and analyses for
determining the impacts of various types of new development on the public
facilities, and determines the cost of acquiring or constructing the
improvements necessary to meet the demands for such public facilities created
by new development.
   I.   The Impact Fee Study uses a calculation methodology in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. This chapter shall not be deemed
invalid because payment of an impact fee may result in an incidental benefit to
others within the service area other than the fee payer.
   J.   The impact fees described in this chapter are based on the Impact Fee
Study, and do not exceed the costs of system improvements for the public
facilities to serve new development that will pay the impact fees.
   K.   The police and emergency services included in the calculation of impact
fees in the Impact Fee Study will benefit all new development throughout the
City, and it is therefore appropriate to treat all areas of the City and the
Area of City Impact as a single service area for purposes of calculating,
collecting and spending the impact fees collected.
   L.   There is both a rational nexus and a rough proportionality between the
development impacts created by each type of development covered by this chapter
and the impact fees that such development will be required to pay.
   M.   This chapter creates a system by which impact fees paid by new
development will be used to finance, defray or to provide capital improvements
for the public facilities in ways that benefit the development for which impact
fees were paid.
   N.   This chapter creates a system under which impact fees shall not be used
to correct existing deficiencies in public facilities, or to replace or
rehabilitate existing public facilities, or to pay for routine operation or
maintenance of those public facilities.
   O.   This chapter creates a system under which there shall be no double
payment of impact fees, in accordance with Idaho Code section 67-8204(19).
   P.   This chapter is consistent with all applicable provisions of title 67,
chapter 82, Idaho Code, concerning impact fee ordinances.
(Ord. 783, 2019: Ord. 867 § 1 (part), 2024)
17.24.020: AUTHORITY, APPLICABILITY, AND EFFECTIVE DATE:
   A.   This chapter is enacted pursuant to the City’s general police powers
pursuant to the authority granted to the City by title 50, Idaho Code, and
pursuant to the authority granted to the City by section 67-8201 et seq., Idaho
Code.
   B.   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all of the territory
within the limits of the City and to any unincorporated areas of the City
within the City’s Area of City Impact where the City has executed an
intergovernmental agreement with Bannock County for purposes of collection or
expenditure of impact fees pursuant to section 67-8204A, Idaho Code, and other
applicable laws of the State of Idaho, or when agreed to by Bannock County
residents in order to receive City of Chubbuck utilities and/or other services.
   C.   This chapter is effective February 26, 2024 (“effective date”), which
effective date is more than thirty (30) days subsequent to the passage,
approval and publication, according to law, of the ordinance codified herein,
which adopted the provisions hereof.
   D.   Applications for building permits received by the City prior to the
effective date hereof, or amendments hereto, adopting impact fees or amending
or adopting any methodology by which impact fees are calculated, will be
subject to adopted development impact fees as set forth by the City Council.
   E.   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, development requirements
for system improvements shall be imposed by the City only by way of impact fees
imposed pursuant to and in accordance with section 67-8201 et seq., Idaho Code,
and this chapter.
(Ord. 783, 2019: Ord. 867 § 1 (part), 2024)
17.24.030: INTENT:
   A.   The intent of this chapter is to promote the health, safety and general
welfare of the residents of the City and its Area of City Impact.
   B.   The intent of this chapter is to be consistent with those principles
for allocating a fair share of the cost of capital improvements to public
facilities to serve new development in compliance with the provisions set forth
in section 67-8201 et seq., Idaho Code. The provisions of this chapter shall be
interpreted, construed and enforced in accordance with the provisions set forth
in section 67-8201 et seq., Idaho Code.
   C.   The intent of this chapter is that impact fees should be charged,
collected, and expended for police and emergency services capital improvements
to increase the service capacity of such categories of public facilities, which
capital improvements are included in approved capital improvements plans that
list the capital improvements that may be funded with impact fees.
   D.   The intent of this chapter is to ensure that:
      1.   Public facilities are available to serve new development;
      2.   New development bears a proportionate share of the cost of police
and emergency services capital improvements to such public facilities;
      3.   Such proportionate share does not exceed the cost of the capital
improvements to such public facilities required to serve new development; and
      4.   The funds collected from new development are used for capital
improvements for public facilities that benefit new development.
   E.   It is not the intent of this chapter to collect any monies from new
development in excess of the actual amount necessary to offset new demands for
capital improvements to public facilities created by such new development.
   F.   It is not the intent of this chapter that the impact fees be used to
remedy any deficiency in police and emergency services capital improvements
existing on the effective date hereof, or ever be used to replace,
rehabilitate, maintain and/or operate any public facilities.
   G.   It is not the intent of this chapter that any monies collected from an
impact fee deposited in an Impact Fee Fund ever be commingled with monies from
a different fund, or ever be used for capital improvements that are different
from those for which the impact fee was paid.
   H.   It is not the intent of this chapter that impact fees be used for:
      1.   Construction, acquisition or expansion of public facilities other
than capital improvements identified in the capital improvements plan.
      2.   Repair, operation or maintenance of existing or new capital
improvements.
      3.   Upgrading, updating, expanding or replacing existing capital
improvements to serve existing development in order to meet stricter safety,
efficiency, environmental or regulatory standards.
      4.   Upgrading, updating, expanding or replacing existing capital
improvements to serve existing development to provide better service to
existing development.
      5.   Administrative and operating costs of the City unless such costs are
attributable to development of the capital improvements plan used to determine
impact fees by a surcharge imposed by ordinance on the collection of an impact
fee, which surcharge shall not exceed a development's proportionate share of
the cost of preparing the capital improvements plan.
      6.   Principal payments and interest or other finance charges on bonds or
other indebtedness except financial obligations issued by or on behalf of the
City to finance capital improvements identified in the capital improvements
plan. (Ord. 783, 2019)

(Ord. 845, 2022: Ord. 783, 2019: Ord. 867 § 1 (part), 2024)
17.24.050: IMPOSITION AND COMPUTATION OF IMPACT FEES:
   A.   Any application for a building permit enabling the construction, and in
the case of construction that does not require a building permit, any building
that takes place on or after the effective date hereof shall be subject to the
imposition of impact fees in the manner and amount set forth in this chapter.
The methodology adopted for the purpose of determining police, emergency
services, and parks and recreation impact fees shall be based upon the
assumptions set forth in the Impact Fee Study for that respective service.
   B.   Impact fees shall be required as a condition of approval of all
residential and nonresidential development in the service area for which a
building permit is required and shall be payable prior to the issuance of any
building permit (or installation permit in the case of a manufactured home) for
a dwelling unit or a nonresidential building. Except as otherwise provided
herein, after the effective date hereof, no building permit shall be issued
until the impact fees described in this chapter have been paid, unless the
development for which the permit is sought is exempted by section
17.24.080 of this chapter or approved credits are used to cover the impact fee,
as set forth in section
17.24.090 of this chapter. The Fee Administrator shall have the authority to
withhold a building permit, stop construction, withhold utility services or
impose liens as the case may be, until the appropriate impact fee has been
collected.
   C.   After payment of the development impact fees or execution of an
agreement for payment of development impact fees, additional development impact
fees or increases in fees may not be assessed unless the number of service
units increases or the scope or schedule of the development changes. In the
event of an increase in the number of service units or schedule of the
development changes, the additional development impact fees to be imposed are
limited to the amount attributable to the additional service units or change in
scope of the development.
   D.   A fee payer required by this chapter to pay an impact fee may choose to
have the amount of such impact fee determined pursuant to either the fee
schedule (whereupon such payment shall be recognized as full and complete
payment of the development's proportionate share of system improvement costs,
except as provided in Idaho Code section 67-8214(3)) or subsections E through G
of this section. If the fee payer chooses to have the amount of such impact fee
determined pursuant to subsections E through G of this section, such impact fee
shall be subject to the adjustment described in section
17.24.090 of this chapter, if applicable. If the project is a mix of those uses
listed on the fee schedule, then the impact fees shall be determined by adding
up the impact fees that would be payable for each use as if it were a
freestanding use pursuant to the fee schedule.
   E.   Individual assessment of impact fees is permitted in situations where
the fee payer can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the
established impact fee is inappropriate for the project. Written application
for individual assessment shall be made to the Fee Administrator at any time
prior to receiving building permit(s). Late applications for individual
assessment of impact fees may be considered for a period of sixty (60) days
after the receipt of a building permit only if the fee payer makes a showing
that the facts supporting such application were not known or discoverable prior
to receipt of a building permit and that undue hardship would result if said
application is not considered. Such independent impact fee calculation study
for the fee payer's development shall be prepared at the fee payer's cost by a
qualified professional and contain studies, data and other relevant information
and be submitted to the Fee Administrator for review. Any such study shall be
based on the same methodology and the same level of service standards,
improvements and costs used in the Impact Fee Study, and must document the
methodologies and assumptions used. The City may hire a professional consultant
to review any independent impact fee calculation study on behalf of the City,
and may charge the reasonable costs of such review to the fee payer.
   F.   Any independent impact fee calculation study submitted by a fee payer
may be accepted, rejected or accepted with modifications by the City as the
basis for calculating impact fees. The City shall not be required to accept any
study or documentation the City reasonably deems to be inaccurate or
unreliable, and shall have the authority to request that the fee payer submit
additional or different documentation for consideration in connection with
review of any independent impact fee calculation. If such additional or
different documentation is accepted or accepted with modifications as a more
accurate measure of the impact fees due in connection with fee payer's proposed
development than the applicable impact fees set forth in the fee schedule, then
the impact fee due under this chapter shall be calculated according to such
documentation.
   G.   The Fee Administrator shall render a written decision establishing the
impact fees in connection with the individual assessment within thirty (30)
days of the date a complete application is submitted. The decision shall
include an explanation of the calculation of the impact fees, shall specify the
system improvement(s) for which the impact fees are intended to be used, and
shall include an explanation of the following factors considered:
      1.   Any appropriate credit, offset or contribution of money, dedication
of land, or construction of system improvements;
      2.   Payments reasonably anticipated to be made by or as a result of a
new development in the form of user fees and debt service payments;
      3.   That portion of general tax and other revenues allocated by the
jurisdiction to system improvements;
      4.   All other available sources of funding such system improvements;
      5.   The cost of existing system improvements within the service area;
      6.   The means by which existing system improvements have been financed;
      7.   The extent to which the new development will contribute to the cost
of system improvements through taxation, assessment, or developer or landowner
contributions, or has previously contributed to the cost of system improvements
through developer or landowner contributions;
      8.   The extent to which the new development is required to contribute to
the cost of existing system improvements in the future;
      9.   The extent to which the new development should be credited for
providing system improvements, without charge to other properties within the
service area;
      10.   Extraordinary costs, if any, incurred in serving the new
development;
      11.   The time and price differential inherent in a fair comparison of
impact fees paid at different times; and
      12.   The availability of other sources of funding system improvements
including, but not limited to, user charges, general tax levies,
intergovernmental transfers, and special taxation. The City shall develop a
plan for alternative sources of revenue.
   H.   Certification of the impact fee for a project may be applied for in the
following manner:
      1.   Written application may be made to the Fee Administrator not later
than sixty (60) days after development approval by the City Council. Late
applications for certification of the impact fee will not be considered unless
the fee payer makes a showing that the facts supporting such application were
not known or discoverable until after the time had run and that undue hardship
would result if said application is not considered.
      2.   The Fee Administrator shall provide the fee payer with a written
impact fee certification for the project within thirty (30) days of the date a
complete application is submitted. The certification provided by the Fee
Administrator shall establish the impact fee for the project in question so
long as there is no material change to the project as identified in the
certification application or the impact fee schedule. The certification shall
include an explanation of the calculation of the impact fees, shall specify the
system improvement(s) for which the impact fees are intended to be used, and
shall include an explanation of the factors considered, which factors are
identified in subsection G of this section.
   I.   Appeals of the Fee Administrator's determination of an individual
assessment or certification shall be made to the City as provided further in
this chapter.
   J.   The City recognizes that there may be circumstances where the
anticipated fiscal impacts of a proposed development are of such magnitude that
the City may be unable to accommodate the development without excessive or
unscheduled public expenditures that exceed the amount of the anticipated
impact fees from such development. If the City determines that a proposed
development would create such an extraordinary impact on the City's police and
emergency services, the City may refuse to approve the proposed development. In
the alternative, the City may calculate a pro rata share per dwelling unit, or
square feet of nonresidential buildings, of the extraordinary impact and charge
a reasonable extraordinary impact fee that is greater than would ordinarily be
charged.
   K.   If the City discovers an error in its impact fee formula that results
in assessment or payment of more than a proportionate share, the City shall, at
the time of assessment on a case by case basis, adjust the impact fee to
collect no more than a proportionate share or discontinue the collection of any
impact fees until the error is corrected by ordinance. (Ord. 783, 2019)
17.24.060: PAYMENT OF IMPACT FEES:
   A.   After the effective date hereof all fee payers shall pay the impact
fees as provided by this chapter to the Fee Administrator following application
for a building permit and prior to the issuance of any building permit for a
dwelling unit, or nonresidential building.
   B.   All impact fees paid by a fee payer pursuant to this chapter shall be
promptly deposited in the Impact Fee Fund described in section
17.24.070 of this chapter.
   C.   If a fee payer fails to pay the impact fee when required and due, the
City may:
      1.   Charge interest on the amount of the fee from the due date until the
date paid at the rate provided in Idaho Code section 28-22-104;
      2.   Withhold the building permit or other governmental approval until
the development impact fee is paid;
      3.   Withhold the providing of utility services until the development
impact fee is paid; and/or
      4.   Impose and file a lien against the property subject to the impact
fee following procedures contained in chapter 5, title 45, Idaho Code. (Ord.
783, 2019)
17.24.070: IMPACT FEE FUNDS; REFUNDS OF IMPACT FEES PAID:
   A.   There is hereby established a Police Impact Fee Fund into which shall
be deposited all police impact fees for the purpose of ensuring police impact
fees collected pursuant hereto are designated for the accommodation of police
capital improvements reasonably necessary to serve new development that paid
the impact fee.
   B.   There is hereby established an Emergency Services Impact Fee Fund into
which shall be deposited all emergency services impact fees for the purpose of
ensuring emergency services impact fees collected pursuant hereto are
designated for the accommodation of emergency services capital improvements
reasonably necessary to serve new development that paid the impact fee.
   C.   Each fund shall be an interest bearing account which shall be accounted
for separately from other Impact Fee Funds and from other City funds. Any
interest or other income earned on monies deposited in a fund shall be credited
to such fund. Expenditures of impact fees shall be made only for the category
of system improvements for which the impact fees were collected and as
identified in the capital improvements plan.
   D.   Except as otherwise provided herein, monies from each fund, including
any accrued interest, shall be limited to the financing of acquisition,
expansion, and/or improvement of capital improvements, or for principal and
interest payments on bonds or other borrowed revenues used to acquire, expand
or improve such capital improvements, necessary to serve new development.
Impact fees in each fund shall be spent within eight (8) years from the date
such impact fees were collected on a first in/first out (FIFO) basis. The City
may hold the impact fees longer than the prescribed time period if the City
identifies, in writing: 1) a reasonable cause why the impact fees should be
held longer; and 2) an anticipated date by which the impact fees will be
expended but in no event longer than eleven (11) years from the date the impact
fees were collected.
   E.   The Fee Administrator shall prepare annual reports to be provided to
the advisory committee and the City Council, which reports shall: 1) describe
the amount of all impact fees collected, appropriated or spent for system
improvements during the preceding year, as applicable, by category of public
facility and service area; and 2) describe the percentage of tax and revenues
other than impact fees collected, appropriated or spent for system improvements
during the preceding year, as applicable, by category of public facility and
service area.
   F.   Funds shall be deemed expended when payment of such funds has been
approved by the City. The fee payer or successor in interest shall be entitled
to a refund of the impact fee if: 1) service is available but never provided;
2) a building permit or permit for installation of a manufactured home is
revoked or abandoned; 3) the City, after collecting the impact fee when service
is not available, has failed to appropriate and expend the collected impact
fees; or 4) the fee payer pays an impact fee under protest and a subsequent
review of the impact fee paid or the completion of an individual assessment
determines that the impact fee paid exceeded the proportionate share to which
the City was entitled to receive.
   G.   When the right to a refund exists, within ninety (90) days after the
City determines that a refund is due, the City shall provide written notice of
entitlement to a refund, to the owner of record and the fee payer who paid the
impact fees at the address shown on the application for development approval,
or to a successor in interest who has notified the City of a transfer of the
right or entitlement to a refund and who has provided to the City a mailing
address. When the right to a refund exists, the City shall also publish the
notice of entitlement to a refund within thirty (30) days after the expiration
of the eight (8) year period after the date that the impact fees were
collected. Such published notice shall contain the heading "Notice of
Entitlement to Impact Fee Refund".
   H.   A refund shall include interest at one-half (1/2) the legal rate
provided for in section 28-22-104, Idaho Code, from the date on which the
impact fee was originally paid.
   I.   In order to be eligible for a refund, a fee payer, successor in
interest or owner of record shall file a written application for a refund with
the Fee Administrator within six (6) months of the time such refund becomes
payable under this chapter, or within six (6) months of publication of the
notice of entitlement to a refund, whichever is later. If a successor in
interest claims a refund of impact fees, the Fee Administrator may require
written documentation that such rights have been transferred to the claimant
prior to issuing the requested refund. Refunds shall be paid within sixty (60)
days after the date on which the Fee Administrator determines that a sufficient
proof of claim for a refund has been made.
   J.   Any person entitled to a refund shall have standing to sue for a refund
under the provisions of this chapter if there has not been a timely payment of
a refund as provided herein. (Ord. 783, 2019)
17.24.080: EXEMPTIONS FROM IMPACT FEES:
   A.   The following types of land development shall be exempted from payment
of the impact fees imposed by this chapter:
      1.   Rebuilding the same amount of square feet of a dwelling unit or
nonresidential structure that was destroyed by fire or other catastrophe,
provided that the structure is rebuilt and ready for occupancy within two (2)
years of its destruction.
      2.   Construction of an unoccupied, detached accessory structure, or
addition of uses related to a dwelling unit unless it can be clearly
demonstrated that the use creates a significant impact on the capacity of
system improvements.
      3.   Remodeling or repairing a dwelling unit or a nonresidential
structure in a manner that does not increase the number of service units.
      4.   Replacing a dwelling unit with another dwelling unit on the same
lot, provided that the number of service units does not increase.
      5.   Placing a temporary construction trailer or office on a lot.
      6.   Constructing an addition on a residential structure which does not
increase the number of service units.
      7.   Adding uses that are typically accessory to residential uses, such
as tennis courts or clubhouse, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that the
use creates a significant impact on the capacity of system improvements.
   B.   An impact fee will be assessed for installation of a modular building,
manufactured home or recreational vehicle unless the fee payer can demonstrate
by documentation such as utility bills and tax records, either: 1) that a
modular building, manufactured home or recreational vehicle was legally in
place on the lot or space prior to the effective date hereof; or 2) that an
impact fee has been paid previously for the installation of a modular building,
manufactured home or recreational vehicle on that same lot or space. Lawful
storage of a recreational vehicle shall not be deemed installation for purposes
of this chapter. (Ord. 783, 2019)
17.24.090: CREDITS; REIMBURSEMENTS:
   A.   No fee payer shall be required to construct, fund or contribute any
capital improvement to meet the same need for police and emergency services
improvements for which an impact fee is imposed. All system improvements
constructed, funded or contributed over and above the proportionate share of
system improvement costs, including such system improvements paid for pursuant
to a local improvement district, shall result in either a credit on future
impact fees or reimbursement (at the fee payer's option) for such excess
construction, funding or contribution to be paid from impact fees paid by
future development that benefits from such system improvements constructed,
funded or contributed by the fee payer. However, no credit or reimbursement
shall be provided for: 1) project improvements; 2) any construction, funding or
contribution not agreed to in writing by the City prior to commencement of such
construction, funding or contribution; and 3) any construction, funding or
contribution of a type of capital improvements not included in the calculation
of the applicable impact fee.
   B.   In the calculation of impact fees for a project pursuant to subsections
17.24.050E through G of this chapter, credit shall be given for the present
value of all tax and user fee revenue generated by the fee payer within the
service area and used by the City for system improvements of the category for
which the impact fee is being collected. If the amount of such credit exceeds
the impact fee for a project, the fee payer shall receive a credit on future
impact fees. The credit may be applied by the fee payer as an offset against
future impact fees only in the service area where the credit was generated.
   C.   In the calculation of impact fees for a project, credit or
reimbursement (at the fee payer's option) shall be given for the present value
of any construction of system improvements or contribution of land or money
required by the City from the developer for system improvements of the category
for which the impact fee is being collected, including system improvements paid
for through local improvement district assessments.
   D.   If credit or reimbursement is due to the fee payer, the City and fee
payer shall enter into a written agreement, negotiated in good faith, prior to
the construction, funding or contribution. The written agreement shall include,
without limitation: a description of the construction, funding or contribution
of system improvements including, in the case of real property, a legal
description of the real property; description as to how the system improvements
are to be valued; the amount of the credit or the amount, time and form of
reimbursement; instructions as to how the capital improvements should be
provided to the City to ensure full transfer of ownership; and the
circumstances under which the credit or reimbursement is deemed effective. To
assist in such reimbursement, the City shall continue to collect impact fees
from other developers whose proposed developments will benefit from such
construction, funding or contribution, and will promptly transfer such funds to
the fee payer. If a successor in interest claims a reimbursement or credit, the
Fee Administrator may require written documentation that such rights have been
conveyed to the claimant prior to issuing the requested reimbursement or
credit.
   E.   Approved credits may be used to reduce the amount of impact fees of the
category for which the impact fee is being collected in connection with any new
development until the amount of the credit is exhausted. Each time a request to
use approved credits is presented to the City, the City shall reduce the amount
of the applicable impact fee otherwise due from the fee payer and shall note in
the City records the amount of credit remaining, if any. Upon request of the
fee payer, the City shall issue a letter stating the amount of credit
available. If the credit has not been exhausted within eight (8) years of the
date of issuance of the first building permit for which an impact fee was due
and payable, or within such other time period as may be designated in writing
by the City, such credit shall lapse, unless a refund of the remaining credit
is applied for as set forth in subsection
17.24.070J of this chapter.
   F.   Approved credits or reimbursement shall only be used to reduce the
amount of the impact fee of the category for which the impact fee is otherwise
due, and shall not be paid to the fee payer in cash or in credits against any
other monies due from the fee payer to the City.
   G.   Credit for land dedications shall, at the fee payer's option, be valued
at: 1) one hundred percent (100%) of the most recent assessed value for such
land as shown in the records of the Bannock County Assessor; or 2) fair market
value established by a private appraiser reasonably acceptable to the City in
an appraisal paid for by the fee payer. Credit for contribution or construction
of system improvements shall be valued by the City based on complete
engineering drawings, specifications, and construction cost estimates submitted
by the fee payer to the City, which estimates shall be revised as actual costs
become available. The City shall determine the amount of credit due based on
the information submitted, or, if the City determines that such information is
inaccurate or unreliable, then on alternative engineering or construction costs
reasonably acceptable to the City as a more accurate measure of the value of
the offered system improvements to the City.
   H.   Approved credits for land dedications shall become effective when the
land has been conveyed to the City in a form reasonably acceptable to the City
at no cost to the City, and has been accepted by the City. Approved credits for
contribution or construction of system improvements shall generally become
effective when: 1) all required construction has been completed and has been
accepted by the City; and 2) all design, construction, inspection, testing,
bonding, and acceptance procedures have been completed in compliance with all
applicable requirements of the City. Approved credits for the construction of
system improvements may become effective at an earlier date if the fee payer
posts security in the form of a performance bond, irrevocable letter of credit
or escrow agreement in the amount and under terms reasonably acceptable to the
City.
   I.   Credit may only be transferred by a fee payer that has received credit
to such fee payer's successor in interest. The credit may be used only to
offset impact fees for the same category for which the credit was issued.
Credits shall be transferred by any written instrument clearly identifying
which credits are being transferred, the dollar amount of the credit being
transferred, and the system improvements for which the credit was issued. The
instrument of transfer shall be signed by both the transferor and transferee,
and a copy of the document shall be delivered to the Fee Administrator for
documentation of the transfer before the transfer shall be deemed effective.
(Ord. 783, 2019)
17.24.100: APPEALS:
The decisions of the Fee Administrator may be appealed as provided below:
   A.   Any fee payer who is or may be obligated to pay an impact fee, may
appeal a decision made by the Fee Administrator in applying this chapter to the
City Council. Such decisions that may be appealed include:
      1.   The applicability of an impact fee to the development.
      2.   The amount of an impact fee to be paid for the development.
      3.   The availability, amount or application of any credit.
      4.   The amount of any refund, reimbursement or credit.
      5.   Any discretionary action or inaction by or on behalf of the City.
A fee payer may pay an impact fee under protest in order to obtain a
development approval or building permit(s) and, by paying such impact fee,
shall not be estopped from exercising the right of appeal provided herein, nor
shall the fee payer be estopped from receiving a refund of any amount deemed to
have been illegally collected. Upon final disposition of an appeal, the impact
fee shall be adjusted in accordance with the decision rendered and, if
necessary, a refund paid.
   B.   In order to pursue an appeal, the fee payer shall file a written notice
of appeal with the City Clerk with a copy to the Fee Administrator within
fifteen (15) days after the date of the decision being appealed, or the date on
which the fee payer submitted a payment of impact fees under protest, whichever
is later. Such written application shall include a statement describing why the
appellant believes that the decision was in error, together with copies of any
documents that the appellant believes supports the claim.
   C.   The City Clerk shall notify the fee payer of the hearing date on the
appeal, which notice shall be given no less than fifteen (15) days prior to the
date of the hearing, and shall hear the appeal within thirty (30) days after
receipt of a written notice of appeal. The appellant shall have a right to be
present and to present evidence in support of the appeal. The Fee Administrator
shall likewise have the right to be present and to present evidence in support
of the decision. The burden of proof in any such hearing shall be on the fee
payer to demonstrate that the amount of the impact fee, credit, reimbursement
or refund was not properly calculated by the City.
   D.   The criteria to be used by the City Council in evaluating the appeal
shall be whether:
      1.   The decision or interpretation made by the Fee Administrator; or
      2.   The alternative decision or interpretation offered by the appellant,
more accurately reflects the intent of this chapter that new development in the
City pay its proportionate share of the costs of system improvements for public
facilities necessary to serve new development.
The City Council may affirm, reject or revise the decision of the Fee
Administrator, providing written findings of fact and conclusions, within
fifteen (15) days after hearing the appeal. The City Council shall modify the
amount of the impact fee, credit, refund or reimbursement only if there is
substantial evidence in the record that the Fee Administrator erred, based upon
the methodologies contained in the Impact Fee Study, this chapter and/or the
capital improvements plan. The decision of the City Council shall be final.
   E.   Upon voluntary agreement by the fee payer and the City, the fee payer
and the City may enter into mediation with a qualified independent party to
address a disagreement related to the impact fee for proposed development.
Costs for the independent mediation service shall be shared equally by the fee
payer and the City. Mediation may take place at any time during an appeals
process and participation in mediation does not preclude the fee payer from
pursuing other remedies. (Ord. 783, 2019)

17.28.010: LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS:
The City Council of the City of Chubbuck, Idaho, finds that:
   A.   Based on the City of Chubbuck Comprehensive Plan adopted by the City
pursuant to title 67, chapter 65, Idaho Code, including, but not limited to,
the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan, and the general
governmental goal of protecting the health, safety, and general welfare of the
citizens of the City, and its Area of City Impact, it is necessary for the
parks and recreation public facilities to accommodate new development within
the City, and its Area of City Impact.
   B.   New residential and nonresidential growth and development imposes and
will impose increasing and excessive demands upon the public facilities.
   C.   The revenues generated from new residential and nonresidential growth
and development often does not generate sufficient funds to provide the
necessary levels of service provided by these public facilities to accommodate
new development.
   D.   New development is expected to continue, and will place ever increasing
demands on the City to provide and expand the public facilities to serve new
development.
   E.   The City has planned for the improvement of the public facilities in
the capital improvements element of the City of Chubbuck Comprehensive Plan and
in the impact fee analysis and the capital improvement plan reviewed and
adopted therewith.
   F.   The equitable impact fee system in accordance with title 67, chapter
82, Idaho Code enables the city to impose a proportionate share of the costs of
needed improvements to the public facilities to accommodate new development,
and assists the City in implementing the capital improvements element of the
comprehensive plan.
   G.   In order to maintain the equitable impact fee system for the public
facilities, the City retained Zions Public Finance, Inc., (“Zions”) to prepare
an impact fee study for these types of facilities five (5) years after adopting
impact fees originally in 2019.. The resulting document is titled:
      Parks and Trails CIP and Impact Fee Analysis dated November 2023 (the
“Impact Fee Study”) and recommended for approval by the Impact Fee Advisory
Committee. The studies are on file in the Office of the City Clerk of the City
of Chubbuck. Any reference herein to the Impact Fee Study shall be to that
study.
   H.   The Impact Fee Study is consistent with the capital improvements
element of the City of Chubbuck Comprehensive Plan, and uses the levels of
service set forth in the Comprehensive Plan for these public facilities.
   I.   The Impact Fee Study sets forth reasonable methodologies and analyses
for determining the impacts of various types of new development on the public
facilities, and determines the cost of acquiring or constructing the
improvements necessary to meet the demands for such public facilities created
by new development.
   J.   The Impact Fee Study uses a calculation methodology in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. This chapter shall not be deemed
invalid because payment of an impact fee may result in an incidental benefit to
others within the service area other than the fee payer.
   K.   The impact fees described in this chapter are based on the Impact Fee
Study, and do not exceed the costs of system improvements for the public
facilities to serve new development that will pay the impact fees.
   L.   The parks and recreation services included in the calculation of impact
fees in the Impact Fee Study will benefit all new development throughout the
City, and it is therefore appropriate to treat all areas of the City and the
Area of City Impact as a single service area for purposes of calculating,
collecting and spending the impact fees collected.
   M.   There is both a rational nexus and a rough proportionality between the
development impacts created by each type of development covered by this chapter
and the impact fees that such development will be required to pay.
   N.   This chapter creates a system by which impact fees paid by new
development will be used to finance, defray or to provide capital improvements
for the public facilities in ways that benefit the development for which impact
fees were paid.
   O.   This chapter creates a system under which impact fees shall not be used
to correct existing deficiencies in public facilities, or to replace or
rehabilitate existing public facilities, or to pay for routine operation or
maintenance of those public facilities.
   P.   This chapter creates a system under which there shall be no double
payment of impact fees, in accordance with Idaho Code section 67-8204(19).
   Q.   This chapter is consistent with all applicable provisions of title 67,
chapter 82, Idaho Code, concerning Impact Fee Ordinances.
(Ord. 804, 2019: Ord. 867 § 2 (part), 2024)
17.28.020: AUTHORITY, APPLICABILITY, AND EFFECTIVE DATE:
   A.   This chapter is enacted pursuant to the City’s general police powers
pursuant to the authority granted to the City by title 50, Idaho Code, and
pursuant to the authority granted to the City by section 67-8201 et seq., Idaho
Code.
   B.   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all of the territory
within the limits of the City and to any unincorporated areas of the City
within the City’s Area of City Impact where the City has executed an
intergovernmental agreement with Bannock County for purposes of collection or
expenditure of impact fees pursuant to section 67-8204A, Idaho Code, and other
applicable laws of the State of Idaho.
   C.   This chapter is effective February 19, 2024 (“effective date”), which
effective date is more than thirty (30) days subsequent to the passage,
approval and publication, according to law, of the ordinance codified herein,
which adopted the provisions hereof.
   D.   Applications for building permits received by the City prior to the
effective date hereof, or amendments hereto, adopting impact fees or amending
or adopting any methodology by which impact fees are calculated, will be exempt
from that portion of this chapter, or amendment enacted after such building
permit application, if a valid building permit has been issued or construction
has commenced prior to the effective date hereof, or amendment. For building
permits that expire or are revoked after the effective date hereof, the fee
payer shall be entitled to a refund of previously paid fees as provided herein,
provided that in the case of reapplication for building permit, the impact fee
in effect at that time shall be paid.
   E.   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, development requirements
for system improvements shall be imposed by the City only by way of impact fees
imposed pursuant to and in accordance with section 67-8201 et seq., Idaho Code,
and this chapter.
(Ord. 804, 2019: Ord. 867 § 2 (part), 2024)
17.28.030: INTENT:
   A.   The intent of this chapter is to promote the health, safety and general
welfare of the residents of the City and its Area of City Impact.
   B.   The intent of this chapter is to be consistent with those principles
for allocating a fair share of the cost of capital improvements to public
facilities to serve new development in compliance with the provisions set forth
in section 67-8201 et seq., Idaho Code. The provisions of this chapter shall be
interpreted, construed and enforced in accordance with the provisions set forth
in section 67-8201 et seq., Idaho Code.
   C.   The intent of this chapter is that impact fees should be charged,
collected, and expended for parks and recreation capital improvements to
increase the service capacity of such categories of public facilities, which
capital improvements are included in approved capital improvements plans that
list the capital improvements that may be funded with impact fees.
   D.   The intent of this chapter is to ensure that:
      1.   Public facilities are available to serve new development;
      2.   New development bears a proportionate share of the cost of parks and
recreation capital improvements to such public facilities;
      3.   Such proportionate share does not exceed the cost of the capital
improvements to such public facilities required to serve new development; and
      4.   The funds collected from new development are used for capital
improvements for public facilities that benefit new development.
   E.   It is not the intent of this chapter to collect any monies from new
development in excess of the actual amount necessary to offset new demands for
capital improvements to public facilities created by such new development.
   F.   It is not the intent of this chapter that the impact fees be used to
remedy any deficiency in parks and recreation capital improvements existing on
the effective date hereof, or ever be used to replace, rehabilitate, maintain
and/or operate any public facilities.
   G.   It is not the intent of this chapter that any monies collected from an
impact fee deposited in an Impact Fee Fund ever be commingled with monies from
a different fund, or ever be used for capital improvements that are different
from those for which the impact fee was paid.
   H.   It is not the intent of this chapter that impact fees be used for:
      1.   Construction, acquisition or expansion of public facilities other
than capital improvements identified in the capital improvements plan.
      2.   Repair, operation or maintenance of existing or new capital
improvements.
      3.   Upgrading, updating, expanding or replacing existing capital
improvements to serve existing development in order to meet stricter safety,
efficiency, environmental or regulatory standards.
      4.   Upgrading, updating, expanding or replacing existing capital
improvements to serve existing development to provide better service to
existing development.
      5.   Administrative and operating costs of the City unless such costs are
attributable to development of the capital improvements plan used to determine
impact fees by a surcharge imposed by ordinance on the collection of an impact
fee, which surcharge shall not exceed a development's proportionate share of
the cost of preparing the capital improvements plan.
      6.   Principal payments and interest or other finance charges on bonds or
other indebtedness except financial obligations issued by or on behalf of the
City to finance capital improvements identified in the capital improvements
plan. (Ord. 804, 2019)

17.28.050: IMPOSITION AND COMPUTATION OF IMPACT FEES:
   A.   Any application for a building permit enabling the construction, and in
the case of construction that does not require a building permit, any building
that takes place on or after the effective date hereof shall be subject to the
imposition of impact fees in the manner and amount set forth in this chapter.
The methodology adopted for the purpose of determining parks and recreation
impact fees shall be based upon the assumptions set forth in the Impact Fee
Study for that service.
   B.   Impact fees shall be required as a condition of approval of all
residential and nonresidential development in the service area for which a
building permit is required and shall be payable prior to the issuance of any
building permit (or installation permit in the case of a manufactured home) for
a dwelling unit or a nonresidential building. Except as otherwise provided
herein, after the effective date hereof, no building permit shall be issued
until the impact fees described in this chapter have been paid, unless the
development for which the permit is sought is exempted by section
17.28.080 of this chapter or approved credits are used to cover the impact fee,
as set forth in section
17.28.090 of this chapter. The Fee Administrator shall have the authority to
withhold a building permit, stop construction, withhold utility services or
impose liens as the case may be, until the appropriate impact fee has been
collected.
   C.   After payment of the development impact fees or execution of an
agreement for payment of development impact fees, additional development impact
fees or increases in fees may not be assessed unless the number of service
units increases or the scope or schedule of the development changes. In the
event of an increase in the number of service units or schedule of the
development changes, the additional development impact fees to be imposed are
limited to the amount attributable to the additional service units or change in
scope of the development.
   D.   A fee payer required by this chapter to pay an impact fee may choose to
have the amount of such impact fee determined pursuant to either the fee
schedule, whereupon such payment shall be recognized as full and complete
payment of the development's proportionate share of system improvement costs,
except as provided in Idaho Code section 67-8214(3), or subsections E through G
of this section. If the fee payer chooses to have the amount of such impact fee
determined pursuant to subsections E through G of this section, such impact fee
shall be subject to the adjustment described in section
17.28.090 of this chapter, if applicable. If the project is a mix of those uses
listed on the fee schedule, then the impact fees shall be determined by adding
up the impact fees that would be payable for each use as if it were a
freestanding use pursuant to the fee schedule.
   E.   Individual assessment of impact fees is permitted in situations where
the fee payer can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the
established impact fee is inappropriate for the project. Written application
for individual assessment shall be made to the Fee Administrator at any time
prior to receiving building permit(s). Late applications for individual
assessment of impact fees may be considered for a period of sixty (60) days
after the receipt of a building permit only if the fee payer makes a showing
that the facts supporting such application were not known or discoverable prior
to receipt of a building permit and that undue hardship would result if said
application is not considered. Such independent impact fee calculation study
for the fee payer's development shall be prepared at the fee payer's cost by a
qualified professional and contain studies, data and other relevant information
and be submitted to the Fee Administrator for review. Any such study shall be
based on the same methodology and the same level of service standards,
improvements and costs used in the Impact Fee Study, and must document the
methodologies and assumptions used. The City may hire a professional consultant
to review any independent impact fee calculation study on behalf of the City,
and may charge the reasonable costs of such review to the fee payer.
   F.   Any independent impact fee calculation study submitted by a fee payer
may be accepted, rejected or accepted with modifications by the City as the
basis for calculating impact fees. The City shall not be required to accept any
study or documentation the City reasonably deems to be inaccurate or
unreliable, and shall have the authority to request that the fee payer submit
additional or different documentation for consideration in connection with
review of any independent impact fee calculation. If such additional or
different documentation is accepted or accepted with modifications as a more
accurate measure of the impact fees due in connection with fee payer's proposed
development than the applicable impact fees set forth in the fee schedule, then
the impact fee due under this chapter shall be calculated according to such
documentation.
   G.   The Fee Administrator shall render a written decision establishing the
impact fees in connection with the individual assessment within thirty (30)
days of the date a complete application is submitted. The decision shall
include an explanation of the calculation of the impact fees, shall specify the
system improvement(s) for which the impact fees are intended to be used, and
shall include an explanation of the following factors considered:
      1.   Any appropriate credit, offset or contribution of money, dedication
of land, or construction of system improvements;
      2.   Payments reasonably anticipated to be made by or as a result of a
new development in the form of user fees and debt service payments;
      3.   That portion of general tax and other revenues allocated by the
jurisdiction to system improvements;
      4.   All other available sources of funding such system improvements;
      5.   The cost of existing system improvements within the service area;
      6.   The means by which existing system improvements have been financed;
      7.   The extent to which the new development will contribute to the cost
of system improvements through taxation, assessment, or developer or landowner
contributions, or has previously contributed to the cost of system improvements
through developer or landowner contributions;
      8.   The extent to which the new development is required to contribute to
the cost of existing system improvements in the future;
      9.   The extent to which the new development should be credited for
providing system improvements, without charge to other properties within the
service area;
      10.   Extraordinary costs, if any, incurred in serving the new
development;
      11.   The time and price differential inherent in a fair comparison of
impact fees paid at different times; and
      12.   The availability of other sources of funding system improvements
including, but not limited to, user charges, general tax levies,
intergovernmental transfers, and special taxation. The City shall develop a
plan for alternative sources of revenue.
   H.   Certification of the impact fee for a project may be applied for in the
following manner:
      1.   Written application may be made to the Fee Administrator not later
than sixty (60) days after development approval by the City Council. Late
applications for certification of the impact fee will not be considered unless
the fee payer makes a showing that the facts supporting such application were
not known or discoverable until after the time had run and that undue hardship
would result if said application is not considered.
      2.   The Fee Administrator shall provide the fee payer with a written
impact fee certification for the project within thirty (30) days of the date a
complete application is submitted. The certification provided by the Fee
Administrator shall establish the impact fee for the project in question so
long as there is no material change to the project as identified in the
certification application or the impact fee schedule. The certification shall
include an explanation of the calculation of the impact fees, shall specify the
system improvement(s) for which the impact fees are intended to be used, and
shall include an explanation of the factors considered, which factors are
identified in subsection G of this section.
   I.   Appeals of the Fee Administrator's determination of an individual
assessment or certification shall be made to the City as provided further in
this chapter.
   J.   The City recognizes that there may be circumstances where the
anticipated fiscal impacts of a proposed development are of such magnitude that
the City may be unable to accommodate the development without excessive or
unscheduled public expenditures that exceed the amount of the anticipated
impact fees from such development. If the City determines that a proposed
development would create such an extraordinary impact on the City's Parks and
Recreation Department and facilities, the City may refuse to approve the
proposed development. In the alternative, the City may calculate a pro rata
share per dwelling unit, or square feet of nonresidential buildings, of the
extraordinary impact and charge a reasonable extraordinary impact fee that is
greater than would ordinarily be charged.
   K.   If the City discovers an error in its impact fee formula that results
in assessment or payment of more than a proportionate share, the City shall, at
the time of assessment on a case by case basis, adjust the impact fee to
collect no more than a proportionate share or discontinue the collection of any
impact fees until the error is corrected by ordinance. (Ord. 804, 2019)
17.28.060: PAYMENT OF IMPACT FEES:
   A.   After the effective date hereof all fee payers shall pay the impact
fees as provided by this chapter to the Fee Administrator following application
for a building permit and prior to the issuance of any building permit for a
dwelling unit, or nonresidential building.
   B.   All impact fees paid by a fee payer pursuant to this chapter shall be
promptly deposited in the Impact Fee Fund described in section
17.28.070 of this chapter.
   C.   If a fee payer fails to pay the impact fee when required and due, the
City may:
      1.   Charge interest on the amount of the fee from the due date until the
date paid at the rate provided in Idaho Code section 28-22-104;
      2.   Withhold the building permit or other governmental approval until
the development impact fee is paid;
      3.   Withhold the providing of utility services until the development
impact fee is paid; and/or
      4.   Impose and file a lien against the property subject to the impact
fee following procedures contained in chapter 5, title 45, Idaho Code. (Ord.
804, 2019)
17.28.070: IMPACT FEE FUNDS; REFUNDS OF IMPACT FEES PAID:
   A.   There is hereby established a Parks and Recreation Impact Fee Fund into
which shall be deposited all parks and recreation impact fees for the purpose
of ensuring parks and recreation impact fees collected pursuant hereto are
designated for the accommodation of parks and recreation capital improvements
reasonably necessary to serve new development that paid the impact fee.
   B.   The fund shall be an interest bearing account which shall be accounted
for separately from other Impact Fee Funds and from other City funds. Any
interest or other income earned on monies deposited in a fund shall be credited
to such fund. Expenditures of impact fees shall be made only for the category
of system improvements for which the impact fees were collected and as
identified in the capital improvements plan.
   C.   Except as otherwise provided herein, monies from the fund, including
any accrued interest, shall be limited to the financing of acquisition,
expansion, and/or improvement of capital improvements, or for principal and
interest payments on bonds or other borrowed revenues used to acquire, expand
or improve such capital improvements, necessary to serve new development.
Impact fees in each fund shall be spent within eight (8) years from the date
such impact fees were collected on a first in/first out (FIFO) basis. The City
may hold the impact fees longer than the prescribed time period if the City
identifies, in writing: 1) a reasonable cause why the impact fees should be
held longer; and 2) an anticipated date by which the impact fees will be
expended but in no event longer than eleven (11) years from the date the impact
fees were collected.
   D.   The Fee Administrator shall prepare annual reports to be provided to
the Advisory Committee and the City Council, which reports shall: 1) describe
the amount of all impact fees collected, appropriated or spent for system
improvements during the preceding year, as applicable, by category of public
facility and service area; and 2) describe the percentage of tax and revenues
other than impact fees collected, appropriated or spent for system improvements
during the preceding year, as applicable, by category of public facility and
service area.
   E.   Funds shall be deemed expended when payment of such funds has been
approved by the City. The fee payer or successor in interest shall be entitled
to a refund of the impact fee if: 1) service is available but never provided;
2) a building permit or permit for installation of a manufactured home is
revoked or abandoned; 3) the City, after collecting the impact fee when service
is not available, has failed to appropriate and expend the collected impact
fees; or 4) the fee payer pays an impact fee under protest and a subsequent
review of the impact fee paid or the completion of an individual assessment
determines that the impact fee paid exceeded the proportionate share to which
the City was entitled to receive.
   F.   When the right to a refund exists, within ninety (90) days after the
City determines that a refund is due, the City shall provide written notice of
entitlement to a refund, to the owner of record and the fee payer who paid the
impact fees at the address shown on the application for development approval,
or to a successor in interest who has notified the City of a transfer of the
right or entitlement to a refund and who has provided to the City a mailing
address. When the right to a refund exists, the City shall also publish the
notice of entitlement to a refund within thirty (30) days after the expiration
of the eight (8) year period after the date that the impact fees were
collected. Such published notice shall contain the heading "Notice of
Entitlement to Impact Fee Refund".
   G.   A refund shall include interest at one-half (1/2) the legal rate
provided for in section 28-22-104, Idaho Code, from the date on which the
impact fee was originally paid.
   H.   In order to be eligible for a refund, a fee payer, successor in
interest or owner of record shall file a written application for a refund with
the Fee Administrator within six (6) months of the time such refund becomes
payable under this chapter, or within six (6) months of publication of the
notice of entitlement to a refund, whichever is later. If a successor in
interest claims a refund of impact fees, the Fee Administrator may require
written documentation that such rights have been transferred to the claimant
prior to issuing the requested refund. Refunds shall be paid within sixty (60)
days after the date on which the Fee Administrator determines that a sufficient
proof of claim for a refund has been made.
   I.   Any person entitled to a refund shall have standing to sue for a refund
under the provisions of this chapter if there has not been a timely payment of
a refund as provided herein. (Ord. 804, 2019)
17.28.080: EXEMPTIONS FROM IMPACT FEES:
   A.   The following types of land development shall be exempted from payment
of the impact fees imposed by this chapter:
      1.   Rebuilding the same amount of square feet of a dwelling unit or
nonresidential structure that was destroyed by fire or other catastrophe,
provided that the structure is rebuilt and ready for occupancy within two (2)
years of its destruction.
      2.   Construction of an unoccupied, detached accessory structure, or
addition of uses related to a dwelling unit unless it can be clearly
demonstrated that the use creates a significant impact on the capacity of
system improvements.
      3.   Remodeling or repairing a dwelling unit or a nonresidential
structure in a manner that does not increase the number of service units.
      4.   Replacing a dwelling unit with another dwelling unit on the same
lot, provided that the number of service units does not increase.
      5.   Placing a temporary construction trailer or office on a lot.
      6.   Constructing an addition on a residential structure which does not
increase the number of service units.
      7.   Adding uses that are typically accessory to residential uses, such
as tennis courts or clubhouse, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that the
use creates a significant impact on the capacity of system improvements.
   B.   An impact fee will be assessed for installation of a modular building,
manufactured home or recreational vehicle unless the fee payer can demonstrate
by documentation such as utility bills and tax records, either: 1) that a
modular building, manufactured home or recreational vehicle was legally in
place on the lot or space prior to the effective date hereof; or 2) that an
impact fee has been paid previously for the installation of a modular building,
manufactured home or recreational vehicle on that same lot or space. Lawful
storage of a recreational vehicle shall not be deemed installation for purposes
of this chapter. (Ord. 804, 2019)
17.28.090: CREDITS; REIMBURSEMENTS:
   A.   No fee payer shall be required to construct, fund or contribute any
capital improvement to meet the same need for parks and recreation improvements
for which an impact fee is imposed. All system improvements constructed, funded
or contributed over and above the proportionate share of system improvement
costs, including such system improvements paid for pursuant to a local
improvement district, shall result in either a credit on future impact fees or
reimbursement (at the fee payer's option) for such excess construction, funding
or contribution to be paid from impact fees paid by future development that
benefits from such system improvements constructed, funded or contributed by
the fee payer. However, no credit or reimbursement shall be provided for: 1)
project improvements; 2) any construction, funding or contribution not agreed
to in writing by the City prior to commencement of such construction, funding
or contribution; and 3) any construction, funding or contribution of a type of
capital improvements not included in the calculation of the applicable impact
fee.
   B.   In the calculation of impact fees for a project pursuant to subsections
17.28.050E through G of this chapter, credit shall be given for the present
value of all tax and user fee revenue generated by the fee payer within the
service area and used by the City for system improvements of the category for
which the impact fee is being collected. If the amount of such credit exceeds
the impact fee for a project, the fee payer shall receive a credit on future
impact fees. The credit may be applied by the fee payer as an offset against
future impact fees only in the service area where the credit was generated.
   C.   In the calculation of impact fees for a project, credit or
reimbursement (at the fee payer's option) shall be given for the present value
of any construction of system improvements or contribution of land or money
required by the City from the developer for system improvements of the category
for which the impact fee is being collected, including system improvements paid
for through local improvement district assessments.
   D.   If credit or reimbursement is due to the fee payer, the City and fee
payer shall enter into a written agreement, negotiated in good faith, prior to
the construction, funding or contribution. The written agreement shall include,
without limitation: a description of the construction, funding or contribution
of system improvements including, in the case of real property, a legal
description of the real property; description as to how the system improvements
are to be valued; the amount of the credit or the amount, time and form of
reimbursement; instructions as to how the capital improvements should be
provided to the City to ensure full transfer of ownership; and the
circumstances under which the credit or reimbursement is deemed effective. To
assist in such reimbursement, the City shall continue to collect impact fees
from other developers whose proposed developments will benefit from such
construction, funding or contribution, and will promptly transfer such funds to
the fee payer. If a successor in interest claims a reimbursement or credit, the
Fee Administrator may require written documentation that such rights have been
conveyed to the claimant prior to issuing the requested reimbursement or
credit.
   E.   Approved credits may be used to reduce the amount of impact fees of the
category for which the impact fee is being collected in connection with any new
development until the amount of the credit is exhausted. Each time a request to
use approved credits is presented to the City, the City shall reduce the amount
of the applicable impact fee otherwise due from the fee payer and shall note in
the City records the amount of credit remaining, if any. Upon request of the
fee payer, the City shall issue a letter stating the amount of credit
available. If the credit has not been exhausted within eight (8) years of the
date of issuance of the first building permit for which an impact fee was due
and payable, or within such other time period as may be designated in writing
by the City, such credit shall lapse, unless a refund of the remaining credit
is applied for as set forth in subsection
17.28.070H of this chapter.
   F.   Approved credits or reimbursement shall only be used to reduce the
amount of the impact fee of the category for which the impact fee is otherwise
due, and shall not be paid to the fee payer in cash or in credits against any
other monies due from the fee payer to the City.
   G.   Credit for land dedications shall, at the fee payer's option, be valued
at: 1) one hundred percent (100%) of the most recent assessed value for such
land as shown in the records of the Bannock County Assessor; or 2) fair market
value established by a private appraiser reasonably acceptable to the City in
an appraisal paid for by the fee payer. Credit for contribution or construction
of system improvements shall be valued by the City based on complete
engineering drawings, specifications, and construction cost estimates submitted
by the fee payer to the City, which estimates shall be revised as actual costs
become available. The City shall determine the amount of credit due based on
the information submitted, or, if the City determines that such information is
inaccurate or unreliable, then on alternative engineering or construction costs
reasonably acceptable to the City as a more accurate measure of the value of
the offered system improvements to the City.
   H.   Approved credits for land dedications shall become effective when the
land has been conveyed to the City in a form reasonably acceptable to the City
at no cost to the City, and has been accepted by the City. Approved credits for
contribution or construction of system improvements shall generally become
effective when: 1) all required construction has been completed and has been
accepted by the City; and 2) all design, construction, inspection, testing,
bonding, and acceptance procedures have been completed in compliance with all
applicable requirements of the City. Approved credits for the construction of
system improvements may become effective at an earlier date if the fee payer
posts security in the form of a performance bond, irrevocable letter of credit
or escrow agreement in the amount and under terms reasonably acceptable to the
City.
   I.   Credit may only be transferred by a fee payer that has received credit
to such fee payer's successor in interest. The credit may be used only to
offset impact fees for the same category for which the credit was issued.
Credits shall be transferred by any written instrument clearly identifying
which credits are being transferred, the dollar amount of the credit being
transferred, and the system improvements for which the credit was issued. The
instrument of transfer shall be signed by both the transferor and transferee,
and a copy of the document shall be delivered to the Fee Administrator for
documentation of the transfer before the transfer shall be deemed effective.
(Ord. 804, 2019)
17.28.100: APPEALS:
The decisions of the Fee Administrator may be appealed as provided below:
   A.   Any fee payer who is or may be obligated to pay an impact fee, may
appeal a decision made by the Fee Administrator in applying this chapter to the
City Council. Such decisions that may be appealed include:
      1.   The applicability of an impact fee to the development.
      2.   The amount of an impact fee to be paid for the development.
      3.   The availability, amount or application of any credit.
      4.   The amount of any refund, reimbursement or credit.
      5.   Any discretionary action or inaction by or on behalf of the City.
A fee payer may pay an impact fee under protest in order to obtain a
development approval or building permit(s) and, by paying such impact fee,
shall not be estopped from exercising the right of appeal provided herein, nor
shall the fee payer be estopped from receiving a refund of any amount deemed to
have been illegally collected. Upon final disposition of an appeal, the impact
fee shall be adjusted in accordance with the decision rendered and, if
necessary, a refund paid.
   B.   In order to pursue an appeal, the fee payer shall file a written notice
of appeal with the City Clerk with a copy to the Fee Administrator within
fifteen (15) days after the date of the decision being appealed, or the date on
which the fee payer submitted a payment of impact fees under protest, whichever
is later. Such written application shall include a statement describing why the
appellant believes that the decision was in error, together with copies of any
documents that the appellant believes supports the claim.
   C.   The City Clerk shall notify the fee payer of the hearing date on the
appeal, which notice shall be given no less than fifteen (15) days prior to the
date of the hearing, and shall hear the appeal within thirty (30) days after
receipt of a written notice of appeal. The appellant shall have a right to be
present and to present evidence in support of the appeal. The Fee Administrator
shall likewise have the right to be present and to present evidence in support
of the decision. The burden of proof in any such hearing shall be on the fee
payer to demonstrate that the amount of the impact fee, credit, reimbursement
or refund was not properly calculated by the City.
   D.   The criteria to be used by the City Council in evaluating the appeal
shall be whether:
      1.   The decision or interpretation made by the Fee Administrator; or
      2.   The alternative decision or interpretation offered by the appellant,
more accurately reflects the intent of this chapter that new development in the
City pay its proportionate share of the costs of system improvements for public
facilities necessary to serve new development.
The City Council may affirm, reject or revise the decision of the Fee
Administrator, providing written findings of fact and conclusions, within
fifteen (15) days after hearing the appeal. The City Council shall modify the
amount of the impact fee, credit, refund or reimbursement only if there is
substantial evidence in the record that the Fee Administrator erred, based upon
the methodologies contained in the Impact Fee Study, this chapter and/or the
capital improvements plan. The decision of the City Council shall be final.
   E.   Upon voluntary agreement by the fee payer and the City, the fee payer
and the City may enter into mediation with a qualified independent party to
address a disagreement related to the impact fee for proposed development.
Costs for the independent mediation service shall be shared equally by the fee
payer and the City. Mediation may take place at any time during an appeals
process and participation in mediation does not preclude the fee payer from
pursuing other remedies. (Ord. 804, 2019)
17.28.110: MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS:
   A.   As used in this chapter, masculine, feminine or neuter gender and the
singular or plural number shall each be deemed to include the others wherever
and whenever the context so dictates; the word shall, will or must is always
mandatory; the word may is permissive; and the word should indicates that which
is recommended, but not required.
   B.   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to create any additional
right to develop real property or diminish the power of the City in regulating
the orderly development of real property.
   C.   Nothing in this chapter shall limit or modify the rights of any person
to complete any development for which a lawful building permit was issued prior
to the effective date hereof.
   D.   Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the City from requiring a
developer to construct reasonable project improvements in conjunction with a
project.
   E.   Nothing in this chapter shall limit the ability of the City to enter
into intergovernmental agreements as provided in section 67-8204A, Idaho Code.
   F.   Nothing in this chapter shall obligate the City to approve any
development request that may reasonably be expected to reduce levels of service
below minimum acceptable levels established in the development Impact Fee
Study.
   G.   Nothing in this chapter shall obligate the City to approve development
which results in extraordinary impact.
   H.   Notwithstanding any agreement by the fee payer to pay the proportionate
share of system improvement costs documented by the supplemental study, nothing
in this chapter shall obligate the City to approve development that results in
an extraordinary impact.
   I.   Nothing in this chapter shall work to limit the use by the City of the
power of eminent domain or supersede or conflict with requirements or
procedures authorized in the Idaho Code for local improvement districts or
general obligation bond issues.
   J.   A development impact fee shall not exceed a proportionate share of the
cost of system improvements determined in accordance with section 67-8207,
Idaho Code. Development impact fees shall be based on actual system improvement
costs or reasonable estimates of such costs.
   K.   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent or prohibit
private agreements between developers, the City, the Idaho Transportation
Department, and/or other governmental entities in regard to the construction or
installation of system improvements or providing for credits or reimbursements
for system improvement costs incurred by a developer or fee payer, including
interproject transfers of credits, or providing for reimbursement for project
improvements that are used or shared by more than one development project. If
it can be shown that a proposed development has a direct impact on a public
facility under the jurisdiction of the Idaho Transportation Department, then
the agreement shall include a provision for the allocation of development
impact fees collected from the developer or fee payer for the improvement of
the public facility by the Idaho Transportation Department.
   L.   Nothing in this chapter shall restrict or diminish the power of the
City: 1) to impose reasonable conditions on the annexation of any property to
the City in accordance with Idaho Code, including conditions for recovery of
project or system improvement costs required as a result of such voluntary
annexation, or 2) to negotiate and execute development agreements that may
impose additional conditions on development, including the recovery of project
or system improvement costs, either in connection with a proposed annexation or
in connection with any other development within the City.
   M.   The impact fees described in this chapter, and the administrative
procedures of this chapter shall be reviewed at least once every five (5) years
to ensure that:
      1.   The demand and cost assumptions and other assumptions underlying

18.08.010: ENUMERATION OF DISTRICTS:
The following land use districts are hereby established:
   A.   Agricultural (A): The purpose of this district is to provide for
orderly transition of farmlands, by limiting their use to low density
residential neighborhoods until such time as other uses, consistent with the
comprehensive plan, become appropriate.
   B.   Single-family residential (R-1): The purpose of this district is to
provide for neighborhoods of single household dwellings and class I production
buildings. Major home occupations may be allowed as defined in section
18.08.040 of this chapter and section
18.12.032 of this title or conditionally permitted.
   C.   Limited residential (R-2): The purpose of this district is to provide
for neighborhoods of single household dwellings, class I production buildings,
and abutting zero lot line residences. An abutting zero lot line residence may
be conditionally permitted in an existing R-2 development and is permitted in a
proposed R-2 subdivision if each lot upon which a zero lot line residence would
be constructed is disclosed on the preliminary and final plats. Duplexes may be
conditionally permitted.
   D.   Limited residential P (R-2P): The purpose of this district is the same
as limited residential (R-2) and any amendments to limited residential (R-2)
shall apply to the limited residential P (R-2P) zone; provided however the lot
sizes for single-family homes shall be reduced to allow for smaller lots to
accommodate either zero lot line residences or to allow a single-family home to
be built on one-half (1/2) of a zero lot line residence but with setbacks for a
single-family home.
   E.   General residential (R-3): The purpose of this district is to provide
for diversity in the arrangement and density of residential uses. Duplexes,
abutting zero lot line residences, threeplexes and fourplexes shall be allowed,
but in order to maintain an appropriate mixture of single household dwellings,
duplexes, abutting zero lot line residences, threeplexes and fourplexes, shall
not compose more than twenty five percent (25%) of the structures in any
subdivision, unless an exception is granted to allow a larger percentage of
such structures by the land use and development commission. Class III
residential production buildings are allowed only in clustered arrangements as
provided elsewhere in this title.
   F.   Dense residential (R-4): The purpose of this district is to provide for
the development of dense residential districts, including apartment buildings
and apartment complexes composed of clusters of abutting zero lot line
residences, duplexes, threeplexes and fourplexes. Single household dwellings,
abutting zero lot line residences, duplexes, threeplexes, fourplexes and
apartments are permitted. Class III residential production buildings are
allowed only in clustered arrangements as provided elsewhere in this title.
   G.   Limited commercial (C-1): The purpose of this district is to provide
for small office uses and neighborhood scaled convenience business uses which
serve nearby residential areas. The goal of this district is to integrate
limited commercial activity and professional offices with residential land uses
in a climate favorable to both. Particular attention is to be paid to the
interface between commercial and professional uses and the residential uses
within the same neighborhood. Such a designation is appropriate where
commercial activities are to be provided in the midst of a neighborhood for the
benefit of the residents thereof. Such benefits may include convenience, energy
conservation or related factors. Such a designation may properly apply to a
limited area located in a convenient place relative to the circulation pattern
for both vehicles and pedestrians within a neighborhood. Some larger
establishments may be conditionally permitted if compatible with adjoining
uses. Application of this district would also be appropriate where its
permitted or conditionally permitted uses might serve as an effective buffer
between a residential neighborhood and nearby commercial or industrial uses.
   H.   General Commercial (C-2): The purpose of this district is to provide
for a broad variety of business establishments serving Municipal or regional
markets. These uses buffer against industrial area, and may include compatible
light industrial uses when conditionally permitted.
   I.   Industrial (I): The purpose of this district is to provide for light
industry not absorbed by general commercial areas and for heavier industrial
uses when conditionally permitted.
   J.   Planned Unit Development (PUD): The purpose of this district is to
encourage innovation and special features in development by embracing and
promoting: development patterns in harmony with community objectives, a maximum
choice of living environments, a more useful pattern of open space and
recreation areas, enhanced design standards and architectural features,
conservation of energy and efficient design, and a-development patterns which
preserves and employ the natural setting of the site.
   K.   Creative Community (CC): The purpose of this district is to provide a
greenfield planned unit development approval process, to provide for a zone
with a mix of land uses that range in intensity than are typically found
separately in mutually exclusive, traditional zoning districts and to provide
for a departure from traditional zoning to the extent that it encourages a
combination of land uses which may be compatible, but have traditionally been
separated. This district shall be governed by the provisions of
chapter 18.21 of this title. (Ord. 778, 2018: Ord. 755, 2016; Ord. 825, 2021)
18.08.020: DISTRICT BOUNDARIES AND LAND USE MAP:
The foregoing districts shall be depicted on the land use map on file in the
City office and incorporated herein by reference and shall be subject to future
amendment in the same manner as other provisions of this chapter. Where
conflicts exist between the district locations shown on the land use map and
the future land use scheme set forth in the City's comprehensive plan, such
conflicts shall be eliminated by ordinance, following transfer of title to
property or request from the landowner(s), when the City Council finds that
such action is timely for the orderly transition of affected neighborhood(s).
(Ord. 755, 2016)
18.08.030: GENERAL CONTROLS BY DISTRICT:
   A.   The general controls for each district set forth by this title shall be
the minimum regulations and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of
structure or land, except as hereinafter provided:
      1.   No structure or land shall be used or occupied and no structure or
part thereof shall be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved or
structurally altered except in conformity with all of the regulations herein
specified for the district in which it is located and in conformity with all
other applicable laws, codes or regulations.
      2.   No building or other structure shall be erected or altered to:
         a.   Provide for greater height or bulk;
         b.   Accommodate or house a greater number of families;
         c.   Occupy a greater percentage of lot area;
         d.   Have narrower or smaller rear yards, front yards, side yards or
other open spaces, other than as herein provided, or any other manner be
contrary to the provisions of this title.
      3.   No side yards in a lot within A, R-1 or R-2 Districts, which are
improved by an inhabitable structure at the time of passage of this title,
shall be reduced in width below five feet (5'). Areas and dimensions of all
other lots and yards shall meet at least the minimum requirements set forth
herein.
   B.   General controls by district shall be as set forth in the schedule
below. Specific uses are permitted where indicated in the schedules by the
letter “P”; provided, however, that the Community Services Director or the
Design Review Committee may, in accordance with the procedures set forth in
subsection C of this section, require the issuance of a conditional use permit
prior to allowing such use. Where the letter “C” appears, it denotes a use
allowed in the district in question only upon issuance of a conditional use
permit as herein provided. An “X” indicates that the use is neither allowed nor
conditionally permitted. Any proposed use which is not specifically mentioned
in the schedule below, is neither allowed nor conditionally permitted in
residential land use districts, but is permitted in all other land use
districts unless the Community Services Director or Design Review Committee
determine, in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection C of this
section, that such use should only be allowed upon the issuance of a
conditional use permit.
   C.   The Community Services Director in reviewing an application for a
building permit, and the Design Review Committee, in reviewing an application
for design review clearance, may determine that a particular land use, although
designated in the schedule of general controls as a permitted use, should be
allowed only upon the issuance of a conditional use permit. In making this
determination, the Community Services Director and Design Review Committee
shall rely upon the criteria and standards set forth in subsection
18.28.020 of this title. If a conditional use permit is required, the applicant
shall immediately thereafter be notified of this determination and shall be
advised of the procedures governing the Land Use and Development Commission’s
consideration of an application for a conditional use permit.
   D.   When several combined land uses exist or are proposed, the most
intensive land use shall be considered the primary activity for a development
application. All nonprimary activities or uses outside a planned unit
development as set forth in
chapter 18.20 of this title or a creative community as set forth in
chapter 18.21 of this title, shall only be allowed in accordance with the
schedule of general controls, unless the same constitutes subordinate uses
which are customarily incidental to and located on the same lot or in the same
building as the primary activity or use.
   E.   Any reference in the schedule of general controls to a use as
conditionally permitted does not constitute a finding or declaration by the
City Council that such use would necessarily be consistent with the
comprehensive plan of the City. The Land Use and Development Commission and
City Council shall not approve an application for a conditional use permit for
a particular proposed use unless such proposed use is found to be consistent
with the comprehensive plan and conforms to the criteria set forth in section
18.28.050 of this title. (Ord. 755, 2016; amd. Ord. 825, 2021; Ord. 845, 2022)

Note:
   1.   The standards in this table apply to the principal structure(s) on a
property. For accessory building standards see section 18.12.030.A of this
Title.
   2.   Minimum total setback is indicated on left; minimum setback for a side
yard is indicated on right. In addition, the setback for at least 1 of the side
yards shall be a distance of no less than 9 feet.
   B.   Corner Lot: On a corner lot, regardless of the facing or configuration
of the principal structure, there shall be a yard on one side that is at least
the amount of the minimum front yard setback set forth in subsection A of this
section, and the other side on the corner shall be not more than five feet (5')
less than the setback set forth in subsection A of this section. If a garage or
carport opens into the smaller of the two (2) setbacks, the garage shall set
back the same distance as the required front yard setback on the adjacent
corner.
   C.   Setbacks: Setbacks for a zero lot line residence or a single- family
residence in an R-2P zone shall be the same as that of the land use district
within which the development lies except the minimum total yard width and the
minimum lot area per household dwelling may be a minimum of seventy five
percent (75%) of that required for a household dwelling in that district.
Additionally, one side yard setback may be zero and the other side yard setback
may be a minimum of ten feet (10'). Two (2) zero lot line residences must be
simultaneously constructed to form an abutting zero lot line residence.
Construction of a single zero lot line residence is not permitted, unless
construction is of a freestanding single-family home in an R-2P zone or on a
zero lot line subdivision where a waiver has been granted.
(Ord. 755, 2016; amd. Ord. 871 § 6, 2024)
18.08.044: SCHEDULE OF GENERAL CONTROLS; LOT DEPTH TO WIDTH RATIO:
The maximum ratio of lot width to lot depth shall be:
Zone Ratio
Zone  Ratio
A     1:5
R-11  1:2
R-21  1:2
R-2P1 1:2
R-3   1:3
R-4   1:3
C-1   1:5
C-2   1:5
I     1:5
 
Note:
   1.   Lots in excess of 1/4 acre; lots 1/4 acre or under, no applicable
ratio.
The lot depth is measured at the farthest point the rear lot line is from the
front lot line. The lot width is measured at the point of the front yard
setback, and, in the case of a corner lot, the shortest line of the two (2)
sides bordering a street shall be used. For tracts that are on hillsides,
irregularly shaped, or that have unusual conditions, drainage, easements or
other such matters, which may make these ratios unworkable, the Community
Services Director and other applicable city officials shall work with the owner
to devise a plan for such a lot that is workable. Any deviations from the above
ratios shall be subject to approval by the land use and development commission
either at the preliminary plat stage or upon special application to the
commission. (Ord. 755, 2016; amd. Ord. 845, 2022)

   A.   In the interpretation of this section, the following shall govern:
      1.   Parking spaces for other permitted or conditional uses not listed in
this subsection shall be determined by the city council.
      2.   Fractional numbers shall be increased to the next whole number.
      3.   Where for any reason parking demand is unusually high or low, then
the parking space provisions cited above may be adjusted proportionately by the
council without the necessity of a variance.
      4.   Paved surfaces must be provided for all off street parking and such
surfaces must be maintained, kept clean and have striping designating the
parking area. Such parking spaces and the striping shall comply with acceptable
parking lot design and with all appropriate laws including the Americans with
disabilities act.
      5.   A paved driveway shall connect the public right of way or other road
providing access to the property and the required off street parking.
      6.   Two (2) or more adjacent or contiguous (other than residential)
users of off street parking subject to this section may petition for a
conditional use permit to decrease the total number of required parking spaces
on the basis that the users have entered into a joint use agreement for
parking. In reviewing this conditional use permit, in addition to the
requirements set forth in section
18.28.020 of this title, the following factors shall be considered:
         a.   Whether the uses of the property and the suggested number of
parking places by the applicant will be compatible as to type of use or hours
of use resulting in an actual reduction in the number of parking spaces needed.
         b.   Whether the reduced number of parking spaces is offset by other
desirable amenities such as increased landscaping or common area or reduced
need for on site stormwater retention due to decreased hard surface parking
area.
         c.   Such other factors as applicant or the reviewing body may deem
appropriate given the proposed use of the land and location of the land with
respect to other development. (Ord. 755, 2016; amd. Ord. 846 § 5, 2022)
18.08.050: ZERO LOT LINE RESIDENCE WAIVER:
Upon application to the land use and development commission, the owner or
developer of a lot(s) platted or designated for zero lot line residences may
obtain a waiver of the requirement to build two (2) contiguous zero lot line
residences and may, upon the granting of the waiver, construct single-family
residences that would comply with the restrictions in a limited residential P
(R-2P) zone. The granting or denial of such a waiver may be appealed to the
Chubbuck city council within the same time frame and parameters as set forth in
subsection
18.28.040B of this title. (Ord. 720, 2013)

18.10.070: Permit Procedures For Accessory Dwelling Units
18.10.010: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to: allow a more economic and efficient use of
the City's housing supply, land, and infrastructure; provide a mix of housing
that responds to changing family needs; provide a means for homeowners,
particularly seniors, single parents, and families with grown children, to
remain in their homes and neighborhoods, and obtain extra income, security,
companionship and services; protect neighborhood stability and property values;
and maintain the appearance and character of Chubbuck's single household
neighborhoods. (Ord. 823, 2021)
18.10.020: OWNERSHIP:
If the proposed accessory dwelling is located in the A, R-l, R-2 or R-2P zone:
   A.   The owner of the property on which the accessory dwelling is to be
created shall occupy one or the other of the dwelling units. For the purposes
of this section:
      1.   Owner shall mean one or more individuals who hold title directly or
indirectly to the dwelling, and for whom the dwelling is the primary residence;
a natural or adopted parent, grandparent, child, grandchild, aunt, uncle,
brother, sister, niece, or nephew of the owner of the dwelling may be
considered the owner occupying one or the other of the dwelling units.
      2.   Owner occupancy shall mean a property owner who makes his or her
legal residence at the site, as evidenced by voter registration, vehicle
registration, or similar means, and resides at the site more than six months in
any given year.
   B.   Before obtaining a building permit, a deed restriction shall be
recorded requiring that either the primary unit or the accessory unit be owner
occupied and that the accessory dwelling shall not be sold separately. The deed
restriction shall run with the land, but may be lifted at a future time if the
main dwelling and the accessory are converted back into a single residence, or
the property conforms to current zoning standards. (Ord. 823, 2021)
18.10.030: LOCATION:
   A.   An accessory dwelling unit is located on the same lot as a single
household dwelling unit, either within the same building as the single
household dwelling or in a detached building such as a guest house or attached
to a garage. It shall not be attached to a duplex or other multi-family
structure.
   B.   An accessory dwelling unit may also be attached to or part of a non-
residential structure or land use, such as a caretaker unit, parsonage, live-
work unit, or loft apartment. Multiple apartments above or behind commercial
space in mixed-use buildings are not considered accessory dwellings.
   C.   Accessory dwelling units are permitted, conditionally permitted, or
permitted with restrictions throughout the City, per the Schedule of General
Controls; Land Uses by Districts found in 18.08.040. (Ord. 823, 2021)
18.10.040: SIZE AND HEIGHT:
   A.   Accessory units associated with a single household dwelling shall be
smaller than and clearly subordinate to the primary dwelling unit, and no
larger than one thousand (1,000) square feet in size. If the accessory dwelling
will occupy one level of the home (e.g., basement), it is not feasible to use
the remaining area on that level as part of the primary dwelling, and it meets
all other requirements of this chapter, it may be authorized by the Director or
his designee to occupy the entire level, regardless of size.
   B.   An accessory dwelling unit associated with a non-residential structure
or land use shall not be limited in size but must be smaller than, and
subordinate to, the primary land use.
   C.   If an accessory dwelling is created from new construction attached to
or detached from an existing home, the height thereof shall not exceed the
height of the main structure on site, or as permitted by the underlying zoning
district, whichever is less. (Ord. 823, 2021)
18.10.050: PARKING AND ACCESS:
   A.   For accessory units associated with a single household dwelling, one
(1) additional off-street parking space shall be required in addition to the
spaces required for the primary dwelling. Garages and carports maybe included
in the required amount of off-street parking. Driveway parking spaces shall be
at least ten feet (10') wide and twenty feet (20') deep. Garages must be
setback from the interior edge of the sidewalk by at least twenty feet (20') to
prevent vehicle overhang.
   B.   For accessory units associated with a non-residential structure or land
use, parking may be shared with the primary land use, but at least one (1)
parking space shall be dedicated for each bedroom if the dwelling is greater
than 1,000 square feet in size.
   C.   A waiver to the parking requirements may be granted by the Director
subject to documentation that unusual circumstances of the occupancy will
result in a reduced need for parking on the premises and will not negatively
impact the neighborhood. The waiver and the circumstances allowing for the
waiver will be documented in the deed restriction required in Section
18.10.020, above.
   D.   A walkway shall be provided from the accessory unit to the street, and
shall be a minimum of three feet (3') wide and shall be finished with a hard
all-weather surface. (Ord. 823, 2021)
18.10.060: DESIGN COMPATIBILITY:
   A.   In order to maintain an exterior consistent with the primary dwelling
and the character of the neighborhood, or the associated non-residential
structure or land use, any additions or modifications to create an accessory
dwelling unit shall incorporate materials, colors, and design motifs that are
compatible with and complement of the primary dwelling or land use, including
siding, roofing materials, exterior colors, window trim, and roof style. If it
is not feasible for the accessory dwelling to meet these requirements, an
alternative design may be approved through a Design Review process.
   B.   For accessory dwelling units attached to a house, any outside entrance
must be on the side or rear. Entrance to the accessory dwelling may be located
on the front building elevation of the house only if using an entrance already
in existence.
   C.   The accessory dwelling shall not be created in or from a production
building, vehicle, or temporary structure. Conversion of a garage is not
permitted unless the required parking can be sited legally elsewhere on the
property, (Ord. 823, 2021)
18.10.070: PERMIT PROCEDURES FOR ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS:
   A.   Any person applying for an accessory dwelling unit shall make
application as set forth in this Title and Title 15.
   B.   If the proposed location lies in the R-l, R-2, or R-2P zone, the
applicant shall, on an application form provided by the city, list the names
and addresses of all owners of record of property from the outermost points
where applicant's property borders the city street, for three hundred feet
(300') each way from that point along and on either side of said city street
(s).
      1.   If the accessory unit will be all or partly in the rear yard, or
consists of new construction or an expansion, owners of record of property
adjacent to the rear property line shall be included,
      2.   If all of the above described owners sign the applicant's petition
for an accessory dwelling permit, then said permit shall be granted, provided
all other requirements of this chapter and Title 15 of this code are satisfied.
      3.   If any owner of record refuses to sign the petition, the applicant
shall be required to seek the issuance of a Conditional Use Permit for the
accessory dwelling.
   C.   If the proposed location lies in the A, C-2 or I zone a Conditional Use
Permit shall be required.
   D.   Any accessory dwelling unit that is attached to or associated with a
primary residence shall be served by the same water, sewer, solid waste,
electric, and natural gas utility connections and the same postal service
address as the primary residence, unless otherwise required by the utility
provider or US Postal Service. (Ord. 823, 2021)

18.12.010: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to prescribe additional controls for particular
uses, categories of uses or areas where problems frequently are encountered.
(Ord. 241 §3-1, 1983)
18.12.020: SUPPLEMENTAL YARD, HEIGHT AND USE CONTROLS:
   A.   Visibility At Intersections: On a corner lot it shall be the
responsibility of the owner of real property to remove from property any hedge,
shrubbery, fence, wall or other sight obstructions of any nature except
buildings where these sight obstructions constitute a traffic hazard. No owner
shall erect, place, plant or allow any object to be so put so as to constitute
a sight obstruction. The above sight obstructions shall not extend more than
three feet (3') in height above the existing centerline road elevation within
the vision triangle of vehicle operators. The boundaries of the vision triangle
being defined by measuring from the intersection of the edges of two (2)
adjacent roadways forty feet (40') along each roadway and connecting the two
(2) points with a straight line. The sight distance obstruction is also
applicable to railroad-highway grade crossings with the vision triangle defined
by measuring forty feet (40') along the railroad property line.
   B.   Yard Requirements For Multi-Household Dwellings: A multi-household
dwelling shall be considered as one structure for the purposes of determining
front, side and rear yard requirements. The entire group as a unit shall
require one front, one rear and two (2) side yards as specified for dwellings
in the appropriate district.
   C.   Side And Rear Yard Requirements For Nonresidential Uses Abutting
Residential Districts: Nonresidential structures or uses shall not be located
nor conducted closer than forty feet (40') to any lot line of a residential
district, except:
      1.   The minimum yard requirements may be reduced to fifty percent (50%)
of the requirement if acceptable landscaping or screening or combination
thereof is provided. Such screening shall be a solid fence a minimum of six
feet (6') in height maintained in good condition and free of all advertising or
other signs. Landscaping provided in lieu of or in addition to such wall or
fence shall be properly maintained and shall, at a minimum, consist of a strip
of land not less than twenty feet (20') in width planted with an evergreen
hedge or dense planting of evergreen shrubs not less than four feet (4') in
height at the time of planting. The landscaping and/or screening needed to
satisfy the requirements of this provision and reduce the minimum yard
requirements by fifty percent (50%) shall be determined in each case by the
Community Services Director, subject to review by the land use and development
commission and the city council; or
      2.   If the nonresidential structure or use is one that is a permitted
use in a limited commercial (C-1) zone, the setback shall be those set forth
for a C-1 zone in subsection
18.08.042A of this title. A conditional use permit for use in a limited
commercial (C-1) zone may also specify such setbacks if deemed appropriate by
the commission for such use, given the surrounding uses in the area.
   D.   Architectural Projections: Open structures such as porches, canopies,
balconies, platforms, carports, covered patios and similar architectural
projections shall be considered parts of the building to which attached and
shall not project into the required minimum front, side or rear yard; provided,

chimneys, flagpoles, steeples, non-power generating windmills, decorative
towers, monuments, weathervanes, etc. but not signs, may exceed the height
limitations provided for in this title upon approval of the design review
committee as provided below:
         a.   In residential or agricultural land use districts, the height
limit may be increased to one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of the allowable
height but shall not exceed seventy (70) feet.
         b.   In commercial and industrial land use districts, the height limit
may be increased to one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of the allowable
height but shall not exceed one hundred feet (100'). However, if the structure
or feature is within one hundred feet (100') of a residential zone, the height
limit may be increased to only one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of the
allowable height in the neighboring residential zone.
         c.   In a Planned Unit Development (PUD) or mixed use district where
no height limit is defined and there are no architectural review covenants, the
height of the building feature may be one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of
the height of the building, or, a free-standing structure may be one hundred
and fifty percent (150%) of the height of the nearest building intended for
human occupancy within the PUD but shall not exceed one hundred feet (100').
         d.   Such features and structures may exceed the height limitations
provided for in sections a through c above only upon the issuance of a
conditional use permit as herein provided.

and the city council may, by resolution, impose additional controls upon
density of development in a defined area within the city, if development within
said area threatens the adequacy of traffic movement and control systems,
municipal services, utilities or open urban space available for recreation and
other purposes. Pending a study of such factors, the council may also by
resolution impose a moratorium upon issuance of building permits in the area,
for a reasonable period of time.
   G.   Use Of Land Or Structures: No land or structure in any district shall
be used or occupied in any manner creating conditions that are injurious or
noxious, or that otherwise substantially and demonstrably adversely affect the
surrounding areas or adjoining premises. Economic impact upon property values
or land uses may be considered in application of this section. This subsection
shall apply notwithstanding compliance with any pertinent specific standards
set forth elsewhere in this title or in other applicable laws, codes or
regulations.
   H.   Use And Storage Of Flammable Or Explosive Materials: Any activity
involving the use and storage of flammable or explosive materials shall be
protected by adequate firefighting and fire prevention equipment and by such
safety devices as are normally used in the handling of any such material.

18.13.010: PURPOSE:
   A.   These standards were developed to protect the public health, safety,
and welfare, to protect property values and minimize visual impact while
furthering the development of enhanced wireless communication and
telecommunication services in the city. These standards were designed to comply
with the telecommunications act of 1996 and subsequent congressional actions
and rulemaking by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The provisions
of this chapter are not intended to and shall not be interpreted to prohibit or
to have the effect of prohibiting wireless services. This chapter shall not be
applied in such a manner as to unreasonably discriminate between providers of
functionally equivalent wireless services.
   B.   To the extent that any provision of this chapter is inconsistent or
conflicts with any other city ordinance, this chapter shall control. Otherwise,
this chapter shall be construed consistently with the other provisions and
regulations of the city.
   C.   In reviewing any application to provide wireless service or to install
WCFs, the city shall act within a reasonable period of time, taking into
account the nature and scope of the application. The city shall approve,
approve with condition, or deny the application in accordance with the time
frames set forth in this title and in accordance with other applicable
ordinances and regulations of the city. (Ord. 836, 9-1-2021)
18.13.020: POLICY STATEMENT:
The purpose of this chapter is to establish general guidelines for the siting
of towers and antennas. The goals of this chapter are to: a) enhance the
ability of carriers to provide such services throughout the city quickly,
effectively, and efficiently; b) encourage carriers to locate towers and
antennas in nonresidential areas; c) encourage carriers to collocate on new and
existing tower sites in order to minimize the number of towers within the city;
d) encourage carriers to locate towers and antennas, to the extent possible, in
areas where the adverse impact on city residents is minimal; and e] encourage
carriers to configure towers and antennas in a way that minimizes any
significant adverse visual impact. Accordingly, the city council finds that the
promulgation of this chapter is warranted and necessary:
   A.   To manage the location of towers and antennas in the city;
   B.   To protect neighborhoods from potential adverse impacts of towers;
   C.   To minimize adverse visual impacts of towers through careful design,
siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging and screening
techniques;
   D.   To accommodate an increased need for towers to serve the wireless
communications needs of city residents;
   E.   To promote and encourage collocation on existing and new towers as an
option rather than construction of additional single use towers, and to reduce
the number of such structures needed in the future;
   F.   To promote and encourage utilization of technology and designs to
either eliminate or reduce the need for new tower structures to support antenna
and other communication facilities.
   G.   To consider the public health and safety of towers to the extent
permitted by federal law and other regulations set forth by the FCC; and
   H.   To avoid potential damage or adverse impacts to adjacent properties
through sound engineering practices, construction, modification, maintenance,
and the proper siting of antenna and support structures, and removal when no
longer used or are determined structurally unsound.
   I.   To ensure that wireless communications facilities are compatible with
surrounding land uses to the greatest extent reasonably possible. (Ord. 836, 9-
1-2021)

      2.   For existing towers in the ROW and all base stations, it increases
the height of the tower or base station by more than ten percent (10%) or ten
feet (10'), whichever is greater;
      3.   For towers outside the ROW, it protrudes from the edge of the tower
more than twenty feet (20'), or more than the width of the tower structure at
the level of the appurtenance, whichever is greater;
      4.   For existing towers in the ROW and all base stations, it protrudes
from the edge of the structure more than six feet (6');
      5.   It involves installation of more than the standard number of new
equipment cabinets for the technology involved, but not to exceed four (4)
cabinets;
      6.   It entails any excavation or deployment outside of the current site
of the tower or base station;
      7.   It would defeat the existing concealment/camouflage elements of the
tower or base station; or
      8.   It does not comply with conditions associated with the locality’s
prior zoning approval of construction or modification of the tower or base
station, unless the noncompliance is due to an increase in height, increase in
width, addition of cabinets, or new excavation that does not exceed the
corresponding “substantial change” thresholds.
   H.   Signs Prohibited: Except as set forth herein, no signs, banners or
similar devices or materials may be attached to the tower, antenna support
structures or antennas.
   I.   While collocation and the requirements herein are encouraged,
collocation shall not take precedence over the construction of shorter towers
with appropriate screening. (Ord. 836, 9-1-2021)
18.13.120: DESIGN CRITERIA:
   A.   As provided above, new facilities shall be designed to accommodate
collocation, unless the applicant demonstrates why such design is not feasible
for economic, technical, or physical reasons.
   B.   Facilities shall be architecturally compatible with the surrounding
buildings and land uses in the zoning district and screened or otherwise
integrated, through location and design, to blend in with the existing
characteristics of the site.
      1.   Setback: A tower’s setback shall be measured from the base of the
tower to the property line of the parcel on which it is located. In residential
districts and residential land use areas, where permitted, towers shall be set
back from all property lines a distance equal to one hundred percent (100%) of
tower height as measured from ground level, unless applicant demonstrates that
because of design, landscaping or screening, unusual geographic limitations or
other public policy considerations such a setback is unnecessary and the city,
in its sole discretion, determines such a setback is not necessary. All other
towers shall comply with the minimum setback requirements of the area in which
they are located in all other zoning districts, unless there are unusual
geographical limitations or other public policy considerations as determined in
the sole and absolute discretion of the city.
Such considerations shall include by way of illustration and not limitation,
but are not limited to:
         a.   impact on adjacent properties;
         b.   Alternative sites for WCFs; and
         c.   The extent to which screening and camouflaging will mitigate the
effects of the WCFs.
      2.   Right-of-way Setback Exception: The setback requirement may be
waived if the antenna and antenna support structure is located in the city
right-of-way.
      3.   View Corridors: Due consideration shall be given so that placement
of towers, antennas, and WCFs do not obstruct or significantly diminish views.
      4.   Color: Towers shall have a color generally matching the surroundings
or background that minimizes their visibility, unless a different color is
required by the FCC or FAA. Security fencing should be colored or should be of
a design which blends into the character of the existing neighborhood.
      5.   Lights, Signals And Signs: No signals, lights, or signs shall be
permitted on towers unless required by the FCC or the FAA. Should lighting be
required, in cases where there are residences located within a distance which
is three hundred percent (300%) of the height of the tower, then dual mode
lighting shall be requested from the FAA.
      6.   Equipment Structures: Ground level equipment, buildings, and the
tower base shall be screened from public view. All such structures shall be
considered primary structures, not accessory structures. The standards for the
equipment buildings are as follows:
         a.   The maximum floor area is three hundred (300) square feet and the
maximum height is twelve feet (12'). Except in unusual circumstances or for
other public policy considerations the equipment building may be located no
more than two hundred fifty feet (250') from the tower or antenna. Depending
upon the aesthetics and other issues, the city, in its sole discretion, may
approve multiple equipment structures or one or more larger structures.
         b.   Ground level buildings shall be screened from view by landscape
plantings, fencing, or other appropriate means, as specified herein or in other
city ordinances, code sections or regulations.
         c.   Equipment buildings mounted on a roof shall have a finish similar
to the exterior building walls. Equipment for roof mounted antennas may also be
located within the building on which the antenna is mounted.
         d.   In instances where equipment buildings are located in residential
zones, equipment buildings shall comply with setback requirements and shall be
designed so as to conform in appearance with nearby residential structures.
         e.   Equipment buildings, antenna, and related equipment shall occupy
no more than twenty five percent (25%) of the total roof area of the building
the facility is mounted on, which may vary in the city’s sole discretion if
collocation and an adequate screening structure is used.
         f.   The use must be approved on a site plan or final development
plan, as applicable.
      7.   Federal Requirements: All towers must meet or exceed current
standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the
federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If those
standards and regulations are changed, then carriers governed by this chapter
shall bring their towers and antennas into compliance with the revised
standards and regulations within three (3) months of their effective date or
the time lines provided by the revised standards and regulations, whichever
time period is longer. The revised standards and regulations are not
retroactively applicable to existing providers, unless otherwise provided or
permitted by federal law. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance
with the revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the
city to remove a provider’s facilities at the provider’s expense.
      8.   Building Codes; Safety Standards: To ensure the structural integrity
of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in
compliance with standards contained in applicable city building codes, FCC
standards for towers, and other standards that are published by the ECIA, as
amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the city concludes that a tower
fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to
persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower,
the owner shall have thirty (30) days to bring the tower into compliance with
such standards. If the owner fails to bring its tower into compliance within
thirty (30) days, the city may remove the tower at the owner’s expense. If the
structure is determined by the city to pose an imminent danger to the public,
the city shall be entitled to abate the danger through the processes and
according to the timetables of the international building code and the 1997
uniform code for the abatement of dangerous buildings.
      9.   Structural Design: Towers shall be constructed to ECIA standards,
which may be amended from time to time, and to all applicable construction/
building codes. Further, any improvements or additions to existing towers shall
require submission of site plans stamped by a professional engineer which
demonstrate compliance with the ECIA standards and all other good industry
practices. The plans shall be submitted and reviewed at the time building
permits are requested. The antenna and its support structure shall be designed
to withstand a wind force of one hundred (100) miles per hour without the use
of supporting guywires.
      10.   Antenna Support Structure Safety: The applicant shall demonstrate
that the proposed antenna and support structure is safe and the surrounding
areas will not be negatively affected by support structure failure, falling
ice, or other debris or interference. All support structures shall be fitted
with anticlimbing devices, as approved by the manufacturers.
      11.   Tower And Antenna Height: The applicant shall demonstrate that the
tower and antenna is the minimum height required to function satisfactorily;
provided additional height beyond the minimum may be allowed if necessary to
accommodate collocation. No tower or antenna that is taller than this minimum
height shall be approved unless necessary to accommodate collocation. No tower
or mount shall exceed one hundred feet (100') in any park, industrial zone or
commercial zone. Towers in residential areas are not allowed unless integrated
with another structure.
A variance from the height limit may be granted if the applicant can show by
clear and convincing evidence that the additional height is necessary to
provide adequate service to the residents of the city and no other alternative
is available.
      12.   Required Parking: If the cell site is fully automated, adequate
paved parking shall be required for maintenance workers. If the site is not
automated, arrangements for adequate off street parking shall be made and
documentation thereof provided to the city.
      13.   Tower Separation: In no case shall towers be located closer than
five hundred feet (500') from another tower whether it is owned or utilized by
applicant or another provider, unless the city designates areas where multiple
towers can be located in closer proximity.
      14.   Antenna Criteria: Antennas on or above a structure shall be subject
to the following:
         a.   The antenna shall be as architecturally compatible as reasonably
possible, with the building and wall on which it is mounted, and shall be
designed and located so as to minimize any adverse aesthetic impact.
         b.   The antenna shall be mounted on a wall of an existing building in
a configuration as flush to the wall as technically possible and shall not
project above the wall on which it is mounted unless it must be for technical
reasons. In no event shall an antenna project more than sixteen feet (16')
above the roofline including parapets.
         c.   The antenna shall be constructed, painted, or fully screened to
match as closely as possible the color and texture of the building and wall on
which it is mounted.
         d.   The antenna may be attached to an existing conforming mechanical
equipment enclosure which projects above the roof of the building, but may not
project any higher than the enclosure.
         e.   If an accessory equipment shelter is present, it must blend with
the surrounding buildings in architectural character and color.
         f.   The structure must be architecturally and visually (color, size,
bulk) compatible with surrounding existing buildings, structures, vegetation,
and uses. Such facilities will be considered architecturally and visually
compatible if they are camouflaged to disguise the facility,
         g.   Site location and development shall preserve the preexisting
character of the site as much as possible. Existing vegetation should be
preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography of the site
should be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact
of the site on the surrounding area, The effectiveness of visual mitigation
techniques shall be evaluated by the city, in the city’s sole discretion.
         h.   In addition to the other requirements of this chapter, on
buildings thirty feet (30') or less in height, the antenna may be mounted on
the roof if the following additional criteria are satisfied:
            (1)   The city finds that it is not technically possible or
aesthetically desirable to mount the antenna on a wall.
            (2)   No portion of the antenna or base station causes the height
of the building to exceed the limitations set forth herein.
            (3)   The antenna or antennas and related base stations cover no
more than an aggregate total of twenty five percent (25%) of the roof area of a
building, which may vary in the city’s sole discretion, if collocating and an
adequate screening structure is used.
            (4)   Roof mounted antenna and related base stations are completely
screened from view by materials that are consistent and compatible with the
design, color, and materials of the building.
            (5)   No portion of the antenna may exceed sixteen feet (16') above
the height of the existing building.
         i.   If a proposed antenna is located on a building or a lot subject
to a site review, approval is required prior to the issuance of a building
permit.
         j.   No antenna shall be permitted on property designated as an
individual landmark or as a part of a historic district, unless such antenna
has been approved in accordance with city ordinances and regulations.
         k.   No carrier or lessee or agent thereof shall fail to cooperate in
good faith to accommodate collocation with competitors. If a dispute arises
about the feasibility of collocating, the city may require a third party
technical study, at the expense of either or both parties, to resolve the
dispute.
         l.   No carrier or lessee shall fail to assure that its antenna
complies at all times with the current applicable FCC standards. After
installation, but prior to putting the antenna service, each provider shall
submit a certification by an independent professional engineer to that effect.
In the event that an antenna is collocated with another antenna, the
certification must provide assurances that FCC approved levels of
electromagnetic radiation will not be exceeded by the collocation.
         m.   Antennas shall comply with FCC regulations to minimize
interference with the reception of any other communications signals including
public safety, television, and radio broadcast signals.
         n.   No person shall locate an antenna or tower for wireless
communications services upon any lot or parcel except as provided in this
chapter. (Ord. 836, 9-1-2021)
18.13.130: PERMITS REQUIRED:
A WCF permit shall be required for all new installations and modifications of
WCFs, antenna, and various equipment unless exempted in this Chapter.
   A.   A WCF permit shall be required for an “eligible facilities request”
that does not “substantially change the physical dimensions of the existing
wireless tower or base station” as defined in the Spectrum Act and CFR 1.61000.
They are considered Type 1 requests, which must be acted upon by the city
within 60 days after a complete application is submitted, or are deemed granted
per Federal Law. The 60 day time limit for action may be extended if agreed
upon by both parties. Type 1 requests include the following.
      1.   Collocation of new transmission equipment;
      2.   The removal of transmission equipment;
      3.   The replacement or modification of transmission equipment;
      4.   Distributed antenna system (DAS) and small cell facilities.
   B.   A WCF permit shall be required for requests that “substantially change
the physical dimensions” of an eligible support structure as defined in the
Spectrum Act and CFR 1.61000. They are considered Type 2 requests, which must
be acted upon within 90 days after a complete application is submitted. Unlike
Type 1 requests, they are not deemed approved after 90 days. Type 2 requests
include the following:
      1.   Any modification of an eligible support structure, including the
collocation of new equipment, that substantially changes the physical
dimensions of the eligible support structure on which it is mounted; or
      2.   Any collocation not eligible for a type 1 permit; or
      3.   Any roof mounted antenna and support system for an antenna not
exceeding ten feet (10') above the highest portion of the roof; or
      4.   A new tower located in the public right-of-way.
   C.   A new WCF tower that is not a collocation considered a type 1 or 2 WCF
permit as outlined in this Title shall be considered a Type 3 request. Type 3
requests include roof mounted antenna exceeding 10 feet above the highest
portion of a roof. Type 3 requests must be acted upon within 150 days after a
complete application is submitted. Unlike Type 1 requests, they are not deemed
approved after 150 days.
   D.   Where a tower or antenna support structure will be sixty feet (60') or
less in height, in addition to the other provisions of this chapter, an
applicant will be required to submit the plan to the design review committee
for review. In the event that a proposed tower or antenna support structure
will be located in a residential zone, park, or mixed residential and
commercial zone, or will be more than sixty feet (60') in height, in addition
to the other provisions of this chapter, an applicant will be required to
obtain a conditional use permit, unless located in an industrial zone, in which
case the structure is a permitted use. With respect to the placement of antenna
on a tower or antenna support structure, the requirements for a conditional use
permit will be applicable based on the height of the tower and antenna or mount
and antenna unless this chapter provides other requirements to the contrary.
      1.   Project permit review procedures shall be as specified in the
ordinances, codes, resolutions and regulations of the city of Chubbuck.
      2.   The table in subsection
18.13.140 specifies the permits required for the various types of WCFs that
meet the standards of this chapter. (Ord. 836, 9-1-2021)

18.13.030 Definitions for additional information.
4.   Stealth design is required; city property only with hearing before the
City Council.
5.   If the tower location is in a city park, a conditional use permit is
required.
6.   Any WCF located in the Right-of-Way must meet all other requirements for
the type of facility and mount as an accessory on a pre-existing structure. If
proposed in any land use district other than General Commercial or Industrial,
notice must be provided to all property owners within 300' of the facility at
least 15 days prior to City Council action, with advisement to provide written
comment at least 7 days prior to the public meeting.
To meet the standards of this chapter, a WCF must also comply with the other
requirements under this chapter and with the following: For antennas attached
to the roof or sides of a building at least thirty feet (30') in height, an
existing tower, a water tank, or a similar structure:
   A.   Type: The antenna must be either:
      1.   An omnidirectional or whip antenna no more than seven inches (7") in
diameter and extending no more than sixteen feet (16') above the structure to
which it is attached; or
      2.   A panel antenna no more than two feet (2') wide and six feet (6')
long, extending above the structure to which it is attached by no more than ten
feet (10').
   B.   Other Height Restrictions: Antenna, antenna arrays, and support
structures not on publicly owned property shall not extend more than sixteen
feet (16') above the highest point of the structure on which they are mounted.
   C.   Setback From Street: Unless there are unusual geographic limitations or
other public policy considerations, as determined in the city’s sole
discretion, no such antenna, antenna array, or its support structure shall be
erected or maintained closer to any street than the minimum setback for the
zone in which it is located unless otherwise waived or exempt.
   D.   Guywires Restricted: No guy or other support wires shall be used in
connection with such antenna, antenna array, or its support structure except
when used to anchor the antenna, antenna array, or support structure to an
existing building to which such antenna, antenna array, or support structure is
attached.
   E.   Exemption: To the extent that antennas are attached to electric, phone
or light poles and such antennas are no more than two feet (2') in height,
design review and building permit review will be required, but such antennas
shall not be subject to setbacks and screening requirements. (Ord. 836, 9-1-
2021)
18.13.150: PERMIT REVIEW TIME REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   City Review Of Application Materials: The time frame for review of an
application shall begin to run when the application is submitted, but shall be
tolled if the City finds the application incomplete and requests, in writing,
that the applicant submit additional information to complete the application.
Such requests shall be made within thirty (30) days of submission of the
application. After submission of additional information, the City will notify
the applicant within ten (10) days of this submission if the additional
information failed to complete the application, If the City deems an
application or supplemental submission incomplete, it shall identify in its
written notice to the applicant the information and/or materials it considers
missing from the application.
   B.   Type 1 Processing Time: For type 1 modifications or collocations, the
City will act on the WCF application together with any other City permits
required for a proposed WCF modification within sixty (60) days, adjusted for
any tolling due to requests for additional information or mutually agreed upon
written extensions of time.
      1.   If the City determines that the application does not qualify as a
type 1 eligible facilities request, the City will notify the applicant of such
determination in writing and will process the application as a type 2 WCF
application.
      2.   To the extent Federal law provides a “deemed granted” remedy for
type 1 WCF application(s) not timely acted upon by the City, no such
application shall be deemed granted until the applicant provides notice to the
City, in writing, that the application has been deemed granted after the time
period in this subsection B has expired.
      3.   Any deemed type 1 WCF application shall be subject to following
conditions:
         a.   The approval of a type 1 WCF permit shall be subject to the
conditions of approval of the underlying permit, except as may be preempted by
the Spectrum Act.
         b.   The proposed project shall be built in compliance with the
approved plans on file with the City of Chubbuck.
   C.   Type 2 Processing Time: For type 2 WCF permits, the City will act on
the application within ninety (90) days, adjusted for any tolling due to
requests for additional information or mutually agreed upon written extensions
of time.
   D.   Type 3 Processing Time: For type 3 WCF permits, the City will act on
the application within one hundred fifty (150) days, adjusted for any tolling
due to requests for additional information or mutually agreed upon written
extensions of time.
   E.   Denial Of Application: In the event that the City denies a WCF
application, the City will notify the applicant of the denial in writing
outlining the reasons for the denial in a Findings of Fact and Conclusions of
Law. (Ord. 836, 9-1-2021)
18.13.160: MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Each permittee shall maintain its WCF in a good and safe condition,
preserving the original appearance and concealment, disguise or screening
elements incorporated into the design at the time of approval and in a manner
which complies with all applicable federal, state, and local requirements. Such
maintenance shall include, but not be limited to, such items as painting,
repair of equipment, and maintenance of landscaping. If the permittee fails to
maintain the facility, the city may undertake the maintenance at the expense of
the permittee or terminate the permit, and remove the WCF at owner’s expense,
at its sole option upon fifteen (15) days’ written notice via normal first
class mail.
   B.   Tower owners shall at all times employ ordinary and reasonable care and
shall install and maintain in use nothing less than commonly accepted methods
and devices for preventing failures and accidents which are likely to cause
damage, injuries, or nuisances to the public. Tower owners shall install and
maintain towers, communications facilities, wires, cables, fixtures, and other
equipment in substantial compliance with the requirements of the national
electrical safety code and all FCC, state, and local regulations, and in such
manner that will not interfere with the use of other property. All towers,
communications facilities, and antenna support structures shall at all times be
kept and maintained in good condition, order, and repair so that the same shall
not menace or endanger the life or property of any person. All maintenance or
construction of towers, communications facilities, or antenna support
structures shall be performed by city and state licensed maintenance and
construction personnel. All tower owners shall maintain the towers in
compliance with current RF emission standards of the FCC.
      1.   If, upon inspection, the city concludes that the tower fails to
comply with such codes or standards and constitutes a danger to person or
property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner
shall have thirty (30) days to bring the tower into compliance with such
standards. Failure to bring such tower into compliance within said thirty (30)
days constitutes grounds for the removal of the tower at the owner’s expense
upon fifteen (15) days’ written notice via normal first class mail.
      2.   In the event that the use of a tower is discontinued by the tower
owner, the tower owner shall provide written notice to the city of its intent
to discontinue use and the date when the use shall be discontinued and the
tower removed from the premises.
   C.   After a facility becomes operational, the facility operator shall
conduct safety and maintenance inspections in accordance with ECIA and FCC
standards and regulations. At the request of the City, the facility operator
shall, within sixty (60) days of the request, provide copies of the duly filed
safety inspection report, or the facility operator’s maintenance reports, for
the prior twelve (12) months. (Ord. 836, 9-1-2021)
18.13.170: LANDSCAPING; SCREENING:
   A.   Landscaping; Landscaping, as described herein, shall be required to
screen WCFs as much as possible, to soften the appearance of the cell site. The
city may permit any combination of existing vegetation, topography, walls,
decorative fences or other features instead of landscaping, if they achieve the
same degree of screening as the required landscaping. If the antenna is mounted
flush on an existing building, and other equipment is housed inside an existing
structure, landscaping shall not be required.
   B.   Screening: The visual impacts of a WCF shall be mitigated through
landscaping or other screening materials at the base of the tower and ancillary
structures. The following landscaping and buffering shall be required around
the perimeter of the tower and accessory structures, except that the city may
waive the standards for those sides of the facility that are not in public
view. Landscaping shall be installed on the outside of fences. Further,
existing vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent practicable and
may be used as a substitute for or as a supplement to landscaping requirements.
      1.   A row of evergreen trees a minimum of six feet (6') tall at planting
a maximum of six feet (6') apart shall be planted around the perimeter of the
fence; and
      2.   A continuous hedge at least thirty six inches (36") high at planting
capable of growing to at least forty eight inches (48") in height within
eighteen (18) months shall be planted in front of the tree line referenced
above.
      3.   In the event that landscaping is not maintained at the level
required herein or as required in any design review or conditional use permit,
or decision of a reviewing body, the city after giving thirty (30) days’
advance written notice may maintain or establish the landscaping and bill both
the owner and lessee for such costs until such costs are paid in full. (Ord.
836, 9-1-2021)
18.13.180: ABATEMENT, NONUSE, AND ABANDONMENT:
   A.   Construction or activation of a WCF shall commence within ninety (90)
days of approval of the WCF permit or the permit shall be null and void. A
ninety (90) day written extension approval may be granted by the planning and
development services department due to weather conditions or other extenuating
circumstances beyond the control of the applicant as determined by the planning
and development services department, after written request by the permittee.
   B.   At such time that a licensed carrier plans to abandon or discontinue
operation of a WCF, the carrier shall notify the city by first class U.S. mail
of the proposed date of abandonment or discontinuation of operations. Such
notice shall be given no less than thirty (30) days prior to abandonment or
discontinuation of operations. In the event that a licensed carrier fails to
give such notice, the WCF shall be considered abandoned, effective the day of
discontinuance. Upon such abandonment, the provider shall have sixty (60) days
or additional period of time determined in the reasonable discretion of the
city within which to:
      1.   Reactivation: Reactivate the use of the facility or transfer the
facility to another provider who makes actual use of the facility; or
      2.   Collocation: In the event that “abandonment” as defined in this
chapter occurs due to relocation of an antenna at a lower point on the antenna
support structure, reduction in the effective radiated power of the antenna or
reduction in the number of transmissions from the antennas, the operator of the
tower shall have six (6) months from the date of effective abandonment to
collocate another service on the tower. If another service provider is not
added to the tower, then the operator shall promptly dismantle and remove that
portion of the tower which exceeds the minimum height required to function
satisfactorily. Notwithstanding the foregoing, changes which are made to WCFs
which do not diminish their essential role in providing a total system shall
not constitute abandonment. However, in the event that there is a physical
reduction in height of substantially all of the providers’ towers in the city
or surrounding area then all of the towers within the city shall similarly be
reduced in height.
   E.   If a carrier fails to remove a WCF in accordance with this section, the
city may cause the facility to be removed and all expenses of removal,
disposal, and restoration shall be paid by the owner of the land where the
facility is located.
   F.   At the earlier of sixty (60) days from the date of abandonment without
reactivating or upon completion of dismantling and removal, city approval for
the facility shall automatically expire. (Ord. 836, 9-1-2021)
18.13.190: THIRD PARTY REVIEW:
Carriers use various methodologies and analyses, including geographically based
computer software, to determine the specific technical parameters of their
services and low power mobile radio service facilities, such as expected
coverage area, antenna configuration, topographic constraints that affect
signal paths, etc. In certain instances, a third party expert may need to
review the technical data submitted by a provider. The city may require a
technical review as part of a permitting process. The costs of the technical
review shall be borne by the provider.
The selection of the third party expert may be by mutual agreement between the
provider and the city, or at the discretion of the city, with a provision for
the provider and interested parties to comment on the proposed expert and
review its qualifications. The expert review is intended to address
interference and public safety issues and be a site specific review of
technical aspects of the facilities or a review of the provider’s methodology
and equipment used and not a subjective review of the site which was selected
by a provider. Based on the results of the expert review, the city may require
changes to the provider’s application. The expert review shall address the
following:
   A.   The accuracy and completeness of submissions;
   B.   The applicability of analysis techniques and methodologies;
   C.   The validity of conclusions reached; and
   D.   Any specific technical issues designated by the city. (Ord. 836, 9-1-
2021)
18.13.200: REMEDIES:
   A.   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter upon
conviction shall be punishable by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) or by imprisonment for a period of up to ninety (90) days, or by
both such fine and imprisonment, for each day during which an offense occurs.
   B.   In addition to receiving any monetary remuneration, the city shall have
the right to seek injunctive relief for any and all violations of this chapter,
and for other relief and/or remedies provided at law or in equity. (Ord. 836,
9-1-2021)

18.19.010: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   Purpose. The Highway Corridor (HC) and Village (V) zones are
established to implement the City of Chubbuck Comprehensive Plan Chapter 16:
Chubbuck Village Specific Plan for the urban gathering place in the City of
Chubbuck.
      1.   This chapter focuses on the pedestrian environment within a mix of
compatible land uses, rather than traditional zoning which often neglects
pedestrian safety and disconnects people and businesses from one another.
      2.   Together the zones are a form-based code (FBC) regulating first how
building placement and basic design features relate to the street and improve
the pedestrian environment, with less emphasis on land use restriction and
separation.
      3.   FBC standards produce more predictable results in the building and
redevelopment of properties and the desired physical form described in the
Chubbuck Village Specific Plan for Chubbuck.
   B.   Intent. The intent of the zones is to further the policies of the
Chubbuck Village Specific Plan to a greater extent than would a traditional
Euclidean zone to:
      1.   Promote the public health, safety, and welfare;
      2.   Create functionally integrated developments that allow for a more
efficient and cost-effective provision of public services;
      3.   Promote decreased suburban sprawl, under-developed sites, and
agricultural land development on the ex-urban fringe;
      4.   Promote increased community interactions via development standards
which emphasize pedestrian and bicycle modalities;
      5.   Encourage a variety of housing types and affordability that
accommodate residents’ needs through different stages of life;
      6.   Establish reasonable design standards for development and
redevelopment within the zone to ensure that the built environment is
sustainably desirable and stable, that property values are stable and
maintained, and to enhance the image of the City of Chubbuck; and
      7.   Establish standards that allow for additional creativity in
promoting and providing sites and structures that accommodate multiple land
uses. (Ord. 847, 2022)
18.19.020: ENUMERATION OF DISTRICTS:
   A.   Highway Corridor (HC) Zone.
      1.   Purpose. The purpose of this district is to provide an enhanced
location for a broad variety of businesses with highway frontage serving local
and regional markets. The district includes standards based on design and
functions of buildings, site layouts, and landscaping with less emphasis on
land uses per parcel. Standards include city street requirements for the
Chubbuck Village area creating commonalities shared between the Highway
Corridor and Village zones.
      2.   Boundary Legal Description. The following described property
encompasses the Highway Corridor Zone:
A parcel of land located in the in Northeast 1/4 of Section 10, Township 6

(Ord. 847, 2022)
18.19.060: DESIGN AND FRONTAGE:
   A.   These standards focus on form and function of the public realm to a
greater extent than traditional zoning which aims primarily to separate land
uses. It is not the intent of this ordinance to restrict creative building and
site designs. The architectural standards reflect the need to create buildings
that enhance the public realm, which are compatible with surrounding (current
and planned) structures and spaces, and that create an appealing visual
interest without being overly prescriptive.
Of particular interest is ground-level architecture and design that pedestrians
and others visiting the Chubbuck Village area find the streets and pedestrian
corridors interesting and engaging, factors which encourage walking,
particularly in the Village Zone. This can be accomplished through elements
such as store front windows with retail displays, outdoor dining areas,
courtyards, art displays, horizontal expression lines, and placing restrictions
on unbroken façade appearances, etc.

Village zones.

      2.   Each building elevation facing the courtyard or patio on the same
parcel must include at least one public entry.
      3.   Courtyards and patios must include some pervious surface such as
paving bricks or planting beds.
   C.   Building façades along an existing or planned pedestrian corridors per
the adopted Chubbuck Village Specific Plan shall meet the design and frontage
standards of this chapter.
   D.   Horizontal expression lines above the first-floor ceiling help define
the pedestrian sphere with a break in color and texture. They are required on
all façades facing a street or pedestrian corridor. The horizontal expression
line may be created with a stringcourse, belt course, lintels, etc.
   E.   Structures currently existing at the time of this code adoption shall
be allowed to remain in their current form and function, however:
      1.   Rehabilitations such as re-roofing, replacing windows, etc. which do
not affect the external dimensions of the structure or make changes to the
exterior of the building do not require compliance with the design and frontage
standards of this chapter.
      2.   Rehabilitation plans which do not affect the external dimensions of
the structure but that replace the siding, cladding, or other non-structural
façades visible from the existing public realm, or from a planned public realm
such as a future street or pedestrian corridor, must be presented by the
building owner for approval by the design review committee demonstrating that
the project will meet as many of the design and frontage standards of this
chapter as are feasible.
      3.   Horizontal and/or vertical additions to existing buildings require
that the addition be constructed to meet the design standards of this chapter.
      If the value of the new addition will exceed the value of the existing
building, as determined by a professional appraiser, county assessor, or other
party as accepted by the applicant and design review committee, the entire
building shall be brought into compliance with the various design standards of
this Chapter. The building owner must present plans for approval by the design
review committee demonstrating that the façades of the existing building will
meet as many of the design and frontage standards of this chapter as are
feasible.
      4.   Additions to existing structures or expansion of businesses on
parcels abutting the railroad right-of-way are exempt from the design and
frontage standards of this chapter if they are not clearly visible from the
adjacent sidewalk on Burley Dr. Alternatively, if such an addition or expansion
would otherwise be visible from the adjacent sidewalk, improvements to the
property frontage that enhance the pedestrian atmosphere and/or meet design and
frontage standards of this chapter may be approved by the design review
committee.

18.19.070: LAND AND BUILDING USES:
   A.   Pedestrian Emphasis. The Highway Corridor and Village zones place more
emphasis on the pedestrian experience through the placement and height of
buildings to frame the street, and enhanced sidewalks, walkways, and
landscaping. The buildings that line the street are less restricted in their
use than traditional zoning, creating a more interesting and livable
atmosphere. See
Table 19.2: Land and Building Uses for specifics on land and building uses that
are permitted, conditionally permitted, not allowed, or have limitations.

11)   Parking garages are permitted in both HC and V zones.
 
   B.   Nonconforming Uses: Land and building uses currently existing at the
time of this code adoption are considered legal non-conforming uses and shall
be allowed to remain in their current form and function, however at the time of
a change to a different land use group as outlined in
Table 19.2: Land and Building Uses above, the new land use must be permitted in
conformance with this chapter. (Ord. 847, 2022)
18.19.080: LANDSCAPING STANDARDS:
   A.   The following standards for landscaping in the Highway Corridor and
Village zones provide for healthy and aesthetic landscaped frontage areas to
carry the pedestrian experience and attractiveness beyond the street (see
Table 19.3: Landscaped Area Requirements Outside Public Right-of-Way).
Improvements listed below will shade larger expanses of pavement and reduce
heat island effect. They are also designed to improve the aesthetics and
environment within parking areas, and to decrease the visual impact of
vehicular areas (and undeveloped areas) from sidewalk and street.
   B.   Standards apply to:
      1.   All new development;
      2.   Physical changes and improvements to vehicular areas (such as
expansion, new driveway, or new landscape beds (excluding maintenance such as
resurfacing or restriping). In such cases the landscaping standards take
precedence over parking space requirements; and
      3.   Alteration to an existing principle building that results in an
increase of greater than or equal to 25% gross floor area.

18.19.090: PARKING STANDARDS:
   A.   Parking Standards for Highway Corridor and Village zones are designed
to ensure appropriate levels of parking, loading, etc. for a variety of uses
(see
Table 19.4: Parking Area Standards). The standards provide flexibility for
small site development and maximize on-street and shared parking. These
measures will help reduce fragmented single-purposed parking, and provide the
ability to, and promote, park-once and enjoy Village streets on foot or by
bicycle. Standards apply to:
      1.   All new construction of primary or accessory buildings, or expansion
of less than or equal to 25%.
      2.   New or reconstructed parking facilities, including driveways and
loading areas.
      3.   Improvements to existing vehicular areas, including enlargement or
reconfiguration.
      4.   Demolition or destruction of main building on site.
   B.   General Regulations:
      1.   Parking spaces and drive aisle standards:
         a.   Standard spaces must be at least 9 feet wide and 18 feet long.
         b.   Parallel parking spaces must be at least 8 feet wide and 20 feet
long.
         c.   Drive aisles must be at least 20 feet wide. Exceptions for 1-way
drive aisle width may be granted between rows of angled, parallel, or mixed
angled/parallel parking.
      2.   Office/professional is based on net leasable floor space - common
areas, restrooms, etc., are excluded if the building/site includes a mixture of
nonresidential uses the combined total of required spaces may be reduced to
75%.
      3.   No off-street parking allowed in front of main building.
      4.   As with requirements for automobile parking, secure bicycle parking
shall also be provided.

   C.   Parking Requirements: The standards in
Table 19.5: Auto and Bicycle Parking Minimum Requirements, below, are reduced
from requirements in other areas of the city, are intended to decrease chances
that the Chubbuck Village area will be “over-parked,” and decrease the amount
of land consumed by parking rather than active land uses and buildings.
      1.   Sites with permanent or long-term shared parking agreements are
eligible for reduced parking requirements. Off-site non-residential parking is
permitted per the following site standards:
         a.   Must be within 800 feet and not across Yellowstone Avenue from
site.
         b.   Must be subject of long-term lease approval or permanently
dedicated.
      2.   On-street parking stalls adjacent to a property may be included in
the non-residential parking spaces requirement. One third of on-street parking
stalls within three hundred feet (300 feet) of a public building entrance (door
or courtyard) or employee entrance may also be included in the parking
requirement.
      3.   Where uses locate in Chubbuck Village which exceed the number of
street parking stalls fronting the property, the city may require that monies
be collected towards the creation of parking in a common parking area or garage
in or near the district.
      4.   As with other areas of the city, the Chubbuck City Council may
consider deviations in parking requirements on a project-by-project basis.

(Ord. 847, 2022)
18.19.100: SIGNAGE STANDARDS:
   A.   Purpose: Signage Standards for the Highway Corridor and Village Zones
strengthen the economic and aesthetic appeal of the area through elevating sign
standards and regulations. The visual quality, appropriate scale, and effective
display of signs contribute to the identity, brand, and atmosphere of zones.
Specifically:
      1.   Provide the public, property owners, and businesses an opportunity
for safe and effective means of communication, reducing visual distractions and
obstructive views from potentially creating safety hazards for motorists,
pedestrians, and bicyclists.
      2.   Coordinate the location and type of signage with existing and
proposed street frontage landscaping in a manner that that contributes to the
character and economic health of the zones and individual projects and
investments, and enhances the aesthetic quality of the area.
      3.   Provide clear and understandable regulations that enable the fair
and consistent enforcement of these standards.
   B.   General Standards and Requirements:
      1.   New or Reconstructed Signs. All new signs and structural
improvements to existing signs shall comply with these regulations.
      2.   Change in Use for Single Business Signage. For signage serving one
business, whenever the existing use is changed to a new use requiring any
change of signage content or face, the new sign, face, and content shall comply
with these regulations.
      3.   Sign area. The sign area shall be measured from the outside edge of
the sign face.
         a.   The area of a sign consisting of two sides shall be computed by
adding together the total area(s) of both sides.
         b.   The total area of a sign with more than two faces shall be
calculated using the area of the largest 2 faces.
         c.   The total area of a 3-dimensional sign structure shall be
calculated by measuring the profile of the sign as 1 side and doubling the
figure to calculate the total area.
         d.   See
Table 19.6: Sign Standards by Type and Zone for specific requirements.
      4.   Prohibited signs. The following sign types are prohibited in the
Highway Corridor and Village Zones:
         a.   Off-premise signs.
         b.   External Temporary signs other than A-Frame/Sandwich Board signs.
         c.   Signs with moving, spinning, animated, or flashing parts,
including wind-driven signs and running lights.
         d.   Electronic message displays, electronic reader boards, and video
displays.
         e.   Inflated or balloon signs.
         f.   Billboards are prohibited throughout the city.
   C.   Signs Requirements by Type and Zone: Various sign types and sizes are
allowed in the Highway Corridor and Village Zones, depending on the zone and
building façade (see
Table 19.6: Sign Standards by Type and Zone).

   D.   Nonconforming Signs: Permanent signs existing at the time of this code
adoption shall be allowed to remain in their current form and function however:
      1.   Nonconforming signs shall not be enlarged, expanded, extended, nor
shall any additional sign be added to the support structure of a nonconforming
sign. Permanent and temporary attachments, including banners, may not be
attached to the sign. Any proposed alteration shall be made only for bringing
the entire sign into conformity.
      2.   General repairs, maintenance, and change to a sign face or
advertising copy that does not include replacing a static sign with an
electronic message display (EMD) are not considered alterations.
      3.   A sign that is removed for public purposes such as for utilities or
street expansion or repair, may be replaced, and may be placed in an
appropriate location as provided by the city, provided there is no increase in
the height or size of the sign. Any other nonconforming element of the sign
must be brought into conformance. A nonconforming sign that is voluntarily
replaced shall be replaced with a conforming sign.
      4.   If more than 50% of a nonconforming sign is damaged by any means, as
measured by total replacement cost of both the sign and structure prior to such
destruction, it shall be considered destroyed and shall not be brought back
into service or use except in conformity with the provisions of this section.

18.20.010: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   Purpose: In accordance with city policy to guide major land development
projects, the purpose of this district is to encourage innovation and special
features in planned unit development (hereinafter referred to as "PUD") by
embracing and promoting projects proposing any of the following, but not
necessarily all:
      1.   A combination of land uses and development patterns in harmony with
development intensity, multimodal transportation, community design, and
community facilities objectives of the City of Chubbuck Comprehensive Plan;
however, unless otherwise stated in this section, a mix of land uses or housing
types is not required in a PUD.
      2.   A maximum choice of living environments by allowing a variety of
housing and structure types, permitting an increased density per acre, and
accepting a reduction in lot dimensions, yards, setback, and area requirements.
      3.   A more useful network of bicycle and pedestrian paths, open space,
and recreation areas accessible to all and supportive of healthy commuting and
active living, and if included as part of a mixed use project, more convenience
in access to employment and services.
   B.   Intent: The intent of the PUD Zone is to further the policies of the
City of Chubbuck Comprehensive Plan to a greater extent than would a
traditional zone, by providing a zoning district with a better mix and
arrangement of land uses than are typically found separately in mutually
exclusive, traditional zoning districts to:
      1.   Promote the public health, safety, and welfare;
      2.   Reduce suburban sprawl, under-developed sites, and agricultural land
development on the ex-urban fringe;
      3.   Promote increased community interactions through careful site
development which emphasizes pedestrian and bicycle modalities;
      4.   Encourage a variety of housing types and affordability that
accommodate residents' needs through all stages of life;
      5.   Establish reasonable design standards for development and
redevelopment in order to ensure that the built environment is sustainably
desirable and stable, that property values are stable and maintained, and to
enhance the image of the City of Chubbuck; and
      6.   Allow for innovative designs that create visually pleasing and
cohesive patterns of development and multi-modal transportation. (Ord. 825,
2021)
18.20.020: RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LAND USE REGULATIONS:
Whenever there is a difference between the provisions of this chapter and those
of other chapters, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. Unless
otherwise authorized, subjects not governed by this chapter shall be governed
by the respective provisions found elsewhere in this title. (Ord. 825, 2021)
18.20.030: ELIGIBILITY:
The PUD process is not intended to skirt development rules nor result in a
detrimental impact on the surrounding community through its implementation.
   A.   Eligibility: A PUD maybe permitted if a developer desires flexibility
from specific conformance with zoning regulations as applicable to individual
lots or traditional subdivision regulations provided they can meet the
requirements for a PUD located within this chapter. The PUD process is intended
to provide flexibility, latitude, and relief from the provisions of the zoning
ordinance only if the proposed development is consistent with at least two (2)
of the following instances and approved as set forth herein:
      1.   The development offers a maximum choice of living environments by
allowing a variety of housing and building types.
      2.   The development promotes mixed use projects which are functionally
integrated within the development and provides services or benefit to the
primary use. For the purposes of this chapter, a mixed use project means the
incorporation of more than one of the following land use groups: residential,
commercial, industrial, and civic/institutional.
      3.   The development provides a layout which preserves and properly
utilizes natural topography and geologic features, historic resources, scenic
vistas, and beneficial trees or other vegetation.
      4.   The development parcel is constrained or otherwise limited by some
obstacle, feature, geometry, condition, or easement that interferes with
applying standard development processes.
      5.   The development qualifies as infill per this chapter.
      6.   The development encourages infill that further implements the City
of Chubbuck comprehensive plan and other plans, such as for parks or the
downtown area.
   B.   Minimum Area:
      1.   Residential: A PUD shall contain an area of not less than one (1)
acre.
      2.   Commercial, Industrial, or Mixed Uses: A PUD shall contain an area
of not less than three (3) acres.
      3.   Residential Infill PUD: There shall be no minimum area requirement
for a PUD meeting the infill standards per section
18.20.060.E, but design must accommodate requirements of this code.
      4.   Downtown Area: For a Residential, Mixed Use or Commercial PUD in the
Downtown Area there shall be no minimum area requirement, but design must
accommodate requirements of this code. For the purposes of this chapter, the
downtown area shall be defined with the following boundary:
         a.   Union Pacific Railroad on the east, Interstate Highway 86 on the
south, a line approximately four hundred (400) feet west of Yellowstone Avenue
on the west, and a line approximately three hundred (300) feet north of
Chubbuck Road on the north.
         b.   Parcels northwest of the Yellowstone Avenue and Chubbuck Road
intersection are included in this description.
      5.   Sites over five (5) acres are also eligible for Creative Community
(CC) zoning and development. Qualifying sites are encouraged to consider
development as a CC.
   C.   Ownership And Direction: A PUD shall be developed under single
ownership or direction or be the subject of a joint application by the owners
of all property included. An application for approval of a PUD may be filed by
a person or persons having contractual interest in the property, but must
include written consent of the recorded owner or owners of property included in
the development. Unless otherwise provided as a condition for approval of a
PUD, the applicant may transfer units of any development for which approval has
been granted; provided, that the transferee shall complete, use, and maintain
each such unit in conformance with the approved PUD Master Development Plan
(hereinafter referred to as "MDP"). Perpetual maintenance arrangements of
common areas shall be arranged in the Codes, Covenants, and Restrictions
(CC&Rs) as described in
18.20.040.D.
   D.   Qualifying Locations: A PUD Zone may be proposed in any part of the
City. (Ord. 825, 2021)
18.20.040: PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF A PUD:
PUDs are allowed in any area within the city; provided the following procedure
is utilized and the plan is approved by the City Council (hereinafter referred
to as “Council”) after appropriate public hearing and review by the Land Use
and Development Commission (hereinafter referred to as “Commission”). In
reviewing any PUD, the Commission and the Council shall take into account the
criteria and standards set forth in subsection
18.28.040.C of this title.
   A.   Discretionary Powers: Following the spirit and purpose of this chapter,
much greater latitude is permitted than in conventional and traditional
regulations for development density and intensity. In consideration of the
latitude given, the Commission and Council shall have discretionary powers in
judging and approving or disapproving the imaginative or unique concepts,
innovations, and designs which shall be incorporated into the plans presented,
provided that PUD shall conform to the general purposes and objectives of the
City of Chubbuck Comprehensive Plan.
   B.   Planning Conference: The developer shall meet with the Community
Services Director in a Planning Conference as described in
17.12.020 to discuss submission of a PUD zone and MDP application. The purpose
of this meeting is to review early and informally the purpose and effect of
this title and the criteria and standards contained herein, and to familiarize
the developer with the Comprehensive Plan and land use and development
regulations,
   C.   Optional Sketch Plan Review: After holding a Planning Conference, and
before applying for a PUD zone and MDP, the developer may elect to present a
sketch plan of the proposed PUD to the Commission and Council for review and
comment as business items with each body. A sketch plan is not a formal PUD
application, and comments or feedback from the Commission and Council shall be
non-binding. A PUD sketch plan review shall include, at a minimum:
      1.   Items 1 and 3 from subsection D below,
      2.   For residential areas, the proposed density, number of units by type
and location, and the amenities, design, and other incentives allowing
increased density, and
      3.   For non-residential areas and land uses, the proposed uses by type
and location, height, parking, and open space variations, and the amenities,
design, and other incentives allowing greater intensity.
      4.   Topography and significant natural features on and adjacent to the
property.
   D.   PUD Zone And MDP: An application for a PUD zone and a MDP shall be
filed concurrently with the Community Services Director by a property owner or
person having existing interest in the property for which the PUD is proposed.
Together the applications shall follow the process and procedures described in
18.28 for a zoning map amendment.
Application for an associated preliminary plat may be filed at the same time;
procedures for the plat shall follow the process and requirements as described
in Title 17.
The PUD MDP application, as an addendum to the PUD zone application, shall
contain the following information:
      1.   Aerial image showing the site location, acreage, boundary, scale,
and north arrow, accompanied by a legal description of the property,
      2.   Concept plan/map of the PUD with proposed land use locations,
concept for open space, pathways, and amenities, and existing and proposed
streets.
      3.   Proposed schedule and phasing plan for the development of the site,
including development of amenities, open space, and landscape features, and
evidence that the applicant can initiate the proposed development plan within
two (2) years.
         a.   Issuance of building permits may be delayed if the construction
of amenities, open space, and landscaping is not in substantial compliance with
the approved schedule and phasing plan.
         b.   Compliance and adjustments to the schedule and phasing plan for
open space and landscaping may be influenced by weather and seasons.
      4.   Existing features of the development site, including all
transportation systems, waterways, major utilities, easements, floodplain
boundaries, topography, structures, and major areas of woodlands or other
native vegetation.
      5.   A design statement or manual with proposed design and architecture
guidelines, and architectural and special features to be included to qualify
for increased development intensity/density, per
18.20.060 D. and
18.20.070. Include building elevations and heights, type and color of building
materials with emphasis on architectural design and aesthetic value, color
renderings of building materials and structures, landscape standards, and other
architectural features such as street furniture, public art, or site-specific
sign standards. Photographs of similar developments, whether developed by
applicant or others, may be provided.
      6.   For residential areas, the proposed density, number of units by type
and location, street pattern and lots, and the amenities and other incentives
justifying the request for increased density if desired. For non-residential
areas and land uses, the proposed intensity, justification for any proposed
height increases, parking and open space variations; approximate square
footage, preliminary site plans, and the amenities and other incentives
allowing greater intensity.
      7.   Statement of eligibility of the project, per
18.20.030, including qualifications for infill or downtown recognition.
      8.   Streetscape standards, and general landscaping plans for open space,
pathways, and recreation areas.
      9.   Requested deviations in zoning standards, per
18.20.060, including proposed internal setbacks, and plans for perimeter
transitions as described in
18.20.070 B. The MDP application shall be accompanied by a written statement by
the developer setting forth the reasons why, in his opinion, the PUD and
associated deviations from city zoning and street standards would be in the
public interest.
      10.   Engineering feasibility studies and plans showing, as necessary,
water, sewer, irrigation, drainage, and waste disposal facilities; street
improvements and cross-sections if they differ from city standards. The plan
shall show the adequacy and suitability of the utilities and streets proposed
to carry anticipated loads, and increased densities will not be such as to
overload the utility and street networks outside the PUD.
      11.   Evidence of unified ownership or control.
      12.   Deed restrictions, protective covenants, CC&Rs, and other legal
statements or devices to be used to control the use, development, and
maintenance of the land and the improvements thereon, including those areas
which are to be commonly owned and maintained, and pads or lots yet to be
developed whether privately or commonly owned.
      13.   Any other appropriate supplementary information that may also be
required by the Community Services Director.
      14.   Where any information required by this section is similar to
information required to be presented by the developer for a preliminary plat in
compliance with title 17 of this code or the PUD zone application, such
information may be utilized for both purposes. However, consideration and
approval of a subdivision shall occur by separate application, presentation,
and action.
   E.   Approval Or Denial:
      1.   Within sixty (60) days after receipt of the application, the
Commission shall hold a public hearing and review the PUD Zone and MDP
proposal, and recommend to the Council whether the PUD Zone and the MDP be
approved as presented, approved with supplementary conditions or disapproved.
The Commission shall then transmit all files constituting the record and the
recommendation to the Council.
      2.   Within sixty (60) days after receipt of the recommendation of the
Commission, the Council shall hold a public hearing and review the PUD Zone and
MDP and approve, approve with supplementary conditions or deny said plan. Upon
granting or denying the application, the Council shall specify:
         a.   The ordinance and standards used in evaluating the application.
         b.   The reasons for approval or denial.
      3.   In the event the proposed MDP is denied by the Council, the PUD Zone
is also denied and the property remains in the original zoning district.
   F.   Implementation: The MDP shall be adopted as an exhibit to the ordinance
which establishes the specific PUD Zone. The MDP, or portions thereof, maybe
amended per the process outlined in 18.20.050. A development agreement between
the City and the applicant may be required by the City Council and executed
before the zoning designation shall be effective.
   G.   Time Limit: The approval of a MDP shall be effective for a period not
to exceed two (2) years. If no construction has begun within two (2) years
after approval has been issued, it shall expire. An extension of the time limit
may be approved, without further hearing or recommendation by the Commission,
if the Council finds good cause in granting such extension. (Ord. 825, 2021;
amd. Ord. 845, 2022)
18.20.050: PROCEDURE FOR AMENDMENT OF A PUD PLAN:

         a.   An increase in the number of dwelling units; or
         b.   An increase in the total building square footage or height;
      5.   Change in the proposed phasing sequence of the PUD;
      6.   Decrease in the amount of approved open space or landscaping;
      7.   Decreases in any approved setback; and
      8.   Any other proposed change deemed by the Community Services Director
to be a significant change in the MDP. Some architectural style or guidelines
may not affect the changes listed above. (Ord. 825, 2021; amd. Ord. 845, 2022)
18.20.060: LAND USES IN THE PUD ZONE:
   A.   Comprehensive Plan: In compliance with the Future Land Use Map and the
District-Zone Conversation Chart in the Comprehensive Plan, the table below
provides guidance for what uses are generally acceptable within a PUD.
Applicants may propose a variety of land uses within a PUD for immediate and
future development per the Land Uses table in Section B, and additional uses
per Sections C and D, below. The Commission and Council shall specify the exact
permitted and conditionally permitted land uses allowed within the PUD after
considering the proposed land uses, design and buffering, compatibility with

Notes:
   1.   Permitted unless objections by any person as set forth in section
18.12.032 of this title, in which case the matter is treated as a conditional
use permit.
   2.   Permitted unless objections by any person as set forth in section
18.12.030N of this title, in which case the matter is treated as a conditional
use permit.
   C.   Additional Land Uses: In addition to residential and other allowed
uses, up to twenty percent (20%) of the gross land area may be directed to
other uses that are not allowed within the Comprehensive Plan Land Use
Designation area, provided that:
      1.   The uses are appropriate with the primary use.
      2.   The uses are intended to serve principally the properties within the
PUD and adjacent areas.
      3.   The uses are integrated into the PUD.
      4.   The uses are located and so designed as to provide direct access to
a collector or an arterial street without creating congestion or traffic
hazards.
      5.   A minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the primary use development
occurs prior to the development of the specially permitted uses.
   D.   Conditional Uses: Proposed land uses that would require a Conditional
Use Permit in the table above in Section B, or are proposed per Section C,
shall require a notice with the MDP public hearing notice. Such conditional
uses proposed within a PUD after its approval, but not included in the MDP,
shall require a Conditional Use Permit.
   E.   Commercial And Employment Land Use Areas: PUDs in areas with a Future
Land Use Designation of Commercial or Employment in the Comprehensive Plan must
not be exclusively residential but shall include non-residential land uses. The
mix of residential and non-residential land uses shall be appropriate for the
site location and design, as determined by the Commission and Council.
Exceptions may be made for qualified infill parcels, particularly in the
downtown area as defined in section
18.20.030.B.
      1.   As a guideline, PUDs located in areas designated as Employment in
the Comprehensive Plan should reserve at least fifty percent (50%) of the area
for industrial land uses, except for PUDs in the downtown area as described in
18.20.030.B.
      2.   New industrial uses are not allowed in PUDs in the downtown area
unless they are subordinate to a primary use, such as a bakery, microbrewery,
studio, or other business for production of goods or art for sale on site.
      3.   Industrial uses may be permitted in PUDs in other Comprehensive Plan
Land Use areas if it can be shown that such development results in more
efficient and desirable use of land. (Ord. 825, 2021)
18.20.070: DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   General Requirements: In the PUD zone the following table of
requirements shall apply. See section
18.20.080 for exceptions and incentives regarding residential density, and
section
18.20.090 for exceptions to non-residential building height, perimeter
setbacks, and parking standards. Different setbacks maybe proposed as part of
the MDP. See additional requirements on setbacks and perimeter guidance in
Subsection B below.

   B.   Setback:
      1.   Standard setback requirements listed in Subsection A above or
Section
18.08.042 A of this Title shall not apply to structures on the interior of the
project, but setbacks shall follow the approved MDP for the site and adopted
building codes. The MDP shall also guide front yard setbacks.
      2.   A proposed PUD shall incorporate height, density, landscaping, and/
or architectural transition designs along the development’s perimeter to
achieve an orderly transition to existing lower density residential development
or zoning districts on adjacent properties.
      3.   Industrial development in a PUD adjacent to any residential uses or
zoning shall include a landscaped buffer that is at least ten feet (10') wide.
The landscaped buffer shall be planted with an evergreen hedge or a dense
planting of trees and shrubs. If using a buffer of trees and shrubs it shall
include some evergreen species appropriate to the site.
      4.   For the purposes of this section, residential uses across an
arterial street from an industrial use shall not be considered adjacent, but
shall be considered adjacent if located across a local or collector street.
   C.   Waivers and Adjustments: The Council may grant waivers or adjustments
to the requirements for public or private street widths, setbacks or other
design standards if such waivers are deemed appropriate for the development
after considering surrounding uses and aesthetics. Special consideration may be
given for PUDs in infill areas.
      1.   Zoning Standards: The developer may deviate from the height, lot
line setback, and lot dimension schedule found in chapters
18.08 and
18.12.
         a.   Deviations shall be listed in full as a part of the PUD
application and MDP. Modifications to other zoning and subdivision standards
will be determined by the Commission and Council on a case by case basis.
         b.   Residential setbacks shall not be reduced between interior edge
of sidewalks and garages to less than twenty feet (20').
      2.   Municipal Standards: The following standards may be modified if
requested as part of the PUD approval process and if deemed appropriate by the
Council upon advice of the Community Services Director, and other staff as
applicable, after considering whether the resulting development would achieve
greater consistency with the intent and purpose of this chapter than
development that would occur without the modification:
         a.   Any provision in title 16 of this Code pertaining to streets and
sidewalks;
         b.   Any provision pertaining to off-street parking and loading except
that at least one of the required parking spaces per residential unit shall be
located within a reasonable walking distance, except as required to comply with
the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
         c.   Other provisions of this Code on a case-by-case basis.
   D.   Building Permits And Architectural Features: When applying for a
building permit for structures or signs within a PUD, the applicant shall
include a letter or checklist verifying that the structure satisfies the
architectural requirements of this chapter and the conditions of approval of
the PUD. A similar letter or checklist may be required for the Design Review
phase of a development to verify conformance with the approved open space and
landscaping conditions of the PUD.
   E.   Water Conservation In Landscaping: In open space, setbacks, and other
landscaped areas in PUDs, other than recreation areas and managed natural
areas, at least thirty-three percent (33%) of the area shall incorporate and
maintain a ground cover other than lawn or turf grasses, and that consumes less
water than lawn or turf grasses.
   F.   Utilities: Underground utilities, including telephone and electrical
systems, are required within the limits of all PUDs. Appurtenances to these
systems which can be effectively screened may be exempted from this requirement
if the Commission and Council finds that such exemption will not violate the
intent or character of the proposed PUD.
   G.   Common Open Space And Pathways In Residential PUDs: The provisions of
this section apply to residential PUDs and to the Net Residential Area of mixed
use PUDs.
      1.   Minimum Open Space: A minimum of ten percent (10%) of the gross land
area developed in any residential PUD project shall be reserved for common open
space and recreational facilities for the residents or users of the area being
developed. The common open space shall not have any dimension less than ten
feet (10') nor be less than three hundred (300) square feet in area. Required
front, side, and rear yard setback areas, and minimum building to building
separation, shall not be included in the calculation of the common open space
provided.
      2.   Ownership: The required amount of common open space land reserved
under a PUD shall either be held in corporate ownership by owners of the
project area for the use of each owner who buys property within the
development, or if approved by the Council be dedicated to the public and
retained as common open space for parks, recreation, and related uses. The
responsibility for the maintenance of all open spaces shall be specified by the
developer and approved by the Council before approval of the PUD MDP.
      3.   Design: Diversity in the design and use of common open space, open
land, parks, and common areas is encouraged, and approval shall be judged as to
its appropriateness based on the following criteria:
         a.   Areas intended for public use shall be freely accessible from
streets and/or other common areas that have unrestricted entry. The
configuration of such space shall be to accommodate parks, play fields, and
play areas as directed by the city.
         b.   Pocket parks, courtyards, and similar common areas for internal
use are encouraged within PUDs so as to convey a sense of openness and
community within the neighborhood. Pocket parks shall be privately maintained
unless approved by the Council.
         c.   Public utility and similar easements or right-of-way for
watercourses and other channels are not acceptable for common open space
dedication unless such land or right-of-way is usable as a trail or similar
purpose. The common open space must be usable ground and not wasteland with no
other practical purpose. Consideration may be given to a managed area with a
natural setting such as a natural wooded area or a natural sage and grass area.
Drainage or storm water retention is permitted in common areas.
      4.   Accessibility: If possible, every property developed under the PUD
approach should be designed to abut upon common open space or similar areas. A
clustering of dwellings is encouraged so that open space is accessible to as
many residents of the PUD as possible.
         a.   Open space and trails shall be designed so that a minimum of 75%
of all multi-family structures (with three (3) or more residential units per
building) and a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of all single family, duplex,
and twin home lots shall be adjacent to or have direct access to the open
space, pathway, or trail. For the purposes of this section, the term “direct
access” means lots or multi-family buildings are located a maximum of two
hundred fifty feet (250') away from an off-street trail connecting to a common
area open space lot or recreation amenity. The minimum width of internal trails
other than sidewalks shall be six (6) feet.
         b.   Building lots separated from a common area open space lot by a
local street shall be deemed to have achieved direct access if a pedestrian
crossing meeting ADA standards connects the two.
      5.   Trail System Connection Requirements: Exclusive of required
sidewalks within or adjacent to a public right-of-way, a public pedestrian or
bicycle circulation system is required to connect to existing or planned
pedestrian or bicycle routes adjacent to the project. The minimum width of
trails connecting to existing or planned pedestrian or bike routes shall be six
(6) feet, but greater widths maybe required by the City after considering
connections to adopted trail plans and anticipated use.
   H.   Required Amenities In Residential PUDs: Two (2) or more of the
following amenities shall be provided as part of each residential PUD or the
Net Residential Area of a mixed use PUD, and shall be commensurate with the
size and planned population of the development.
      1.   Additional landscaped open space of at least ten percent (10%) of
the gross area (twenty percent (20%), total). To qualify as an amenity, the
additional open space must meet the same requirements as described in 18.20.070
G.1. above for minimal open space requirements.
      2.   Private active recreational facilities such as playgrounds, picnic
areas, basketball or tennis courts, swimming pool, clubhouse, etc., of a size
suitable to meet the needs of the development. For the purposes of this
section, a recreational facility(ies) that can simultaneously serve
approximately eight percent (8%) to ten percent (10%) of the projected PUD
population at any given time shall be deemed commensurate with the size and
needs of the development.
      3.   Golf courses, but regardless of its size no golf course may
contribute more than one-quarter of the common open space required by this
section.
      4.   Provision for a neighborhood park or other public open space or
improved trailhead, with public access thereto.
      5.   Greenways and waterways that include pedestrian ways, trails, bike
paths, and equestrian trails linking residential areas with other open space
uses. These maybe constructed on public utility or other easements or canal
right-of-way, and may be dedicated to the City or a non-profit entity.
Greenways and waterways differ in scale from required trail systems described
in subsection B above, and may include natural areas, seating/rest areas or
other appropriate facilities.
      6.   Other amenities as may be approved by the Commission and Council on
a case-by-case basis. (Ord. 825, 2021; amd. Ord. 845, 2022; Ord. 846 § 7, 2022)
18.20.080: RESIDENTIAL PUD REQUIREMENTS AND INCENTIVES:

         g.   Accessory dwellings and loft apartments are not included in the
categories above for the purposes of this section nor Section
18.20.060.D above.
         h.   Gross vs. Net Residential Areas: For the purposes of calculating
density in regards to this chapter, the Gross Area of a PUD shall include all
parcels included in the application. Residential Net Area means the Gross Area
of a mixed use PUD less all acreage designated for non-residential or mixed
uses. Internal streets, driveways, parking, and recreation facilities serving
residents of the PUD are included in the Net Residential Area.
   B.   Residential Design Standards And Architectural Form:
      1.   Architectural Features.
         a.   The following features shall be required:
            (1)   Contrasting color schemes and/or textures to create visual

            (6)   Enhanced window fenestration on all remaining front elevation
windows, and all second story windows facing a street, parking area, or open
space area, using principal window treatments described above in subsection a.
(2)
            (7)   Break-up of parking areas in multi-family developments,
including the use of enhanced landscaping features. Driveways between separate
parking areas shall be provided, unless unusual site shape or other
characteristics warrant separate access points and parking areas.
            (8)   Garages or covered parking stalls for at least one of the
required parking spaces for each unit in a multi-family development. Detached
garages or covered parking structures must complement the residential structure
design in color, texture, etc. (Garages or covered parking shall count as two
(2) features for the purposes of this section).
      2.   Gated Communities Prohibited: Gated communities are prohibited
within the PUD Zone.
      3.   Parking, Garages, and Carports: Garages and carports maybe included
in the required amount of off-street parking provided in residential areas.
Driveway parking spaces shall be at least ten feet (10') wide and twenty feet
(20') deep. Garages must be setback from the interior edge of the sidewalk by
at least twenty feet (20') to prevent vehicle overhang.
      4.   Land uses within the PUD will be interconnected through a system of
roadways and pathways as appropriate. Clustering of buildings is also
encouraged to increase efficiency in land use and in public utility delivery.
      5.   Parking areas in multi-family developments or other shared
residential parking areas shall be landscaped per requirements of Title 18.14,
with the following enhancements:
         a.   Landscaping strips at least four feet (4') wide shall separate
parking areas from buildings. Any sidewalk provided between a building and
parking area may be on either side of the landscape strip. Such strips are
considered part of the parking area and not open space.
         b.   Planters for trees in parking areas shall be distributed so that
all parking stalls are within fifty feet (50') of a tree, measured from corner
of stall to tree trunk. Tree and shrub planting areas shall be at least four
feet (4') wide and six feet (6') long. Covered parking spaces shall be within
sixty feet (60') of a tree. Parking garage spaces are exempt from this
requirement, but landscaping is required adjacent to the garage as described in
subsection 3.a above.
   C.   Residential Density And Incentives:
      1.   Density per Future Land Use Designation: The base allowable
residential density for a PUD is established per the Future Land Use
Designation area in the City of Chubbuck Comprehensive Plan as follows:
         a.   Low Density Residential (LDR): 5 units per acre.
         b.   Medium Density Residential (MDR): 8 units per acre.
         c.   High Density Residential (HDR), Mixed Use (MU), Commercial, and
Employment: sixteen (16) units per acre.
      2.   Density Incentives: To provide for an incentive for quality PUDs,
the Council may authorize an increased density of up to twenty-five percent
(25%) of the allowable number of dwelling units or structures, as appropriate,
taking into consideration the factors set forth in the following subsections.
Character, identity, architecture, and siting variation incorporated into a
development shall be considered the standard for all PUDs, such as: exceptional
landscaping, streetscapes, and site design; open spaces and plazas, use of
native plantings, and pedestrianway treatments, and recreational areas; siting,
visual focal points, use of existing physical features, and variation in
building setbacks and building grouping (such as clustering); and design
features, street sections, architectural styles, harmonious use of materials,
parking areas broken by landscaping features and varied use of housing types.
         a.   Public facility site dedications including, but not be limited
to, the following: school site, transit facility, park and ride lot, and public
facility such as a library, recreation center, police, fire, or emergency
medical services station. Lands considered for this purpose must be sufficient
in size and scope to accommodate specific public need(s), free of encumbrances,
pose no health or safety issues, and serve the public interests as determined
by the Council in order to qualify for this designation and the ensuing
acceptance. Land dedicated for public use maybe eligible for bonus density
opportunity; fifteen percent (15%).
         b.   Workforce/affordable housing, a maximum increase often percent
(10%) for those projects providing workforce/affordable housing. Workforce/
affordable housing shall be measured against the eligible income limits
recognized by SEICAA for Bannock County. The developer shall present
recommendations from SEICAA or other findings and examples relative to the
housing provided to qualify units as affordable. A general guideline for
affordability may include the number of bedrooms relative to the income limits
by household size.
            (1)   Affordable units must be dispersed throughout the
development, if possible.
            (2)   Up to five percent (5%) for a PUD with four (4) affordable
units or two percent (2%) of all units, whichever is greater; or
            (3)   Up to ten percent (10%) for a PUD with eight (8) affordable
units or five percent (5%) of all units, whichever is greater.
         c.   Architectural features: Inclusion of at least three (3) of the
following components on or affecting all residential structures throughout the
development; ten percent (10%):
            (1)   Any of the architectural features suggested in section
18.20.070.B that were not incorporated in the PUD to meet the requirements of
that section.
            (2)   Enhanced paving and/or hardscape design features at
intersections, courtyards, driveways, etc.
            (3)   Staggered setbacks for adjacent homes, townhouses, etc.
            (4)   The use of green building components such as, but not
limited, to the following:
               (a)   Permeable pavement on parking areas or driveways.
               (b)   Renewable energy systems, such as solar panels.
               (c)   Selective window orientation, shading and other treatments
with building placement to preserve solar access and/or improve heating/cooling
efficiency,
               (d)   Use of landscaping or natural topography, and energy-
efficient building layout, for natural windbreaks and shade in clustered or
multi-family developments.
         (5)   The proposed architectural features for the PUD shall be
included in the MDP application described in
18.20.040.D.
      3.   Flexibility: Any latitude, flexibility or relief provided through a
PUD application shall be compensated by the addition of some new amenity,
within or outside the development. Such an amenity should provide equal or
greater value to the development as a whole. The determination of whether the
compensation offered is equal to or greater than the relief provided is left to
the discretion of Commission and Council.
   D.   Residential Infill Developments:
      1.   Lots and parcels within the city, or annexing into the city, may be
considered for infill PUD status if it meets the following criteria:
         a.   Location:
            (1)   Lie in areas already substantially developed defined as at
least sixty percent (60%) of the land area within three hundred (300) feet of
the boundaries of the parcel (excluding streets, waterways, etc.); or

      1.   The MDP of a non-residential or mixed use PUD shall provide for: the
integrated and harmonious design of buildings, adequate and properly arranged
facilities for internal traffic circulation, a compact grouping in order to
economize in the provision of such utility services as are required, and
landscaping and such other features and facilities necessary to make the
project attractive from adjoining and surrounding residential and public areas.
      2.   Non-residential structures and buildings shall be planned as groups
having common parking areas and common ingress and egress points in order to
reduce the number of potential accident locations and maintain collector and
arterial street traffic circulation. The uses within the PUD will be
interconnected through a system of roadways and pathways as appropriate.
      3.   Parking areas shall be landscaped per requirements of Title 18.14,
with the following enhancements:
         a.   Landscaping strips at least four feet (4') wide shall separate
parking areas from buildings. Any sidewalk provided between a building and
parking area maybe on either side of the landscape strip. Such strips are
considered part of the parking area and not the required open space.
         b.   Planters for trees in parking areas shall be distributed so that
all uncovered parking stalls are within fifty feet (50') of a tree, measured
from corner of stall to tree trunk. Tree and shrub planting areas shall be at
least four feet (4') wide and six feet (6') long. Covered parking spaces and
parking garage spaces are exempt from this requirement, but landscaping is
required in the parking area, and adjacent to the garage as described in
subsection 3.a above.
      4.   Industrial uses and parcels shall use landscaping, existing terrain
or vegetation, berms, fencing, or a combination thereof as buffers to screen
lighting, parking areas, loading areas or docks, and/or outdoor storage of raw
materials or products from residential areas, open space, parks, and arterial
streets. Thoroughfares shall be kept to a minimum throughout a planned
industrial area in order to reduce truck traffic in the PUD.

elements in all buildings or public areas in the PUD. Elements may include:
similar or complementary colors, textures or architectural features; window
treatments or canopies; courtyards and/or alcoves; street furniture and public
art; or some other features as proposed by the applicant. Accessory structures
and secured and screened parking or delivery areas may be exempt from this
requirement. Awnings are allowed in a PUD but do not meet the standards of this
section.
      7.   Noise-generating fixtures and equipment including but not limited to
large-scale HVAC units, loudspeakers, electric and pneumatic tools, and
compressors must be reasonably located or screened to limit sound transfer to
adjacent residential or recreation areas within or outside the PUD.

         c.   Hardscapes such as fountains, courtyards, plazas, and decorative
walkways (other than required sidewalks) may be part of the open space.
         d.   Public utility and similar easements or right-of-way for
watercourses and other channels are not acceptable for open space dedication
unless such land or right-of-way is usable as a trail or similar purpose
allowing bicycle and pedestrian access or circulation for employees and
customers, as well as residents in mixed use PUDs. The common open space must
be usable ground and not wasteland with no other practical purpose.
Consideration may be given to a managed area with a natural setting such as a
natural wooded area or a natural sage and grass area. Drainage or stormwater
retention is permitted in common areas.
   B.   Non-Residential Development Incentives:
      1.   Open Space. The common open space required by this section may be
reduced by the Council by twenty-five percent (25%) in non-residential areas if
it can be demonstrated that the common open space and parking areas are:

maximum height if they are setback from R-l, R-2, or R-2P zoning districts at
the PUD perimeter by at least forty feet (40'). Upper floors of multi-story
buildings may use "wedding cake style architecture" to achieve transitions from
neighboring parcels and extend above the maximum height; maximum increase ten
feet (10').
         b.   Architectural Features: Non-residential structures meeting the
following design guidelines may qualify for an increase of up to ten feet (10')
above the standard height limit. Qualified buildings or PUDs shall incorporate
at least three (3) of the following features:

included in the shared parking reduction without a parking study as described
above in subsection (2).
            (4)   If a parking incentive is desired for more than two uses in
the table above, one reduction rate based on the two uses with the highest
parking demand (total number of spaces needed) shall be used to calculate the
potential incentive.
         b.   In addition to the potential parking requirement modifications
described in section 1 above, parking requirements maybe reduced for all or
part of the non-residential development as follows:
            (1)   Parking requirements for non-residential PUDs, or parts
thereof, in the downtown area:
               (a)   Reductions in requirements described in section 1. above
maybe increased by fifty percent (50%).
               (b)   On street parking adjacent to the PUD (street frontages
only) may be included in the required parking amount. Public street center
parking islands are not included for the purposes of this section.
            (2)   For every five (5) covered bicycle parking spaces provided
the required number of vehicle parking spaces may be reduced by one (1) space,
up to a maximum reduction of three (3) spaces. Bicycle parking must be ground-
mounted, such as wave, U, or bollard styles, or custom/architectural racks.
Grid style or low-profile racks will not be considered for a parking reduction.
            (3)   For a permanent bicycle repair station and pump, provided
with covered bicycle parking as described above in subsection (2), the required
number of vehicle parking spaces may be reduced by one (1) additional space.

CHAPTER 18.21
CREATIVE COMMUNITY (CC) ZONE
SECTION:
18.21.010: Purpose And Intent
18.21.020: Special Provisions
18.21.030: Zone Establishment; Master Development Plan
18.21.040: Design Book Review
18.21.050: Development And Design Standards
18.21.010: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   Purpose: The Creative Community (CC) Zone is established to provide a
greenfield planned unit development approval process as permitted under Idaho
Code 67-6515, and to provide for a zone with a mix of land uses that range in
intensity than are typically found separately in mutually exclusive,
traditional zoning districts. This zone represents a departure from traditional
zoning to the extent that it encourages a combination of land uses which may be
compatible, but have traditionally been separated.
   B.   Intent: The intent of the Creative Community (CC) Zone is to further
the policies of the Comprehensive Plan to a greater extent than would a
traditional Euclidean zone to:
      1.   Promote the public health, safety, and welfare;
      2.   Create functionally integrated developments that allow for a more
efficient and cost effective provision of public services;
      3.   Promote decreased suburban sprawl, under-developed sites, and
agricultural land development on the ex-urban fringe;
      4.   Promote increased community interactions through careful site
development which emphasizes pedestrian and bicycle modalities;
      5.   Encourage a variety of affordable housing types;
      6.   Establish reasonable design standards for development and
redevelopment within the zone in order to ensure that the built environment is
sustainably desirable and stable, that property values are stable and
maintained, and to enhance the image of the City of Chubbuck; and
      7.   Allow for innovative designs that create visually pleasing and
cohesive patterns of development and multi-modal transportation. (Ord. 778,
2018)
18.21.020: SPECIAL PROVISIONS:
In order to achieve the purpose and intent of this chapter, as part of the CC
Zone approval process, the City shall consider the following provisions during
reviews:
   A.   Selective Modifications Of Municipal Standards: The following standards
may be modified if requested as part of the CC Zone approval process and if
deemed appropriate by the Council upon advice of the Community Services
Director, and other staff as applicable, after considering whether the
resulting development would achieve greater consistency with the intent and
purpose of this chapter than development that would occur without the
modification:
      1.   Any provision in title 16 of this Code pertaining to streets and
sidewalks.
      2.   Any provision pertaining to off-street parking and loading except
that at least one of the required parking spaces per residential unit shall be
located a reasonable walking distance, except as required to comply with the
Americans With Disabilities Act.
      3.   Other provisions of this Code on a case-by-case basis.
   B.   Qualifying Locations And Area Requirements: The following location and
area requirements apply in any CC Zone:
      1.   Qualifying Locations: A CC Zone may be proposed in any part of the
City.
      2.   Minimum Zone Area: To ensure that CC zoned developments are able to
achieve the purposes stated in this chapter, and to ensure that projects are
large enough to support a private homeowners’ association, property management
agency, or corporation responsible for maintenance of open space, all CC zoned
developments shall have a minimum area of five (5) acres unless, after written
request from the developer, written authorization is granted by the Community
Services Director prior to developer making application based on finding that
the proposed development will be able to satisfy the intent of this subsection
and chapter. Any such authorization from the Community Services Director shall
not be binding on the Land Use and Development Commission or the City Council.
   C.   Overall Net Residential Zone Density: In no case shall the net
residential area (gross acreage less the area of nonresidential uses) be less
than three (3) dwelling units per acre. There shall be no maximum density,
provided that public services and utilities are adequate to serve the
development or could be adequate through developer remedy.
   D.   Minimum Lot Area: There shall be no minimum lot area in any CC Zone,
except as established with development approval. Parcels shall be of sufficient
size to assure compliance with building setbacks, landscaping, access, parking,
and walkability standards.
   E.   Surrounding Properties: Through use of design features including, but
not limited to, increased peripheral setbacks, architectural treatments, and
landscaped buffers, the developer shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Council, that sufficient measures have been incorporated into the development
plan to assure that adjacent properties will not experience significant impacts
as a result of the proposed development.
   F.   Pedestrian Realm: In order to achieve an overall walkable development,
appropriate land uses, pedestrian connections, cross easements, common
driveways, consistent site standards, etc., must be coordinated within the
respective CC Zone, even though properties may be individually owned.
   G.   Land Use Area Designation: As part of the approval process as set forth
in this chapter, the developer shall designate areas within the CC Zone in
accordance with the land use area listed below and shall submit a list of
permitted and conditionally permitted uses within each proposed land use area
from section
18.08.040 of this title. Through the zoning process, uses conditionally
permitted in the CC Zone under section
18.08.040 of this title may be designated as permitted within specific land use
areas. The allowable and conditional uses for a CC Zone are established by the
ordinance zoning the subject property as a CC Zone.
      1.   Residential: This land use area is designed for comparatively low to
medium density development that emphasizes residential (single and multi-
family) use, but also may include appropriately scaled office, commercial,
public/semipublic and recreation/open space uses.
      2.   Village: This land use area is designed for medium to high density
mixed use development that includes residential (single- and multifamily),
office, commercial, public/semipublic, recreation/open space uses, and certain
compatible light industrial uses without a predetermined emphasis on any single
use.
      3.   Town: This land use area is designed for office, commercial and
recreational uses, but also includes residential (single- and multi-family),
public/semipublic, open space, and certain compatible light industrial uses.
      4.   Business and research park: This land use area is designed to
accommodate (but not require) a mixture of all uses: residential (single- and
multi-family), office, commercial, light industrial, recreational and public/
semipublic uses. The principal land use in this category should be office,
commercial and light industrial.
   H.   Relationship To Other Land Use Controls: Wherever there is a difference
between provisions of this chapter and those of other chapters, the provisions
of this chapter shall control. Unless otherwise authorized, subjects not
governed by this chapter shall be governed by the respective provisions found
elsewhere in this Code. (Ord. 778, 2018; amd. Ord. 845, 2022)
18.21.030: ZONE ESTABLISHMENT; MASTER DEVELOPMENT PLAN:
   A.   Each proposed CC Zone may be established by following standard rezoning
procedures of this title and shall be accompanied by a master development plan
(MDP) prepared by the applicant, in consultation with City staff and area
property owners, which specifies land use areas. Design books, phased
developments, and approved individual plats and site plans shall conform to the
master development plan. The MDP shall contain:
      1.   Aerial image showing the zone location, acreage, boundary, scale,
and north arrow;
      2.   Concept/bubble plans showing designated land uses areas, open space,
conceptual vehicle transportation system, and conceptual bicycle and pedestrian
transportation systems and facilities;
      3.   Phasing plan;
      4.   Existing transportation infrastructure, waterways, major utilities,
and easements, and floodplain boundaries;
      5.   Topography and significant features on or adjacent to the property;
      6.   Architectural renderings demonstrating the development’s theme;
      7.   Narrative including a description of the densities of the project, a
description of the proposed public or quasi-public amenities, and a description
of how the development will satisfy the requirements of this chapter; and
      8.   A land use area table showing the number of dwelling units,
commercial area, and densities within each respective land use area, and the
total acreage of open space by area, and a list of permitted and conditional
uses in each designated land use area.
      9.   A draft development agreement which includes proposed codes,
covenants, and restrictions (CC&Rs), which said CC&Rs demonstrating how the
developer intends to satisfy short and long-term obligations of the zoning
district.
      10.   Any other appropriate supplementary information that may also be
required by the Community Services Director.
      11.   Evidence of unified ownership or control.
   B.   The intent of the above is to achieve a consistent overall mixed use
neighborhood with uniform and compatible site standards when the project area
is completely built out. Remnant parcels left from old developments, rebuilds
on existing parcels, or pads within existing center developments, are required
to make reasonable compliance with mixed use development standards through
consultation with the Community Services Director.
   C.   The MDP shall be adopted as an exhibit to the ordinance which
establishes the specific CC Zone. The MDP, or portions thereof, may be amended
only after review by the Land Use and Development Commission, with public
input, and upon approval of the City Council after the establishment of the CC
Zone, as may be needed. A development agreement between the City and the
applicant may be required by the City Council and executed before the zoning
designation shall be effective.
In consideration of the latitude given with CC Zone, the City shall have
discretionary powers in judging and approving or disapproving the imaginative
or unique concepts, innovations, and designs which shall be incorporated into
the master development plan presented. (Ord. 778, 2018; amd. Ord. 845, 2022)
18.21.040: DESIGN BOOK REVIEW:
All development and uses in CC Zones may only be established in conformance
with the approved master development plan (MDP), or as the plan may be amended
and approved, through conformance reviews at application development and design
review stages. Applicants are encouraged to consult with City staff prior to
submitting an application.
   A.   In addition to those items required for a preliminary plat application
under title 17 of this Code, applicants within CC Zones shall prepare and
submit a site plan and submit a design book containing typical renderings,
cross sections, and plan views of the following:
      1.   Existing and proposed public street curb, gutter, sidewalk,
landscaping, streetlights, and pavement;
      2.   Yard areas between buildings and public streets, including trees,
grass shrubs, ground cover, signs, fencing, and screen walls;
      3.   Parking areas, walkways, driveways, landscaped areas, and stormwater
detention/retention areas;
      4.   Architectural features, including materials and colors, of
buildings, freestanding and wall-mounted signs and light fixtures, trash
enclosures, utility and loading area screen walls, fencing plans, pedestrian
furniture, and artwork.
      5.   Other improvements as required by City staff to ensure conformance
with the MDP.
   B.   The design book must be found to be in conformance with the MDP by the
Land Use and Development Commission in order for a preliminary plat application
to be approved.
   C.   Building permits and other uses within the development shall only be
issued upon being found to conform to the design book and MDP. (Ord. 778, 2018)
18.21.050: DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN STANDARDS:
In order to achieve the purpose and intent of this chapter, the following
standards apply to CC Zoning Districts:
   A.   General Standards:
      1.   Common Ownership: For all multiple use developments, the tract or
tracts of land included in such developments must be under one ownership or
control or be the subject of a joint application by the owners of all property
included. Unless otherwise provided as a condition for approval, the applicant
may transfer units of any development for which approval has been granted;
provided, that the transferee shall complete, use, and maintain each such unit,
in strict conformance with the approved development plan.
      2.   Appropriate Mix Of Uses; Careful Location Of Nonresidential Uses: CC
Zones shall demonstrate an appropriate mix of land uses such as different types
of residential uses, residential with commercial, or some other mix.
Appropriateness shall be judged on the tract's location in relation to
infrastructure, topography, and current and projected market demand.
         a.   Dense Land Use Areas: To maximize economic synergy and prevent
commercial sprawl, more intensive and dense land use areas, such as the village
and town land use areas, shall be located towards the center of the development
or, if the development will be located next to an existing or planned similar
intensive and dense area, near said areas, unless otherwise demonstrated to be
unfeasible or undesirable by the developer, City staff, or the City Council
through the approval process.
         b.   Village And Town Siting Determination: The location of each
village and town land use area shall be carefully selected to be located at a
walkable distance from planned or existing predominantly residential
developments.
      3.   Bicycle And Pedestrian Pathways And Trails: The CC zoned development
shall demonstrate an excellent system of pathways, trails, and sidewalks which
are demonstrated to be useful, safe, comfortable, and interesting, and which
provide connectivity within the development and to adjacent properties.
         a.   Internal Connectivity: Pathways within a development shall
connect residential areas to other residential neighborhoods and to
nonresidential areas, to open space common lots, recreational facilities, and
to school bus pick up locations. Width and materials of pathways shall be
designed in accordance with their anticipated use and volume; as a guideline,
major two-way shared use paths should be at least ten feet (10') wide and no
path should be smaller than five feet (5') wide. Design of these pathways shall
minimize street crossings to reduce conflict points.
         b.   Street Furniture: Within areas of intense commercial use, street
furniture which is related to the overall design theme of the development may
be required which may include benches, trash receptacles, artwork, bike racks
and facilities, etc.
         c.   Transit: Upon recommendations from PRT and/or BTPO, bus turnouts,
shelters, stops, and other transit options may be required.
         d.   Bike Lanes: Extensive use of bike lanes and other facilities and
of curb extensions/bulb-outs at intersections is encouraged and may be
required.
      4.   Peripheral Location Of Collectors And Arterials: To facilitate
enhanced mobility for people who walk and bike, required collectors and
arterials shall be located on the periphery of the development unless otherwise
demonstrated to be unfeasible or undesirable by the developer, City staff, or
the City Council through the approval process.
      5.   Ownership And Maintenance Of Open Space And Common Property:
Whenever private common open space, improvements, or other property are
provided, the City will require that an association of owners or tenants be
created and incorporated for the purpose of maintaining such commonly held
property or improvement. The association shall be created in such a manner that
owners of property shall automatically be members and shall be subject to
assessments levied to maintain said open space and/or common property for the
purposes intended. The period of existence of such association shall be
perpetual unless a majority vote of the members and consent of the City Council
shall terminate it.
      6.   Gated Communities Prohibited: Gated communities are prohibited with
the CC Zone.
   B.   Building And Architectural Design And Standards:
      1.   Building Areas To Be Unencumbered: Buildable areas must be
unencumbered by setbacks, public easements, and other physical constraints
(such as topography or similar features).
      2.   Clustering: Buildings shall be clustered to preserve scenic or
environmentally sensitive areas in the natural state, or to consolidate small
open spaces into larger, more usable areas for common use and enjoyment.
Clustered areas shall be carefully designed to abut upon common open space or
recreational amenities. When CC zoned developments include commercial uses,
commercial buildings and establishments, the development shall be planned as
groups having common parking areas and common ingress and egress points in
order to reduce the number of vehicle and bike/pedestrian conflict point
locations.
      3.   Like Uses To Face Like Uses: Where possible, "like land uses" shall
face "like land uses" or open space, i.e., retail across the street from
retail, townhomes from townhomes, etc.
      4.   Landscaping: All areas not covered by buildings, or by off- street
car parking areas or driveways, shall be planted in lawn, trees and shrubs, or
otherwise landscaped and maintained in accordance with an approved landscape
plan; the use of extensive xeriscaping is strongly encouraged. All required
front yard and side yard areas which are adjacent to a public street shall not
be used for automobile parking areas, except for permitted driveways, but shall
be landscaped and maintained with lawns, trees and shrubs, or other landscape
materials. Landscaped park strips with street trees, in accordance with this
Code, are required along local and functionally classified streets; portions of
park strips may be paved to accommodate street furniture, leaving appropriately
sized tree wells for street trees.
      5.   Fencing Along Sidewalks And Streets Discouraged; Standards For When
Used: To facilitate a visually open public realm, unless otherwise required by
this chapter, fencing along sidewalks or streets, excluding alley ways, is
strongly discouraged. Where such fencing is used however, fencing plans which
include heights, materials, and designs, shall be reviewed as part of the
design book review process and the City may impose necessary conditions of
approval in order to satisfy the intent and purpose of this chapter and
section.
      6.   Buffering Of Nonresidential Uses From Residential Uses: Where
separation is desirable between uses, landscaped buffers are preferred over
fences and walls in order to create a more visually open look. When fences are
used between uses or properties within the development, fencing shall be
compatible in color, texture, and design in relationship to building materials.
Buffering may be required by the Land Use and Development Commission, the City
Council, or Design Review Committee between uses deemed incompatible.
      7.   Utilities: Underground utilities, including telephone, fiber, and
electrical systems, are required within the limits of all CC Zones.
Appurtenances to these systems which can be effectively screened may be
exempted from this requirement if the Council finds that such exemption will
not violate the intent or character of the proposed development. However, the
developer shall make efforts to group appurtenances together so as to minimize
their distribution.
      8.   Storage Of Recreational Vehicles, Watercraft, Trailers, Campers,
Motorhomes, And Other Utility Vehicles To Be Screened: Watercraft, trailers,
campers, motor homes and other utility or recreational vehicles shall be stored
within completely enclosed, lawfully constructed buildings or within fenced
enclosures at least six feet (6') behind the front line and the street side
line of the main building on the lot or parcel in a CC Zone, except that said
vehicles may be parked temporarily in front or side yards for no longer than
twenty four (24) hours.
      9.   Architectural Control Committee Required: Each development shall
provide for, and maintain, an Architectural Control Committee to ensure that
the treatment of building mass, materials, and exterior appurtenances create
aesthetically pleasing structures and a site that is in character with, and in
proportion to, other surrounding buildings, while still providing diversity in
design and neighborhood identity. The committee shall review and approve all
themes and colors prior to design review and building permit application
submittals to the City and to significant exterior modifications to ensure
compliance with the approved Master Development Plan and Design Book.
      10.   Product Mix: Each project shall provide a variety of home styles to
ensure a diverse and interesting street scene. Neighborhoods that have nearly
identical homes and streets without variation in product placement and form are
not allowed. In order to ensure that the neighborhood is non-repetitive, homes
with the same color scheme shall not be built on adjacent lots on the same
street or on lots directly or diagonally across the street from one another.
      11.   Corner Lots: Special attention should be paid to corner lots. At
least one home plan per neighborhood shall be designed specifically for corner
home sites. This home plan is required to include wrap-around architecture to
provide visual interest on both the front and corner side yard of the home, and
the ability to turn the garage for side entry. An example would be continuing a
full-wrap of material accent onto the side facade, adding a wraparound porch,
or facing the home on a diagonal towards the intersection. Corner lot
development shall conform to product mix requirements of the previous section.
      12.   Entry Sidewalks And Front Porch: Single-family residences shall
have building entry sidewalks that connect directly to a street sidewalk or
pathway. Except where sloped topography may justify, the distance between the
front door and edge of the sidewalk shall not exceed twenty five feet (25'). To
encourage increased community interactions and feeling, residences are
encouraged to have covered, open-front porches that are at least six feet (6')
in width.
      13.   Garages: The home and front yard rather than the garage shall be
the primary emphasis of the front elevation. The City encourages the use of
side load/swing-in type garages and rear- loaded garages. Where front-loaded
garages are to be used, they shall be subservient to the dwelling and shall be
set back at least fifteen feet (15') from the front line of the dwelling.
      14.   Multi-Family Housing: Multi-family dwellings, including apartments,
duplexes, 3-plexes, 4-plexes, etc., shall be designed to have an outward
appearance of a single-family dwelling unless a design deviation is granted as
part of the design book approval process.
      15.   Ground Level Aesthetics: Buildings shall be designed to relate to
grade conditions with a minimum of grading and exposed foundation walls,
creating easy pedestrian access from sidewalks, parking areas, etc. Commercial
or mixed use buildings shall be designed with contrasting ground floor
architectural articulation in order to enhance street activity and walkability.
Windows, display windows, doors, and arcades must make up at least fifty
percent (50%) of street facing facades on the first story of commercial
developments. Window shapes and sizes shall be so designed to be compatible
from building to building. Tinted windows or windows with reflective film or
glass are discouraged at street level.
      16.   Access: All lots developed for residential purposes shall have
frontage along a public roadway, or be rear-loaded with alley access, or front
upon a "green court". All retail, civic, and office buildings shall front onto
streets.
      17.   Building Height: Buildings shall have a minimum and maximum number
of stories as indicated by the land use areas in the table below, with height
measured according to the City's adopted ordinances and standards. The City
Council may approve greater building heights than shown in the table below if
it identifies site or design characteristics that are unique to the development
such as size, scale, topography, or development amenities (e.g., rooftop
gardens), that justify allowing greater building heights. Approved structures
with additional height may be required to employ suitable "step back"
architecture and other architectural features that create a development that is
built at the human scale, and is pedestrian friendly and architecturally
diverse.

Notes:
   1.   Vertical architectural elements that make the buildings appear greater
than 1 story.
   2.   "Step back" architecture may be required so that building heights
adjacent to public streets are limited to enhance pedestrian design.
      18.   Lighting: Streetlights shall conform to an approved theme and shall
exhibit pedestrian-scaled design and enhance walking safety. For purposes of
this section, pedestrian-scaled design means using lighting that is lower in
height and more closely spaced than standard street lighting, with heights
between twelve feet to sixteen feet (12' - 16'). Additional lighting at
crosswalks and crosswalk approaches may be required.
      19.   Parking: Parking lots between buildings and functionally classified
collector and arterial streets are prohibited unless justified through the
applicable review approval process on a case-by-case basis.
      20.   Signage: Proper design and placement of signs and their lighting
shall be compatible with structures and uses. Mixed use developments shall have
a sign theme which promotes mixed use compatibility. Wall signs, blade signs,
and window signs, approved as part of an overall sign theme, are encouraged.
      21.   Open Space: Significant usable and functionally connected open
space shall be provided within the mixed use development, depending upon size,
scale, nature, and proximity of other accessible open space amenities in the
area of the development. It is the intent of this section that as residential
lots decrease in usable private yard areas, that increased community open space
be provided to compensate. Approved open space may include, but is not limited
to: commons, pocket parks, plazas, outdoor dining, courtyards, natural or
manmade landscape features or focal points, fountains, waterfalls, other water
features, greenbelts, trail connections, playgrounds, pavilions, and picnic
areas. A "village green", as a commons area, may be required adjacent to mass
transit connections or other significant activity. Stormwater drainage areas
may be incorporated into open space designs, provided that open space amenities
are provided for within.
Construction materials used within open space areas shall be related to the
materials of adjacent buildings. Design and texture shall encourage comfortable
and safe pedestrian use, including landscaping, seating areas, and lighting as
appropriate.
Areas of environmental concern or interest may be required to be preserved,
i.e., drainages, steep slopes, connections to trail systems, and water
features. Unless otherwise specified through special agreement or understanding
with the City, all open space areas shall be commonly owned maintained by
property owners or property associations. (Ord. 778, 2018)

18.24.070: Uses Under Conditional Use Provisions
18.24.080: Livestock
18.24.090: Kennel
18.24.010: PURPOSE:
This chapter permits nonconforming uses to continue until they are removed, but
does not encourage them to be perpetuated. It is further the intent of this
chapter that nonconforming uses shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or
extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited
elsewhere in the same district. (Ord. 241 §6-1, 1983)
18.24.020: INCOMPATIBILITY OF NONCONFORMING USES:
Nonconforming uses are hereby declared incompatible with permitted uses in the
districts in which such uses are located. A nonconforming use shall not be
extended or enlarged after enactment of this title, by attachment on a building
or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or
by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be generally prohibited
in the district in which such use is located. Provided, however, that to avoid
undue hardship, nothing in this title shall be deemed to require a change in
the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which actual
construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this title and upon which actual building construction has been
carried on diligently. (Ord. 241 §6-2, 1983)
18.24.030: SINGLE NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD:
In any district in which single household dwellings are permitted, a single
household dwelling and customary accessory structures may be erected on any
single lot of record if the lot is, at the effective date of this title, in
separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same
ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the
requirements for area or minimum lot width or both, that are generally
applicable in the district; provided, that the yard dimensions and requirements
other than those applying to area or minimum lot width, or both, of the lot
shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located.
(Ord. 241 §6-3, 1983)
18.24.040: NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD IN COMBINATION:
If two (2) or more lots or a combination of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the effective date of
this title, and if all or part of the lots with no buildings do not meet the
requirements established for minimum lot width and area, the lands involved
shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this title
and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which
diminishes compliance with minimum lot width and area requirements established
herein, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with a
minimum width or area below the requirements stated in this title. (Ord. 241
§6-4, 1983)
18.24.050: NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES OR OF STRUCTURES AND LAND IN
COMBINATION:
If a lawful use involving land, individual structures or if a structure and
land in combination, exist at the effective date of adoption or amendment of
this title that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this
title, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
subject to the following provisions:
   A.   No existing structure devoted to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged
or structurally altered, nor any new structure erected with the result of
expanding the use not permitted; but such alteration may be made for the
purpose of converting to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.
   B.   No nonconforming use shall be extended to occupy any additional land
area.
   C.   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and land, may, upon the issuance of a conditional use
permit, be changed to another nonconforming use; provided, that the land use
and development commission shall find that the proposed use is equally
appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming
use. In permitting such change, the land use and development commission may
require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with other
provisions of this title.
   D.   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter
be resumed.
   E.   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and land in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned for more than one year (except when
government action impedes access to the premises), the structure, or structure
and land in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with
the regulations of the district in which it is located.
   F.   A nonconforming use of land shall be made to conform to the provisions
of this title within a period of two (2) years after effective date of this
title. (Ord. 728, 2013)
18.24.060: REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE:
On any nonconforming structure, or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs or on repairs or
replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing; provided, that
the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased.
Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety upon order of
such official. (Ord. 241 §6-6, 1983)
18.24.070: USES UNDER CONDITIONAL USE PROVISIONS:
Any use which is permitted as a conditional use in a district under the terms
of this title shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such district, but
shall, without further action, be considered a conforming use. (Ord. 241 §6-7,
1983)
18.24.080: LIVESTOCK:
Wherever the keeping of livestock has been lawfully conducted under prior
ordinances, and constitutes a nonconforming use, such livestock may be bred,
replaced and sold or traded so long as the number and type of livestock allowed
under said prior ordinance comply with the provisions of sections
9.20.070 through
9.20.090, inclusive, of this code. (Ord. 241 §6-8, 1983)
18.24.090: KENNEL:
No "commercial kennel" or "hobby kennel", as defined herein, which constitutes
a nonconforming use under the terms and provisions of this chapter, shall be
operated or maintained in violation of the terms and provisions of this
chapter, or within any district in which the same is not permitted, after
December 31, 1983. (Ord. 241 §6-9, 1983)

(Ord. 528 § 1, 2000; Ord. 832, 2021; Ord. 845, 2022)
18.28.020: CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS (CUP) PROCEDURES:
   A.   Applicability. Conditional or special use permits(CUPs) are those which
are not allowed outright within a zone but nay be allowed only if certain
conditions of approval are satisfied. The purpose of this section is to
prescribe the procedure for the accommodation of uses with special site or
design requirements, operating characteristics, or potential adverse effects on
surroundings. This procedure shall apply to all proposals for which a CUP is
required by city code.
   B.   Design Review Committee Review to Occur Prior to Making Application:
Prior to making application for a CUP, where a design review approval is
required by Chapter 18.16 or elsewhere in City Code, the applicant shall first
obtain a design review clearance of the project such that the Committee may
review and relay technical details of the project as they relate to this or
other titles of City code. A design review approval does not constitute
approval of the use and LUDC may attach more stringent requirements upon a CUP
than the Design Review Committee.
   C.   General Requirements and Procedures:
      1.   Authority to Apply: Any person who owns or has a contractual
interest in real property governed by this title may apply for a CUP. A CUP is
issued to authorize development or use of the property for the use specified in
the permit and subject to any conditions imposed upon the use. The CSD may
require the submission of special studies related to the social, economic,
fiscal, and environmental effects and any aviation hazard as defined in Idaho
Code section 21-501(2) along with the application.
      2.   Deadline for Complete Applications is Twenty-Eight (28) Days before
Hearing: Complete applications containing the required information and, in the
format prescribed by the CSD and all fees as established by resolution of the
Council shall be submitted to the CSD at least twenty-eight (28) calendar days
before the desired hearing. In the event that an application is deemed
incomplete and additional information is required from the applicant, the CSD
may remove the item from the desired meeting’s agenda. If upon review the CSD
determines that an application is of such unusual complexity that more time is
needed to thoroughly review and analyze an application in order to make
findings and a recommendation to LUDC, the CSD may cause the application to be
heard no later than I regularly scheduled meeting after the originally
anticipated meeting.
      3.   Notification Requirements: Notices for the public hearing shall be
provided in accordance with Section
18.28.010 C.
      4.   Public Hearing: A public hearing shall be held by LUDC in accordance
with procedures adopted by Council resolution. At the public hearing, LUDC
shall receive pertinent evidence concerning the proposed use and the proposed
conditions under which it would be operated or maintained, particularly with
respect to the standards of approval in Section 18.28.020 C.5.
      5.   Standards for Approving a CUP: A CUP may only be approved if LUDC
makes affirmative findings of fact on each of the following standards:
         a.   The proposed use is conditionally permitted in the subject zoning
district and complies with all of the applicable provisions of city code unless
modified through the conditional use permit process.
         b.   The proposed use is generally not in conflict with the goals,
objectives, and policies of the adopted Comprehensive PIan.
         c.   The proposed use is compatible with other existing and permitted
uses in the general vicinity.
         d.   The proposed use is harmonious in scale, mass, coverage, density,
and intensity with all adjacent permitted land uses.
         e.   The proposed use would not place an undue burden on
transportation, police, fire and EMS protection, water/sewer, schools, and
other public facilities or agencies, in the vicinity.
         f.   The proposed use, if it complies with all conditions imposed,
will not adversely affect other properties or the environment in the vicinity
to a materially greater extent than would uses permitted outright by this Code.
      6.   Conditions of Approval: It is not the intent of this section to
restrict or specify the design proposed or to specify the exterior detail or
design, color, or materials of a project, except when such detail is of a
magnitude affecting the general appearance and compatibility of the development
with its surroundings. To make affirmative findings relating to the standards
established in section 18.28.020 C.5, LUDC may condition approval of the permit
on compliance, including but not limited to, the following:
         a.   Conformity to approved plans and specifications.
         b.   Provision of open spaces, pathways, buffer strips, walls, fences,
landscaping, and lighting.
         c.   Minimizing adverse impact on other development.
         d.   Controlling the sequence and timing of development.
         e.   Assuring that development is maintained properly.
         f.   Designating the provision of on-site or off-site public
facilities or services.
         g.   Requiring more restrictive standards than those generally
required by the Code; and
         h.   Requiring the mitigation of effects of the proposed development
upon service delivery to the property by any political subdivision, including
school districts.
      7.   Requiring Special Studies: Prior to making a decision or as a
condition of approval, the LUDC may require the submission of special studies
related to the social, economic, fiscal, and environmental effects and any
aviation hazard as defined in Idaho Code section 21-501(2).
      8.   Variance or Waiver to Development Standards Included in Permit:
Pursuant to Idaho Code section 67-6512(f), LUDC may approve, in accordance with
notice and approval criteria in Section
18.28.030, a change from required standards located in this Title. The
application must specify the changes being requested and address the approval
criteria via narrative. When an application contains both requests, only the
fee for a conditional use permit shall apply.
      9.   Effective Date: The decision of LUDC shall be effective ten (10)
calendar days from the date that the findings of fact and conclusions of law is
signed and approved by the Chair.
      10.   Application Resubmittal: No application for a conditional use
permit that has been denied by LUDC or Council shall be resubmitted in either
the same or substantially same form less than one (1) year from the date of the
final action, unless specifically authorized by the granting body during the
final action decision.
      11.   Regulatory Taking: Denial of a CUP or approval of the same with
conditions unacceptable to the landowner may be subject to a regulatory taking
analysis provided for by Idaho Code section 67-8003, consistent with
requirements established thereby.
   D.   Modifications to Approved CUPS: Modifications or amendments to approved
CUPs may be approved by LUDC only after following the application submission,
fee payment, public notice, and public hearing requirements and procedures
established by Chapter. If upon review the change is deemed technically
substantive enough by the CSD such that it could impact the delivery of
services or infrastructure by the City, the CSD may require that the
modifications be reviewed and approved by the Design Review Committee prior to
being scheduled with LUDC. Upon review by LUDC, requirements and standards of
sections 18.28.020 C.5. - 11. shall be considered, and affirmative findings be
made for each standard.
   E.   Regulatory Takings Analysis: Denial of a CUP or modification request or
approval of the same with conditions unacceptable to the landowner or applicant
may be subject to a regulatory takings analysis provided for by Idaho Code
section 67-8003, consistent with the requirements established thereby.
   F.   Term of Approval: Unless a longer time shall be specifically
established as a condition or allowance of approval, a conditional use permit
shall lapse and become automatically void one (1) calendar year following the
date on which such permit became effective, unless prior to expiration, the use
has commenced, and all conditions of the permit are satisfied.
   G.   Extension: A CUP subject to lapse may be renewed by the CSD one (1)
time for up to additional two (2) years provided that prior to the expiration
date, a written petition is filed at least thirty (30) days prior to lapse with
the CSD and that the same finds that none of the following circumstances exist;
in the event that the CSD finds that any of the following exist, the extension
request shall be denied and the applicant may appeal through the usual appeals
process or may apply for a new conditional use permit:
      1.   There have been significant amendments to the Comprehensive Plan or
Land Use ordinance which will affect the CUP authorization.
      2.   There have been significant land use changes in the vicinity which
would adversely impact the project, or which would be adversely impacted by the
project.
      3.   There are hazardous situations which have developed or have been
discovered in the area.
   H.   Approval is Non-Transferrable and Runs with the Land: A CUP is non-
transferable from one (1) parcel of land to another and shall run with the land
and continue to be valid upon a change of ownership of the site or structure,
providing however, that the new owner complies with the terms of the permit.
   I.   Revocation of Permits: CUPs may be revoked by the CSD at any time if it
is determined that any condition of the CUP or any other city code is being
violated. Prior to revocation, the applicant shall be afforded thirty (30) days
after the date of notification of noncompliance/intent to revoke to become
compliant. Additionally, prior to revocation, the applicant shall be afforded
an opportunity for a hearing before LUDC; said hearing must be requested within
ten (10) calendar days of the date of notification of noncompliance/intent to
revoke the conditional use permit. Failure to come into compliance within
thirty (30) days of the notification of noncompliance and failure to request
such a hearing will result in immediate revocation of the approved CUP and may
constitute a violation of this title. (Ord. 755, 2016; Ord. 832, 2021; Ord.
845, 2022)
18.28.030: VARIANCES:
   A.   Applicability: A variance shall not be considered a right or special
privilege but may be granted upon a determination by LUDC that the approval
criteria are satisfied. A variance pursuant to this Chapter shall not apply to
variances as described in
Chapter 15.54 Flood Damage Prevention, nor shall it apply to parking
requirements, or other deviations allowed in other sections of code. For
purposes of this chapter, a variance is defined as the modification of the bulk
and placement requirements of the Land Use Ordinance as to one (1) or more of
the following items only:
      1.   Minimum lot area (square feet).
      2.   Minimum lot width and depth.
      3.   Minimum lot frontage.
      4.   Minimum front yard setback.
      5.   Minimum rear yard setback.
      6.   Minimum side yard setback.
      7.   Maximum building or structure height.
      8.   Any other land use ordinance provision affecting the size or shape
of a structure or building or the placement of a structure or building upon a
lot, or the size of lots.
   B.   General Requirements and Procedures:
      1.   Authority to Apply: Any person who owns or has a contractual
interest in real property governed by this title may apply for a variance.
      2.   Deadline for Complete Applications is Twenty-Eight (28) Days before
Hearing: Complete applications containing the required information and, in the
format prescribed by the CSD and all fees as established by resolution of the
Council shall be submitted to the CSD at least twenty-eight (28) calendar days
before the desired hearing. If an application is deemed incomplete and
additional information is required from the applicant, the CSD may remove the
item from the desired meeting’s agenda. If upon review the CSD determines that
an application is of such unusual complexity that more time is needed to
thoroughly review and analyze an application to make findings and a
recommendation to LUDC, the CSD may cause the application to be heard no later
than one (1) regularly scheduled meeting after the originally anticipated
meeting.
      3.   Notification Requirements: Notices for the public hearing shall be
provided in accordance with section
18.28.010 C.
      4.   Public Hearing: A public bearing shall be held by LUDC in accordance
with procedures adopted by Council resolution. At the public hearing, LUDC
shall receive pertinent evidence concerning the proposal, particularly with
respect to the standards of approval in Section 18.28.030 B.5.
      5.   Standards for Approving a Variance; written final decision required:
A variance may be only approved if LUDC makes affirmative written findings of
fact on each of the following standards:
         a.   The applicant has taken all reasonable steps to comply with the
strict terms of the ordinance from which a variance is requested.
         b.   Granting of the variance is not a right or special privilege.
         c.   Granting of the variance is due to an undue hardship as related
to the characteristics of the land, and the applicant has shown that absent a
variance, they would be deprived of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties
in the identical zoning district under the terms of the title.
         d.   Granting of the variance is the result of an undue hardship
caused by the characteristics of the site and the creation of the hardship did
not result from actions of the applicant, or the current, or a prior landowner,
or any of their agents. In no event shall any variance be granted merely
because compliance would diminish the financial return from use of the land in
question or because it would reduce the market value of lands or because
compliance with code would be financially costly.
         e.   Granting of the variance does not demonstrably adversely affect
adjacent/nearby property.
         f.   Granting of the variance is not detrimental to the public health,
safety, and welfare.
      6.   Precedents: The granting of a prior variance or referencing property
developed under prior regulations is not admissible evidence for the granting
of a new variance. Each request for a variance shall be judged on its own facts
and circumstances.
      7.   Effective Date: The decision of LUDC shall be effective ten (10)
calendar days from the date that the findings of fact and conclusions of law is
approved by the Chair.
      8.   Application Resubmittal: No application for a variance that has been
denied by LUDC shall be resubmitted in either the same or substantially same
form less than one (1) year from the date of the final action, unless
specifically authorized by LUDC, or the Council upon hearing an appeal.
      9.   Regulatory Takings Analysis: Denial of a variance or approval of the
same with conditions not acceptable to the landowner may be subject to a
regulatory takings analysis provided for by Idaho Code section 67-8003,
consistent with the requirements established thereby.
      10.   Variance Expiration: Authorization for an approved variance shall
be valid for a period of one (1) year from the date of approval. The applicant
must initiate implementation of the approved variance through construction
within one (1) year from the date of approval. The approval shall become null
and void in the event that implementation of the variance and all conditions
are not initiated within said one (1) year period. A variance permit that has
expired prior to implementation shall not be reestablished without a new
variance being approved, unless the permit is otherwise extended under the
terms of this chapter.
      11.   Time Extension. An applicant who has been granted a variance may
request a time extension that does not exceed an additional six (6) month
period. A request for a time extension must be submitted in writing to the CSD
at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the approved variance
permit. The CSD may grant the request provided the applicant demonstrates good
cause for the extension of the approved permit. Only one extension may be
granted. A denial of a time extension by the Director may be appealed to LUDC
in accordance with section
18.28.070.
      12.   Administrative Variance: The CSD may approve the modification of a
setback, building height, lot coverage, or building footprint size requirements
of this Title by up to ten percent (10%), in writing, subject to the following
requirements:
         a.   The applicant must provide written consent from all adjoining
property owners of record, signified by the owner’s signature on a form
provided by the PWD; for purposes of this chapter, if one property owner of a
property listed with multiple property owners provides written consent, this
requirement shall be deemed satisfied for that property.
            (1)   The consent form shall clearly describe the nature of the
proposed variance request and state that the property owner, by signing the
form, is consenting to the variance request.
               (a)   If any of the adjoining owners fail to sign the form, then
the administrative variance cannot be processed by the CSD.
               (b)   If the applicant fails to obtain all of the required
signatures, they may at their own discretion, submit a variance application
pursuant to this section.
         b.   The application meets the standards for approving a variance set
forth in section 18.28.030 B.5. (Ord. 246 § 2, 1983: Ord. 241 § 7-3, 1983: Ord.
832, 2021: Ord. 845 § 13, 2022)
18.28.040: COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AMENDMENT:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to establish procedures for
amendments to the text and map components of the adopted Comprehensive Plan
(Plan) of the City of Chubbuck.
   B.   Applicability: The provisions of this section shall apply to any Plan
amendment application.

discuss their proposal with staff to identify any readily apparent issues with
the proposal and to discuss rationale for the proposal.
      2.   Deadline for Complete Applications is Twenty-Eight (28) Days before
Hearing: Complete applications containing the required information and in the
format prescribed by the CSD and all fees as established by resolution of the
Council shall be submitted to the CSD at least twenty-eight (28) calendar days
before the desired hearing. If an application is deemed incomplete and
additional information is required from the applicant, the CSD may remove the
item from the desired meeting’s agenda. If upon review the CSD determines that
an application is of such unusual complexity that more time is needed to
thoroughly review and analyze an application to make findings and a
recommendation to LUDC, the CSD may cause the application to be heard no later
than one (1) regularly scheduled meeting after the originally anticipated
meeting.
      3.   Amendments Require At Least One (1) Public Hearing: Prior to
recommending the adoption, amendment, or repeal of the Plan to the Council,
LUDC shall conduct at least one (1) public hearing in accordance with the
resolution of the City Council and with notice provided in accordance with
section
18.28.010 C. LUDC shall review the criteria found in 18.28.040 D. and issue
provide a recommendation to the Council as whether the proposal satisfies or
does not satisfy each criteria.
   D.   Recommendation to Council and Required Findings: Upon recommendation
from LUDC, the Council shall review the recommendation and the record at a
public meeting; at their discretion, the Council may call for a public hearing
to be held and the applicant shall be responsible to all costs of providing
notice. The Council may approve a Plan amendment after considering following
criteria; affirmative findings on each of the following are not required to
approve an amendment:
      1.   The proposed change is required for the public convenience or
necessity, or the general welfare of the community, and is in the community’s
best interest.
      2.   The proposed change is needed to recognize substantial changes in

objectives, and policies within the comprehensive plan, including its maps; and
      4.   The proposed change will not place undue burden on transportation or
other public facilities in the planning area and does not adversely impact the
delivery of services by any political subdivision.
   E.   Material Change from LUDC Recommendation Requires Public Hearing: If
the Council determines it best to make a material change from the
recommendation of LUDC, further notice and public hearing shall be provided in
accordance with section
18.28.010 C. before the Council adopts, amends, or repeals the Plan.
   F.   Approval by Resolution: A Plan amendment shall become effective when
enacted by resolution by the Council. (Ord. 832, 2021: Ord. 845 § 13, 2022)
18.28.050: TITLE TEXT AND MAP AMENDMENTS AND INITIAL ZONING DISTRICT

the recommendation of the Commission and shall render a decision. Since a
public hearing was held on the application by the Commission, a public hearing
with Council shall not be required however, affected persons may petition the
Council in writing to hold a public hearing. The decision as to whether or not
to hold a hearing shall be at the discretion of the Mayor after discussing the
petition with the city’s legal counsel, the Council President, and the CSD. In
those instances where a hearing is held, notice shall be given pursuant to
requirements of Idaho Code section 67-6511 and the applicant shall be
responsible for the costs associated with additional notices. As a requirement
for consideration and action, any written petition by an affected person for a
hearing shall be submitted to the CSD not less than seven (7) calendar days
prior to the Council meeting in which the application will be reviewed in order
for the petition to be considered. Any petition not submitted in a timely
manner shall be barred from consideration. Petitions shall include the names
and addresses of the petitioners and a narrative describing the petitioner’s
concerns with the application as they specifically pertain to the review
criteria as found in subsection 8 of this section and describing how the
proposal affects their interests.
      8.   Standards for Approving a Title Text or Map Amendment: A title
amendment may be only recommended for approval by LUDC, and approved by the
Council, if affirmative written findings of fact are made on each of the
following standards; concurring findings between the two bodies are not
necessary in order for the Council to approve, approve with conditions, or deny
an application:
         a.   Map Amendment:
            (1)   The proposed map amendment would be in the community’s best
interest;
            (2)   The list of uses permitted by the land use ordinance would
blend with surrounding land uses and the uses permitted in the proposed zoning
district would be harmonious in terms of their scale, mass, coverage, density,
and intensity with adjacent land uses.
            (3)   The subject site is suitable for the type and intensity of
land uses permitted under the proposed zoning district.
            (4)   The subject site would be adequately served by transportation
routes, police, fire and EMS protection, water/sewer, schools, and other public
facilities and services, or agencies, to serve the public health, safety, and
general welfare under the proposed zoning district; and
            (5)   The proposed map amendment is generally not in conflict with
the goals, objectives, and policies of the adopted Comprehensive Plan. LUDC and
Council shall have discretion in interpreting exact boundary locations of the
future land use map designations when considering map amendment requests.
         b.   Text Amendment:
            (1)   The proposed text amendment would be in the community’s best
interest.
            (2)   The proposed text amendment is consistent with the existing
provisions of the zoning ordinance; and
            (3)   The proposed text amendment is generally not in conflict with
the goals, objectives, and policies of the adopted Plan and furthers them more
than the adopted zoning text.
   C.   Approval by Ordinance: Zoning ordinance amendments, text or map, shall
become effective when the Council adopts an ordinance amending the Title and
upon summary publication.
   D.   Rezoning of Land within Four Years: If the Council adopts a zoning
district change pursuant to a request by a property owner, the Council shall
not subsequently reverse its action or otherwise change the zoning
classification of said property without the consent in writing of the current
property owner for a period of four (4) years from the date of adoption of said
change, per Idaho Code section 67-6511(d).
   E.   Regulatory Takings Analysis: An amendment of the zoning ordinance
applicable to an owner’s lands or approval of conditional rezoning or denial of
a request for rezoning may be subject to a regulatory taking analysis provided
for by Idaho Code section 67-8003, consistent with the requirements established
thereby.
   F.   Zoning Development Agreements (ZDA):
      1.   Purpose: A zoning development agreement (ZDA) is a discretionary
tool to be used by LUDC and the Council pursuant to Idaho Code section 67-
6511A. ZDAs allow a change in a zoning for a specific project, with a specific
use, to be developed in an area which may not be appropriate for all uses
permitted outright or conditionally within the proposed zone. Approval of a
ZDA, pursuant to this section, would permit the proposed use, with conditions,
within the proposed zone.
      2.   ZDA Designation: Lands approved for a change in zoning with a ZDA
shall be designated by a “ZDA” (Zoning Development Agreement) on the map
following the official zoning designation (e.g., R-1(ZDA), R-2(ZDA), C-1(ZDA),
PUD(ZDA), etc.). Designation of property as (ZDA) shall not constitute “spot
zoning” nor shall be it presumptive proof that the zoning of other property
adjacent to or in the vicinity of the ZDA property should be zoned the same.
      3.   When Permitted or Required: A ZDA may be permitted or required at
the discretion of LUDC or Council when considering a request for a rezone. An
agreement, when permitted or required, shall be initiated through one of the
following methods:
         a.   On request by the landowner or duly authorized representative.
         b.   On recommendation of the CSD; and
         c.   As recommended by LUDC and/or required by Council.
            (1)   LUDC or Council may require that a ZDA be executed prior to
allowing a particular project to proceed. A ZDA may be formulated when approval
of the rezone would permit uses within that zone which may not be appropriate
to the area, but the subject project presented may have value to the community
which could otherwise be allowed using an agreement.
      4.   Creation and Form: If a ZDA is deemed necessary by LUDC or Council,
the developer or owner shall prepare and execute an agreement with the City
that shall be reviewed and approved for form by the City Attorney prior to
final Council action. The agreement shall contain the provisions set out below,
and once executed by the developer/owner, shall be presented to Council for its
approval, and then recorded with the County Clerk with a copy of the instrument
provided to the City. Minimum provisions in ZDA’s shall be:
         a.   Legal description of the subject property;
         b.   An affidavit by the owner of the property agreeing to the
submission of the use and property for an agreement;
         c.   A concept plan for the property including, but not limited to
preliminary site plans, elevation plans, density, and other pertinent exhibits;
         d.   Construction schedule, including projected occupancy date;
         e.   Provisions for any reservation or dedication of land;
         f.   The duration of the agreement; and
         g.   A provision that the owner acknowledges and agrees that failure
to comply with the terms of the agreement shall result in a rezoning of the
real property to the zoning district existing immediately prior to the
execution of the agreement or, in the case of the preexisting zone being an
initial zone at annexation, a zone deemed appropriate by the Commission and
Council.
         h.   A provision specifying that the agreement and all conditions,
terms, duties, and obligations included in said agreement shall be an
encumbrance on the real property and shall run with the land.
         i.   Any other matter required by the Council. (Ord. 832, 2021: Ord.
845 § 13, 2022)
18.28.060: ANNEXATIONS:
   A.   Applicability: This section implements the expressed policy of the
State of Idaho that cities of the state should be able to annex lands which are
reasonably necessary to assure the orderly development of Idaho's cities to
allow efficient and economically viable provision of tax-supported and fee-
supported municipal services, to enable the orderly development of private
lands which benefit from the cost-effective availability of municipal services
in urbanizing areas, and to equitably allocate the costs of public services in
management of development on the urban fringe. The corporate boundary of the
city may be expanded whenever the council deems it to be for public convenience
or necessity or for the general welfare. This section shall apply to all lands
which can annex by state law in accordance with its procedures under Idaho Code
50-222.
   B.   Implied Consent: For purposes of this section, prior consent to annex
shall be deemed given when a property has been connected to a city water or
wastewater collection system if the connection was requested in writing by the
owner or the owner's authorized agent prior to July 1, 2024, or if the
connection was completed prior to July 1, 2008.
   C.   Approval By Ordinance: Annexations shall become effective when the
council adopts an ordinance and upon summary publication.
   D.   Annexation Or Written Consent To Annex Required Before Providing City
Facilities And Services: Prior to providing municipal facilities or services,
the city will require annexation of those eligible properties and if not
eligible, written annexation consents to be recorded with the county recorder's
office and evidence of the instrument provided to the city.
   E.   Application: A request for the annexation of property into the city may
be initiated as outlined in Idaho Code Title 50, Chapter 2. In the case of non-
city initiated annexations, an annexation application shall be filed and
include all information required by the CSD and fees as required by resolution
adopted by the council, along with any other information required by the same
chapter of Idaho Code. All annexation applications shall be accompanied by a
separate application for an initial zoning designation pursuant to the
requirements of Section 18.28.050; the council shall not review an annexation
application until it has received an initial zoning designation recommendation
from the commission.
   F.   Annexation Classifications, Notice, And Procedure:
      1.   Annexation With Consent: In the case of prospective annexations
where all landowners of the subject property have requested annexation, or have
given consent or where implied consent has been given, the annexation is deemed
one of consent and no notice, hearing, or annexation plan are required pursuant
to Idaho Code 50-222(5)(a) provided, however, that an initial zoning
designation, and comprehensive plan designation if the property does not have
one, shall follow notice and hearing procedures of this title and be approved
with the annexation ordinance, or immediately following it.
      2.   Enclave Annexations: In the event that an annexation is proposed for
residential enclaved lands surrounded entirely by the city or lands which
cannot be legally or physically annexed, and which have thirty (30) or fewer
privately owned parcels, no notice, hearing, or annexation plan are required
pursuant to Idaho Code 50-222(5)(b) provided, however, that an initial zoning
designation, and comprehensive plan designation if the property does not have
one, shall follow notice and hearing procedures of this title and be approved
with the annexation ordinance or immediately following it.
      3.   Other Annexations: Annexations not meeting the standards of
subsections 1 and 2 above shall follow the annexation procedures established in
Idaho Code 50-222 including providing an annexation plan, written notice, and
public hearings with both the land use and development commission and the city
council.
   G.   Standards For Approving Annexations:
      1.   Standards For Approving An Annexation: Annexation may be approved by
the city council if affirmative written findings of fact are made on each of
the following standards:
         a.   The land is contiguous or adjacent to the city boundary.
         b.   All portions of highways, streets, or roadways lying wholly or
partially within an area to be annexed shall be included within the area
requested for annexation unless expressly agreed between the city and the
county. If a property has an adjacent railroad, the annexation boundary shall
include the railroad right-of-way as directed by the community services
director.
         c.   The annexation meets the requirements under Idaho Code.
         d.   Annexation of the land is in the best interest of the city.
Suggested considerations to evaluate for this criteria include:
            (1)   Revenue generated by property taxes will exceed long-term
costs associated with maintenance and provision of services and facilities.
            (2)   The advantages both to the city and to the area outweigh the
disadvantages.
            (3)   If previously developed, the area has the opportunity to be
redeveloped or to develop at higher intensity.
            (4)   If expenses required to bring the properties to city
standards exceed anticipated property tax income, the residents and/or council
agree to form a local improvement district.
            (5)   Annexation is equitable and fair to existing residents; and
            (6)   Annexation would address a public health concern.
         e.   The land can be served currently, or within a reasonable time, by
essential urban services. If existing structures being annexed are not
connected to city culinary water or sanitary sewer, and are connected to
private wells and/or septic systems, each property owner will connect to city
utilities, at their own cost, when city utilities are within three hundred feet
(300') of the nearest property line upon which such building or structure is
situated. The connection must be completed within six (6) months of annexation
or extension of the city utilities, to within three hundred feet (300') of the
nearest property line upon which such building or structure is situated,
whichever occurs later. The city may, depending on the equivalent dwelling
units utility consumption on the property, require connections sooner or at a
longer distance than the aforementioned three hundred feet (300') by the
annexation ordinance for the property.
         f.   A zoning district will be assigned via ordinance at the same
time, or immediately following, the annexation approval.
         g.   The annexation does not annex any lands prohibited by Idaho Code
50-222.

18.32.050: CONDITIONAL OCCUPANCY PERMIT:
   A.   Required: The city council is hereby authorized to issue conditional
occupancy permits, under the terms and conditions of this section, whereby
buildings or parts of buildings classed as a group B-2 occupancy under the
international building code shall, for a period not to exceed twenty four (24)
hours, be regarded as an A-1, A-2, or A-3 occupancy. Upon the issuance of a

international building code or international fire code shall have the meanings
assigned to them by said codes.
   C.   Procedure For Issuance Of Conditional Occupancy Permit: The owner or

occupancy permit shall be granted, until and unless the city council determines
that, based upon: 1) the recommendation of the building official, 2) the
requirements of this section, and 3) such additional requirements as may be
imposed by the city council, the proposed change in occupancy classification
will not create a hazard to the public. Upon such determination, the city
council shall direct the city building official to issue the conditional
occupancy permit upon the building official's determination that the applicant
has complied with all conditions imposed by this section and such other
conditions as the building official may recommend and the city council may
impose as a condition to the issuance of the conditional occupancy permit.
   D.   Determination Of Occupancy Load: Following the issuance of the
conditional occupancy permit, the city building official shall make a
determination as to the maximum occupancy load permitted for the applicant's
structure, which determination shall be made in accordance with the provisions
of this section. The occupancy load for the applicant's structure shall be
limited to the lesser of one occupant per ten (10) square feet of open space or
one hundred (100) occupants per linear foot of exit doors. For purposes of
determining the permitted occupancy load, areas more than one hundred twenty
five feet (125') from a main exit shall not be included in determining the
permitted occupancy load.
   E.   Minimum Facility Requirements: In addition to such other and additional
requirements which the city building official may recommend or the city council
may impose, the following minimum facility requirements shall be satisfied
prior to the issuance of a conditional occupancy permit.
      1.   All areas within the structure which are accessible to the public

structure which is open to the public and: a) shall be placed no more than one
hundred feet (100') apart; b) shall be placed at each exit and entrance; and c)

conditional occupancy permit is in effect and the occupancy of the premises
exceeds that which would have been allowed but for the provisions of this
section, the city shall, subject to reimbursement by the owner as hereinafter
set forth, provide police and fire protection personnel, as follows:

policemen.
      3.   The city personnel assigned to the premises pursuant to this section
shall be and hereby are authorized to issue such other directives or orders,
during the time that the permit is in effect, as may be reasonably necessary to

create a hazard to the public.
      4.   Additional personnel may be required by the fire chief and chief of
police by so notifying the owner of the premises in advance of the effective
date of the conditional occupancy permit.
      5.   The wages of all policemen and firemen assigned to the premises
shall be paid by the city at the regular hourly or overtime rates then
applicable. The owner shall reimburse the city for the cost of such wages,
including any reasonable additional charges which the city may impose to cover
administrative expense. The amount of such reimbursement shall be stated on the
conditional occupancy permit and shall be paid to the city twenty four (24)
hours in advance of the effective date of the conditional occupancy permit.
      6.   In the event the number of available city police or fire personnel
are not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of this section, the city
council may revoke or refuse to issue the requested conditional occupancy
permit.
   H.   Enforcement:
      1.   In the event an owner fails to comply with: a) the terms of this
section; b) the terms of the conditional occupancy permit, following the
issuance thereof; or c) the directives or orders issued by the city personnel

of police, the fire chief or their designee shall be and is authorized to order
and direct that the premises be vacated to such an extent as may be necessary
to comply with the occupancy loads permitted by the international building code
and international fire code.

tobacco products or other materials on the premises after having been advised
that such conduct is prohibited while the conditional occupancy permit is in
effect. (Ord. 717, 2012)

   C.   Intent And Purpose: The intent and purpose of this zoning district is
to further the specific intent of the Creative Community District as set forth
in section 18.21.010 of this title and to specifically address the following
goals:
      1.   Place, A Vision, And An Opportunity: A goal of the community builder
and the City is that Harvest Springs captures the spirit of community by
incorporating modern new layout and design techniques. Through comprehensive
site planning, building form and detailing, and landscaping, Harvest Springs
draws from the architectural elements of old world design and reinterprets them
in a sophisticated modern way utilizing sound design principles. This design
direction executed in a vibrant, mixed-use environment establishes Harvest
Springs as a truly memorable community. Lending to this vibrancy are the public
spaces in the Harvest Springs community plan and their ability to accommodate a
wide range of activities. These may include but are not limited to events and
activities such as water events at the Harvest Springs Lake, dog park, "tot"
area with splash pad, interactive street art, and a community garden. Christmas
tree lightings and other seasonal or holiday events, smaller live "park"
setting performances, poetry readings, and retail or restaurant events such as
"A Taste of Harvest Springs" in the Town Center area; and retail and dining
activities are encouraged to flow out onto the sidewalks in the Town Center on
a daily basis. Live entertainment is allowed and encouraged in restaurants. The
combination of the character of the architecture and public spaces in Harvest
Springs, along with the activities and events that bring people to those
spaces, creates the strong sense of place that will enrich the lives of all
residents of Chubbuck.
      2.   Fulfill The City's Creative Community Public Benefit Objectives: A
goal of the developer ("community builder") and the City is that construction
of the Harvest Springs MDP, consistent with the MDP approval and this chapter,
will fulfill the public benefit objectives outlined in
 chapter 18.21 of this title.
      3.   Create Employment Opportunities: A goal of the community builder and
City is to provide commercial, retail, office, and light industrial
opportunities that are well-integrated into the Harvest Springs Zoning
District, that promote the creation of jobs and commerce, that are flexible to
market conditions and that provide the opportunity for the newly created
households and residents to have a place to work and shop. The community
builder will also provide mixed-use opportunities to create meaningful village
centers that support local business activity and employment opportunities.
      4.   Create A Mix Of Land Uses: A goal of the community builder and City
is to develop a mix of uses within the Harvest Springs Zoning District that
complements the range of existing and planned uses within the City; respects
the character of adjacent neighborhoods; and utilizes existing availability and
planned capacity of urban services, access opportunities, and infrastructure
systems located in proximity to the district.
      5.   Protect The Environment: A goal of the community builder and City is
to create a creative community that seeks to protect the naturally constrained
areas of the zoning district and surrounding area, including stream beds,
hillsides, and surface and groundwater resources, through master planning
concepts and, to the extent feasible, through low impact development
technologies.
      6.   Create A Fiscally-Sound, Economically-Viable Community: A goal of
the community builder and City is to create an economically- viable creative
community that provides office, retail, light industrial, and other commercial
uses; preserves open spaces and integrates open space corridors; provides
recreational opportunities, necessary public facilities, and a wide range of
residential opportunities. The community builder and City seek to ensure that
these elements of the Harvest Springs Zoning District are fiscally sound and
sufficient so they can aid in minimizing necessary up-front infrastructure cost
and upgrades as well as generate an adequate financial return to justify the
risk and cost of local and regional improvements to transportation, water,
sewer, and stormwater facilities. Opportunities to create positive fiscal
performance that are mutually beneficial to the City and community builder are
to be pursued.
      7.   Provide A Range Of House Types And Lifestyles Opportunities: A goal
of the community builder and City is to provide within the Harvest Springs
Zoning District a range of residential and lifestyle opportunities at urban
densities within the City that adequately responds to dynamic market factors
over time, is accessible to all economic segments of the population, and
contributes to the City targets for accommodating growth under the
comprehensive plan.
      8.   Built-In Flexibility: A goal of the community builder and City is to
create a community with the flexibility to quickly respond and adapt to new
and/or innovative technology, construction methods and materials, land uses,
housing types and businesses. Recognizing that the future may include advances
in these areas that do not currently exist and that may prove to be fiscally or
environmentally beneficial to the community builder and City, the City shall
allow flexibility in the use of new and/or innovative technologies,
construction methods and materials, land uses, housing types and businesses
that meet or exceed the design standards and guidelines throughout the Harvest
Springs MDP.
      9.   Sustainability: A goal of the community builder is to integrate low
impact development techniques within the Harvest Springs Zoning District in
order to create a community that is more livable, walkable, and sustainable for
current and future residents. Potential techniques include, but are not limited
to, low impact development, recycling, and water conservation.
      10.   Make Development Decisions Predictable, Fair And Cost- Effective: A
goal of the City is to provide certainty, predictability and a stream-lined
process for the review and approval of phases and neighborhoods that are
consistent with and implement this district.
   D.   Relationship To Other Land Use And Development Controls And Codes;
Chapter Supersedes Portions Of Code As Described:
      1.   With the establishment of this zoning district, modifications from
this Code are allowed within the Harvest Springs Zoning Districts as
applicable.
      2.   Where there appears to be a conflict between these standards and any
other sections of this Code, the requirements set forth in this zoning district

18.34.030: MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM BUILD-OUT DENSITY AND OCCUPIED FLOOR AREA; OPEN
SPACE REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Uses: The Harvest Springs Zoning District will provide a mixture of
uses including: residential, commercial, office, light industrial, retail,
educational, civic, and recreational uses such as trails, parks, and open
space.
   B.   Maximum And Minimum Number Of Residential Units: A maximum of one
thousand three hundred seventy five (1,375) residential units are permitted

family units (single-family dwelling, single-family attached including
townhomes or duplexes, triplex, or quadplex) and seven hundred fifty (750)
multifamily units (structures containing greater than 5 residential units). To
meet the overall net residential density requirement of subsection

platted lots and to track current densities and may require that future
developments contain greater densities than proposed by the community builder.
Accessory dwelling units do not count toward the maximum number of dwelling
units.
   C.   Maximum Square Feet Of Occupied Floor Area For Non-Residential Uses:
There is no restriction on maximum square feet occupied floor area for non-

serve the area without negatively impacting the ability to serve other planned
or existing areas in or near the City.
   D.   Open Space Minimum Area Requirement: At least forty nine (49) acres of
open space are required within the district. Development of the open space
areas shall be at least proportional to the development area (e.g., if a plat
contains 15 percent of the land area in the district, there shall be built or
existing, at least 15 percent of the proposed open space in the district);
however, recognizing that market or development patterns may cause a need to
deviate from this requirement, a deviation may be granted through the design
book approval process. For purposes of this zoning district, open space
amenities as approved through the MDP are on file in the City. (Ord. 796, 2019:
Ord. 845 § 14, 2022)
18.34.040: SCHEDULE OF GENERAL CONTROLS; LAND USE CHART:
   A.   General Controls: General controls for the zoning district are set
forth in the chart below. Specific uses are permitted where indicated in the
chart by the letter “P”. Where the letter “C” appears, it denotes a use allowed
in the district in question only upon issuance of a conditional use permit as
herein provided. An “X” indicates that the use is neither allowed nor
conditionally permitted. An “R” indicates a restriction on that use. Because no
list can be all encompassing, decisions on uses will be rendered by the
Community Services Director with appeal to the Land Use and Development
Commission as a business item available to the applicant. In making a
determination of use, the Community Services Director shall consider similar
uses listed in the chart below, the character of the surrounding neighborhood,
and characteristics of the proposed use.
   B.   More Than Five Dwellings: All non-residential uses/projects and
residential uses/projects with structures containing more than five (5)
dwellings shall be subject to the City's Design Review Committee review and
approval.
   C.   Land Use Designation Areas Defined: Within the Harvest Springs Zoning
District are land use designation areas with specific uses permitted,
conditionally permitted, or prohibited by this section. Whereas land uses may
differ between the district and the private covenants, all applications for new
or modified uses within the zoning district must be submitted with a
recommendation from the reviewing body of homeowners' association. These land
use designation areas are part of this chapter and prior to design book and
platting, are to be interpreted as not being hard, definite boundaries but are
rather, flexible to accommodate needs related to topography and grade, lot
layout and plat design, or other elements that may be identified during the
platting process. Land use designation areas are as follows:
      1.   Residential (R): This land use area is designed for comparatively
low to medium density development that emphasizes residential (single and
multi-family) use, but also may include appropriately scaled office,
commercial, public/semipublic and recreation/open space uses. Home occupations
may be allowed as defined.
      2.   Village (V): This land use area is designed for medium to high
density mixed use development that includes residential (single- and multi-
family), office, commercial, public/semipublic, recreation open space uses, and
certain compatible light industrial uses without a predetermined emphasis on
any single use.
      3.   Town (T): This land use area is designed for office, commercial and
recreational uses, but also includes residential (single- and multi-family),
public/semipublic, open space, and certain compatible light industrial uses.
      4.   Business and research park (BRP): This land use area is designed to
accommodate (but not require) a mixture of all uses: residential (single- and
multi-family), office, commercial, light industrial, recreational and public/
semipublic uses. The principal land use in this category should be office,
commercial and light industrial.

Notes:
   1.   Front yard is the area of the structure that faces either on a public
street or green court. Front yard is measured from the back of sidewalk,
courtyard path, or walkway; distance is measured from the closest edge of
building materials (e.g., if dwelling has front porch, the front porch shall be
used to determine distance; if dwelling does not have front porch, the closest
edge of the structure facing the front shall be used). Front yard maximum
setback may be increased where necessary due to topography.
   2.   Setbacks for street-loaded garages are measured from the front of the
dwelling as defined in note 1 of this chart.
   3.   Setbacks for alley-loaded garages are measured from the edge of the
alley right-of- way (private or public).
   4.   Note that side yard setback does not apply to the common wall on
townhome, duplex, other similar attached dwellings or alternative lot
configurations as provided in this section.
   5.   Use easements may be utilized for provision of private yards.
   6.   Nonresidential uses and/or structures have no minimum side or rear yard
setback requirements; there may be no minimum front yard setback provided that
it can be successfully demonstrated that pedestrian or vehicular travel is not
negatively impacted.
   7.   Allowed encroachments:
      a.   Uncovered decks, patios, walkways, and other minor structural
elements less than 30 inches in height; and fences 7 feet in height or less;
are exempt from setback requirements.
      b.   Retaining walls, rockeries and heat pumps and other similar
mechanical/landscape features are allowed within setbacks.
      c.   Balconies above the first floor may intrude into setbacks up to 2
feet subject to applicable Construction Codes.
      d.   Chimneys and fireplaces, accent walls or pilasters, bay windows,
eaves and other similar minor structural or architectural elements may encroach
up to 2 feet into setbacks subject to applicable Construction Codes.
      2.   Setbacks: Setbacks are measured from the outside wall of the
foundation of a structure to the property lines in a perpendicular fashion
unless otherwise stated herein.
      3.   Irregular Lots: Setbacks for irregular lots as defined shall be as
follows:
         a.   Front: Front setbacks shall be measured from the property line
that abuts the street from which the lot is addressed or takes primary access.
         b.   Rear: In the case of an irregularly shaped lot, a ten foot (10')
line which is within the lot and parallel to and most distant from the front
lot line shall be considered the rear lot line. For an alley loaded lot, the
setback is measured from the lot line closest from the alley.
         c.   Side: All lot lines, which are not front or rear lot lines, shall
be considered side lot lines.
         d.   Pie-Shaped Lots: Setbacks on pie-shaped lots shall be measured at
the closest point between the proposed building and the angled lot line,
perpendicular to that lot line.
         e.   Cul-De-Sac Lots: Setbacks shall be taken from the nearest
proposed foundation corner, and measured perpendicular to the property lines.
         f.   Flag Lots: A flag lot is a lot so shaped that the building area
(the "flag") is not adjacent to the street or alley on which the lot fronts,
and which includes an access strip (the "pole") connecting the building area to
the street or alley. Setbacks shall be applied at the enlarged area of the lot
("flag"), and front (or false front) setbacks shall be a minimum of ten feet
(10') and side yard setbacks shall be a minimum of six feet (6'); whereas rear
setbacks shall be a minimum of five feet (5').
   C.   Alternative Lot Configurations: In order to promote creative and unique
site designs, alternative lot configurations are allowed within the Harvest
Springs MDP. Alternative lot configurations include, but are not limited to:
      1.   Zero lot line developments.
      2.   "Z" lot configurations.
      3.   Common access easements configurations.
      4.   Courtyard.
   D.   Deviations From Dimensional Standards: The following deviations from
dimensional standards may be allowed by the City:
      1.   Front and side yard setbacks set by this chapter for residential
structures may be administratively reduced up to a maximum of ten percent (10%)
provided that the deviation does not result in a garage with a front yard
setback of less than twenty feet (20') from the property line.
   E.   Building Height:
 
Land Use                   Maximum Height
                           (In Stories)1,2
Residential                2
Village                    3
Town                       4
Business and research park 4
 
Notes:
   1.   Stories are the number of stories above grade at the front of the
structure street level. This does not restrict walkout basements for non-street
fronting structure areas.
   2.   The City Council may approve greater building heights than shown in the
table above if it identifies site or design characteristics that are unique to
the development such as size, scale, topography, or development amenities
(e.g., rooftop gardens), that justify allowing greater building heights.
Approved structures with additional height may be required to employ suitable
"step back" architecture and other architectural features that create a
development that is built at the human scale, and is pedestrian friendly and
architecturally diverse.
(Ord. 796, 2019)
18.34.060: GENERAL CONTROLS:
   A.   Building Areas To Be Unencumbered: Buildable areas must be unencumbered
by setbacks, public easements, and other physical constraints (such as
topography or similar features).
   B.   Clustering: Buildings shall be clustered to preserve scenic or
environmentally sensitive areas in the natural state, or to consolidate small
open spaces into larger, more usable areas for common use and enjoyment.
Clustered areas shall be carefully designed to abut upon common open space or
recreational amenities. Commercial developments shall be planned as groups
having common parking areas and common ingress and egress points in order to
reduce the number of vehicle and bike/pedestrian conflict point locations.
   C.   Like Uses To Face Like Uses: Where possible, "like land uses" shall
face "like land uses" or open space, i.e., retail across the street from
retail, townhomes from townhomes, etc.
   D.   Fencing Along Sidewalks And Streets Discouraged; Standards For When
Used: To facilitate a visually open public realm, unless otherwise required by
this chapter, fencing along sidewalks or streets, excluding alley ways, is
strongly discouraged. Where such fencing is used however, fencing plans which
include heights, materials, and designs, shall be reviewed as part of the
design book review process and the City may impose necessary conditions of
approval in order to satisfy the intent and purpose of this chapter and
section.
   E.   Buffering Of Nonresidential Uses From Residential Uses: Where
separation is desirable between uses, landscaped buffers are preferred over
fences and walls in order to create a more visually open look. When fences are
used between uses or properties within the development, fencing shall be
compatible in color, texture, and design in relationship to building materials.
Buffering may be required by the Land Use and Development Commission, the City
Council, or Design Review Committee between uses deemed incompatible.
   F.   Utilities: Underground utilities, such as telephone, fiber, and
electrical systems, are required if included in the development. Appurtenances
to these systems which can be effectively screened may be exempted from this
requirement if the City finds that such exemption will not violate the intent
or character of the proposed development. However, the developer shall make
efforts to group appurtenances together so as to minimize their distribution.
   G.   Storage Of Recreational Vehicles, Watercraft, Trailers, Campers,
Motorhomes, And Other Utility Vehicles To Be Screened: Watercraft, trailers,
campers, motor homes and other utility or recreational vehicles shall be stored
within completely enclosed, lawfully constructed buildings or within fenced
enclosures at least six feet (6') behind the front line and the street side
line of the main building on the lot or parcel in a CC Zone, except that said
vehicles may be parked temporarily in front or side yards for no longer than
twenty four (24) hours.
   H.   Architectural Control Committee Required: The Harvest Springs
development shall provide for, and maintain, an Architectural Control Committee
to ensure that the treatment of building mass, materials, and exterior
appurtenances create aesthetically pleasing structures and a site that is in
character with, and in proportion to, other surrounding buildings, while still
providing diversity in design and neighborhood identity. The committee shall
review and approve all themes and colors prior to Design Review Committee and
building permit application submittals to the City and to significant exterior
modifications to ensure compliance with the approved Master Development Plan
and Design Book.
   I.   Product Mix: A variety of different residential architectural styles
have been approved through the master development plan process. Neighborhoods
that have nearly identical homes and streets without variation in product
placement and form are not allowed. In order to ensure that the neighborhood is
non- repetitive, homes with the same color scheme shall not be built on
adjacent lots on the same street or on lots directly or diagonally across the
street from one another.
   J.   Corner Lots: Special attention should be paid to corner lots. At least
one home plan per neighborhood shall be designed specifically for corner home
sites. This home plan is required to include wrap-around architecture to
provide visual interest on both the front and corner side yard of the home, and
the ability to turn the garage for side entry. An example would be continuing a
full-wrap of material accent onto the side facade, adding a wraparound porch,
or facing the home on a diagonal towards the intersection. Corner lot
development shall conform to product mix requirements of the previous
subsection.
   K.   Entry Sidewalks: Single-family residences shall have building entry
sidewalks that connect directly to a street sidewalk or pathway.
   L.   Ground Level Aesthetics: Buildings shall be designed to relate to grade
conditions with a minimum of grading and exposed foundation walls, creating
easy pedestrian access from sidewalks, parking areas, etc. Commercial or mixed
use buildings shall be designed with contrasting ground floor architectural
articulation in order to enhance street activity and walkability. Windows,
display windows, doors, and arcades must make up at least fifty percent (50%)
of street facing facades on the first story of commercial developments. Window
shapes and sizes shall be so designed to be compatible from building to
building. Tinted windows or windows with reflective film or glass are
discouraged at street level.
   M.   Access: All lots developed for residential purposes shall have frontage
along a public roadway, or be rear-loaded with alley access, or front upon a
"green court". All retail, civic, and office buildings shall front onto
streets. (Ord. 796, 2019)
18.34.070: PARKING STANDARDS:
The standards for parking facilities are intended to promote vehicular and
pedestrian safety and efficient land use. Parking lot landscaping standards are
provided in section
18.34.090 of this chapter.
   A.   Minimum Parking Requirements:
      1.   Residential uses or structures shall provide off-street parking
spaces pursuant to the chart below; guest parking for residential uses and
nonresident parking for mixed-use, live work uses and home occupations is
included within those required spaces. Additional guest parking may be provided
on-street. For mixed use projects, the residential use portion of the structure
shall satisfy the requirements of the chart below:
 
Use/Structure                            Required Spaces Per Unit
Dwelling unit, detached or attached less 2
than or equal to 3 dwellings
Dwelling unit, attached more than 3      1.75
dwellings
Dwelling unit, accessory                 1
Multi-family studio units                1
Group quarters                           Calculated in same manner as non-
                                         residential uses
 
      2.   Non-residential uses: Off-street parking shall be provided to meet
the demand of the proposed land use. The applicant shall calculate this demand
based on accepted standards, such as published in the Institute of
Transportation Engineer's Parking Generation Reports. Mixed-use projects shall
provide parking according to a shared parking analysis that projects parking
needs based on the peak hour of parking demand. For example, a building with
first-floor retail and office space and upper-floor residential will be able to
adjust total parking demand to address the fact that peak residential parking
demand will occur in the evening, while peak office parking demand will occur
during the day. This analysis shall be based on accepted methodologies, such as
the Urban Land Institute Shared Parking Study.
   B.   Parking Dimensions: Parking dimensions shall meet or exceed the
following standards:
      1.   Spaces:
         a.   Standard space: 9.5 feet x 18 feet, with a two foot (2') overhang
permitted into non-pedestrian areas.
         b.   Compact space: 8.5 feet x 16 feet, with a two foot (2') overhang
permitted into non-pedestrian areas; up to sixty five percent (65%) of total
spaces may be compact.
         c.   Motorcycle space: 4.5 feet x 12 feet.
         d.   Parallel parking space: 24 feet x 7 feet.
      2.   Location Of Parking: For single-family detached dwelling on a fee
simple lot, the parking must be provided on the lot it serves. For all other
uses, the parking shall be provided within five hundred feet (500') of the use.
      3.   Aisle Widths: Drive aisle widths for parking lots with perpendicular
parking is twenty four feet (24') minimum, and for angled parking is twenty
feet (20') minimum for two-way traffic.
   C.   Motorcycle And Bicycle Parking: Motorcycle and bicycle parking shall
meet the following standards:
      1.   All multi-family developments and non-residential uses may provide
one motorcycle space for every twenty five (25) required automobile parking
spaces in lieu of a required automobile space.
      2.   All uses with twenty five (25) or more required parking spaces shall
provide a designated bicycle parking area to accommodate a minimum of five (5)
bicycles. Such bicycle parking shall provide a secure facility to which to lock
bicycles and shall be located so as to be reasonably convenient to the on-site
use and not interfere with pedestrian or automobile traffic. The City may
require additional bicycle parking for facilities with high expected bicycle
traffic, such as schools. (Ord. 796, 2019)
18.34.080: SIGNAGE STANDARDS:
   A.   Sign Standards Applicability: All phases and neighborhoods within the
Harvest Springs community shall be subject to the definitions, standards,
requirements and processes found within this chapter and the standards found
within the Master Development Plan and Design Book with the following
standards:
      1.   Shopping center identification signs shall be designed with similar
materials and architectural character as the buildings within the shopping
center so as to provide a cohesive appearance.
      2.   A master sign plan that provides for consistent color, placement,
materials and design of all signs within the shopping center shall be submitted
and approved together with the application for the shopping center
identification sign.
      3.   Water features, masonry, and/or landscaping should be incorporated
into the design to create visual interest.
      4.   Signs may be indirectly lit or have internally illuminated channel
letters. Internally illuminated plastic, or other similar material, faced box
signs are not allowed.
      5.   Maximum height of shopping center identification sign is thirty feet
(30') including its base, measured from the adjacent ground level. Signs of
heights greater than thirty feet (30') may be conditionally permitted by the
City after considering the recommendation of the community builder, homeowners'
association, and/or Architectural Control Committee and after considering the
criteria for conditional use permits in this title.
   B.   Neighborhood Identification Signs: Signs identifying each neighborhood
within the MDP shall be installed at the beginning and end of each
neighborhood. (Ord. 796, 2019)
18.34.090: LANDSCAPING STANDARDS:
   A.   Applicability: The provisions of this section establish the landscape
standards for the Harvest Springs Zoning District, and shall apply to all
phases and neighborhoods within the district except for detached single family
residences, accessory dwelling units, attached residential dwellings in
buildings up to and including four (4) units, home occupations, temporary uses,
accessory uses, and clearing and grading associated with these uses. All phases
and neighborhoods, including those excepted above, are still subject to review
by the Design Review Committee.
   B.   Review Process:
      1.   A landscape plan designed or approved by either a landscape
architect licensed in the State of Idaho or Idaho State Master Gardener shall
be submitted to the Design Review Committee for review and approval.
      2.   The landscaping plans shall contain generally accepted
specifications and direction for planting and maintenance such as, but not
limited to, tree and shrub planting, staking, and soil preparation.
   C.   Landscape Design: Landscape design shall be consistent with the
approved master development plan/design book and guidelines of this chapter,
and be appropriate to the intended use of the site or building.
   D.   Landscape Materials: New landscape materials shall include species
native to the area or non-invasive naturalized species that have adapted to
those climate conditions in the following amounts: seventy five percent (75%)
groundcovers and shrubs, fifty percent (50%) trees. Sixty percent (60%) of
plant materials must be drought tolerant. In addition, landscaping may include
water features, rock, wood, walls, fences and other similar decorative
materials and artistic features. Playfields, playgrounds, and other similar
uses are exempt from the materials requirement.
   E.   Right-Of-Way And Associated Landscape Tracts:
      1.   One street tree per each thirty (30) lineal feet of street frontage
is required on all streets. In addition, trees can be staggered, and/or planted
in drifts or groves so long as the total number of required trees is provided.
Street trees must be a minimum caliper of one and one-half inches (1.5")
diameter at breast height.
      2.   Medians and planter strips shall be planted with landscape materials
per subsection D of this section. Trees, shrubs and groundcovers may be planted
in drifts, or as appropriate for stormwater quality/low impact development.
      3.   Landscaping within planter strips adjacent to parking spaces must
include a low growing plant palette with a variety of textures, such as, but
not limited to, low grasses, groundcovers and perennials.
      4.   Portions of park strips may be paved to accommodate street
furniture, leaving appropriately sized tree wells for street trees.
   F.   Parking Lot Landscaping: The purpose of parking lot landscaping is to
soften the visual appearance, soften views of parking lots, add shade and
reinforce safe pedestrian access to buildings and connecting sidewalks. Parking
lots with twelve (12) or more stalls shall include:
      1.   One tree for every ten (10) stalls located in islands or perimeter
landscaping; and
      2.   Total of all interior landscaped areas shall be at least ten percent
(10%) of the total parking area (including parking, maneuvering, and loading
areas); and
      3.   All landscape areas must be planted with landscape materials per
subsection D of this section, except where pedestrian access is provided.
Landscaping adjacent to parking spaces must include a low growing plant palette
with a variety of textures, such as, but not limited to, low grasses,
groundcovers and perennials; and
      4.   Minimum width of all landscape areas is four feet (4'). A reduction
in width of up to two feet (2') may be allowed for interior landscape areas
(not adjacent to right-of-way) provided the total required area is provided;
and
      5.   A minimum six foot (6') wide perimeter of landscaping is required
adjacent to rights-of-way, except where vehicular ingress and egress is
proposed. The perimeter landscaping may include decorative walls, solid fences
or vegetation to obscure views of parking areas provided that any of the
aforementioned screening treatments are limited to a maximum height of four
feet (4').
   G.   Maintenance: To the extent necessary to remain, all landscaping shall
be watered, weeded, pruned, freed of pests, and replaced as necessary. (Ord.
796, 2019)
18.34.100: STREET STANDARDS:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to establish standards for the
design, configuration and performance of all public and private streets within
the Harvest Springs Zoning District in order to:
      1.   Ensure adequate access and connectivity throughout the project site;
      2.   Allow for flexibility in the design and location of streets; and
      3.   Establish a streetscape and street design that helps to define the
character and image of the Harvest Springs District.
   B.   Applicability: This section is applicable to all streets, alleys,
private drives and other vehicular accessways proposed within the zoning
district. Specific land uses, site conditions, visibility limitations and
critical areas may result in variations to the street types as permitted in
this section. Standards not defined in this section will be governed by the
typical City of Chubbuck standards.
   C.   Street Types: Exhibit "E" of the approved Master Development Plan shows
the approximate location of streets classified as arterials and major and minor
collectors. All other streets and access will be neighborhood streets, private
roads, shared drives, auto/pedestrian shared drives or alleys and will be
designed and located by the applicant during the platting and/or development
process associated with each parcel. These phases and neighborhoods shall be
designed to foster the development of a street grid system throughout the
project site. It is understood that street design is limited by geographical
features such as the Interstate 15, the Fort Hall Canal, and general
topography.
   D.   Off-Site Connections Required: The Harvest Springs development shall
stub streets to the boundaries of abutting off-site property as generally shown
in the approved master development plan; the connection points on the approved
MDP Circulation Map are approximate. The actual design and location of
connection points will be determined at the preliminary plat stage of each
phase by the community builder and City using a collaborative process.
   E.   Review Criteria For Deviations: The requirements of this section may be
modified through a deviation request for cause during the design book and
preliminary platting phase. Street sections may be modified to best fit the
character of the proposed neighborhood and respond to natural site features.
Modifications to street sections related to on-street parking, bicycle lanes,
planter strips and/or sidewalks must meet the following guidelines as
applicable:
      1.   On-street parking is required to the extent necessary to satisfy
guest parking requirement.
      2.   Bicycle lanes are only required to be included in street sections
that are classified higher than a neighborhood street. Bicycle lanes may be
eliminated if an adequate off-street trail facility is provided as a
replacement.
      3.   A sidewalk may be eliminated if a separated trail section is
provided as a replacement. For example, where a paved multi-use trail is
provided along the road (it may be separated), the sidewalk may be eliminated
on one or both sides.
   F.   Street Sections: As authorized by the master development plan approval,
street sections for all street types within the district shall be followed.
These street sections are typical and may vary subject to approval by the
Public Works Director to accommodate specific site and design conditions.
Street sections may incorporate cross-slopes, crowns, inverts, and/or super
elevation to accommodate low impact development or other design features.
   G.   Tyhee Road/Harvest Springs Boulevard: The design of Harvest Springs
Boulevard is to extend from Hiline Road near the north end of the project and
continue through the project until it ultimately connects with the East Siphon/
Northgate Extension/New Day Parkway as per the master plan layout. The
community builder shall be responsible for the construction of a three (3) lane
road for the initial build of Harvest Springs Boulevard, including the bridge
crossing onto Hiline Road, which said construction costs may be available for
reimbursement through an approved Urban Renewal District. A one hundred foot
(100') wide right-of-way shall be dedicated to the City of Chubbuck for the
full build out of Harvest Springs Boulevard. (Ord. 796, 2019)
18.34.110: PARKS AND OPEN SPACE:
   A.   Parks: The community builder is responsible for the design and
construction of the parks. The actual location and boundaries of parks may vary
but will be defined through the platting stage.
   B.   Sensitive Areas And Buffers: Sensitive areas and buffers are the steep
slopes (slopes above 35 percent grade), lowlands, and dry-stream beds. An
effort shall be made to preserve and protect and, in many cases, leave natural,
sensitive areas and buffers. Trails, crossings, encroachments, and improvements
may be allowed within sensitive areas consistent with a low impact development
effort. These areas may be dedicated to the City as open space at the time of
phase platting.
   C.   Non-Sensitive Open Space: Open space outside of sensitive areas and
buffers includes, but is not limited to, the plaza, community parks, trails,
neighborhood and pocket parks, natural areas and stormwater ponds and
infiltration facilities. Additional parks may be provided as individual phases
are developed.
   D.   Stormwater Ponds And Facilities: Stormwater ponds and facilities shall
be designed as either passive or active open space when practical. Passive open
space facilities consisting of stormwater ponds shall be designed to appear as
a natural wetland or pond. Vegetation shall consist of no less than seventy
percent (70%) native plant material typically found in and around Bannock
County. Any fencing required shall be designed and located such that it does
not detract from the natural character of the facility. If natural landscaping
is intended to provide a long- term barrier to human intrusion, temporary
fencing may be permitted until such time as the landscaping has matured to the
point of providing the barrier.
   E.   Trail Plan: The community builder is responsible for the design and
construction of the trails shown on the plan with approval by the City. The
actual location of trails may vary and will be defined through the platting
process. Necessary trail construction will be completed within the boundaries
of each phase as constructed. Where feasible, trail construction should avoid
dead ends and incomplete segments.
   F.   Trail Standards: Trails will be built to the standards as described in
subsection
18.21.050A3 of this title. The following amenities may be included within trail
corridors subject to mutual agreement between the community builder and the
City: rest stops, sculpture and other art, pedestrian lighting, exercise
stations, picnic tables, interpretive areas, pocket parks/tot lots, drinking
fountains, restrooms, and covered sheds, and other similar amenities.
   G.   Park, Open Space, And Deviations From Plan: All park, recreation
facility, open space and trail standards, cross sections and locations are
general documents and may be modified through the deviation process established
by section
18.34.120 of this chapter. (Ord. 796, 2019)
18.34.120: PLAN AND AGREEMENT CHANGES; ADMINISTRATION:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to provide a process and
criteria to interpret, modify and/or amend the standards, processes,
conditions, or provisions contained within the MDP approval as codified in this
chapter and in agreements with the community builder. In addition, recognizing
that not all potential issues can be anticipated over the life of this
development, it is the intent of this chapter to allow for flexibility so that
Harvest Springs Zoning District can adapt to new information, changes in the
market, and technological advances over time.
   B.   Interpretations: Any dispute over the meaning of this chapter shall be
resolved first by an interpretation from the Community Services Director. The
Community Services Director shall issue a written interpretation within ten
(10) business days of receiving a written request for clarification. The City
Community Services Director’s interpretation may be appealed to the City
Council. The City Council shall hold a meeting on the interpretation appeal at
the next available regular meeting following the date upon which the request
for an appeal to the City Council is delivered to the Community Services
Director. At the appeal, both the Community Services Director and appellant
shall be entitled to voice testimony to the Council for consideration. The
community builder or community builder transferee shall exhaust its remedies as
set forth herein prior to exercising other remedies.
   C.   Appeal Of Administrative Decisions To City Council: Final
administrative decisions of this chapter may be appealed to the City Council.
   D.   Deviations From The Master Development Plan Approval: An amendment to
the Harvest Springs Master Development Plan as approved may be requested by the
community builder or community builder transferee. Minor deviations meeting the
criteria as described below may be approved administratively by the Community
Services Director; major deviations not meeting the criteria for a minor
deviation shall require the same review and approval process as a Zoning
Ordinance amendment as outlined in Idaho Code 67-6511.
   E.   Minor Deviation: A deviation to the approved master development plan
shall be considered minor if the change satisfies all of the following
criteria:
      1.   The deviation will not increase the total number of dwelling units
in the development above the maximum number set forth in the approved master
development plan, or reduce the minimum number by more than ten percent (10%);
      2.   The deviation will not increase the total floor area of
nonresidential uses by more than ten percent (10%);
      3.   The deviation will not decrease the minimum, or increase the maximum
density for residential areas of the development beyond approved density ranges
approved;
      4.   The deviation will not decrease the approved amount of open space or
recreation space;
      5.   The deviation will not increase any adverse environmental impact,
provided that additional environmental review may be required to determine
whether such change is likely to occur;
      6.   The deviation will not adversely impact the project’s fiscal
projections to the detriment of the City;
      7.   The deviation will not significantly impact the overall design of
the approved master development plan;
      8.   The deviation will not significantly alter the size or location of
any designated open space resulting in a lowered level of service; and
      9.   The requested amendment is a land use category change that does not
increase the land use category of a development parcel immediately adjacent to
the perimeter of the project site.
   F.   Project And Improvement Phasing: The concept master phasing plan
approved through the Master Development Plan approval process is intended to be
a general guide and to reflect current conditions. It is not the intent of the
City to restrict other phasing opportunities which correspond to changes in
market conditions and technological advances nor to restrict infrastructure and
timing of the development which may differ from the approved concept.
   G.   Responsibility Of The Community Builder To Ensure Compliance With This
Chapter: The community builder shall designate through its controlling
community documents, a Community Review Board who, prior to any applications
being accepted by the City for review and approval, shall perform a review of
the petition materials to ensure that the requirements and intent and purpose
of this zone are upheld and shall then provide a letter to the City to
accompany the application stating their findings and providing a
recommendation. The City will not enforce standards of the development
contained within the development’s internal codes, covenants, and restrictions
or other related controlling documents.
   H.   Deviations From Standards Of This Chapter: In instances where the
community builder or interested party seeks a deviation from the City from
regular standards of this Code as may be authorized in this chapter (e.g.,
height, building and parking lot layouts, fencing and screening, etc.), and in
addition to any of the criteria related to the subject matter, the City shall
consider the following in making a decision:
      1.   Findings and recommendation of the community builder, homeowners’
association, and/or the Architectural Control Committee.
      2.   Whether the proposed deviation would conflict with the stated intent
and purposes of this chapter and the adopted master development plan and design

   C.   Intent And Purpose: The intent and purpose of this zoning district is
to further the specific intent of the Creative Community District as set forth
in section
18.21.010 of this title. Specifically, the Northside Crossing development goals
are as follows:
      1.   Purpose: Northside Crossing at New Day will provide a new
opportunity for its residents. Much like the dawn of a new day, our new
community will provide residents a new beginning, a new start, and a new life
every day of the year. The community builder together with the City has
partnered together to create an open and inviting neighborhood to all those who
live or visit here. It is the community builder's goal to create a truly
walkable neighborhood that is easy and safe to navigate. Through comprehensive
site planning this community will incorporate something for everyone. Miles of
walking paths will connect dozens of acres of open spaces, parks, and
recreational areas. These recreational areas are intended to promote health and
wellness along with offering places for gathering. The "Hub" at Town Center
will be a place for public events, live entertainment and music, apartment over
retail living, and many other creative uses.
      2.   Fulfill The City's Creative Community Public Benefit Objectives: A
goal of the developer ("community builder") and the City is that construction
of the Northside Crossing MDP, consistent with the MDP approval and this
chapter, will fulfill the public benefit objectives outlined in chapter 18.21
of this title.
      3.   Create Employment Opportunities: A goal of the community builder and
City is to provide commercial, retail, office, and light industrial
opportunities that are well-integrated into the Northside Crossing Zoning
District, that promote the creation of jobs and commerce, that are flexible to
market conditions and that provide the opportunity for the newly created
households and residents to have a place to work and shop. Health and wellness
is intended to be the focus in this community. The community builder will also
provide mixed-use opportunities to create meaningful village centers that
support local business activity and employment opportunities.
      4.   Create A Mix Of Land Uses: A goal of the community builder and City
is to develop a mix of uses within the Northside Crossing Zoning District that
complements the range of existing and planned uses within the City; respects
the character of adjacent neighborhoods; and utilizes existing availability and
planned capacity of urban services, access opportunities, and infrastructure
systems located in proximity to the district.
      5.   Protect The Environment: A goal of the community builder and City is
to create a creative community that seeks to protect the landscape and allow
its residents to enjoy the outdoors. Idaho is a beautiful state. People will be
moving here for that reason. Solar, as a renewable energy source will be
encouraged. Water conservation efforts will be met through smart landscaping
and the use of Fort Hall water for irrigation. Recycling and other repurposing
receptacles are envisioned to be placed strategically in the community.
      6.   Create A Fiscally-Sound, Economically-Viable Community: A goal of
the community builder and City is to create an economically- viable creative
community that provides office, retail, light industrial, and other commercial
uses; preserves open spaces and integrates open space corridors; provides
recreational opportunities, necessary public facilities, and a wide range of
residential opportunities. The community builder and City seek to ensure that
these elements of the Northside Crossing Zoning District are fiscally sound and
sufficient so they can aid in minimizing necessary up-front infrastructure cost
and upgrades as well as generate an adequate financial return to justify the
risk and cost of local and regional improvements to transportation, water,
sewer, and stormwater facilities. Opportunities to create positive fiscal
performance that are mutually beneficial to the City and community builder are
to be pursued.
      7.   Provide A Range Of House Types And Lifestyles Opportunities: A goal
of the community builder and City is to provide within the Northside Crossing
Zoning District a range of residential and lifestyle opportunities at urban
densities within the City that adequately responds to dynamic market factors
over time, is accessible to all economic segments of the population, and
contributes to the City targets for accommodating growth under the
comprehensive plan.
      8.   Built-In Flexibility: A goal of the community builder and City is to
create a community with the flexibility to quickly respond and adapt to new
and/or innovative technology, construction methods and materials, land uses,
housing types and businesses. Recognizing that the future may include advances
in these areas that do not currently exist and that may prove to be fiscally or
environmentally beneficial to the community builder and City, the City shall
allow flexibility in the use of new and/or innovative technologies,
construction methods and materials, land uses, housing types and businesses
that meet or exceed the design standards and guidelines throughout the
Northside Crossing MDP.
      9.   Sustainability: A goal of the community builder is to integrate low
impact development techniques within the Northside Crossing Zoning District in
order to create a community that is more livable, walkable, and sustainable for
current and future residents. Potential techniques include, but are not limited
to, low impact development, recycling, and water conservation.
      10.   Make Development Decisions Predictable, Fair And Cost- Effective: A
goal of the City is to provide certainty, predictability and a stream-lined
process for the review and approval of phases and neighborhoods that are
consistent with and implement this district.
   D.   Relationship To Other Land Use And Development Controls And Codes;
Chapter Supersedes Portions Of This Code As Described:
      1.   With the establishment of this zoning district, modifications from
this Code are allowed within the CC-NC Zoning District as applicable.
      2.   Where there appears to be a conflict between these standards and any
other sections of this Code, the requirements set forth in this zoning district
prevail. This district does not prevail over Life Safety Codes. (Ord. 801,

18.35.030: MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM BUILD-OUT DENSITY AND OCCUPIED FLOOR AREA; OPEN
SPACE REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Uses: The Northside Crossing Zoning District will provide a mixture of
uses including: residential, commercial, office, light industrial, retail,
educational, civic, and recreational uses such as trails, parks, and open
space.
   B.   Maximum And Minimum Number Of Residential Units: A maximum of one
thousand four hundred (1,400) residential units are permitted within the zoning

process, in no instance shall the district be built out to contain fewer than
four hundred (400) residential units. Accessory dwelling units shall not count
toward the density calculations of this section. To ensure that the community

platted lots and to track current densities and may require that future
developments contain greater densities than proposed by the community builder.
Accessory dwelling units do not count toward the maximum number of dwelling
units.
   C.   Maximum Square Feet Of Occupied Floor Area For Non-Residential Uses:
There is no restriction on maximum square feet occupied floor area for non-
residential uses provided that City utilities and services are adequate to
serve the area without negatively impacting the ability to serve other planned
or existing areas in or near the City.
   D.   Open Space Minimum Area Requirement: At least eighteen (18) acres of
open space are required within the district. Development of the open space
areas shall be at least proportional to the development area (e.g., if a plat
contains 15 percent of the land area in the district, there shall be built or
existing, at least 15 percent of the proposed open space in the district);
however, recognizing that market or development patterns may cause a need to
deviate from this requirement, a deviation may be granted through the design
book approval process. For purposes of this zoning district, open space
amenities as approved through the MDP are found on file in the City. (Ord. 801,
2019: Ord. 845 § 15, 2022)
18.35.040: SCHEDULE OF GENERAL CONTROLS; LAND USE CHART:
   A.   General Controls: General controls for the zoning district are set
forth in the chart below. Specific uses are permitted where indicated in the
chart by the letter “P”. Where the letter “C” appears, it denotes a use allowed
in the district in question only upon issuance of a conditional use permit as
herein provided. An “X” indicates that the use is neither allowed nor
conditionally permitted. An “R” indicates a restriction on that use. Because no
list can be all encompassing, decisions on uses will be rendered by the
Community Services Director with appeal to the Land Use and Development
Commission as a business item available to the applicant. In making a
determination of use, the Community Services Director shall consider similar
uses listed in the chart below, the character of the surrounding neighborhood,
and characteristics of the proposed use.
   B.   More Than Five Dwellings: All non-residential uses/projects and
residential uses/projects with structures containing more than five (5)
dwellings shall be subject to the City's Design Review Committee review and
approval.
   C.   Land Use Designation Areas Defined: Within the Northside Crossing
Zoning District are land use designation areas with specific uses permitted,
conditionally permitted, or prohibited by this section. Whereas land uses may
differ between the district and the private covenants, all applications for new
or modified uses within the zoning district must be submitted with a
recommendation from the reviewing body of homeowners' association. These land
use designation areas are part of this chapter and prior to design book and
platting, are to be interpreted as not being hard, definite boundaries but are
rather, flexible to accommodate needs related to topography and grade, lot
layout and plat design, or other elements that may be identified during the
platting process. Land use designation areas are as follows:
      1.   Village (V): This land use area is designed for medium to high
density mixed use development that includes residential (single- and multi-
family), office, commercial, public/semipublic, recreation/open space uses, and
certain compatible light industrial uses without a predetermined emphasis on
any single use.
      2.   Town (T): This land use area is designed for office, commercial and
recreational uses, but also includes residential (single- and multi-family),
public/semipublic, open space, and certain compatible light industrial uses.
      3.   Business and research park (BRP): This land use area is designed to
accommodate (but not require) a mixture of all uses: residential (single- and
multi-family), office, commercial, light industrial, recreational and public/
semipublic uses. The principal land use in this category should be office,
commercial and light industrial.

Notes:
   1.   Front yard is the area of the structure that faces either on a public
street or green court. Front yard is measured from the back of sidewalk,
courtyard path, or walkway; distance is measured from the closest edge of
building materials (e.g., if dwelling has front porch, the front porch shall be
used to determine distance; if dwelling does not have front porch, the closest
edge of the structure facing the front shall be used). Front yard maximum
setback may be increased where necessary due to topography.
   2.   Setbacks for street-loaded garages are measured from the front of the
dwelling as defined in note 1 of this chart.
   3.   Setbacks for alley-loaded garages are measured from the edge of the
alley right-of- way (private or public).
   4.   Note that side yard setback does not apply to the common wall on
townhome, duplex, other similar attached dwellings or alternative lot
configurations as provided in this section.
   5.   Use easements may be utilized for provision of private yards.
   6.   Nonresidential uses and/or structures have no minimum side or rear yard
setback requirements; there may be no minimum front yard setback provided that
it can be successfully demonstrated that pedestrian or vehicular travel is not
negatively impacted.
   7.   Allowed encroachments:
      a.   Uncovered decks, patios, walkways, and other minor structural
elements less than 30 inches in height; and fences 7 feet in height or less;
are exempt from setback requirements.
      b.   Retaining walls, rockeries and heat pumps and other similar
mechanical/landscape features are allowed within setbacks.
      c.   Balconies above the first floor may intrude into setbacks up to 2
feet subject to applicable Construction Codes.
      d.   Chimneys and fireplaces, accent walls or pilasters, bay windows,
eaves and other similar minor structural or architectural elements may encroach
up to 2 feet into setbacks subject to applicable Construction Codes.
      2.   Setbacks: Setbacks are measured from the outside wall of the
foundation of a structure to the property lines in a perpendicular fashion
unless otherwise stated herein.
      3.   Irregular Lots: Setbacks for irregular lots as defined shall be as
follows:
         a.   Front: Front setbacks shall be measured from the property line
that abuts the street from which the lot is addressed or takes primary access.
         b.   Rear: In the case of an irregularly shaped lot, a ten foot (10')
line which is within the lot and parallel to and most distant from the front
lot line shall be considered the rear lot line. For an alley loaded lot, the
setback is measured from the lot line closest from the alley.
         c.   Side: All lot lines, which are not front or rear lot lines, shall
be considered side lot lines.
         d.   Pie-Shaped Lots: Setbacks on pie-shaped lots shall be measured at
the closest point between the proposed building and the angled lot line,
perpendicular to that lot line.
         e.   Cul-De-Sac Lots: Setbacks shall be taken from the nearest
proposed foundation corner, and measured perpendicular to the property lines.
         f.   Flag Lots: A flag lot is a lot so shaped that the building area
(the "flag") is not adjacent to the street or alley on which the lot fronts,
and which includes an access strip (the "pole") connecting the building area to
the street or alley. Setbacks shall be applied at the enlarged area of the lot
("flag"), and front (or false front) setbacks shall be a minimum of ten feet
(10') and side yard setbacks shall be a minimum of six feet (6'); whereas rear
setbacks shall be a minimum of five feet (5').
   C.   Alternative Lot Configurations: In order to promote creative and unique
site designs, alternative lot configurations are allowed within the Northside
Crossing Zoning District. Alternative lot configurations include, but are not
limited to:
      1.   Zero lot line developments.
      2.   "Z" lot configurations.
      3.   Common access easements configurations.
      4.   Courtyard.
   D.   Deviations From Dimensional Standards: The following deviations from
dimensional standards may be allowed by the City:
      1.   Front and side yard setbacks set by this chapter for residential
structures may be administratively reduced up to a maximum of ten percent (10%)
provided that the deviation does not result in a garage with a front yard
setback of less than twenty feet (20') from the property line.
   E.   Building Height:
 
Land Use                   Maximum Height
                           (In Stories)1,2,3
Village                    3
Town                       4
Business and research park 4
 
Notes:
   1.   Stories are the number of stories above grade at the front of the
structure street level. This does not restrict walkout basements for non-street
fronting structure areas.
   2.   The City Council may approve greater building heights than shown in the
table above if it identifies site or design characteristics that are unique to
the development such as size, scale, topography, or development amenities
(e.g., rooftop gardens), that justify allowing greater building heights.
Approved structures with additional height may be required to employ suitable
"step back" architecture and other architectural features that create a
development that is built at the human scale, and is pedestrian friendly and
architecturally diverse.
   3.   Heights up to 35 feet with more than 2 stories may be permitted for
buildings such as split level homes or buildings with attic offices or
quarters.
(Ord. 801, 2019)
18.35.060: GENERAL CONTROLS:
   A.   Building Areas To Be Unencumbered: Buildable areas must be unencumbered
by setbacks, public easements, and other physical constraints (such as
topography or similar features).
   B.   Clustering: Buildings shall be clustered to preserve scenic or
environmentally sensitive areas in the natural state, or to consolidate small
open spaces into larger, more usable areas for common use and enjoyment.
Clustered areas shall be carefully designed to abut upon common open space or
recreational amenities. Commercial developments shall be planned as groups
having common parking areas and common ingress and egress points in order to
reduce the number of vehicle and bike/pedestrian conflict point locations.
   C.   Like Uses To Face Like Uses: Where possible, "like land uses" shall
face "like land uses" or open space, i.e., retail across the street from
retail, townhomes from townhomes, etc.
   D.   Fencing Along Sidewalks And Streets Discouraged; Standards For When
Used: To facilitate a visually open public realm, unless otherwise required by
this chapter, fencing along sidewalks or streets, excluding alley ways, is
strongly discouraged. Where such fencing is used however, fencing plans which
include heights, materials, and designs, shall be reviewed as part of the
design book review process and the City may impose necessary conditions of
approval in order to satisfy the intent and purpose of this chapter and
section.
   E.   Buffering Of Nonresidential Uses From Residential Uses: Where
separation is desirable between uses, landscaped buffers are preferred over
fences and walls in order to create a more visually open look. When fences are
used between uses or properties within the development, fencing shall be
compatible in color, texture, and design in relationship to building materials.
Buffering may be required by the Land Use and Development Commission, the City
Council, or Design Review Committee between uses deemed incompatible.
   F.   Utilities: Underground utilities, such as telephone, fiber, and
electrical systems, are required if included in the development. Appurtenances
to these systems which can be effectively screened may be exempted from this
requirement if the City finds that such exemption will not violate the intent
or character of the proposed development. However, the developer shall make
efforts to group appurtenances together so as to minimize their distribution.
   G.   Storage Of Recreational Vehicles, Watercraft, Trailers, Campers,
Motorhomes, And Other Utility Vehicles To Be Screened: Watercraft, trailers,
campers, motor homes and other utility or recreational vehicles shall be stored
within completely enclosed, lawfully constructed buildings or within fenced
enclosures at least six feet (6') behind the front line and the street side
line of the main building on the lot or parcel in a CC Zone, except that said
vehicles may be parked temporarily in front or side yards for no longer than
twenty four (24) hours.
   H.   Architectural Control Committee Required: The community builder shall
provide for, and maintain, an Architectural Control Committee to ensure that
the treatment of building mass, materials, and exterior appurtenances create
aesthetically pleasing structures and a site that is in character with, and in
proportion to, other surrounding buildings, while still providing diversity in
design and neighborhood identity. The committee shall review and approve all
themes and colors prior to Design Review Committee and building permit
application submittals to the City and to significant exterior modifications to
ensure compliance with the approved Master Development Plan and Design Book.
   I.   Product Mix: A variety of different residential architectural styles
have been approved through the master development plan process. Neighborhoods
that have nearly identical homes and streets without variation in product
placement and form are not allowed. In order to ensure that the neighborhood is
non- repetitive, homes with the same color scheme shall not be built on
adjacent lots on the same street or on lots directly or diagonally across the
street from one another.
   J.   Corner Lots: Special attention should be paid to corner lots. At least
one home plan per neighborhood shall be designed specifically for corner home
sites. This home plan is required to include wrap-around architecture to
provide visual interest on both the front and corner side yard of the home, and
the ability to turn the garage for side entry. An example would be continuing a
full-wrap of material accent onto the side facade, adding a wraparound porch,
or facing the home on a diagonal towards the intersection. Corner-lot
development shall conform to product mix requirements of the previous section.
   K.   Entry Sidewalks: Single-family residences shall have building entry
sidewalks that connect directly to a street sidewalk or pathway.
   L.   Ground Level Aesthetics: Buildings shall be designed to relate to grade
conditions with a minimum of grading and exposed foundation walls, creating
easy pedestrian access from sidewalks, parking areas, etc. Commercial or mixed
use buildings shall be designed with contrasting ground floor architectural
articulation in order to enhance street activity and walkability. Windows,
display windows, doors, and arcades must make up at least fifty percent (50%)
of street facing facades on the first story of commercial developments. Window
shapes and sizes shall be so designed to be compatible from building to
building. Tinted windows or windows with reflective film or glass are
discouraged at street level.
   M.   Access: All lots developed for residential purposes shall have frontage
along a public roadway, or be rear-loaded with alley access, or front upon a
"green court". All retail, civic, and office buildings shall front onto
streets. (Ord. 801, 2019)
18.35.070: PARKING STANDARDS:
The standards for parking facilities are intended to promote vehicular and
pedestrian safety and efficient land use. Parking lot landscaping standards are
provided in section 18.35.090 of this chapter.
   A.   Minimum Parking Requirements:
      1.   Residential uses or structures shall provide off-street parking
spaces pursuant to the chart below; guest parking for residential uses and non-
resident parking for mixed-use, live work uses and home occupations is included
within those required spaces. Additional guest parking may be provided on-
street. For mixed use projects, the residential use portion of the structure
shall satisfy the requirements of the chart below:
 
Use/Structure                            Required Spaces Per Unit
Dwelling unit, detached or attached less 2
than or equal to 3 dwellings
Dwelling unit, attached more than 3      1.75
dwellings
Dwelling unit, accessory                 1
Multi-family studio units                1
Group quarters                           Calculated in same manner as non-
                                         residential uses
 
      2.   Non-residential uses: Off-street parking shall be provided to meet
the demand of the proposed land use. The applicant shall calculate this demand
based on accepted standards, such as published in the Institute of
Transportation Engineer's Parking Generation Reports. Mixed-use projects shall
provide parking according to a shared parking analysis that projects parking
needs based on the peak hour of parking demand. For example, a building with
first-floor retail and office space and upper-floor residential will be able to
adjust total parking demand to address the fact that peak residential parking
demand will occur in the evening, while peak office parking demand will occur
during the day. This analysis shall be based on accepted methodologies, such as
the Urban Land Institute Shared Parking Study.
   B.   Parking Dimensions: Parking dimensions shall meet or exceed the
following standards:
      1.   Spaces:
         a.   Standard space: 9.5 feet x 18 feet, with a two foot (2') overhang
permitted into non-pedestrian areas.
         b.   Compact space: 8.5 feet x 16 feet, with a two foot (2') overhang
permitted into non-pedestrian areas; up to sixty five percent (65%) of total
spaces may be compact.
         c.   Motorcycle space: 4.5 feet x 12 feet.
         d.   Parallel parking space: 24 feet x 7 feet.
      2.   Location Of Parking: For single-family detached dwelling on a fee
simple lot, the parking must be provided on the lot it serves. For all other
uses, the parking shall be provided within five hundred feet (500') of the use.
      3.   Aisle Widths: Drive aisle width for parking lots with perpendicular
parking is twenty four feet (24') minimum, and for angled parking the width is
twenty feet (20') minimum for two-way traffic.
   C.   Motorcycle And Bicycle Parking: Motorcycle and bicycle parking shall
meet the following standards:
      1.   All multi-family developments and non-residential uses may provide
one motorcycle space for every twenty five (25) required automobile parking
spaces in lieu of a required automobile space.
      2.   All uses with twenty five (25) or more required parking spaces shall
provide a designated bicycle parking area to accommodate a minimum of five (5)
bicycles. Such bicycle parking shall provide a secure facility to which to lock
bicycles and shall be located so as to be reasonably convenient to the on-site
use and not interfere with pedestrian or automobile traffic. The City may
require additional bicycle parking for facilities with high expected bicycle
traffic, such as schools. (Ord. 801, 2019)
18.35.080: SIGNAGE STANDARDS:
   A.   Sign Standards Applicability: All phases and neighborhoods within the
Northside Crossing Zoning District shall be subject to the definitions,
standards, requirements and processes found within this chapter and the
standards found within the Master Development Plan and Design Book with the
following standards:
      1.   Shopping center identification signs shall be designed with similar
materials and architectural character as the buildings within the shopping
center so as to provide a cohesive appearance.
      2.   A master sign plan that provides for consistent color, placement,
materials and design of all signs within the shopping center shall be submitted
and approved together with the application for the shopping center
identification sign.
      3.   Water features, masonry, and/or landscaping should be incorporated
into the design to create visual interest.
      4.   Signs may be indirectly lit or have internally illuminated channel
letters. Internally illuminated plastic, or other similar material, faced box
signs are not allowed.
      5.   Maximum height of shopping center identification sign is thirty feet
(30') including its base, measured from the adjacent ground level. Signs of
heights greater than thirty feet (30') may be conditionally permitted by the
City after considering the recommendation of the community builder, homeowners'
association, and/or Architectural Control Committee and after considering the
criteria for conditional use permits in this title.
   B.   Neighborhood Identification Signs: Signs identifying each neighborhood
within the MDP shall be installed at the beginning and end of each
neighborhood. (Ord. 801, 2019)
18.35.090: LANDSCAPING STANDARDS:
   A.   Applicability: The provisions of this section establish the landscape
standards for the Northside Crossing Zoning District, and shall apply to all
phases and neighborhoods within the district except for detached single family
residences, accessory dwelling units, attached residential dwellings in
buildings up to and including four (4) units, home occupations, temporary uses,
accessory uses, and clearing and grading associated with these uses. All phases
and neighborhoods, including those excepted above, are still subject to review
by the Design Review Committee.
   B.   Review Process:
      1.   A landscape plan designed or approved by either a landscape
architect licensed in the State of Idaho or Idaho State Master Gardener shall
be submitted to the Design Review Committee for review and approval.
      2.   The landscaping plans shall contain generally accepted
specifications and direction for planting and maintenance such as, but not
limited to, tree and shrub planting, staking, and soil preparation.
   C.   Landscape Design: Landscape design shall be consistent with the
approved master development plan/design book and guidelines of this chapter,
and be appropriate to the intended use of the site or building.
   D.   Landscape Materials: New landscape materials shall include species
native to the area or non-invasive naturalized species that have adapted to
those climate conditions in the following amounts: seventy five percent (75%)
groundcovers and shrubs, fifty percent (50%) trees. Sixty percent (60%) of
plant materials must be drought tolerant. In addition, landscaping may include
water features, rock, wood, walls, fences and other similar decorative
materials and artistic features. Playfields, playgrounds, and other similar
uses are exempt from the materials requirement.
   E.   Right-Of-Way And Associated Landscape Tracts:
      1.   One street tree per each thirty (30) lineal feet of street frontage
is required on all streets. In addition, trees can be staggered, and/or planted
in drifts or groves so long as the total number of required trees is provided.
Street trees must be a minimum caliper of one and one-half inches (1.5")
diameter at breast height.
      2.   Medians and planter strips shall be planted with landscape materials
per subsection D of this section. Trees, shrubs and groundcovers may be planted
in drifts, or as appropriate for stormwater quality/low impact development.
      3.   Landscaping within planter strips adjacent to parking spaces must
include a low growing plant palette with a variety of textures, such as, but
not limited to, low grasses, groundcovers and perennials.
      4.   Portions of park strips may be paved to accommodate street
furniture, leaving appropriately sized tree wells for street trees.
   F.   Parking Lot Landscaping: The purpose of parking lot landscaping is to
soften the visual appearance, soften views of parking lots, add shade and
reinforce safe pedestrian access to buildings and connecting sidewalks. Parking
lots with twelve (12) or more stalls shall include:
      1.   One tree for every ten (10) stalls located in islands or perimeter
landscaping;
      2.   Total of all interior landscaped areas shall be at least ten percent
(10%) of the total parking area (including parking, maneuvering, and loading
areas);
      3.   All landscape areas must be planted with landscape materials per
subsection D of this section, except where pedestrian access is provided.
Landscaping adjacent to parking spaces must include a low growing plant palette
with a variety of textures, such as, but not limited to, low grasses,
groundcovers and perennials;
      4.   Minimum width of all landscape areas is four feet (4'). A reduction
in width of up to two feet (2') may be allowed for interior landscape areas
(not adjacent to right-of-way) provided the total required area is provided;
and
      5.   A minimum six foot (6') wide perimeter of landscaping is required
adjacent to rights-of-way, except where vehicular ingress and egress is
proposed. The perimeter landscaping may include decorative walls, solid fences
or vegetation to obscure views of parking areas provided that any of the
aforementioned screening treatments are limited to a maximum height of four
feet (4').
   G.   Maintenance: To the extent necessary to remain, all landscaping shall
be watered, weeded, pruned, freed of pests, and replaced as necessary. (Ord.
801, 2019)
18.35.100: STREET STANDARDS:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to establish standards for the
design, configuration and performance of all public and private streets within
the Northside Crossing Zoning District in order to:
      1.   Ensure adequate access and connectivity throughout the project site;
      2.   Allow for flexibility in the design and location of streets; and
      3.   Establish a streetscape and street design that helps to define the
character and image of the Northside Crossing Zoning District.
   B.   Applicability: This section is applicable to all streets, alleys,
private drives and other vehicular accessways proposed within the zoning
district. Specific land uses, site conditions, visibility limitations and
critical areas may result in variations to the street types as permitted in
this section. Standards not defined in this section will be governed by the
typical City of Chubbuck standards.
   C.   Street Types: Exhibit "E" of the approved Master Development Plan shows
the approximate location of streets classified as arterials, collectors and
neighborhood streets. All other streets and access will be neighborhood
streets, private roads, shared drives, auto/pedestrian shared drives or alleys
and will be designed and located by the applicant during the platting and/or
development process associated with each parcel. These phases and neighborhoods
shall be designed to foster the development of a street grid system throughout
the project site.
   D.   Off-Site Connections Required: The Northside Crossing development shall
stub streets to the boundaries of abutting off- site property as generally
shown in the approved master development plan; the connection points on the
approved MDP Circulation Map are approximate. The actual design and location of
connection points will be determined at the preliminary plat stage of each
phase by the community builder and City using a collaborative process.
   E.   Review Criteria For Deviations: The requirements of this section may be
modified through a deviation request for cause during the design book and
preliminary platting phase. Street sections may be modified to best fit the
character of the proposed neighborhood and respond to natural site features.
Modifications to street sections related to on-street parking, bicycle lanes,
planter strips and/or sidewalks must meet the following guidelines as
applicable:
      1.   On-street parking is required to the extent necessary to satisfy
guest parking requirement.
      2.   Bicycle lanes are only required to be included in street sections
that are classified higher than a neighborhood street. Bicycle lanes may be
eliminated if an adequate off-street trail facility is provided as a
replacement.
      3.   A sidewalk may be eliminated if a separated trail section is
provided as a replacement. For example, where a paved multi-use trail is
provided along the road (it may be separated), the sidewalk may be eliminated
on one or both sides.
   F.   Street Sections: As authorized by the master development plan approval,
street sections for all street types within the district shall be followed.
These street sections are typical and may vary subject to approval by the
Public Works Director to accommodate specific site and design conditions.
Street sections may incorporate cross-slopes, crowns, inverts, and/or super
elevation to accommodate low impact development or other design features.
   G.   Tyhee Road: The design of Tyhee Road, as proposed to realign through
the district, will extend from the Union Pacific Railroad to Hiline Road and
will be designed to create an intersection with its extension being built by
the community builder of the Creative Community-Harvest Springs developer. The
community builder may dedicate and plan a one hundred foot (100') wide right-
of-way to be dedicated since the right-of-way will contain a separated multi-
use path and five (5) lanes. (Ord. 801, 2019)
18.35.110: PARKS AND OPEN SPACE:
   A.   Parks: The community builder is responsible for the design and
construction of the parks. The actual location and boundaries of parks may vary
but will be defined through the platting stage.
   B.   Sensitive Areas And Buffers: Sensitive areas and buffers are the steep
slopes (slopes above 35 percent grade), lowlands, and dry-stream beds. An
effort shall be made to preserve and protect and, in many cases, leave natural,
sensitive areas and buffers. Trails, crossings, encroachments, and improvements
may be allowed within sensitive areas consistent with a low impact development
effort. These areas may be dedicated to the City as open space at the time of
phase platting.
   C.   Non-Sensitive Open Space: Open space outside of sensitive areas and
buffers includes, but is not limited to, the plaza, community parks, trails,
neighborhood and pocket parks, natural areas and stormwater ponds and
infiltration facilities. Additional parks may be provided as individual phases
are developed.
   D.   Stormwater Ponds And Facilities: Stormwater ponds and facilities shall
be designed as either passive or active open space when practical. Passive open
space facilities consisting of stormwater ponds shall be designed to appear as
a natural wetland or pond. Vegetation shall consist of no less than seventy
percent (70%) native plant material typically found in and around Bannock
County. Any fencing required shall be designed and located such that it does
not detract from the natural character of the facility. If natural landscaping
is intended to provide a long- term barrier to human intrusion, temporary
fencing may be permitted until such time as the landscaping has matured to the
point of providing the barrier.
   E.   Trail Plan: The community builder is responsible for the design and
construction of the trails shown on the plan with approval by the City. The
actual location of trails may vary and will be defined through the platting
process. Necessary trail construction will be completed within the boundaries
of each phase as constructed. Where feasible, trail construction should avoid
dead ends and incomplete segments.
   F.   Trail Standards: Trails will be built to the standards as described in
subsection
18.21.050A3 of this title. The following amenities may be included within trail
corridors subject to mutual agreement between the community builder and the
City: rest stops, sculpture and other art, pedestrian lighting, exercise
stations, picnic tables, interpretive areas, pocket parks/tot lots, drinking
fountains, restrooms, and covered sheds, and other similar amenities.
   G.   Park, Open Space, And Deviations From Plan: All park, recreation
facility, open space and trail standards, cross sections and locations are
general documents and may be modified through the deviation process established
by section
18.35.120 of this chapter. (Ord. 801, 2019)
18.35.120: PLAN AND AGREEMENT CHANGES; ADMINISTRATION:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to provide a process and
criteria to interpret, modify and/or amend the standards, processes,
conditions, or provisions contained within the MDP approval as codified in this
chapter and in agreements with the community builder. In addition, recognizing
that not all potential issues can be anticipated over the life of this
development, it is the intent of this chapter to allow for flexibility so that
Northside Crossing Zoning District can adapt to new information, changes in the
market, and technological advances over time.
   B.   Interpretations: Any dispute over the meaning of this chapter shall be
resolved first by an interpretation from the Community Services Director. The
Community Services Director shall issue a written interpretation within ten
(10) business days of receiving a written request for clarification. The City
Community Services Director’s interpretation may be appealed to the City
Council. The City Council shall hold a meeting on the interpretation appeal at
the next available regular meeting following the date upon which the request
for an appeal to the City Council is delivered to the Community Services
Director. At the appeal, both the Community Services Director and appellant
shall be entitled to voice testimony to the Council for consideration. The
community builder or community builder transferee shall exhaust its remedies as
set forth herein prior to exercising other remedies.
   C.   Appeal Of Administrative Decisions To City Council: Final
administrative decisions of this chapter may be appealed to the City Council.
   D.   Deviations From The Master Development Plan Approval: An amendment to
the Northside Crossing Master Development Plan as approved may be requested by
the community builder or community builder transferee. Minor deviations meeting
the criteria as described below may be approved administratively by the
Community Services Director; major deviations not meeting the criteria for a
minor deviation shall require the same review and approval process as a Zoning
Ordinance amendment as outlined in Idaho Code 67-6511.
   E.   Minor Deviation: A deviation to the approved master development plan
shall be considered minor if the change satisfies all of the following
criteria:
      1.   The deviation will not increase the total number of dwelling units
in the development above the maximum number set forth in the approved master
development plan, or reduce the minimum number by more than fifteen percent
(15%);
      2.   The deviation will not increase the total floor area of
nonresidential uses by more than ten percent (10%);
      3.   The deviation will not decrease the minimum, or increase the maximum
density for residential areas of the development beyond approved density ranges
approved;
      4.   The deviation will not decrease the approved amount of open space or
recreation space;
      5.   The deviation will not increase any adverse environmental impact,
provided that additional environmental review may be required to determine
whether such change is likely to occur;
      6.   The deviation will not adversely impact the project’s fiscal
projections to the detriment of the City;
      7.   The deviation will not significantly impact the overall design of
the approved master development plan;
      8.   The deviation will not significantly alter the size or location of
any designated open space resulting in a lowered level of service; and
      9.   The requested amendment is a land use category change that does not
increase the land use category of a development parcel immediately adjacent to
the perimeter of the project site.
   F.   Project And Improvement Phasing: The concept master phasing plan
approved through the Master Development Plan approval process is intended to be
a general guide and to reflect current conditions. It is not the intent of the
City to restrict other phasing opportunities which correspond to changes in
market conditions and technological advances nor to restrict infrastructure and
timing of the development which may differ from the approved concept.
   G.   Responsibility Of The Community Builder To Ensure Compliance With This
Chapter: The community builder shall designate through its controlling
community documents, a Community Review Board who, prior to any applications
being accepted by the City for review and approval, shall perform a review of
the petition materials to ensure that the requirements and intent and purpose
of this zone are upheld and shall then provide a letter to the City to
accompany the application stating their findings and providing a
recommendation. The City will not enforce standards of the development
contained within the development’s internal codes, covenants, and restrictions
or other related controlling documents.
   H.   Deviations From Standards Of This Chapter: In instances where the
community builder or interested party seeks a deviation from the City from
regular standards of this Code as may be authorized in this chapter (e.g.,
height, building and parking lot layouts, fencing and screening, etc.), and in
addition to any of the criteria related to the subject matter, the City shall
consider the following in making a decision:
      1.   Findings and recommendation of the community builder, homeowners’
association, and/or the Architectural Control Committee.
      2.   Whether the proposed deviation would conflict with the stated intent
and purposes of this chapter and the adopted master development plan and design
book. (Ord. 801, 2019: Ord. 845 § 15, 2022)
