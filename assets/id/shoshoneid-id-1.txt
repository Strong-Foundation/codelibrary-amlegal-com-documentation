council, the hearing shall, if feasible, be placed on the agenda of the next
regularly scheduled city council meeting. The decision of the city council

CHAPTER 10.24
SEAT BELT USE POLICY
SECTION:
10.24.010: Policy
10.24.020: Procedure
10.24.010: POLICY:
To assure safety of all personnel, safety belts shall be worn by drivers and
passengers in all vehicles owned, leased or rented by the departments at all
times. This also applies to the operation of privately owned or other vehicles,
if used on duty.
Research shows the use of safety belts has a significant effect in reducing the
number of deaths and the severity of injury resulting from traffic crashes. A
law enforcement officer's or fireman's chance of being involved in a motor
vehicle crash is two (2) to ten (10) times greater than that of the general
public. The use of safety restraints reduces this risk and assists officers in
maintaining proper control of their vehicles in pursuit and/or emergency high
speed operations. (Ord. 459, 1998)
10.24.020: PROCEDURE:
   A.   Department personnel shall use the safety belts installed by the
vehicle manufacturer properly adjusted and securely fastened when operating or
riding in any vehicle so equipped if used while on duty.
   B.   Lap belts shall be properly secured in those vehicles equipped with
automatic safety belt systems that require the lap portion of the belt be
manually secured.
   C.   The driver of the vehicle is responsible for ensuring compliance by all
occupants of the vehicle they are operating. Approved child safety restraints
shall be used for all children of age, size or weight for which such restraints
are prescribed by law.
   D.   No person shall operate a departmental vehicle in which any safety belt
in the driver's seating position is inoperable. No person shall be transported
in a seating position in which the safety restoring is inoperable.
   E.   No person shall modify, remove, deactivate or otherwise tamper with the
vehicle safety belts except for vehicle maintenance and repair and not without
the express authorization of the fire chief or the police chief.
   F.   Personnel who discover an inoperable restraint system shall report the
defect to the appropriate supervisor. Prompt action will be taken to replace or
repair the system.
   G.   Any person(s) under arrest and being transported in department vehicle
(s) are required to be secured in the vehicle by a safety belt in all seating
positions for which safety belts are provided by the vehicle manufacturer.
Caution: Prisoners that are handcuffed in front have the ability to release the
handcuffs using the safety restraint's latch plate.
   H.   An officer operating in an undercover capacity may be exempt only if
the officer believes use of the safety belt will compromise their identity.
   I.   When arriving at an emergency call or making a vehicle traffic stop,
the operator may remove the safety restraint just prior to stopping for quick
exit. Caution should be exercised in ensuring that the violator is in fact
going to stop. This prevents becoming involved in a pursuit without the use of
a safety belt. (Ord. 459, 1998)

These rules and regulations and rates are to be part of the contract between
the city and every individual, firm, or corporation using or applying for the
use of sewer service within the area to be served by the city, and every
individual, firm, or corporation agrees in making applications for sewer
service to be bound thereby. (Ord. 310, 1971)
13.08.020: RULES ADOPTED:
The rules and regulations and rates specified in this chapter are adopted by
the city council as of August 3, 1971, and in effect as of January 1, 1972, and
are promulgated in compliance and in conformance with this chapter and the
statutes of the state. (Ord. 310, 1971)
13.08.030: SYSTEM DESIGNATED:
   A.   The city owns and operates a municipal sewer system and lagoon type
sewage treatment plants composed of:

lines from property lines discharging into collector sewer pipelines;
      2.   Concrete pipe and cement-asbestos collector sewer lines discharging
into;
      3.   Concrete or reinforced concrete pipe trunk sewer lines;
all provided with standard precast or cast in place concrete manholes using
cast iron rings and covers. Sewer trunk lines will discharge into aerated
lagoon type treatment facility with a design capacity of two thousand (2,000)
population equivalent.
   B.   Sewer enters the lagoons through an eight inch (8") pressure line.
   C.   The lagoons are interconnected and will be operated in series and
require very little maintenance or operation labor or cost other than
inspection, mowing weeds along the dikes, fence repair, and electric power for
aerators.
   D.   Sewer lines are laid mostly on self-cleaning grades with sewage lift
stations placed where necessary to provide sewage facilities for all homes and
businesses where feasible.
   E.   Monthly sewer service charges are based on the volume of sewage
actually discharged into the sewers, as estimated in relation to other metered

will be based on $0.23 a square foot in addition to setup fees.
Basis for square feet is to figure construction rate for determining fee
(example: 24 x 60 = 1,440 square feet x $63.00 = $90,720.00 value of home
which would result in a fee of $824.75 plus $20.00 permit fee for a total of
$844.75, not including refundable deposit).

15.04.060: BUILDING PERMIT; APPROVAL:
   A.   All applications for a building permit under this chapter shall be
examined by the mayor and/or city council who shall, during the course of the
examination, confer with other public officials that they deem may be
interested in the proposed building or building site. The mayor and/or council
shall review all building permit applications for new construction or
alterations to existing structures to determine whether proposed building sites
will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a
location that has a flood hazard, any proposed new construction or substantial
improvement must:
      1.   Be designed or modified and anchored to prevent flotation, collapse,
or lateral movement of the structure;
      2.   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage; and
      3.   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
   B.   The mayor and/or council shall review all subdivision proposals and
other proposed new developments to assure that:
      1.   All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood
damage;
      2.   All public utilities and facilities are located and constructed to
minimize or eliminate flood damage; and
      3.   Adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood
hazards.
   C.   After examination of the application and after determining that the
requested information is contained on the application, the permit may be
granted; provided, however, if granting application will violate any city
ordinance or state law it shall be denied. (Ord. 335 § 4, 1977)
15.04.070: VESTED RIGHT PROHIBITED:
No person, firm, partnership, or corporation shall acquire any vested right to
construct, alter, or maintain any building by virtue of money spent or work
done prior to obtaining a building permit required by the terms of this
chapter. (Ord. 335 § 4, 1977)

15.12.010: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND OBJECTIVES:
   A.   Statutory Authority: The Legislature of the State of Idaho, pursuant to
Idaho Code sections 46-1020, 46-1023, and 46-1024, authorizes local governments
to adopt floodplain management ordinances that identify floodplains and minimum
floodplain development standards to minimize flood hazards and protect human
life, health, and property. Therefore, the City Council of the City of
Shoshone, Idaho does hereby ordain as follows.
   B.   Findings Of Fact:
      1.   The flood hazard areas of the City of Shoshone are subject to
periodic inundation that results in:
         a.   Loss of life and property;
         b.   Health and safety hazards;
         c.   Disruption of commerce and governmental services;
         d.   Extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and
protection; and
         e.   Impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety, and general welfare.
      2.   These flood losses are caused by structures in flood hazard areas,
which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from
flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains
causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
      3.   Local government units have the primary responsibility for planning,
adopting, and enforcing land use regulations to accomplish proper floodplain
management.
   C.   Statement Of Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to promote public
health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses
due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      1.   Protect human life, health, and property;
      2.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
purification and sewage treatment plants, water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in floodplains;
      3.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas;
      4.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      5.   Minimize the need for rescue and emergency services associated with
flooding, generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      6.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      7.   Ensure potential buyers are notified the property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
      8.   Ensure those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
   D.   Objectives And Methods Of Reducing Flood Losses: In order to accomplish
its purpose, this chapter includes methods and provisions to:
      1.   Require that development which is vulnerable to floods, including
structures and facilities necessary for the general health, safety, and welfare
of citizens, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      2.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights,
velocities, or erosion;
      3.   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage or erosion;
      4.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert flood waters or that may increase flood hazards to other
lands;
      5.   Preserve and restore natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which carry and store flood waters. (Ord. 553,

15.12.020: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall
be interpreted according to the meaning they have in common usage and to give
this chapter its most reasonable application.
ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE): A structure on the same lot or
parcel as a principal structure, the use of which is incidental and subordinate
to the principal structure.
ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING BUILDING): An extension or increase in the floor area
or height of a building or structure.
APPEAL: A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's interpretation
of provisions of this chapter or request for a variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO, AH, AR/AO, or AR/AH Zone on a
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent (1%) or greater
annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one foot (1') to three feet
(3') where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding
is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: See definition of special flood hazard area
(SFHA).
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): A determination by the Federal Insurance
Administrator of the water surface elevations of the base flood, that is, the
flood level that has a one percent or greater chance of occurrence in any given
year. When the BFE has not been provided in a special flood hazard area, it may
be obtained from engineering studies available from a Federal, State, or other
source using FEMA-approved engineering methodologies. This elevation, when
combined with the freeboard, establishes the flood protection elevation.
BASEMENT: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
BUILDING: See definition of structure.
CRITICAL FACILITIES: Facilities that are vital to flood response activities or
critical to the health and safety of the public before, during, and after a
flood, such as a hospital, emergency operations center, electric substation,
police station, fire station, nursing home, school, vehicle and equipment
storage facility, or shelter; and facilities that, if flooded, would make the
flood problem and its impacts much worse, such as a hazardous materials
facility, power generation facility, water utility, or wastewater treatment
plant.
DATUM: The vertical datum is a base measurement point (or set of points) from
which all elevations are determined. Historically, that common set of points
was the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD29). The vertical datum
currently adopted by the Federal government as a basis for measuring heights is
the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88).
DEVELOPMENT: Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of
equipment or materials.
DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY: Any activity defined as development which will
necessitate a floodplain development permit; such as: the construction of
buildings, structures, or accessory structures; additions or substantial
improvements to existing structures; bulkheads, retaining walls, piers, and
pools; the placement of mobile homes; or the deposition or extraction of
materials; the construction or elevation of dikes, berms and levees.
DIGITAL FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (DFIRM): The digital official map of a
community, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, on which both the
special flood hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the
community are delineated.
ELEVATED BUILDING: For insurance purposes, a non-basement building which has
its lowest elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear
walls, posts, piers, pilings, or columns.
ELEVATION CERTIFICATE: The Elevation Certificate is an important administrative
tool of the NFIP. It is used to determine the proper flood insurance premium
rate; it is used to document elevation information necessary to ensure
compliance with community floodplain management regulations; and it may be used
to support a request for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) or Letter of Map
Revision Based On Fill (LOMR-F).
ENCLOSURE: An area enclosed by solid walls below the BFE/FPE or an area formed
when any space below the BFE/FPE is enclosed on all sides by walls or
partitions. Insect screening or open wood lattice used to surround space below
the BFE/RFPE is not considered an enclosure.
ENCROACHMENT: The advance or infringement of uses, fill, excavation, buildings,
structures, or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the
flow capacity of a floodplain.
EXISTING CONSTRUCTION: For the purposes of determining rates, structures for
which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the
FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing
construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures".
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR MANUFACTURED HOME SUBDIVISION: A
manufactured home park or subdivision where the construction of facilities for
servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed
(including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of
streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed
before the effective date of the original floodplain management regulations
adopted by the community, June 19, 1985.
EXISTING STRUCTURES: See definition of existing construction.
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The preparation
of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufacturing homes are to be affixed (including the installation of
utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the
pouring of concrete pads).
FLOOD ELEVATION DETERMINATION: See definition of base flood elevation (BFE).
FLOOD ELEVATION STUDY: See definition of Flood Insurance Study (FIS).
FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM): An official map of a community, issued by the
Federal Insurance Administrator, where the boundaries of the flood, mudslide
(i.e., mudflow) related erosion areas having special hazards have been
designated as Zones A, M, and/or E.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): An official map of a community, on which the
Federal Insurance Administrator has delineated both the special hazard areas
and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been
made available digitally is called a Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM).
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS): An examination, evaluation, and determination of
flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations; or
an examination, evaluation and determination of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and/or
flood-related erosion hazards.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      1.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
      2.    The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
      3.    Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by flooding
as defined in subsection A2 of this definition and are akin to a river of
liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when
earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the
current.
   B.    The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other
body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents
of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an
unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe
storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an
abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event
which results in flooding as defined in subsection A1 of this definition.
FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (FPE): The base flood elevation plus the freeboard.
   A.    In "special flood hazard areas" where base flood elevations (BFEs)
have been determined, this elevation shall be the BFE plus two feet (2') of
freeboard; and
   B.    In "special flood hazard areas" where no BFE has been established,
this elevation shall be at least two feet (2') above the highest adjacent
grade.
FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM: Those physical structural works for which funds have
been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed
specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the area
within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the
depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes dams,
reservoirs, levees, or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those
constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.
FLOOD ZONE: A geographical area shown on a Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) or
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) that reflects the severity or type of flooding
in the area.
FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR: The individual appointed to administer and enforce
the floodplain management regulations.
FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT PERMIT: Any type of permit that is required in
conformance with the provisions of this chapter, prior to the commencement of
any development activity.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to
emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, and floodplain management
regulations.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS: Zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations,
Building Codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a
floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance, and erosion control ordinance), and
other applications of police power. The term describes such State or local
regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the
purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.
FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD-PRONE AREA: Any land area susceptible to being inundated by
water from any source (see definition of "flooding").
FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation.
FREEBOARD: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for
the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the
many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the
height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as
wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effects of urbanization in a watershed. The base flood elevation
(BFE) plus the freeboard establishes the flood protection elevation (FPE).
Freeboard shall be two feet (2').
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE: A facility that cannot be used for its intended
purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water, such
as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo
or passengers, shipbuilding, or ship repair facilities. The term does not
include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE (HAG): The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed walls of a structure.
Refer to the FEMA Elevation Certificate for HAG related to building elevation
information.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE: A structure that is:
   A.    Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the National Register;
   B.    Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered Historic
District or to a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify
as a registered Historic District;
   C.    Individually listed on a State Inventory of Historic Places and
determined as eligible by states with historic preservation programs which have
been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or
   D.    Individually listed on a Local Inventory of Historic Places and
determined as eligible by communities with historic preservation programs that
have been certified either:
      1.    By an approved State program as determined by the Secretary of the
Interior, or
      2.    Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC): A general term used to refer to the several types
of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by letter.
They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision (LOMR), and
Letter of Map Revision Based On Fill (LOMR-F).
   Conditional Letter Of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and comment as
to whether a proposed flood protection project or other project complies with
the minimum NFIP requirements for such projects with respect to delineation of
special flood hazard areas. A CLOMR does not revise the effective Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or Flood Insurance Study (FIS). Upon submission and
approval of certified as-built documentation, a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)
may be issued by FEMA to revise the effective FIRM. Building permits and/or
flood development permits cannot be issued based on a CLOMR, because a CLOMR
does not change the NFIP map.
   Letter Of Map Amendment (LOMA): An official amendment, by letter, to an
effective National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) map. A LOMA establishes a
property's location in relation to the special flood hazard area (SFHA). LOMAs
are usually issued because a property has been inadvertently mapped as being in
the floodplain but is actually on natural high ground above the base flood
elevation.
   Letter Of Map Revision Based On Fill (LOMR-F):   FEMA's modification of the
special flood hazard area (SFHA) shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
based on the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway. The
LOMR-F does not change the FIRM, FBFM, or FIS report.
   Letter Of Map Revision (LOMR):   FEMA's modification to an effective Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or a Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM) or both.
LOMRs are generally based on the implementation of physical measures that
affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and
thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the
effective base flood elevations (BFEs), or the special flood hazard area
(SFHA). The LOMR officially revises the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or
Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM), and sometimes the Flood Insurance Study
(FIS) report, and when appropriate, includes a description of the
modifications. The LOMR is generally accompanied by an annotated copy of the
affected portions of the FIRM, FBFM, or FIS report.
LEVEE: A man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed according to sound engineering practices, to contain, control, or
divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.
LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees,
and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE (LAG): The lowest point of the ground level next to the
structure. Refer to the FEMA Elevation Certificate for LAG related to building
elevation information.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirements of 44 CFR section 60.3 and this
chapter.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, built on
a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured
home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land
divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
MARKET VALUE: The building value, not including the land value and that of any
accessory structures or other improvements on the lot. Market value may be
established by independent certified appraisal; replacement cost depreciated
for age of building and quality of construction (actual cash value); or
adjusted tax assessed values.
MEAN SEA LEVEL: For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP),
the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum (such as
North America Vertical Datum of 1988 - NAVD88) to which base flood elevations
(BFEs) shown on a community's FIRM are referenced.
MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW): Describes a condition where there is a river, flow,
or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside usually as a result of a dual
condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on
the ground preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. A
mudslide (i.e., mudflow) may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a landslide
is in progress, and will be recognized as such by the Administrator only if the
mudflow, and not the landslide, is the proximate cause of damage that occurs.
MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) AREA MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program
of corrective and preventive measures for reducing mudslide (i.e., mudflow)
damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, mudslide
control works, and floodplain management regulations.
MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) PRONE AREA: An area with land surfaces and slopes of
unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate indicate a
potential for mudflow.
NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal program created
by Congress to mitigate future flood losses nationwide through sound,
community-enforced building and zoning ordinances and to provide access to
affordable, Federally backed flood insurance protection for property owners.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: For floodplain management purposes, a structure for which the
start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain
management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
Any construction started after June 19, 1985 and before the effective start
date of this chapter is subject to the ordinance in effect at the time the
permit was issued, provided the start of construction was within one hundred
eighty (180) days of permit issuance.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A place where the construction of
facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be
affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction
of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is
completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations
adopted by a community June 19, 1985.
POST-FIRM: Construction or other development for which the "start of
construction" occurred on or after the effective date of the initial Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
PRE-FIRM: Construction or other development for which the "start of
construction" occurred before June 19, 1985, the effective date of the initial
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle that is:
   A.    Built on a single chassis, and
   B.    Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection, and
   C.    Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towed by a light duty
truck, and
   D.    Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
REGULATORY FLOODWAY: See definition of floodway.
REMEDY A VIOLATION: To bring the structure or other development into compliance
with State or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not
possible, to reduce the impacts of its non-compliance. Ways that impacts may be
reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from
flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of this chapter or
otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing Federal financial
exposure with regard to the structure or other development.
REPETITIVE LOSS STRUCTURE: An NFIP-insured structure that has had at least two
(2) paid flood losses of more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) each in any
10-year period since 1978.
RIVERINE: Relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including
tributaries), stream, brook, etc.
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA): The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
For purposes of these regulations, the term "special flood hazard area" is
synonymous in meaning with the phrase "area of special flood hazard".
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was
within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means
either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site,
such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of its market value before the damage occurred. See
definition of "substantial improvement". Substantial damage also means flood-
related damage sustained by a structure on two (2) separate occasions during a
10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood
event, on the average, equals or exceeds twenty five percent (25%) of the
market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction"
of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred
"substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include either:
   A.    Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local Health, Sanitary, or Safety Code specifications
which have been identified by the local Code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
   B.    Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure" and the alteration is approved by variance issued pursuant to this
chapter.
TECHNICAL BULLETINS AND TECHNICAL FACT SHEETS: FEMA publications that provide
guidance concerning the building performance standards of the NFIP, which are
contained in title 44 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations section 60.3. The
bulletins and fact sheets are intended for use primarily by State and local
officials responsible for interpreting and enforcing NFIP regulations and by
members of the development community, such as design professionals and
builders. New bulletins, as well as updates of existing bulletins, are issued
periodically as needed. The bulletins do not create regulations. Rather they
provide specific guidance for complying with the minimum requirements of
existing NFIP regulations.
It should be noted that Technical Bulletins and Technical Fact Sheets provide
guidance on the minimum requirements of the NFIP regulations. State or
community requirements that exceed those of the NFIP take precedence. Design
professionals should contact the community officials to determine whether more
restrictive State or local regulations apply to the building or site in
question. All applicable standards of the State or local Building Code must
also be met for any building in a flood hazard area.
TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED: Having the temperature regulated by a heating and/or
cooling system, built-in or appliance.
VARIANCE: A grant of relief by the Governing Body from a requirement of this
chapter.
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the Finished Construction Elevation Certificate,
other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR
section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is
presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of
1988 (or other specified datum), of floods of various magnitudes and
frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.
WATERCOURSE: A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel, or other topographic
feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse
includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may
occur. (Ord. 553, 2017)
15.12.030: GENERAL PROVISIONS:

      3.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State Statutes.
   G.   Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability: The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This
chapter does not imply that land outside the special flood hazard areas or uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This
chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of Shoshone or by
any officer or employee thereof for flood damages that result from reliance on
this chapter or an administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
   H.   Penalties For Violation: No structure or land shall hereafter be
located, extended, converted, or altered unless in full compliance with the

from taking such other lawful actions as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation. (Ord. 553, 2017)
15.12.040: ADMINISTRATION:
   A.   Designation Of Floodplain Administrator: The Planning and Zoning
Commission, hereinafter referred to as the "Floodplain Administrator", is
hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this chapter.
   B.   Duties And Responsibilities Of The Floodplain Administrator: The
Floodplain Administrator shall perform, but not be limited to, the following
duties:
      1.   Review all floodplain development applications and issue permits for
all proposed development within special flood hazard areas to assure that the
requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
      2.   Review all proposed development within special flood hazard areas to
assure that all necessary local, State, and Federal permits have been received,
including section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act amendments of
1972, 33 USC 1334.
      3.   Notify adjacent communities and the Idaho Department of Water
Resources State Coordinator for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse and submit evidence of
such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
      4.   Assure that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated
portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is maintained.
      5.   Prevent encroachments into floodways and flood fringe areas unless
the certification and flood hazard reduction provisions of subsection
15.12.050E of this chapter are met.
      6.   Obtain actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the
lowest floor (including basement) and all attendant utilities of all new and
substantially improved structures, in accordance with the provisions of
subsection C3 of this section.
      7.   Obtain actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which all
new and substantially improved structures and utilities have been floodproofed,
in accordance with the provisions of subsection C3 of this section.
      8.   Obtain actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of all
public utilities in accordance with the provisions of subsection C3 of this
section.
      9.   When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, obtain
certifications from a registered professional engineer or architect in
accordance with the provisions of subsection C3 of this section and subsection
15.12.050B2 of this chapter.
      10.   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of
boundaries of the special flood hazard areas, floodways, or flood fringe areas
(for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary
and actual field conditions), make the necessary interpretation. The person
contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to appeal the interpretation as provided in this section.
      11.   When base flood elevation (BFE) data has not been provided in
accordance with the provisions of subsection
15.12.030B of this chapter, obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any BFE
data, along with floodway data or flood fringe area data available from a
Federal, State, or other source, including data developed pursuant to
subsection
15.12.050C2 of this chapter, in order to administer the provisions of this
chapter.
      12.   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is provided but no floodway or
flood fringe area data has been provided in accordance with the provisions of
subsection
15.12.030B of this chapter, obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any floodway
data or flood fringe area data available from a Federal, State, or other source
in order to administer the provisions of this chapter.
      13.   When the lowest floor and the lowest adjacent grade of a structure
or the lowest ground elevation of a parcel in a special flood hazard area
(SFHA) is above the base flood elevation (BFE), advise the property owner of
the option to apply for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from FEMA. Maintain a
copy of the LOMA issued by FEMA in the floodplain development permit file.
      14.   Permanently maintain all records that pertain to the administration
of this chapter and make these records available for public inspection,
recognizing that such information may be subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as
amended.
      15.   Make on-site inspections of work in progress. As the work pursuant
to a floodplain development permit progresses, the Floodplain Administrator
shall make as many inspections of the work as may be necessary to ensure that
the work is being done according to the provisions of the local ordinance and
the terms of the permit. In exercising this power, the Floodplain Administrator
has a right, upon presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises
within the jurisdiction of the community at any reasonable hour for the
purposes of inspection or other enforcement action.
      16.   Issue stop-work orders as required. Whenever a building or part
thereof is being constructed, reconstructed, altered, or repaired in violation
of this chapter, the Floodplain Administrator may order the work to be
immediately stopped. The stop-work order shall be in writing and directed to
the person doing or in charge of the work. The stop-work order shall state the
specific work to be stopped, the specific reason(s) for the stoppage, and the
condition(s) under which the work may be resumed. Violation of a stop-work
order constitutes a misdemeanor.
      17.   Revoke floodplain development permits as required. The Floodplain
Administrator may revoke and require the return of the floodplain development
permit by notifying the permit holder in writing stating the reason(s) for the
revocation. Permits shall be revoked for any substantial departure from the
approved application, plans, and specifications; for refusal or failure to
comply with the requirements of State or local laws; or for false statements or
misrepresentations made in securing the permit. Any floodplain development

addressing each of the above factors in subsections E3a through E3k of this
section with their application for a variance.
      5.   Conditions: Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the
purposes of this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes and
objectives of this chapter.
      6.   Variance Granted: Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall
be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood
elevation (BFE) and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and
that such construction below the BFE increases risks to life and property, and
that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the BFE will
result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty five dollars
($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage. Such
notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions,
including justification for their issuance.
      7.   Records: The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of
all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management

provided by FEMA, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of
subsection A of this section, shall apply:
      The BFE used in determining the flood protection elevation (FPE) shall be
determined based on the following criteria:
      1.   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is available from other
sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas
shall also comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter and shall be
elevated or floodproofed in accordance with standards in subsections A and B of
this section.
      2.   When floodway or flood fringe data is available from a Federal,
State, or other source, all new construction and substantial improvements
within floodway and flood fringe areas shall also comply with the requirements
of subsections B and E of this section.
      3.   All subdivision, manufactured home park, and other development
proposals shall provide base flood elevation (BFE) data if development is
greater than five (5) acres or has more than fifty (50) lots/manufactured home
sites. Such base flood elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by reference in
accordance with subsection 15.12.030B of this chapter and utilized in
implementing this chapter.
(The applicant/developer shall submit an application for a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision (CLOMR) prior to preliminary plat approval and have obtained a
Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) prior to any building permits for structures
being issued. See FEMA 480 and/or FEMA 265 for further information.)
      4.   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available from a
Federal, State, or other source as outlined above, the lowest floor shall be
elevated or floodproofed (non-residential) to two feet (2.0') above the highest
adjacent grade (HAG) at the building site or to the flood protection elevation
(FPE) whichever is higher, as defined in section 15.12.020 of this chapter. All
other applicable provisions of subsection B of this section shall also apply.
   D.   Standards For Riverine Floodplains With Base Flood Elevations But
Without Established Floodways Or Flood Fringe Areas: Along rivers and streams
where base flood elevation (BFE) data is provided by FEMA or is available from
another source but neither floodway nor flood fringe areas are identified for a
special flood hazard area on the FIRM or in the FIS report, the following
requirements shall apply to all development within such areas:
      1.   Standards of subsections A and B of this section; and
      2.   Until a regulatory floodway or flood fringe area is designated, no
encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or
other development shall be permitted unless certification with supporting
technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating
that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood at any point within the community.
   E.   Standards For Floodways And Flood Fringe Areas: Areas designated as
floodways or flood fringe areas are located within the special flood hazard
areas established in subsection
15.12.030B of this chapter. The floodways and flood fringe areas are extremely
hazardous areas due to the velocity of floodwaters that have erosion potential
and carry debris and potential projectiles. The following provisions, in
addition to standards outlined in subsections A and B of this section, shall
apply to all development within such areas:
      1.   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other developments shall be permitted unless:
         a.   It is demonstrated that the proposed encroachment would not
result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice and presented to the Floodplain Administrator
prior to issuance of floodplain development permit; or
         b.   A Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) has been approved by
FEMA. A Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) must also be obtained within six (6)
months of completion of the proposed encroachment.
      2.   If subsection E1 of this section is satisfied, all development shall
comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this chapter.
      3.   Manufactured homes may be permitted provided the following
provisions are met:
         a.   The anchoring and the elevation standards of subsection B3 of
this section; and
         b.   The encroachment standards of subsection E1 of this section.
   F.   Standards For Areas Of Shallow Flooding (Zone AO, AH, AR/AO, Or AR/AH):
Located within the special flood hazard areas established in subsection
15.12.030B of this chapter, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas.
These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one
foot (1') to three feet (3') where a clearly defined channel does not exist and
where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate. In addition to
subsections A and B of this section, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall meet the following requirements:
      1.   The lowest floor shall be elevated at least as high as the depth
number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), in feet, plus a
freeboard of two feet (2'), above the highest adjacent grade; or at least four
feet (4') above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
      2.   Non-residential structures may, in lieu of elevation, be
floodproofed to the same level as required in subsection F1 of this section so
that the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities,
below that level shall be watertight with walls substantially impermeable to
the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
Certification is required in accordance with subsection
15.12.040C3 of this chapter and subsection B2 of this section.
      3.   Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around structures on
slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. (Ord.

of this title the zoning districts have been formulated to realize the general
purposes as set forth in this title. In addition, the specific purpose of each
zoning district shall be as stated. (Ord. 573, 2024)
16.12.020: ZONING DISTRICTS:
   A.   Agricultural District (A): The purpose of the A district is to
recognize the existing agricultural uses on the land within the city and in the
city's area of impact and to preserve and protect this interest as long as it
is used substantially for agricultural purposes.
   B.   Central Business District (CB): The purpose of the CB district is to
accommodate and encourage further expansion and renewal in the historical core
business area of the community. A variety of business, public, quasi-public,
cultural, residential, and other related uses are encouraged in an effort to
provide the mix of activities necessary to establish a truly urban character.
   C.   Commercial District (C1) Or Light Commercial: The purpose of the C1
district is to encourage additional commercial development within the city. The
commercial activity allowed in this district is suited for locations along
highways where exposure to high volumes of traffic is desirable. This district
is not intended for residential purposes, and no developable residential
density is assigned within it. However, all development within the district
must be designed and constructed to operate compatibly in close proximity to
adjoining residential, commercial, or industrial uses.
   D.   Commercial District (C2) Or Heavy Commercial: The purpose of this
district is to encourage more intensive commercial development within the city.
The commercial activities allowed in this district typically do not require
exposure to high volumes of traffic. This district is not intended for
residential purposes, and no developable residential density is assigned within
it. However, all development within the district must be designed and
constructed to operate compatibly in close proximity to adjoining residential,
commercial, or industrial uses.
   E.   Manufacturing District (M1) Or Light Industrial: The purpose of the M1
district is to encourage the development of manufacturing and wholesale
business establishments which are clean, quiet and nearly free of hazardous or
objectionable elements such as noise, odor, dust, smoke or glare that are
operated entirely within enclosed structures and generate low levels of
industrial traffic. This district is not intended for residential purposes, and
no developable residential density is assigned within it. However, all
development within the district must be designed and constructed to operate
compatibly in close proximity to adjoining commercial or industrial uses.
   F.   Manufacturing District (M2) Or Heavy Industrial: The purpose of the M2
district is to encourage the development of manufacturing and wholesale
business establishments which are relatively clean and emit minimum levels of
hazardous or objectionable elements such as noise, odor, dust, smoke or glare,
that are operated within enclosed or unenclosed structures, and generate
moderate industrial traffic. This district is not intended for residential
purposes, and no developable residential density is assigned within it.
However, all development within the district must be designed and constructed
to operate compatibly in close proximity to adjoining commercial or industrial
uses.
   G.   Neighborhood Business District (NB): The purpose of the NB district is

uses. These areas can be publicly or privately developed and may be part of
public school playground and/or sports area. The park/recreation zone indicates
sites either under this use, or land to be developed as a park and/or
recreation facility.
      Because negative environmental impacts such as increased noise, unusually
bright lights, increased pedestrian traffic and vehicular traffic will likely
result from construction of additional facilities in the PR District, these
added restrictions are placed upon said construction:
      1.   All construction of buildings or other permanent structures in the
PR District is to be done using conditional use permits;
      2.   Conditional use permit(s) must be obtained from the City of Shoshone
prior to the commencement of construction;
      3.   All conditional use permit applications in the PR District must
include, as a minimum, an environmental checklist which addresses these
potential environmental impacts on the surrounding residential zones:
         a.   Pedestrian traffic;
         b.   Vehicular traffic;
         c.   Noise (City Code 8.20.060);
         d.   Ambient lighting;
         e.   Storm water runoff;
         f.   Solid waste and blowing trash control.
   I.   Residential District (R1): The purpose of the R1 district is to permit
the establishment of single-family dwellings. It is required that water and

To determine in which district a specific use is allowed:
   A.   Find the appropriate land use in one of the groups;
   B.   Read across the chart until either "P" or "C" appears in one of the
columns; and
   C.   If "P" appears, the use is a permitted (allowed) use; if "C" appears,
the use is allowed only upon the issuance of a conditional permit. If the use
is blank, then it is not permitted.
      The commission shall interpret the appropriate district for land uses not
specifically mentioned by determining the district in which similar uses are
permitted. When several combined land uses exist, or are proposed, the most
intensive land use shall be considered as the primary activity.
      OFFICIAL SCHEDULE OF DISTRICT REGULATIONS
If a specific use is not listed on this schedule, the City Council or Planning
and Zoning Commission may make a determination on whether it is similar to a
use listed below. If a determination is made that the use is similar to one
listed, such use shall meet all the same requirements of this code of the
similar use.

16.44.150: APPROVAL IN PRINCIPLE BY THE COMMISSION:
   A.   Within thirty (30) days after the public hearing the commission shall
review the preliminary development plan to determine if it is consistent with
the intent and purpose of this title, whether the proposed development advances
the general welfare of the community and neighborhood and whether the benefits,
combination of various land uses and the interrelationship with the land uses
in the surrounding area justify the deviation from standard district
regulations. The commission's approval in principle of the preliminary
development plan shall be necessary before an applicant may submit a final
development plan. Approval in principle shall not be construed to endorse a
precise location of uses, configuration of parcels or engineering feasibility.
   B.   The commission shall consider the general standards applicable to
conditional use permits and criteria for special uses before approving in
principle a preliminary development plan. (See sections
16.40.030 and
16.40.040 of this title.) (Ord. 573, 2024)
16.44.160: CONTENTS OF APPLICATION FOR APPROVAL OF FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN:
Upon approval in principle of a preliminary development plan, an application
for approval of the final development plan may be filed with the city clerk or
deputy city clerk by at least one property owner or person having a presently
existing interest in the property for which the PUD is proposed. Each
application shall be signed by the owner or lessee, attesting to the truth and

16.44.170: RECOMMENDATION BY COMMISSION:
   A.   Within thirty (30) days after receipt of the final development plan,
the commission shall recommend to the council that the final development plan
be approved as presented, approved with supplementary conditions, or
disapproved. The commission shall then transmit all papers constituting the
record and the recommendations to the council.
   B.   The commission shall find that the facts submitted with the application
and presented to them establish that:
      1.   The proposed development can be initiated within two (2) years of
the date of approval;
      2.   Each individual unit of the development, as well as the total
development, can exist as an independent unit capable of creating an
environment of sustained desirability and stability or that adequate assurance
will be provided that such objective will be attained; the uses proposed will
not be detrimental to present and potential surrounding uses, but will have a
beneficial effect which would not be achieved under standard district
regulations;
      3.   The streets and thoroughfares proposed are suitable and adequate to
carry anticipated traffic, and increased densities will not generate traffic in
such amounts as to overload the street network outside the PUD;
      4.   Any proposed commercial development can be justified at the
locations proposed;
      5.   Any exception from standard district requirements is warranted by
the design and other amenities incorporated in the final development plan, in
accordance with the PUD and the adopted policy of the council;
      6.   The area surrounding said development can be planned and zoned in
coordination and substantial compatibility with the proposed development;
      7.   The PUD is in general conformance with the comprehensive plan; and
      8.   The existing and proposed utility services are adequate for the
population densities and nonresidential uses proposed. (Ord. 573, 2024)
16.44.180: ACTION BY THE COUNCIL:
   A.   Within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the final recommendation
of the commission, the council shall either approve, approve with supplementary
conditions, or disapprove the application as presented. Upon granting or
denying the application the council shall specify:
      1.   The ordinance and standards used in evaluating the application;
      2.   The reasons for approval or denial; and
      3.   The actions, if any, that the applicant could take to obtain a
permit.
   B.   If the application is either approved or approved with conditions, the
council shall direct the city clerk or deputy city clerk to issue building
permits only in accordance with the approved final development plan and the
supplementary conditions attached thereto. (Ord. 573, 2024)
16.44.190: EXPIRATION AND EXTENSION OF APPROVAL PERIOD:
The approval of a final development plan for a PUD shall be for a period not to
exceed two (2) years to allow for preparation and recording of the required
subdivision plat and the development of the project. If no construction has
begun within two (2) years after approval is granted, the approved final
development plan shall be void. An extension of the time limit or modification
of the approved final development plan may be approved if the council finds
that such extension or modification is not in conflict with the public
interest. (Ord. 573, 2024)

SECTION:
16.48.010: Intent
16.48.020: Incompatibility Of Nonconforming Uses
16.48.030: Avoidance Of Undue Hardship
16.48.040: Single Nonconforming Lots Of Record
16.48.050: Nonconforming Lots Of Record In Combination
16.48.060: Nonconforming Uses Of Structures Or Of Structures And Land In
Combination
16.48.070: Repairs And Maintenance
16.48.080: Uses Under Conditional Use Provisions Not Nonconforming Uses
16.48.010: INTENT:
It is the intent of this title to allow existing nonconforming uses to continue
until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the
intent of this title that nonconforming uses shall not be enlarged upon,
expanded, or extended; and not be used as grounds for adding other structures
or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. (Ord. 573, 2024)
16.48.020: INCOMPATIBILITY OF NONCONFORMING USES:
Nonconforming uses are declared by this title to be incompatible with permitted
uses in the districts in which such use is located. A nonconforming use shall
not be extended or enlarged after passage of this title by attachment on a
building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the
premises, or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be generally
prohibited in the district in which such use is located. (Ord. 573, 2024)
16.48.030: AVOIDANCE OF UNDUE HARDSHIP:
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this title shall be deemed to require a
change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which
actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption
or amendment of the ordinance codified herein and upon which actual building
construction has been carried on diligently. (Ord. 573, 2024)
16.48.040: SINGLE NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD:
In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family
dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of
record (see definition of "lot of record") at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of the ordinance codified herein, notwithstanding limitations imposed
by other provisions of this title. Such lot must be in separate ownership and
not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership (see section
16.48.050 of this chapter). This provision shall apply even though such lot
fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally
applicable in the district, provided, that setback dimensions and requirements
other than those applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform
to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. (Ord. 573,
2024)
16.48.050: NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD IN COMBINATION:
If two (2) or more lots or a combination of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or
amendment of the ordinance codified herein, and if all or part of the lots with
no buildings do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area,
the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the
purposes of this title and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a
manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements
established by this title. No division of any parcel shall be made which
creates a lot with a width or area below the requirements stated in this title.
(Ord. 573, 2024)
16.48.060: NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES OR OF STRUCTURES AND LAND IN
COMBINATION:
If a lawful use involving individual structures or of a structure and land in
combination exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the
ordinance codified herein that would not be allowed in the district under the
terms of this title, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   A.   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this title in
the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed,
reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the
structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located;
   B.   No nonconforming use shall be extended to occupy any additional land
area;
   C.   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure or structure and land may, upon the issuance of a conditional use
permit by the commission, be changed to another nonconforming use provided that
the commission shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more
appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting
such change, the commission may require appropriate conditions and safeguards
in accord with other provisions of this title;
   D.   Any structure or structure and land in combination in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter
be resumed;
   E.   When a nonconforming use of a structure or structure and land in
combination is discontinued or abandoned for more than two (2) years (except
when government action impedes access to the premises), the structure or
structure and land in combination shall not thereafter be used except in
conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located; and
   F.   Where nonconforming status applies to a structure and land in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land. (Ord. 573, 2024)
16.48.070: REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE:
On any nonconforming structure, or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs or on repair or
replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing; provided, that
the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased.
Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety upon order of
such official. (Ord. 573, 2024)
16.48.080: USES UNDER CONDITIONAL USE PROVISIONS NOT NONCONFORMING USES:
Any use which is permitted as a conditional use in a district under the terms
of this title shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such district, but
shall, without further action, be considered a conforming use. (Ord. 573, 2024)

error has been made, variance from the terms of this title and requests for
hearings from affected persons. (Ord. 573, 2024)
16.64.020: ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS:
Appeals to the council concerning interpretation or administration of this
title may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer or bureau of the
legislative authority affected by any decision of the commission. Such appeal

the appeal is based. (Ord. 573, 2024)
16.64.030: STAY OF PROCEEDINGS:

cause. (Ord. 573, 2024)
16.64.040: VARIANCE:
The commission may authorize in specific cases such variance from the terms of

structures, or buildings in the same district and no permitted or nonconforming
use of lands, structures or buildings in other districts shall be considered
grounds for issuance of a variance. Variances shall not be granted on the
grounds of convenience or profit, but only where strict application of the
provisions of this title would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance does

of the applicant; and

which supports conclusions that the above-mentioned standards and conditions
have been met by the applicant. (Ord. 573, 2024)

this title in said district. In granting any appeal or variance, the commission
may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this

conditional use, or variance permit, if no hearing has been held on the

      2.   Delay such a decision for a definite period of time for further
study or hearing.
