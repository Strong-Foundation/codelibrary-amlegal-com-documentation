is hereby designated as the zoning administrator who shall be charged with the
administration and enforcement of this title. The city council may also appoint
other officers to assist in the administration and enforcement of this title.
   B.   Powers And Duties: It shall be the duty of the zoning administrator to
inspect or cause to be inspected all buildings in the course of construction or
repair. He shall enforce all of the provisions of this title, entering actions
in the courts, when necessary; and his failure to do so shall not legalize any
act in violation of such provisions.
   C.   Appeal: Upon appeal to the planning and zoning commission of any
matters on which said commission is required to pass, the zoning administrator
shall forthwith transmit all papers, records and other pertinent data
pertaining to the appeal to said planning and zoning commission as required by

the planning and zoning commission and city council as set forth in this title.
(Ord. 199, 11-14-1983)
10-2-2: PLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSION:
   A.   Organization; Meetings; Records:
      1.   The planning and zoning commission shall organize and elect a
chairman and adopt rules in accordance with the provisions of this title.
      2.   Meetings of the commission shall be held at the call of the chairman
and at such other times as the commission may determine. The chairman or, in
his absence, the acting chairman, shall conduct all meetings and may administer
oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the commission
shall be open to the public. The commission shall keep minutes of its
proceedings showing the vote of each member upon each question or, if absent or
failing to vote, indicating such facts, and shall keep records of its
examinations and other official acts, all of which shall be filed immediately
in the office of the commission and shall be a public record. "Robert's Rules
Of Order" shall be followed in the conduct of meetings wherever applicable.
   B.   Powers And Duties: The planning and zoning commission shall have
judicial power to interpret the provisions of this title. The commission shall
also have administrative duties to grant variances and special exceptions or
conditional use permits, as follows:
      1.   Intent: It is the intent of this provision to provide a way whereby
applicants who think that the zoning administrator is in error or does not
interpret the provision of this title correctly, to obtain a relief from such
error in an expeditious and inexpensive manner without having to resort to the
courts.
      2.   Duty To Interpret: The planning and zoning commission shall hear and
decide appeals where it is alleged by the appellant that there is error in any
order, requirement, decision, or refusal made in the enforcement of this title.
The planning and zoning commission shall also interpret the zone map and
boundaries therefor in cases of dispute or disagreement.
   C.   Grant Variance: The planning and zoning commission may authorize, upon
appeal, variances from the terms of this title pertaining to area and width of
lot, size of yards, and height and size of buildings where, owing to special
conditions peculiar to the property, a literal enforcement of the provisions of
this title would result in a hardship which is unnecessary in carrying out the
intent of this title. Before any variance may be granted, however, it must be
shown that:
      1.   The variance will not substantially affect the comprehensive plan of
zoning and that adherence to the strict letter of this title will cause
difficulties and hardships upon the petitioners which are unnecessary in order
to carry out the purposes of this title.
      2.   Special circumstances attach to the property owned by the applicant
that do not apply to other property in the same zone.
      3.   That because of said special circumstances, property covered by the
application is deprived of privileges possessed by other properties in the same
zone; and that the granting of the variance is essential to the enjoyment of a
substantial property right possessed by other property in the same zone.
      4.   That the difficulties and hardships were not created by an act of
the appellant subsequent to the effective date of the regulation from which
appealed.
   D.   Grant Certain Special Exceptions Or Conditional Uses:
      1.   Intent: There are certain uses which are not permitted within
particular zones unless they are made to comply with conditions which are
compatible with other uses in the same zone. It is the intent of this provision
to authorize the planning and zoning commission to use its discretion in
prescribing these conditions. However, the planning and zoning commission may
not authorize a conditional use unless such use is specifically permitted by
the terms of this title.
      2.   Duty To Prescribe Conditions In Connection With Special Exceptions
Or Conditional Uses: The planning and zoning commission shall hear and decide
requests for "special exceptions" but only when authorized by the terms of this
title to do so. In deciding whether or not to grant a special exception, the
commission shall be guided by the conditions set forth in this title with
respect thereto, which conditions shall be deemed to be the minimum standards
which must be complied with.
   E.   Attaching Reasonable Conditions: The planning and zoning commission may
attach reasonable conditions or requirements to the grant of a variance,
special exception, or conditional use which the petitioner must comply with as
a condition of the grant or approval. A time limit of one year shall be
attached to the exercise or nonexercise of any grant unless specifically
extended by action of the commission.
   F.   Reverse Or Affirm Zoning Administrator: In performing the duties and
powers as set forth herein, the planning and zoning commission is hereby
empowered to reverse or affirm wholly or partly or modify the order,
requirement, decision, or determination of the enforcing officer and may make
such order or requirement as ought to be made; provided, however, that in
interpreting and applying the provisions of this title, the requirements
contained herein shall be deemed to be the minimum requirements for the purpose
set forth.
   G.   Authority Limited: The powers and duties of the planning and zoning
commission are limited to judicial and administrative matters as set forth in
this title. The planning and zoning commission shall not have the authority to
amend this title nor to correct what it may consider to be an unwise
requirement. Nevertheless, the planning and zoning commission shall have powers
and duties as set forth in this title and within the limitations and intent of
the provisions of this title shall perform its duties and shall have the power
to perform those acts as herein set forth.

by filing a request in writing with the zoning administrator and by paying a
fee as set by the city council, provided such appeal is made within thirty (30)

administrator. The request to appear before the planning and zoning commission
shall be made on forms furnished by the zoning administrator. (Ord. 199, 11-14-
1983; amd. 2011 Code)
      2.   Procedure:

forthwith transmit to the planning and zoning commission all papers
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. The
planning and zoning commission shall review the application and shall return
the same to the zoning administrator with its decision pertaining thereto
within thirty (30) days. Failure to return said application within thirty (30)
days shall constitute approval. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance
of the action appealed from unless the zoning administrator certifies to the
planning and zoning commission after the notice of appeal shall have been filed
with him that by reason of fact stated in the certificate a stay would in his
opinion cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings
shall not be stayed otherwise than by restraining order which may be granted by
the planning and zoning commission or by the district court on application and
notice to the zoning administrator and on due cause shown.
         b.   The planning and zoning commission shall fix a reasonable time
for the hearing of the appeal, give public notice thereof by publication of
notice at least five (5) days prior to the date of hearing, as well as notice
by mail to adjacent property owners, and decide the same within a reasonable
time. Any party may appear at the hearing, in person, or by agent or by

10-4-4: Amendments To Text And Map
10-4-1: INTENT:
The intent of this chapter is to accumulate provisions applying to all land and
buildings within the incorporated area of the city into one chapter rather than
to repeat them several times.
(Ord. 199, 11-14-1983)
10-4-2: NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS, USES AND LOTS:
   A.   Nonconforming Buildings And Uses:
      1.   Generally: In view of the fact that no further development or change
in use can be undertaken contrary to the provisions of this title, it is the
intent of this title that nonconforming uses shall not be increased nor
expanded except where a health or safety official, acting in his official
capacity, requires such increase or expansion. Such expansion shall be no
greater than that which is required to comply with the minimum requirements as
set forth by the health or safety official. Nevertheless, a nonconforming
building or structure or use of land may be continued to the same extent and
character as that which legally existed on the effective day of the applicable
regulations. Repairs may also be made to a nonconforming building or to a
building housing a nonconforming use.
      2.   Damaged Building Restored: A nonconforming building or structure or
a building or structure occupied by a nonconforming use which is damaged or
destroyed by fire, flood, wind, earthquake, or other calamity or act of God or
public enemy may be restored, and the occupancy or use of such building,
structure, or part thereof, which legally existed at the time of such damage or
destruction may be continued or resumed; provided, that such restoration is
started within a period of one year from the date of destruction and is
diligently prosecuted to completion, and provided that such restoration does
not increase the floor space devoted to the nonconforming use over that which
existed at the time the building became nonconforming.
      3.   Discontinuance Or Abandonment: A nonconforming building or
structure, or portion thereof, or a lot occupied by a nonconforming use which
is, or hereafter becomes, abandoned or is discontinued for a continuous period
of one year or more shall not thereafter be occupied, except by a use which
conforms to the use regulations of the zone in which it is located.
      4.   Change To Conforming Use: A nonconforming use or building may be
changed to a conforming use or building. Any nonconforming use or building
which has been changed to a conforming use or building shall not thereafter be
changed back to a nonconforming use.
      5.   Change To Another Nonconforming Use Prohibited: A nonconforming use
of a building or lot shall not be changed to another nonconforming use
whatsoever. Changes in use shall be made only to a conforming use.
      6.   Reclassification Of Territory: The provision pertaining to
nonconforming uses of land and buildings shall also apply to land and buildings
which hereafter become nonconforming due to an amendment to this title. (Ord.
199, 11-14-1983)
      7.   Prior Permits; Construction: Notwithstanding the issuance of a
permit therefor, no building which becomes nonconforming upon the effective
date hereof or which becomes nonconforming due to an amendment to this title
shall be built unless construction has taken place thereon to the extent of at
least such amount as set by the city council in replaceable value by the
effective date hereof or when said amendment becomes effective. "Replaceable
value" shall be construed to mean the expenditure necessary to duplicate the
materials and labor at market prices. (Ord. 199, 11-14-1983; amd. 2011 Code)
   B.   Nonconforming Lots Of Record: Notwithstanding any other provision of
this title, a one-family dwelling may be permitted on any lot of record in any
zone in which dwellings are permitted, even though such lot fails to meet the
area or width requirements for one-family dwellings within the zone; provided,
that where two (2) or more contiguous lots of record having continuous frontage
are owned by the same person at the effective date of the controlling
ordinance, the land included in the lots shall be considered to be an undivided
parcel and no portion of said parcel shall be used as a dwelling site or sold
which does not meet the area and width requirements of the zone in which the
lot is located. Yard dimensions and other requirements not involving area or
width shall conform to the regulations of the zone in which the lot is located,
except when granted by a variance by the planning and zoning commission.

of providing a location where the cultivation of crops and the raising and
keeping of livestock and related uses can be carried on and where such uses can
be protected and encouraged. While dwellings and certain other uses not related
to agriculture are permitted, such development is not encouraged in the A-
1 agricultural zone because of the conflict which occurs between farm and
nonfarm uses. For this reason, owners or developers of land should bear in mind
that primacy is given in this zone to agriculture and livestock raising and any
development should be undertaken in recognition thereof.
   B.   The A-1 agricultural zone is characterized by large lots and tracts of
land intermixed with dwellings.
   C.   In order to accomplish the objectives and purposes of this title and to
stabilize and protect the essential characteristics of this zone, the

street, railroad, or limited access highway, the City may require frontage
streets, reverse frontage streets or such other treatment for the appropriate
use of the tract.
   D.   Half-street dedications shall be discouraged; provided however, the
City may accept a partial street dedication when such street forms the boundary
of the proposed subdivision and is deemed to be necessary for the orderly
development of the neighborhood, and provided the City finds it will be
appropriate to require the dedication of the remainder of the right of way when
the adjoining property is developed. When a partial street exists adjoining a
proposed subdivision, the remainder of the right of way shall be dedicated.

11-7-3: No Division Of Cost
11-7-1: GENERALLY:
   A.   All improvements of streets, alleys, or easements which are required as
a condition of plat approval shall be the responsibility of the subdivider.
   B.   Plans for the improvements herein required shall be prepared by an
licensed professional engineer registered in the State of Idaho.
   C.   All improvements required by this title shall be in accordance with the
Idaho Standards for Public Works Construction (ISPWC), and the city's current
standard specifications for street, sanitation sewer, and domestic water
improvements for development of subdivisions.
   D.   Prior to the time of recording of the final plat, the subdivider shall
file with the city's consulting engineer construction drawings for all
improvements required in the portion of the subdivision contained in the final
plat.
   E.   At the time of recording the final plat, the subdivider shall have
previously constructed all required improvements and secured a certificate of
completion from the engineer, or filed with the City Clerk a surety bond, or
other acceptable guarantee, to ensure the actual construction of such
improvements as previously submitted and approved. The improvements shall be
constructed within one year from the date of approval of the final plat;
provided however, the City Council may extend the period one year upon the
showing of just cause by the subdivider. Such surety bond or other guarantee
shall be in the amount of one hundred ten percent (110%) of the estimated cost
of the improvements as determined by the City's consulting engineer.
   F.   Prior to acceptance by the City of any improvements installed by the
subdivider, two (2) sets of prints of the "as-built" plans and specifications
shall be certified by the subdivider's engineer and filed with the City's
consulting engineer.
   G.   Within ten (10) days after completion of improvements and submission of
"as-built" plans, the consulting engineer shall certify the completion and
acceptance of the construction and shall transmit a copy of said certification
to the subdivider. If a surety agreement has been executed by the subdivider,
the same shall be forwarded to the City Clerk. The City Clerk shall thereafter
release said surety or guarantee upon application by the subdivider.
   H.   New electric, communication and television lines shall be installed
underground in accordance with the standards of the current edition of National

the location shall be approved by the City's consulting engineer. When overhead
utility lines exist within the property being platted, said existing overhead
utility lines and any additions or replacements needed to increase the capacity
or improve service reliability may remain overhead; provided however, that any
service drops into the platted area from said peripheral overhead lines shall
be underground. When overhead utility lines exist on the periphery of the
property of five (5) acres or less being platted, then the utility lines within
the platted area may be overhead. When, as a result of the subdivision
development, it is necessary to relocate, renew or expand existing facilities
within the platted area, the subdivider shall make the necessary arrangements
with the serving utility for these installations to be placed underground. The
subdivider shall arrange with the serving utility for, and be responsible for,
the cost of underground service lines to approved streetlight locations, as
required. Those electric lines of greater than three thousand (3,000) kVA
(kilovolt amperes) capacity as rated by the American Standards Association are
excluded from the requirement of this Section.
   I.   All underground utilities to be installed in new streets shall be
constructed prior to the surfacing of such streets. Service stubs to platted
lots within the subdivision for underground utilities shall be placed at such
length as not to necessitate the disturbance of street improvements when
service connections are made. If connected to a City-owned system, application
and fee shall be the responsibility of the developer in accordance with City
requirements.
(Ord. 305, 12-11-2023)
11-7-2: REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS:
   Standard or matching existing curb and gutters and asphalt plant pavement
shall be required on all streets in a proposed subdivision or dedication;
except the City Council may waive the requirements for curb and gutter for good
cause shown by the subdivider.
   A.   Concrete Sidewalks Shall Be Provided. However, where installation of
sidewalks is not considered necessary by the city, the requirement may be
waived.
   B.   Disposal Of Stormwater: Proper and adequate provision shall be made for
disposal of stormwater. The type, extent, location and capacity of drainage
facilities shall be determined for the individual subdivision by the
subdivision engineer and approved by the city's consulting engineer.
   C.   Sewer System Installed: Central sanitary sewer systems shall be
installed in all subdivisions where they are within the service area of an
existing public system and can be reached by a reasonable extension and said
public system. Construction plans and specifications for central sanitary sewer
extension shall be approved by the agency controlling the system and the
appropriate health authority. In a subdivision where central water is proposed
but a central sanitary sewer system is not available, such subdivision may make
alternate provisions for sewage disposal in accordance with the requirements of
the appropriate health authority and the city council.
   D.   Monuments: Monuments shall be installed in accordance with current city
standards at all corners, angle points, curves and all street intersections.
   E.   Dedication Of Open Space May Be Required: In a proposed subdivision of
twenty (20) or more lots, the city council may additionally require a
dedication to a public of an open area or areas for public parks and
playgrounds of approximately one-tenth (1/10) of the area platted. Such public
open areas shall be graded with due consideration for drainage. Landscaping and
other improvements following final approval of the plat shall be the
responsibility of the city.
   F.   Asphalt Road Surfaces:
      1.   All newly constructed or reconstructed asphalt road surfaces
required for subdivision approval pursuant to this title, whether within a
subdivision or as required off site improvements, shall be warranted for a
period of one year from completion of the installation of the asphalt surface
course and preliminary approval of said surface by the city.
      2.   Following the one year warranty period, the developer shall apply a
chip seal coating on the asphalt road surface as approved by the city engineer
and according to the specifications outlined in the then current edition of the
Idaho standards of public works construction (ISPWC).
      3.   Following the acceptance of the proper installation of the chip seal
coat, the city shall accept the dedication of the newly constructed or
reconstructed road(s) and include said road(s) on its official road inventory.
(Ord. 305, 12-11-2023)
11-7-3: NO DIVISION OF COST:

CHAPTER 8
MODIFICATIONS AND WAIVERS
SECTION:
11-8-1: Procedure For Granting
11-8-1: PROCEDURE FOR GRANTING:
   A.   Where the City Council finds extraordinary hardships may result from
the strict compliance with these regulations, it may waive a regulation or
requirement for good cause shown, provided that the public interest is still
secured. Any such waiver granted shall not have the effect of nullifying the
intent and purpose of the City Comprehensive Plan or these regulations.
   B.   The fact that an owner could realize a greater financial return by a
use of his property that is contrary to these regulations is not sufficient
reason for change. Hardship cannot be proven where it can be shown that
property was purchased with the knowledge of existing restrictions, nor can
hardship be claimed in terms of prospective sales or potential customers.
   C.   In granting a modification and waiver, the City Council may require
such conditions as will secure substantially the objectives of the standards or
requirements so waived or modified.
