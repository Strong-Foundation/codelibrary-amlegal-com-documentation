PREFACE
The Coeur d'Alene City Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in
1976, has been kept current by regular supplementation. In 1986, Sterling
Codifiers began providing supplement service for the City Code. In 1992,
Sterling Codifiers prepared a review and research of the City Code,
reformatted, compiled a new index and reprinted the City Code under the
direction of Jeff Jones, the City Attorney.
During the original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and
indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction
of William McFarland, City Attorney.
The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three (3) factor
decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation
without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number
designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter and section. Thus,
section 1.01.010 is section .010, located in chapter 1 of title 1. In most
instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine
(9) vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future
provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal
expansion.
Page numbers are assigned according to title and chapter numbers, i.e., page
1.01 - 1 represents title 1, chapter 1, page 1 of that chapter; page 12.28 - 11
represents title 12, chapter 28, page 11 of that chapter. This allows for
inserting new chapters between existing chapters and easily assigning page
numbers. The index pages are numbered I - 1, I - 2, I - 3, etc.
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the
specific sources for the provisions of that section.
Footnotes referring to applicable statutory provisions are located throughout
the text. A subject matter index, with cross referencing, locates specific Code
provisions by individual section numbers.
This supplement 80 (ALP S-11) brings the Code up to date through Ordinance
3758, passed August 5, 2025.

The person(s) selected to negotiate for the employee unit shall be members
thereof. The person(s) selected by the City to negotiate shall be elected
officials, officers, managerial employees or supervisors employed by the City.
The bargaining agent shall bargain collectively in good faith with the City. To
bargain collectively in good faith is the performance of the mutual obligation
of the City and the bargaining agent to meet at reasonable times and to
negotiate in good faith with respect to wages, hours and other terms and
condition of employment.
   B.   Whenever wages, rates of pay or any other matter requiring

bargaining conducted under the provisions of this Chapter, it is the obligation
of the bargaining agent to serve written notice of request for collective
bargaining or the corporate authorities at least ninety (90) days before the
last day on which money can be appropriated by the City to cover the contract
period, which is the subject of the collective bargaining procedure.
   C.   In the event that the bargaining agent and the corporate authorities
are unable, within thirty (30) days from and including the date of their first
meeting, to reach an agreement on a contract, any and all unresolved issues
shall be submitted to a factfinding commission.
   D.   Within five (5) days from the expiration of the thirty (30) day period
referred to in subsection C of this Section, the bargaining agent and the
corporate authorities shall each select and name one member of a factfinding
commission respectively and shall immediately thereafter notify each other, in
writing, of the names and addresses of the person so selected. The two (2)
members so selected and named shall, within ten (10) days from and after the
expiration of the five (5) day period mentioned above, agree upon and appoint
and name a third member. If, on the expiration of the ten (10) day period, the
two (2) members are unable to agree upon the appointment of a third member, the
State Labor Commissioner shall appoint such third member upon request, in
writing, from either the bargaining agent or the corporate authorities. The
third member of the factfinding commission, whether appointed as a result of
agreement between the two (2) members selected by the bargaining agent and the
corporate authorities, or appointed by the State Labor Commissioner, shall act
as chairman of the factfinding commission. No member of the factfinding
commission shall be an elected official or employee of the City. Any expenses
incurred by the factfinding commission shall be equally shared by the
bargaining agent and the corporate authorities.

hearing and cause notification to the parties consisting of the bargaining
agent and the corporate authorities to be served personally or by registered
mail not less than five (5) days before the hearing. Appearances at the hearing
waive such notice requirement. The factfinding commission may adjourn the
hearing from time to time, as necessary, and on request of a party for good
cause or upon their own motion, may postpone the hearing. The factfinding
commission may hear and determine the controversy upon the evidence produced,
notwithstanding the failure of a party duly notified to appear.
      2.   All interested parties are entitled to be heard, to present evidence
material to the controversy and to cross- examine, witnesses appearing at the
hearing.
      3.   The hearing shall be conducted by all of the members of the
factfinding commission, but a majority may determine any question and render a
decision. It, during the course of the hearing, a member of the factfinding
commission for any reason ceases to act or serve on said commission, the
remaining members appointed to act may continue with the hearing and
determination of the controversy.
   F.   The decision of the factfinding commission shall be in writing and
signed by the members joining in the decision. The factfinding commission shall
deliver a copy of the decision to the bargaining agent, corporate authorities
and any other party requesting such decision. The decision of the factfinding
commission shall be binding on all parties. (Ord., §8, 2-2-1999)
2.62.090: DUES; DEDUCTION FROM PAY:
Upon the written authorization of any public employee within the bargaining
unit and after the certification or recognition of such bargaining
representative, the City employer shall deduct from the pay of such public
employee the monthly amount of dues as certified by the secretary of the
exclusive bargaining representative and shall transmit the same to the
treasurer of the exclusive bargaining representative. (Ord., §9, 2-2-1999)
2.62.100: VOLUNTARY AGENCY SHOP:
A collective bargaining agreement may include union security provisions
including an agency shop, but not a union or closed shop. If an agency shop
provision is agreed to, the employer shall enforce it by deducting from the
salary payments to members of the bargaining unit the dues required of
membership in the bargaining representative, or, for nonmembers thereof, a fee
equivalent to such dues. All union security provisions must safeguard the right
of nonassociation of employees based on bona fide religious tenets or teachings
of a church or religious body of which such employee is a member. Such employee
shall pay an amount of money equivalent to regular dues and fees to a
nonreligious charity or to another charitable organization mutually agreed upon
by the employee affected and the bargaining representative to which such
employee would otherwise pay the dues and fees. The employee shall furnish
written proof that such payment has been made. If the employee and the
bargaining representative do not reach agreement on such matter, the commission
shall designate the charitable organization. (Ord., §10, 2-2-1999)
2.62.110: PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RIGHTS:
Public employees shall have the right to form, join and participate in, or to
refrain from forming, joining or participating in any employee organization.
(Ord., §11, 2-2-1999)

At no time may any employee or employee organization engage in any strike,
slowdown or work stoppage, nor may the City lock out any of its employees.
(Ord., §12, 2-2-1999)
2.62.130: LEGAL ENFORCEMENT:
The provisions of the Chapter may be enforced by the City, representatives of
the employees, the factfinding commission or any elected or interested citizen
in the District Court to the First Judicial District in Kootenai County and
such court shall have jurisdiction to issue an appropriate order. A failure to
obey such order may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof. A decision
of the arbitration panel shall be final and binding on the parties, and may be
enforced at the instance of either party, the arbitration panel or the
commission in the district court where the dispute arose. (Ord., §13, 2-2-1999)
2.62.140: SEVERABILITY:
If any of the provisions or sections of this chapter, or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held by any court to be invalid or
unconstitutional such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining
provisions or sections. (Ord., §14, 2-2-1999)
2.62.150: REPEALING CLAUSE:
All ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict herewith are hereby repealed.
(Ord., §15, 2-2-1999)

2.85.055: DEMOLITION REVIEW PROCESS FOR HISTORIC BUILDINGS:
   A.   Purpose and Goals: The purpose of this section is to establish a review
process whenever the owner of property requests a demolition permit for a
building or structure originally constructed prior to 1960. The goals of the
demolition process are to provide education about historic preservation to
owners of such buildings and structures, ensure photographic documentation of
Historic Buildings and Structures, preserve items of historical interest,
provide input on new design opportunities and community context, and encourage
feedback on historic preservation.
   B.   Applicability: Any building or structure originally constructed prior
to 1960 is subject to the review process established by this section.
   C.   Process: The following process will apply to applications for a
demolition permit for a building or structure originally constructed prior to
1960.
      1.   When an owner or the owner's representative submits an application
for a demolition permit to the building department, the Building Official or
designee shall verify if the building or structure was originally constructed
prior to 1960. If so, a demolition permit shall not be issued and the Building
Official or designee shall notify the Community Planning Director of the
application.
      2.   Within seven (7) days of receiving notice from the Building Official
or designee of the application for a demolition permit for a building or
structure originally constructed prior to 1960, the Community Planning Director
or designee shall determine if it is located within an historic district, or if
it is individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places or is
considered to be eligible for listing, whether as a contributing or
noncontributing property.
      3.   If Community Planning Director or designee determines that the
building or structure was originally constructed prior to 1960, and/or it is
located within an historic district, and/or individually listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or is considered to be individually eligible for
listing, whether as a contributing or noncontributing property, the Community
Planning Director or designee shall refer the application for a demolition
permit to the Commission subcommittee charged with reviewing applications for
demolition permits. Otherwise, the Community Planning Director or designee
shall inform the Building Official that a demolition permit may be issued.
      4.   Within seven (7) days of the referral, a member of the Commission
subcommittee shall review the application and conduct a windshield survey of
the property. The member shall determine whether to refer the application to
the Commission for further review or approve the issuance of the demolition
permit.
      5.   If the matter is referred to the Commission for further review, it
shall be placed on the agenda for the next regular Commission meeting. The
applicant, and any abutting and adjoining property owners will be notified of
the meeting by mail or personal service at least forty-eight (48) hours prior
to the meeting. The matter shall be the first action item on the Commission
agenda and the Commission shall take public comment from any interested person.
No public hearing will be conducted, but the applicant and staff will be
allowed to present to the Commission. Following any presentations and receipt
of public comment, the Commission shall make recommendations to the property
owner for preservation, if feasible, and possible modifications to the building
or structure if the building or structure is to be preserved. The Commission
may request a site visit to take photographs to document the interior and
exterior of the building or structure, and/or salvage of significant items such
as doors, windows, mantles, fireplaces, stained glass, molding, etc. The
Commission will forward its recommendations to the property owner and the
Community Planning Director.
      6.   The Community Planning Director or designee shall promptly notify
the Building Official of the Commission's recommendations and whether the
demolition permit may be issued or if additional documentation is required
prior to demolition.
      7.   Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to deny a property
owner the right to demolish any building or structure on his or her property,
subject to the process outlined herein.
   D.   Exemptions: A building or structure that is determined by the Building
Official or designee to be dangerous and that is ordered demolished by the
Building Official or designee pursuant to the Uniform Code for the Abatement of
Dangerous Building,
Chapter 15.09, Coeur d'Alene Municipal Code, is exempt from the process
established in this section. Interior-only demolition permits would also be
exempt from the process established in this section.
   E.   Appeal:
      1.   An appeal may be taken to the City Council by an aggrieved party
from any administrative determination or interpretation made by the Community
Planning Director under this section. Such appeal shall be in writing and filed
with the Community Planning Director within fifteen (15) days following the
date of the Commission decision. The appeal shall state specifically the
objections to the decision or identify an abuse of discretion or where the
decision is not supported by the evidence. The appeal shall be accompanied by
such information as may be required to facilitate review, and by the fee as
referenced in the fee schedule.
      2.   The City Clerk shall fix the time for consideration thereof and the
City Council shall hear such appeal between seven (7) and twenty-one (21) days
after the filing of the appeal. Written notice shall be given to the appellant
and to any known interested parties, or their representatives, of the time and
place of the hearing on the appeal at least five (5) days prior to the hearing
date.
      3.   The City Council shall hear presentations by the applicant and

and intent of the pertinent provisions of the Coeur d'Alene Municipal Code, and

interpretation. (Ord. 3741, 11-19-2024)

exacerbate adult asthma and allergies, and cause eye, throat and nasal
irritation. The U.S. Surgeon General has concluded that there is no risk-free
level of exposure to secondhand smoke. The conclusions of public health
officials concerning secondhand tobacco smoke are sufficient to warrant
measures that regulate smoking in public places in order to protect the public
health.

environment, and the rights of nonsmokers to breathe clean air by prohibiting
smoking within a specified area around City Hall and the City Library, which is
an area frequented by adults and children, who, without this chapter, would be
forced to choose between exposure to secondhand smoke or avoiding these areas
whose purpose is to provide a benefit to the public at large. (Ord. 3603, 2018)

5.28.010: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The City recognizes the health and wellness benefits of massage and
reflexology, and that massage and reflexology businesses in the City serve a
legitimate and beneficial purpose in the community. The City also recognizes
that there are some businesses that hold themselves out as massage or
reflexology businesses, but employ unlicensed persons to provide massage and
uncertified persons to provide reflexology who fail to follow state health and
licensing requirements, and do not have the proper training required to obtain
a state license or certification. In addition, these businesses that employ
unlicensed or uncertified persons to provide massage and reflexology can be
used to facilitate the commission of various criminal acts, including but not
limited to human trafficking and prostitution. The businesses that permit
unlicensed or uncertified persons to perform massage and reflexology or permit
the commission of unlawful acts threaten the business and reputation of
legitimate and licensed businesses and practitioners, and present a threat to
the public health, safety, and welfare. This Chapter is intended to inhibit the
ability of an individual or businesses to engage in the practice of providing
unlicensed massage and reflexology, and support the legitimate provision of
these services by licensed massage practitioners and reflexologists. (Ord.

5.68.050: LICENSE; INVESTIGATION; INSPECTION OF PREMISES:
   A.   Investigation: Before any license shall be issued under this chapter,
an investigation of the applicant, all other persons for whom a criminal
history check and a central child protection registry check is required under
Idaho Code section 39-1105, and any other person twelve (12) years of age or
older that resides at the childcare facility or is regularly present on the
premises, and inspection of the premises shall be made by the fire department,
police department and other city departments, the district health department,
and other agencies as may be necessary, to determine that the applicant and the
premises fully comply with Idaho Code sections 39-1105, 39-1109, 39-1110, 39-
1118 and 39-1119.
   B.   Criminal History Check: In order to determine the suitability of
applicants for a childcare facility license or employment by such facility, the
City Clerk and/or the Police Department shall conduct a criminal history check
of all people twelve (12) years of age or older residing, working, or
participating at the facility, except supervised volunteers, regardless of time
of residence in the county, and any other persons required under Idaho Code
section 39-1105 to provide information and fingerprints necessary as provided
hereafter. The City shall also request the Department of Health and Welfare to
conduct a criminal history check and a central child protection registry check,
and to report the results to the City.
      1.   Upon receipt of a first-time application for a license, the City
shall obtain criminal history information from the Idaho state police and the
federal bureau of investigation. Pursuant to section 67-3008, Idaho Code and
congressional enactment public law 92-544, the city of Coeur d'Alene shall
submit a set of fingerprints obtained from the applicant and the required fees
to the Idaho state police, bureau of criminal identification, for a criminal
records check of state and national databases. The submission of fingerprints
and information required by this section shall be on forms prescribed by the
Idaho state police. The city of Coeur d'Alene is authorized to receive criminal
history information from the Idaho state police and the federal bureau of
investigation for the purpose of evaluating the fitness of applicants for
licensing. As required by state and federal law, further dissemination or other
use of the criminal history information is prohibited. The cost of the criminal
history check shall be the amount charged for such background check by the
state of Idaho and include any cost required by the federal bureau of
investigation and any reasonable administrative fee established by resolution
of the city of Coeur d'Alene.
      2.   For any license renewal, the City shall perform a search of the
Idaho Courts database. In addition, every five years, both a City and a State
background check shall be performed. Grounds for denial of a license renewal
shall be the same as the grounds for denial of an initial license.
      3.   No license shall be issued until such background check has been
completed and its subject has been deemed qualified. However, upon the receipt
of an application for a childcare provider license, the City Clerk may issue a
provisional license to an applicant for a provider license if the City Clerk
determines that such person is in substantial compliance with the provisions of
this Chapter. In determining whether substantial compliance with this Chapter
exists, the City Clerk shall require completion of all criminal record
clearances. A provisional license shall expire one hundred twenty (120) days
from the date of issuance or at such earlier time as the City Clerk may
designate for good cause. A childcare provider or any other person required to
have a license must be continually under the supervision of a licensed
childcare provider until a provider license is issued.
   C.   Pending Criminal Charge: If the criminal history check reveals that
there is a pending criminal investigation or criminal charge that would result
in the revocation or denial of a childcare license if there is a conviction or
withheld judgment entered for the charge, the city clerk may issue a
provisional license pending the outcome of any such criminal investigation or
criminal case. The person that is the suspect or defendant in such criminal
case shall be continually under the supervision of a licensed childcare
facility director until resolution of the investigation, any resulting criminal
charges or any pending criminal case.
   D.   Sex Offender: Any operator or employee who has an immediate family
member who is registered on any sex offender list or becomes registered, and
who may reasonably be expected to be on the premises at any time must disclose
this information, in writing and including a photograph of the registered sex
offender, to all employees, parents and the city.

vegetation over eight inches (8") in height (other than trees, bushes, and
cultivated plants, flowers, and agricultural products), waste matter, nuisance
trees or bushes, brush, or vegetative litter on said property. In addition, it
is a violation of this chapter for the owner or occupant of real property to
allow the same uncontrolled growth or accumulation on a planting strip abutting
said property unless it is determined by the city official charged with
enforcing this chapter that the planting strip is so attenuated from the
property as to make it inequitable to require the owner or occupant to maintain
it in accordance with this chapter.
The owner of real property is ultimately responsible for violations of this
chapter.
   B.   It is a violation of this chapter for the owner or occupant of real
property to allow any tree, bush, or other plant material, waste matter, or any
dead or dying tree or bush located on private property in the city to overhang
or intrude over or upon any public street, alley, avenue, roadway, sidewalk,
traffic intersection visibility triangle (see section

that it interferes with the safety of the traveling public or constitutes a
hazard or hindrance to public safety or use of public property.
   C.   Pursuant to Idaho Code section 50-317 or its successor, and article
XII, section 2 of the Idaho constitution, the owner and occupant of real
property, and the agent or representative of any such owner or occupant having
control of the property, shall be responsible for immediately remedying any
conditions that violate this chapter. Upon notice to the owner or occupant, the
city may abate such violation by causing the cutting and removal of trees,
weeds, and/or grasses, and the removal of waste matter, and to assess the cost
thereof against the owner or occupant of the real property and planting strip
so cleared. Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, nothing addressed

nuisance pursuant to provisions of Idaho Code and pursuing abatement as
provided thereby. (Ord. 3564, 2017)
8.08.030: INSPECTION:
The chief of police or his designee may determine by inspection whether the

time within which the owner or occupant of the property is required to abate
the violation(s). (Ord. 3564, 2017)
8.08.050: OWNER OR OCCUPANT TO ABATE VIOLATION:
It shall be the duty of the owner or occupant of real property to cut, trim or
remove such accumulations or growth within five (5) days after the receipt of
notice, unless an extension is granted. One or more extensions may be granted
upon a showing of good cause. (Ord. 3564, 2017)
8.08.060: PENALTY FOR VIOLATION:
   A.   Upon the failure, neglect, or refusal of any owner or occupant to abate
such violation within the time specified in the notice, such owner or occupant
may be issued a civil citation. The civil citation shall carry a penalty in the
amount established by resolution of the city council for civil penalties and
shall be payable within ten (10) days of receipt of the civil citation. Each
day that a violation of this chapter continues may result in a separate civil
citation. For good cause shown, the city administrator, or his designee, may
waive all or a portion of any civil penalty assessed pursuant to this chapter.
   B.   In the event a person fails or refuses to pay the civil penalty
assessed pursuant to this chapter, the city may take such action as may be
necessary for enforcement of that civil penalty. Enforcement actions may
include, but are not limited to, initiation of collection procedures via a debt
collection service, filing a civil lawsuit for collection of the unpaid penalty
(ies), and/or, subject to subsection C of this section, filing a misdemeanor
complaint. The city shall be entitled to all fees, costs, and attorney fees
incurred in the collection of such civil penalty(ies) and, upon entry of a
judgment, the city may proceed with enforcement of the judgment as provided by
law.
   C.   If a person has been issued two (2) civil citations for violation of
this chapter, both of which remain unpaid, subsequent violations shall
constitute a misdemeanor, subject to a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) or imprisonment in the county jail for not more than six (6)
months, or both. A misdemeanor citation may only be issued if there are at
least two (2) unpaid civil citations for violation of this chapter outstanding.
(Ord. 3564, 2017)
8.08.070: APPEAL:
Within ten (10) days from the date of the required notice, the owner or
occupant of the real property concerned may appeal by filing a written notice
of appeal with the city clerk. The city administrator or his designee shall
review the appeal and shall issue a written determination within fifteen (15)
days of the filing of the notice of appeal. A civil citation may be upheld in
whole or in part, or it may be overturned. If the civil citation is upheld, the
owner or occupant shall be required to pay the civil penalty by the due date
set forth in the written denial of appeal. Enforcement may proceed as set out
in subsection
8.08.060B of this chapter. If the civil citation is overturned, it shall be
deemed void. (Ord. 3564, 2017)
8.08.080: ABATEMENT OF VIOLATIONS BY CITY AND COLLECTION OF COSTS:
In addition to the procedures set forth in section
8.08.060 of this chapter, in any case where the owner or occupant fails to
abate a violation, the city, through its own personnel, contractor, and/or
agents, may enter upon the premises and cut, trim, or remove weeds, brush
piles, vegetative litter, waste matter, or nuisance tree or bush, to abate such
violation. The total cost of the abatement shall be billed to the owner of the
property for payment. In the event payment is not made within sixty (60) days,
or if the owner cannot be found, the cost of abatement may be certified by the
city clerk and forwarded to the county treasurer for inclusion in the county
property tax assessment pursuant to Idaho Code section 50-1008. Pursuit of
abatement by the city shall not preclude prosecution of violations of this
chapter. (Ord. 3564, 2017)

The vision of the City is of a community in which all residents and visitors,
regardless of their age, ability, or financial resources, can safely and
efficiently use the public rights-of- way to meet the transportation needs of
their chosen mode of travel.
The purpose of this chapter is to increase opportunities for use of the City's
roadways; support a vibrant community beneficial to local businesses; promote
healthy living, economic development, and tourism; advance the wellbeing of
travelers; support the goal of compact development; reduce negative
environmental impacts associated with motor vehicle travel; and meet the needs
of the diverse populations that comprise our community including school
students, our aging population, and those with disabilities. (Ord. 3614, 2018)
10.03.020: DEFINITIONS:
CITY: Means the legal environs of the Municipality designated "Coeur d'Alene,
Idaho".
COMPLETE STREETS: Means the public transportation corridors and networks that
are scoped, planned, designed, built, operated, and maintained to enable safe
travel and access for users regardless of their mode of transportation.
WAYFINDING: Means informational signage used to orient people and facilitate
navigation from place to place. (Ord. 3614, 2018)
10.03.030: STATEMENT OF POLICY:
   A.   The City will plan for, design, construct, operate, and maintain an
appropriate and integrated transportation system that will meet the needs of
motorists, pedestrians, bicyclists, wheelchair users, transit vehicles and
riders, freight haulers, emergency responders, and residents of all ages and
abilities.
   B.   Transportation facilities that support the concept of complete streets
include, but are not limited to, pavement markings and signs; street and
sidewalk lighting; sidewalk and pedestrian safety improvements; features
consistent with Americans With Disabilities Act and title VI of the Civil
Rights Act compliance; bicycle accommodations including bike lanes, bike
infrastructure, and appropriate signage and markings; and, as appropriate,
streetscapes and street trees that appeal to and promote pedestrian use.
   C.   The system's design will be consistent with and supportive of local
neighborhoods, commercial zones, and business delivery areas, recognizing that
transportation needs vary and must be balanced in a flexible, safe, and cost
effective manner. (Ord. 3614, 2018)
10.03.040: PLANNING:
Those involved in the planning and design of projects within the public right-
of-way will give consideration to all users and modes of travel from the start
of planning and design work. Transportation improvements shall be viewed as
opportunities to create safer, more accessible streets for all users. This
policy shall apply to new construction, reconstruction, and rehabilitation
projects. (Ord. 3614, 2018)
10.03.050: EXCEPTIONS:
Exceptions to this policy may be granted for unusual or extraordinary
circumstances by the City Engineer with the concurrence by City Council, the
Planning Commission, or the Community Planning Director, with input from the
Pedestrian and Bicycle Advisory Committee. Exceptions will be considered with
one or more of the following circumstances:
   A.   Street projects may exclude those elements of this policy that would
require the accommodation of street uses prohibited by law or where the use is
deemed contrary to public safety by the City Engineer;
   B.   Street reconstruction projects and maintenance paving projects which
involve widening pavement may exclude elements of this policy when the
accommodation of a specific use is expected to:
      1.   Require more space than is physically available; or
      2.   Be impacted by a street reconstruction project in the near future;
or
      3.   Be located where both current and projected future demand is
demonstrably absent; or
      4.   Adversely change the cost-benefit ratio and equivalent alternatives
exist within close proximity that are convenient and accessible to all users;
or
      5.   Have adverse impacts on environmental resources such as streams,
wetlands, floodplains, or historic structures or sites above and beyond the
impacts of currently existing infrastructure.
   C.   Street projects may exclude the development of sidewalks in areas
falling outside those identified as appropriate for sidewalks on the basis of
an adopted sidewalk policy. (Ord. 3614, 2018)
10.03.060: INTERGOVERNMENTAL COOPERATION:
   A.   The City will cooperate with other transportation agencies including
the Idaho Transportation Department and neighboring governmental agencies and
highway districts to confirm that the principles and practices of complete
streets are embedded within their planning, design, construction, and
maintenance activities, when these activities have a direct impact on the
City's ability to enact complete streets policies.
   B.   The City will specifically cooperate to confirm that the transportation
network flows seamlessly, for all modes, between jurisdictions in accordance
with local and regional road, transit, bicycle, and pedestrian plans. (Ord.
3614, 2018)
10.03.070: DESIGN CRITERIA:
   A.   The City, through the Streets and Engineering Department, shall
maintain design criteria standards, and guidelines based upon recognized best
practices in street design, construction, and operation.
   B.   To the greatest extent feasible, the City shall adopt the same
standards with particular emphasis on pedestrian and bicycle accommodations and
wayfinding signage.
   C.   Resources to be referenced in developing these standards shall include,
but not necessarily be limited to, the latest editions of:
      1.   American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials
(AASHTO) Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets;
      2.   AASHTO Guide to the Development of Bicycle Facilities;
      3.   Idaho Transportation Department Roadway Design Manuals;
      4.   Institute of Transportation Engineers (Designing Walkable Urban
Thoroughfares);
      5.   National Association of City Transportation Officials (Urban Parkway
Design Guide, Urban Street Design Guide, Transit Street Design Guide); and
      6.   Manual On Uniform Traffic Control Devices. (Ord. 3614, 2018)
10.03.080: COMMUNITY CONTEXT:
   A.   Implementation of this policy shall take into account the goal of
enhancing the context and character of the surrounding built and natural
environments, as well as local business access and operations.
   B.   Appropriate attention should be given to projects which enhance the
overall transportation system and its connectivity for access to parks or
recreation areas, schools, shopping/commercial areas, public transportation,
employment centers, existing pedestrian or bicycle networks, or regional
bicycle pedestrian plans prepared by associated groups such as Kootenai County.
   C.   One or more connections to an adjacent bicycle or pedestrian trail
shall be made by the developer in developments approved after the effective
date of this chapter, as required by the City Engineer. In addition, cul-de-
sacs and dead end streets in developments approved after the effective date of
this chapter shall be designed to accommodate bicycle and pedestrian traffic in
a manner approved by the City Engineer. (Ord. 3614, 2018)
10.03.090: PERFORMANCE:
The City Engineer, or designee, shall report to the Pedestrian and Bicycle
Advisory Committee and City Council on an annual basis regarding the
transportation projects undertaken within the prior year and planned for the
near future, and the extent to which any of these projects has met or will meet
the objectives of this policy. (Ord. 3614, 2018)
10.03.100: IMPLEMENTATION:
   A.   This chapter will be primarily implemented through developing bike and
pedestrian network plans within the City in conjunction with Kootenai
Metropolitan Planning Organization's regional plans. If a development is
proposed for an area which is not covered by a bike or network plan, the
requirements of this chapter apply if the street(s) of that development will
connect to a street or facility which is covered by a bike and pedestrian
network plan.
   B.   These plans should specify the type and location of improvements, and
should be implemented as funding becomes available.
   C.   Special emphasis shall be placed on those elements of these plans that
can be accomplished with little additional expense, such as providing bike
lanes where existing pavement is adequate or where road shoulders are
sufficient to allow for safe bicycle use.
   D.   Completion of the Complete Streets Checklist shall be required for all
street projects, subdivisions, planned unit developments, and commercial and
multi-family building permits. (Ord. 3614, 2018)
10.03.110: VARIANCES:
A variance from the requirements of this chapter, different from what is stated
in section
10.03.050 of this chapter, may be granted only upon a showing of undue hardship
due to unique site characteristics. A variance may only be granted by the
aforementioned decision makers in such circumstances if the approval of the
variance would not otherwise impair achievement of the purposes of this
chapter. Any person requesting a variance under this section must provide data
showing that the proposed alternative methods of non-motorized transportation
and/or connections will produce comparable efficacy of the transportation
network required by this chapter. No variance will be issued unless all
elements of this section are met. (Ord. 3614, 2018)

10.22.010: PURPOSE AND SCOPE:
This chapter authorizes a program and a procedure by which property owners and
residents in qualifying residential neighborhoods can maintain quality of life
when competing with commuter vehicles for available on street parking in
congested areas. Such parking on residential streets by nonresidents who are
not visiting or conducting business with residents, creates adverse impacts on
the public's general health, safety, and welfare. The burden of the adverse
impact is particularly borne by the residents, thus contributing to
neighborhood decline. In these situations, uniform parking regulations do not
serve the public's interest. (Ord. 3065 §1, 2002)
10.22.020: PROCEDURE FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A RESIDENTIAL ON STREET PARKING
PERMIT AREA DESIGNATION:
   A.   Local governments have certain powers pursuant to the Idaho state law
to regulate the standing or parking of vehicles on public streets. The city
council may, after holding a public hearing on any residential parking permit
proposals, create pursuant to ordinance, areas of the city to be designated as
residential parking permit areas during specified times of the day, week, and
year, if the city council finds that the residential area under consideration
for such a designation is experiencing some of the following conditions:
      1.   Predominately residential in character near a nonresidential use
that attracts a significant volume of motor vehicle commuter traffic;
      2.   The streets, without motor vehicle regulations, are regularly
congested with hazardous traffic conditions, with vehicles blocking pedestrian
crosswalk areas, driveways and alleys, as well as, obstructing visibility of
pedestrians and motorists at intersections;
      3.   An area in which a significant number of residential dwelling units
in the area lack sufficient off street parking spaces to adequately serve the
motor vehicle parking needs of the residents, causing unreasonable burdens in
gaining access to their residences;
      4.   An area where limiting the parking of vehicles along public streets
in the residential area to vehicles registered or controlled, and exclusively
used by persons residing in the residential area is necessary in order to
preserve the safety of children and other pedestrians, improve traffic safety,
reduce hazardous traffic conditions and better provide adequate motor vehicle
parking for residents of the area, as well as, improve the peace, good order,
comfort, convenience, and welfare of the inhabitants and preserve the character
of their residential district through control and reduction of litter, noise,
and air pollution.
   B.   Any ordinance designating an area of the city as a residential permit
parking area shall describe:
      1.   The designated public street area along which parking will be
limited to vehicles registered to or controlled and exclusively used by persons
residing in the area;
      2.   Hours of each day, days of each week, and year that the residential
parking permit regulations shall be in effect;
      3.   The basis that will be used to determine the annual cost for
purchasing a permit and the date by which a permit must be renewed each year;
      4.   The individuals eligible to purchase a permit;
      5.   Any special provisions or exceptions applicable to schools,
churches, businesses, public park use, etc., within the residential area; and
      6.   Visitor permit or special gathering provisions for the residential
area.
   C.   Upon adoption of any ordinance by the city council designating an area
for residential parking permit only, the city engineer shall cause appropriate
signs to be erected along the streets identified in the ordinance prior to any
enforcement of the residential parking permit regulations. The street signs
erected shall give notice of the nature of the parking limitation and shall
indicate the hours and days when such parking limitation shall be in effect.
(Ord. 3065 §2, 2002)
10.22.030: DESIGNATION OF RESIDENT ONLY PARKING AREAS:
   A.   For the purposes of this chapter, "resident only" permits shall be
construed to include permits for employees of churches or other residential
service organizations within the designated resident only areas. For purposes
of this chapter, references to the city engineer, city clerk, or police
department shall be construed to mean any staff member or officer designated by
the mayor and city council to operate, manage, or conduct the program.
   B.   Said persons, as listed above, are hereby authorized to issue resident
only permits to employees described above, as well as, to issue permits for
healthcare providers, in home service providers, meals on wheels, and similar
residential service organizations to allow their staff to attend to clients
living in all the resident only parking areas. The city clerk, city engineer,
or designee, are hereby authorized to establish procedures for applicants and
issuance of permits in accordance with this chapter, design appropriate
application forms, order supplies, erect or remove signs as needed, and perform
such other duties and services as might be necessary to carry out the purposes
of this chapter.
   C.   The city engineer shall establish resident only parking areas and erect
signs to so notify the public along those streets, which the city deems
appropriate, based upon the city engineer's traffic and congestion studies. The
studies shall consider the extent to which legal on street parking spaces are
occupied by motor vehicles; the extent to which vehicles parking in the area
are vehicles other than resident vehicles; and the extent to which resident
motor vehicles in the residential area cannot be accommodated by the number of
available off street parking spaces. Notification of this designation and the
procedures for obtaining permits shall be mailed to each residence and/or
property owner along the streets so designated by the city engineer. Parking in
such areas during the hours of seven thirty o'clock (7:30) A.M. to five thirty
o'clock (5:30) P.M., Monday through Friday, shall be allowed only for vehicles
displaying either a resident's decal or a visitor's permit tag, unless
designated otherwise for specific areas. (Ord. 3065 §3, 2002)
10.22.040: REMOVAL OF DESIGNATION; DELETION OF STREETS FROM RESIDENT ONLY
PARKING AREAS:
Information generated through the original designation process and criteria set
forth in this chapter shall also be utilized by the city engineer in
determining whether to remove the resident only designation from any portion of
an area previously so designated.
   A.   Procedure; Notice: The city engineer may remove a resident parking only
area from designation under the program or delete a portion thereof after a
public hearing and giving written notice of such intentions to the residents of
dwelling units in the area subject to the proposed changes. The notice shall
contain a description of the area or streets to be deleted from the permit
parking area and the date, time, and place of a public hearing to consider the
proposed changes.
   B.   Hearing And Results: The city engineer shall explain the factors
justifying his proposal. Said city council decision shall be rendered, in
writing, and filed with the city of Coeur d'Alene police department with copies
mailed to residents along the affected streets. If removal from designation is
approved, the city engineer shall cause all signs designating the area as
resident only parking to be immediately removed. (Ord. 3065 §4, 2002)
10.22.050: ISSUANCE OF PERMITS:
   A.   Form Of Permit: Once an area has been designated a resident only
parking area, the city clerk shall issue parking permits in the form of decals
and visitor permit tags to applicants determined eligible for permits under
this chapter. The resident permits shall be valid from August 15 of a year
through August 14 of the following year, and be in the form of numbered, color
coded decals or, for visitors, in the form of numbered hangtags. Decals must be
placed on the lower left rear window (driver's side) of the vehicle; visitor

(4) or more written citations for parking violations in the city of Coeur
d'Alene, and which citations have remained unpaid for at least forty five (45)
days from the date of issuance. (Ord. 3554, 2016)
10.30.030: SCOFFLAW LIST:
   A.   The parking commission or its designee shall compile and maintain a

   E.   A motorist may appeal inclusion of a vehicle on the list by filing a
written statement of the reasons for the appeal with the city clerk within
thirty (30) days of the date of the notice required hereunder. The city clerk
will schedule a hearing before a city hearing officer. The hearing officer's
sole duty will be to determine whether the motorist owns or leases a vehicle or
vehicles that are the subject of four (4) or more written citations for parking
violations in the city of Coeur d'Alene which have remained unpaid for at least
forty five (45) days from the date of issuance, whether the motorist owned or

be immobilized if found parked on public property, including within rights of
way, in the city.
   B.   Upon immobilization, a written notice shall be posted on the vehicle
that states:
      1.   The vehicle has been immobilized by the city for failure to pay four
(4) or more parking citations, any of which have remained unpaid for at least
forty five (45) days;
      2.   The immobilization may be removed by paying all outstanding fines,
fees, costs, and civil penalties then due;
      3.   The vehicle will be impounded unless full payment is made within two
(2) business days of the notice; and
      4.   It is a misdemeanor for any person to remove, attempt to remove, or
damage any immobilization device, or to move or attempt to move an immobilized
vehicle.
   C.   A motorist may have an immobilization device removed upon paying to the
city all outstanding parking citations and associated costs and fees.
   D.   In the discretion of an authorized representative of the city, a
scofflaw vehicle which has been immobilized may be impounded if the motorist
fails to pay all outstanding fines, fees, and civil penalties then due within
two (2) business days of immobilization.
   E.   A vehicle impounded pursuant to subsection D of this section shall not
be released until the motorist has paid all citations, fines, fees, and costs,
including towing and storage charges.
   F.   A motorist shall have the right to a postimmobilization hearing. The
motorist shall file a written demand for such hearing within seven (7) days of
the immobilization. A postimmobilization hearing shall be conducted by a
hearing officer unless the hearing officer presided over the appeal regarding
the inclusion on the list, in which case the postimmobilization hearing shall
be conducted by the city administrator or his designee. Failure to request a
hearing within the specified period of time or attend a scheduled
postimmobilization hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing.
The sole issues to be determined in a postimmobilization hearing provided by
this section are whether the citations were validly issued, any fines, fees, or
costs were outstanding at the time of immobilization, and the motorist was the
registered owner or lessee of the scofflaw vehicle at the time the citations
were issued.
   G.   The process and procedures set out in this chapter are not exclusive.
The city is entitled to enforce parking regulations and citations in any manner

10.60.060: STANDARDS FOR ISSUANCE:
   A.   Statement Of Purpose: The purpose of these regulations is to set forth
the standards of issuance for a parade, public assembly, or block watch event

      1.   Assure that emergency services such as police, fire, and ambulance
services are available for a parade, public assembly, or block watch event
taking place within the corporate limits of the City of Coeur d'Alene;
      2.   Assure that emergency services such as police, fire, and ambulance
services are not unreasonably inhibited in their ability to travel on and cross
public streets and sidewalks by parades, public assemblies, or block watch
events; at a minimum, an emergency access twenty feet (20') wide shall be
required to all parts of the event;
      3.   Assure that business activities in the City are not unreasonably
impacted by parades, public assemblies, or block watch events; and
      4.   Assure that traffic is not unreasonably disturbed by parades, public
assemblies, or block watch events.

first served basis for a parade or public assembly as follows: for each
calendar day, only one high impact event, or up to two (2) medium impact
events, or one medium and one low impact event, or up to two (2) low impact
events. The issuance of any permit is dependent upon available staffing by the
City. Block watch events are exempted from any limitation as to the number of
events per calendar day.
   C.   Application Form; Approval: The City Clerk may request such information
from the applicant as is necessary in their sole discretion to determine
whether to approve the application. A public safety plan shall be submitted and
approved prior to issuance of a permit. The information may be requested in the
permit application form, through written instructions available from the City
Clerk or by written or oral inquiries addressed to the applicant. The time for
considering the permit shall be extended by the time taken by the applicant in
responding satisfactorily to any inquiry. The required public safety plan, or
parts thereof, may be waived by the Chief of Police, Fire Chief, and/or their
designees.
   D.   Discrimination Prohibited: There shall be no discrimination in
granting, denying, or conditionally granting permits under this chapter, and a
permit shall not be denied based upon the content of the applicant's message or
political, religious, ethnic, racial, disability, or gender related grounds.
   E.   Permit Denial: The City Clerk may deny a permit if the applicant, or
the person or organization on whose behalf the application is made, has on
prior occasions made material misrepresentations regarding the nature or scope
of a parade, public assembly, or block watch event previously permitted or has
violated the terms of prior permits; or if the applicant, or the person or
organization on whose behalf the application was made, has on prior occasions
damaged City property and not paid in full for such damage or has other unpaid
debts to the City. Further, the City Clerk may deny a permit if the proposed
parade, public assembly, or block watch event is for the primary purpose of
commercial benefit to a private party or parties, and it would disrupt streets
or sidewalks ordinarily subject to great congestion during the time of the
parade, public assembly, or block watch event, or would be detrimental to
public safety due to the City personnel required. The applicant shall be given
an opportunity to modify the proposed parade, public assembly, or block watch
event to address the reason(s) for denial, and any proposed modification shall
not be unreasonably rejected.
   F.   Additional Reasons For Denial; Halting Of Assembly: A permit may be
denied where the City Clerk determines that the parade, public assembly, or
block watch event would unreasonably disrupt traffic, vehicular or pedestrian,
or public services, or where there is substantial evidence that the applicant,
the applicant's agents, or participants in the parade, public assembly, or
block watch event intend to engage in violence. A parade, public assembly, or
block watch event may be halted by the Chief of Police if at any time the
participants fail to comply with the requirements of the permit or violate the
law. (Ord. 3606, 2018)

all mailboxes, fire hydrants, water gates, valves, manholes and other public
service structures and property as may be required for emergency use. All
gutters, pipes, drains, conduits, culverts, catch basins, storm water inlets
and all other storm water facilities shall be kept open so as to permit the
free and unobstructed flow of water at all times. Such public service
structures or property shall not be removed or relocated without proper
coordination with the properly constituted authorities charged with their
control and maintenance. The working area shall be confined so as not to
obstruct roadways and walks unnecessarily. Temporary roadways, driveways and
walks for vehicles and pedestrians shall be constructed where required. It may
be the duty of the permittee making any excavation in any public street, alley
or other public place to maintain safe crossings for vehicle traffic at all
street intersections, and safe crossings for pedestrians at intervals of not
more than three hundred feet (300'). All materials excavated shall be laid
compactly along the side of the trench and kept trimmed so as to cause as
little inconvenience as possible to public travel. If the street is not wide
enough to hold the excavated materials without using part of the adjacent
sidewalk, the person by whom the excavation is made shall erect a tight board
fence upon and along such sidewalk and keep a passageway at least four feet
(4') in width open upon and along such sidewalk. All gutters shall be
maintained free and unobstructed for the full depth of the adjacent curb and
for at least one foot (1') in width from the face of such curb at the gutter
line. It shall also be the duty of the permittee excavating or otherwise
obstructing any sidewalk in the fire limits to erect and maintain a four foot
(4') walkway outside of the curbline along such excavation or obstruction
during such time as the sidewalk may remain impassable, with a substantial
railing on each side to protect pedestrians.
   B.   Any monument of granite, concrete, iron or other lasting material set
for the purpose of locating or preserving the lines of any street or property
subdivision or a precise survey reference point within the Municipality shall
not be removed or disturbed without first obtaining permission in writing from
the Engineer, the permission to be granted upon condition that the person
applying therefor shall cause to be replaced, at his expense by the Engineer of
this Municipality, the monument so removed or disturbed. (prior code §9-11-5)
12.16.060: PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE SURFACES:
   A.   Where excavations or trenches are made in exposed Portland cement or
concrete surfaces (concrete driveways, sidewalks and pavement), a power-driven
concrete saw may be required to cut a kerf deep enough to permit complete
breakage of the concrete without ragged edges.
   B.   Portland cement concrete surfaces disfigured or damaged by the
permittee shall be replaced or cleaned and ground to a smooth and uniform
appearance. (prior code §9-11-6)
12.16.070: CONTINUANCE OF WORK:
After the work has been started it shall be diligently and continuously

fences, barricades, warning and directional signs, flares, red lights,
watchmen, and flagmen as may be required by existing laws and regulations and
as deemed necessary in the opinion of the Street Commissioner, to insure full
and complete safety to the general public. It shall also be the duty of the
permittee making any excavation in any public street, alley or other public
place, to place and maintain barriers at each end of such excavation and at
such places as may be necessary along the excavation to prevent accidents and
also to place and maintain lights at each end of such excavation and at
distances of not more than fifty feet (50') along the line thereof, from sunset
each day to sunrise of the next day, until such excavation is entirely
refilled, and it is unlawful for the permittee to fail, refuse or neglect to
comply with any requirement contained in this Section. (prior code §9-11-8)

If the work is unduly delayed by the permittee, and if the public interests
reasonably so demand, the Engineer shall have authority, upon written notice to
the permittee, to complete the work or any portion thereof. The actual cost of
such work by the Municipality plus fifteen percent (15%) as an overhead charge
shall be charged to, and paid for by, the permittee. (prior code §9-11-10)
12.16.110: BACKFILL:
All trenches and excavations shall be backfilled in the manner provided in this
Section. The trench or excavation shall be filled to not less than one foot
(1') above the top of the pipe or other utility facility with fine material
selected from the excavation, free from stones and lumps and of such character
as to be readily compacted around and under the pipe or other utility facility,
or with an imported fine granular material wherever material from the
excavation is not suitable. The backfill material shall be thoroughly compacted
around the pipe or other utility facility. Above the resultant level of this
first operation the trench or excavation shall be backfilled with earth from
the trench excavation or with imported material to six inches (6") below the
subgrade of the curb, gutter, pavement, sidewalk or driveway to be replaced or
to the surface if no improvement replacement is indicated. The use of water in
this stage of the backfill operation will not be permitted if the soil will not
readily drain and/or if the adjacent street may become damaged or the paving is
unduly delayed. If the material from the excavation will not give the required
relative compaction, an imported granular material that will give the relative
compaction shall be used. Excess water must be evaporated before the next layer
of earth or paving is placed. If an improvement replacement is indicated, the
upper six inches (6") of the trench immediately below the subgrade of the
improvement to be replaced shall be filled with selected imported granular
material of such character as to readily compact by sprinkling with water if
too dry to tamp and thoroughly compacted by power-driven equipment. All work
shall be done in such a manner as to obtain a relative compaction throughout
the entire depth of the backfill of not less than that which exists adjacent to
the excavation, but in every case the work shall be done in such a manner as to
obtain a relative compaction of not less than eighty percent (80%). (prior code
§9-11-11)

Temporary surfacing acceptable to the Engineer, where indicated on the permit,
shall be installed on the same day the backfilling has been completed unless
otherwise directed by the Engineer. The time limit for the replacement of
temporary surfacing with final pavement shall be at the direction of the
Engineer.
   A.   Any excavation of a paved street shall be immediately backfilled with
gravel, compacted and patched with cold mix asphalt. Thereafter, within seven
(7) working days, or as approved by the City Engineer or Engineer's designee,
the permittee shall have the paved street permanently patched with hot mix
asphalt.
      1.   The permittee shall maintain the temporary patch until the permanent
patch is in place.

to the plans and specifications, shall be made a part of, and be included in,
the grade of such highway, street or alley, and shall be provided for in the
contract for the grading of such street or avenue hereafter to be graded. The
cost of the concrete curb shall be assessed upon all property in such local

12.28.180: NEW CONSTRUCTION OR IMPROVEMENTS; SPECIFICATIONS GENERALLY; PERMIT:
   A.   Hereafter, when building structures are constructed on, or moved to, or
alteration is made to any building on, lots within the city where there are no
curbs, the persons constructing or causing to be constructed on, or moving, or
causing to be moved such structures to, or altering or causing alterations to
be made to existing structures on such lots shall, during the construction,
moving, or alteration construct street curbs and install asphalt paving between
the newly installed curb line and the existing street paving resulting in no
pervious interstices. If the street grade is less than thirty one-hundredths of
one percent (0.30%), curbs and gutters shall be constructed, except in areas
where in the judgment of the city engineer they are not practicable because of
construction problems. Such curbing, curbs and gutters, and asphalt shall be
constructed and installed along the front of the lot. If such lot is a corner
lot, or has double frontage, such curbing, or curbs and gutters, shall be
constructed along the front of the lot and extended along a radius to the side
street and installed along the side street to the rear lot line. In addition,
when curbing is required, corner lots shall be required to install curb ramps
complying with city standards and ADA guidelines, when there is existing
sidewalk or when sidewalk will be installed with the project. Curbs, curbs and
gutters, and asphalt shall be constructed to conform to the plans and
specifications on file in the office of the city engineer. No curbing, curbs
and gutters, curb cuts in existing curbing, or asphalt shall be constructed
without a permit issued by the office of the city engineer and all such work
shall be inspected by the city engineer, or his duly authorized agent. Such
construction shall conform to the grades established by the city engineer.
   B.   In the event the building structure is a portable classroom which meets
the parking requirements of subsections
17.44.050D4 and D5 of this code and other requirements of section
17.44.050 of this code, curbs and asphalt installation shall not be required
until a permanent structure(s) is built thereon.
   C.   In the case of streets under the jurisdiction of the city and
designated as urban principal arterials, urban minor arterials, and urban
collector streets pursuant to the Coeur d'Alene comprehensive transportation
plan as adopted by ordinance 2242, and as may hereafter be amended, curbs and
asphalt paving shall not be required if the city council has prioritized said
streets anticipating improvement by local improvement districts or otherwise
within five (5) years from the date curbs and asphalt paving would be required
under subsection A of this section and if the conditions in subsection C1 of
this section are met.
      1.   In the event said street is so designated, an owner of real property
abutting said street, who pursuant to subsection A of this section would be
required to provide curbing and asphalt paving, shall enter into an agreement
in a form acceptable to the city. The agreement shall provide that in the event
the city does not proceed with such improvement for said street within five (5)
years from the date curbs and asphalt paving are required, the owner will
immediately install curbs and asphalt paving as are then required by law or the
city may install the required curbs and asphalt paving at the owner's expense
which the owner shall agree will become a lien on the subject property.
   D.   Curbs and asphalt paving shall not be required for frontages of a
development along undeveloped and unused street rights of way when the
undeveloped public right of way is not needed for ingress or egress to the
proposed development.
   E.   In the event of alteration or modification of an existing structure
which would require curbing and asphalt paving exceeding five hundred feet
(500'), the city may enter into an agreement with the property owner to
construct the remaining required curb and asphalt paving within a period of
time not to exceed five (5) years.
   F.   Curbing and asphalt paving, if otherwise required by this section, may
be deferred if it is determined by the city council that curb and asphalt
paving construction would cause a safety hazard, maintenance problem, or
drainage hazard in an area where the city does not anticipate further
development except by local improvement district, or where physical constraints
are present which preclude the construction of such improvements in a
reasonable manner. When curbing and asphalt paving are deferred, the owner
shall enter into an agreement with the city for the installation of such
improvements at a future time. Such an agreement shall provide for at least the
following:
      1.   Construction of said improvements shall commence within ninety (90)
days of receipt of a notice to proceed from the city.
      2.   That in the event of default by the owner, the city is authorized to
cause the improvements to be installed and charge the entire cost and expense
to the owner.
      3.   That the agreement be recorded with the county recorder at the
expense of the owner, and shall bind all successors and assigns and constitute
a lien on the property.
      4.   That the owner, his successors or assigns, agree not to object, by
signing a petition, or not to protest the formation of a local improvement
district by resolution method.
         a.   The agreement shall not relieve the owner from any other lawful
requirements. The improvements shall conform to the applicable codes in effect
at the time of construction.
         b.   Deferred curbing and asphalt paving improvement agreements shall
be effective for ten (10) years from the date of recordation.
         c.   Deferred curbing and asphalt paving improvement agreements shall
be approved by the city council in a manner determined by the council.
   G.   No curbing is required when:
      1.   The building permit is for an amount less than thirty thousand
dollars ($30,000.00), or the value of a structure moved onto the lot together
with the amount for which the building permit is issued is less than thirty
thousand dollars ($30,000.00); however, if a footing and foundation only
building permit is issued, and a subsequent building permit is issued for the
structure that is to be placed on top of that same foundation, and the combined
valuation of both permits exceeds thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00), then
for the purposes of this section both permits shall be considered as one permit
and curbs and asphalt paving shall be required, subject to any exceptions
further defined herein.
      2.   In a previously developed residential neighborhood on residential
streets when:
         a.   All of the lots on one side of the street have been previously
built upon in accordance with city codes without curbs; and
         b.   Said lot frontages without curbs extend a maximum of four hundred
fifty feet (450') in either direction or to the nearest intersection whichever
is less.
A neighborhood for purposes of all parts of this section shall be defined
within the limits delineated in subsections G2a and G2b of this section.
In the event a local improvement district is created in the neighborhood, this
section shall no longer apply. (Ord. 3370 §1, 2009)
12.28.190: CURBING, CURBS AND GUTTERS; MATERIALS; DIMENSIONS:

12.28.210: SIDEWALKS; REQUIREMENTS FOR CONSTRUCTION AND IMPROVEMENT:
   A.   Sidewalk Construction Required: Hereafter when building structures are
constructed on or moved to or alterations are made to existing structures on
lots within the city where there are no sidewalks, the persons constructing, or
causing such construction, or moving, or causing to be moved such structures,
or altering or causing to be altered such existing structures on the lots,
shall, during the construction, moving or alteration of structures, construct
sidewalks and curb ramps as described in sections
12.28.220 and 12.28.230 of this chapter.
   B.   Subdivision Improvements: Hereinafter, but subject to the provisions of
subsection C5 of this section regarding hillside subdivisions, sidewalks and
curb ramps will be required to be constructed as subdivision improvements.
   C.   Exceptions To Sidewalk Requirements: No sidewalk is required when:
      1.   The building permit is for an amount less than thirty thousand
dollars ($30,000.00), or the value of a structure moved onto the lot together
with the amount for which the building permit is issued is less than thirty
thousand dollars ($30,000.00); however, if a footing and foundation only
building permit is issued, and a subsequent building permit is issued for the
structure that is to be placed on top of that same foundation, and the combined
valuation of both permits exceeds thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00), then
for the purposes of this section both permits shall be considered as one permit
and sidewalks shall be required subject to any exceptions further defined
herein.
      2.   There is a natural change of elevation in the ten foot (10') strip
adjoining the curb of greater than four feet (4') and a safe alternative
pedestrian pathway is available.

17.44.050D4 and D5 of this code and other requirements of section
17.44.050 of this code.
      5.   There is a hillside subdivision. A "hillside subdivision" is defined
as a subdivision where the highest and lowest points are at least one thousand
feet (1,000') distant horizontally and the difference in elevation is at least
thirty percent (30%) of the horizontal separation.
      6.   Sidewalks may not be required for immediate installation if the
requirements of subsection
12.28.180C, D, or F of this chapter are met. However, such sidewalks will be
installed at such time that curbs would be pursuant to subsections
12.28.180C, D, and F of this chapter.
   D.   Sidewalk Length:
      1.   The length of the sidewalk required on large lots shall be limited
to one hundred feet (100') or ten percent (10%) of the building permit
valuation, whichever is greater. For the purposes of this calculation, the
price of the sidewalk shall be determined by the most recent sidewalk bid
available to the city. Remainders of twenty percent (20%) or less shall be
included in the required sidewalk.
      2.   However, if the length of required sidewalk would exceed five
hundred feet (500') and the building permit is for an alteration or
modification of an existing structure, the city may enter into an agreement
with the property owner to construct the length of sidewalk exceeding five
hundred feet (500') within a period of time not to exceed five (5) years.
   E.   Sidewalk Location: Sidewalk location shall allow for a five foot (5')

parking strip or placement of the sidewalk against the curb shall be allowed,
dependent upon the width of the right of way.
      2.   The occurrence of the following natural and manmade features shall
allow alternate placement:
         a.   Trees and shrubs larger than six inches (6") at the base;
         b.   A grade change between two feet (2') and four feet (4') in the
ten foot (10') strip adjoining the curb;
         c.   The presence of permanent structures.
      3.   When sidewalks are being installed in a local improvement district
construction project, the sidewalk may be located next to the curb at the
request of a majority of the property owners within such district witnessed by
a written petition filed with the city prior to the awarding of the contract
for the construction of the sidewalk. (Ord. 3379 §1, 2010)
12.28.220: SIDEWALKS; MATERIALS; THICKNESS:

12.28.240: CURBS AND SIDEWALKS IN ANNEXED AREAS; CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
EXEMPTED:
   A.   The city council has found it to be a hardship on property owners
within light manufacturing (LM) and manufacturing (M) zoning districts to
compel construction of sidewalks and curbing when the following criteria are
met:
      1.   The property was annexed into Coeur d'Alene prior to January 1,
1984; and
      2.   The property was previously developed in accordance with applicable
standards in effect at the time of the development of the LM or M use; and
      3.   The property owner enters into an agreement with the city to waive
future protest against the formation of a local improvement district which
would provide public improvements which would benefit the property; and
      4.   That due to the development of the surrounding area, the
installation of curbs and sidewalks would, in the opinion of the city engineer
based upon recognized standards, create a hazard to public health and welfare.
   B.   Property use for LM and M purposes meeting the requirements of
subsections A1 through A3 of this section shall be exempt from the mandatory
requirements of this chapter as to construction of new sidewalks and curbs for
a period of twenty (20) years immediately following annexation of the property,
but shall not be exempt from the mandatory requirements for the repair of
existing sidewalks and curbs, if any.
   C.   This section shall not apply when a local improvement district is
established which benefits the property, or if the property is subdivided
subsequent to annexation.
   D.   For purposes of this section, the term "previously developed" means
property upon which a building permit was issued by a jurisdiction other than
the city, and the building or buildings completed, occupied, and continuously
utilized for a use permitted in an LM or M zoning district as allowed by this
code. (Ord. 2621 §1, 1994)

constructed on or moved to or alterations are made to existing structures on
lots within the city, either residential or commercial in nature, where access
to the building and/or parking lot, parking structure or garage via adjoining
alley, the persons constructing, or causing such construction, or moving, or
causing to be moved such structures, or altering or causing to be altered such
existing structures on the lots, shall, during the construction, moving or
alteration of structures, surface said alley with asphalt paving per this
section.
Exception: One single-family dwelling unit or one single duplex unit on an
individual lot.
   B.   Alley Surfacing As Subdivision Improvement: Hereinafter, any
subdivision of property that utilizes alleys for access, either existing or new
construction, will be required to pave said alley as a subdivision improvement,
prior to the issuance of any building permits for the subject property.
   C.   Alley Paving Length: The length of the alley paving will be determined
by the location of the building structure(s) that is constructed or relocated
onto the site.
      1.   Any structure that is constructed or relocated between zero to
thirty percent (30%) of the block length shall be required to install paving to
the farthest property line from the nearest adjoining street access point.
      2.   Any structure that is constructed or relocated between thirty one
(31) to fifty percent (50%) of the block length shall be required to install
paving the entire length of the alley to both adjoining street access points.
   D.   Alley Design: Engineered design shall be completed by a licensed civil
engineer and submitted for approval prior to construction. Design cross section
will require an inverted crown section at no less than one percent (1%), and
drain longitudinally to the adjoining streets. At no time will alley drainage
be allowed to cross or flow onto adjoining properties on either side.
   E.   Alley Paving Width: Minimum pavement width required will be the total
width of the dedicated alley as shown on the subdivision plat document, or the
total width of the alley as dedicated by private easement.
   F.   Pavement Design: Must conform to city of Coeur d'Alene standards for
public works construction.
      1.   Pavement surface shall conform to the requirements of the Idaho
transportation department, class III, one-half inch (1/2") maximum size
aggregate.
      2.   Minimum surface course of pavement is required to be two inches (2")
of asphalt.
      3.   Minimum base course is four inches (4") of three-fourths inch (3/4")
crushed rock, compacted in place to ninety five percent (95%) density.
Compaction test results are required to be furnished to the city public works

The street lighting system and the city is divided into separate zones to
reflect the intensity of illumination required to provide safe travel and
protection of property within each zone. These zones shall be as follows:
   A.   Highway Illumination Zone: The highway illumination zone shall include
all areas requiring illumination along the streets where there is no direct
benefit accruing to any particular improved real property owner or occupant.
Such zone includes freeway interchanges, the limited access portions of U.S.
Highway 95 from Northwest Boulevard to Walnut Avenue, freeway overpasses and
other such areas as determined by the city engineer or street superintendent,
where no direct benefit is accrued to any particular improved real property.
   B.   High Illumination Intensity Zone: The high illumination intensity zone
includes areas requiring twenty thousand (20,000) lumen lights to provide for
public safety and the safety of the improved real property. The streets in this
zone carry the highest traffic volumes. This zone shall include improved real
property with frontage on the following streets: Northwest Boulevard, Sherman
Avenue, U.S. Highway 95 from Ironwood Drive south to Walnut Avenue, Fourth
Street from Sherman Avenue to Best Avenue and Appleway from Fourth Street to
Ramsey Road.
   C.   Moderate Illumination Intensity Zone: The moderate illumination
intensity zone includes areas requiring ten thousand (10,000) lumen lights to
provide for the general public safety and the safety of improved real property.
The streets in this zone do not have the traffic volume of the high
illumination intensity zone, but have greater traffic volumes than residential
areas. This zone shall include improved real property with frontage on the
following streets: Fifteenth Street north of Sherman Avenue, Harrison Avenue
from Government Way to Fifteenth Street, Best Avenue and Third Street from
Sherman Avenue North.
   D.   Residential Illumination Intensity Zone: The residential illumination

12.34.020: CRITERIA AND STANDARDS:
The following streetlight criteria and standards have been applied and shall
hereafter apply to provide uniform lighting within each zone sufficient for
public safety and the protection of improved real property:
   A.   In the highway illumination zone, lights shall be placed at all
intersections and at all highway overpasses; provided, however, that the
placement of such lights shall be determined by the city engineer in
conformance to the policies and purposes expressed in this chapter.
   B.   In moderate and high illumination intensity zones lights shall be
placed at every intersection where practical. Where blocks are longer than one
thousand eight hundred feet (1,800'), an additional light shall be placed near
the middle of the block.
   C.   In the residential illumination intensity zone, lights shall be placed
at intersections where practical. Where blocks exceed six hundred feet (600')
in length, lights shall, where practical, be placed so that no property
frontage is a distance of more than three hundred feet (300') from the nearest
light. (Ord. 3064 §6, 2002: Ord. 2934 §21, 1999: Ord. 1686 §3, 1981)
12.34.030: COSTS:
   A.   The costs of all street lighting within the City of Coeur d'Alene shall
be financed by charges assessed to the owners and occupants of improved real

owners and occupants of improved real property shall be jointly and severally
liable for such charges and the charges shall become a lien upon and against
the property against which the charge is levied to the extent permitted by the
laws of the State of Idaho and the ordinances of the City of Coeur d'Alene and
may be collected in any manner permitted or hereafter permitted by such laws
and ordinances.
   E.   The foregoing charges are fixed and determined in amounts determined
sufficient to pay the costs of street lighting within the City of Coeur
d'Alene. Such charges shall be changed or amended by the City Council from time
to time, as determined necessary to finance such street lighting costs. Any
changes or amendments to such service charges may be made and fixed by the City
Council by resolution. Three (3) copies of such resolution, duly certified by

Chapter may be made monthly, quarterly or at such other intervals as may be
determined by resolution of the Mayor and Council, and shall be fixed at such
intervals as will correspond to billings of the same improved real property for
water, garbage and sewer services. Such billings may be billed on the same
statement; provided, however, that the billings for each service shall be
segregated. Such charges shall be due at the same time as charges for water,
garbage and sewer and, if not paid within twenty (20) days after they become
due and payable, shall be deemed to be delinquent and a late penalty charge of
ten percent (10%) of the amount of such charge may be added thereto. (Ord. 1888
§1, 1985: Ord. 1686 §§6, 7, 1981)
12.34.070: COMPUTATION OF CHARGES:

rate shall be the residential rate. The residential rate shall be applied to
all owners and occupants of improved real property within the City of Coeur
d'Alene.

residential intensity lighting, as described in subsection D of Section
12.34.010, plus the cost of general highway lighting, the cost of excess
residential lighting in moderate and high intensity zones, the cost of
completion of the street lighting system within the City and the cost of
administration.

13.04.150: CONNECTION FEE; REQUIRED; DISPOSITION OF MONEYS COLLECTED:
   A.   The water rate schedule and study prepared by qualified consulting
engineers shows, and the Mayor and City Council find, that the projected loss
of the Coeur d'Alene Lake water source and the rapid increase of users served
by the Coeur d'Alene water system requires the City to proceed with a
construction program to make capital improvements to the system. Since these
improvements have been made as a result of the projected increase of users of
the system, they should be financed by connection fees charged to the users of
new services. Such charge shall be made to owners of property making
application by consumer order after February 23, 1979, for new water service
connection to the City water system by direct connection, or by connection to a
private water system connected to the City water system.
   B.   At the time a building permit application is filed with the City or
County of Kootenai for an improvement to be served by the Coeur d'Alene water
system, a connection fee shall be charged the applicant, which fee shall be in
the amount as shown on Exhibit "A" attached to the ordinances codified in this
Section and kept on file in the office of the City Clerk, and by reference made
a part hereof, or such other amount as may hereafter be determined by
resolution of the Mayor and City Council of the City, after notice and hearing,
as provided for the amendment of rates, schedules, rules, and regulations, by
this Chapter.
   C.   Should a potential water user apply for water services to premises for
which a building permit has never been issued or has been issued without
payment of the connection fee here provided for in this Section, water service
shall not be initiated for such premises until the connection fee provided for
in this Section, in the amount currently charged at the time of the application
is paid.
   D.   All moneys received by the City as connection fees shall be by the City
Treasurer placed in a special fund to be held and invested as provided by the
Mayor and City Council, and as allowed by Idaho law, and shall be expended only
as allowed and directed by appropriation ordinance.
   E.   No connection fee shall be charged for a meter installed on a service
in existence for a minimum of twenty four (24) months which is to be used for
the sole purpose of determining the quantity of water that is not discharged
into the Coeur d'Alene wastewater collection and treatment system (pursuant to
establishing a classification under Section
13.08.020 of this Title). (Ord. 2472 §1, 1992: Ord. 2209 §1, 1989: Ord. 2113
§1, 1988: Ord. 1792 §1, 1983: Ord. 1650 §1, 1981: Ord. 1580 §1, 1979: Ord. 1568

13.08.080: Disconnection For Nonpayment
13.08.090: Wastewater Fund
13.08.010: PURPOSE OF PROVISIONS:
It has been determined that the cost of operation, maintenance and improvement
of the public wastewater collection and treatment works is largely dependent
upon the quantity and quality of effluent discharged by the various users into
the system; and that the charging of a fee based upon the quantity of
wastewater discharged and the strength of effluent discharged by such users
will result in an equitable distribution of the costs amongst the users. To
equitably establish such fees, sewer users have been classified in several
classes according to volume and strength of effluent received from various
properties and fees have been calculated for the various classifications based
on the factors set out and recommendations made in the most recent and adopted
City of Coeur d'Alene wastewater cost of service rate study, by HDR Engineering
Inc., or any successor thereto, which study is on file in the Office of the
City Clerk. (Ord. 3655 §1, 2020: Ord. 3599, 2018)
13.08.020: USER CHARGES:
Users of the Coeur d’Alene public wastewater collection and treatment works are

*Includes multifamily residential customers greater than 2 units.
   A.   Rate Calculations: Rate calculations for customer classifications are
described below. Customer classifications are described in the most recent and
adopted City of Coeur d’Alene wastewater cost of service rate study report
appendix C.
      1.   Residential Customer Class: Residential customers include single-
family residences and duplexes. The monthly bill to the residential accounts
will comprise of two (2) parts: a) a monthly service charge per account, and b)
a usage charge per dwelling unit. Using water use records from the non-
irrigation month period, wastewater usage will be averaged for the class each
year to determine if the usage charge needs to be adjusted. Duplexes with two
(2) meters will be assessed two (2) separate usage rates. Duplexes with one
meter will also be assessed two (2) usage rates.
      2.   Residential-Low Customer Class: Single-family or duplex customers
are eligible for this classification when they are full-time year-round
residents that use less than two thousand five hundred (2,500) gallons of water
per month based on the non-irrigation months and based on at least one year of
water use records. The monthly bill to the residential-low accounts will
comprise of two (2) parts: a) a monthly service charge per account, and b) a
usage charge per dwelling unit. Using water use records from the non-irrigation
month period, wastewater usage will be averaged for the class each year to
determine if the usage charge needs to be adjusted.
      3.   Residential-Vacation Rate: Single-family or duplex customers are
eligible for this rate when they do not occupy their homes for an extended time
period, and have the water turned off. When both requirements are met, the
customer will be charged the wastewater monthly service charge per account.
      4.   Commercial Customer Classes: Commercial classifications include
multi-family properties with three (3) or more dwelling units, mobile home
parks, government, commercial, and industrial businesses. The monthly bill to
the commercial accounts will comprise of two (2) parts: a monthly service
charge per account and a usage charge per thousand gallons of flow. The usage
charge differs for each of the commercial customer classifications relative to
the different strengths of wastewater estimated or determined for the customer.
Using water use billing records, usage for commercial accounts will be the
actual metered water use each month. The monthly usage for each account will be
multiplied by the respective usage charge for the appropriate class to
determine the usage rate component of each commercial customer’s bill.
   B.   Combined Use Rates: Users which fall into more than one customer class
are charged by assigning them to the higher use commercial classification.
   C.   Customers Not On City Water System: Nonresidential customers who do not
receive all of their water from the City water system must meter, at their
expense, all water which is supplied by another system.
   D.   Special Case Procedures: Uses not categorized above or not clearly
defined as being within one or more of the above classifications shall be
charged a rate to be determined by the following formula:
   Example for calculating the monthly bill during FY 2023 - 2024:
      ($15.74) + ($3.93 * monthly billed water use (kgal)) + ($0.0493 *
calculated lbs of BOD) + ($0.5254 * calculated lbs of SS) + ($27.0940 *
calculated lbs of P) + ($3.12 * calculated lbs of NH3N). The City reserves the
right to determine the final measured flow and strength levels.
   E.   Installation Of Private Meter: Should any user consider himself to be
aggrieved by the foregoing schedules or by the determination of the Wastewater
Superintendent, such user may install a meter or devices which measure the
strength and continuous flow of user’s sewage, in which event a charge shall be
fixed based on the indicated results for not less than one (1) year. Such meter
or devices shall be installed at the expense of the user, and shall be
calibrated or installed to the satisfaction of the Wastewater Superintendent or
designee.
   F.   User Charges For Commercial Accounts Based On Non-irrigation Month
Water Use: Commercial accounts existing before March 1, 2003, that have been
charged the usage component of the monthly bill based on non-irrigation month
water use records will continue to be billed in this manner as long as the City
Treasurer or designee is satisfied that non-irrigation month water usage is
representative and accurately represents the wastewater discharge each month of
the year. These accounts will not be eligible for this method of bill
calculation when the property has a change of ownership, the use of the
property changes, or improvements are made to the property that require City
building or plumbing permits. Upon determination of non-eligibility by the City
Treasurer or designee, a customer desiring elimination of irrigation water from
the water meter reading may install a second water service and meter at his own
expense that is dedicated to irrigation water. In this manner, the wastewater
user charge will not include irrigation water that does not enter the sewer.
   G.   Vacancies: At any month during which the occupant does not occupy the
residence or business, and does not show water use, the wastewater charge for
that month shall be equal to the monthly service charge.
   H.   Change Of Use: The customer is responsible for immediate written
notification to the City Finance Department of any change in use for correct
classification for billing. No adjustment to bills will be made sooner than
sixty (60) days from written notification. (Ord. 3715 § 2, 2023: Ord. 3655 §2,

All billings for charges and fees levied and assessed under the provisions of
this chapter shall be made by, and all payments shall be paid to, the Office of
the Treasurer of the City. Billings shall be at the discretion of the City
Treasurer or designee, in the name of either the owner or occupant, or both, of
the premises against which the charge or fee is made. (Ord. 3655 §3, 2020:
prior code §8-6-4)
13.08.050: BILLING; WHEN; DELINQUENCY; PENALTY CHARGE:
Billings for charges and fees levied and assessed under the provisions of this
chapter may be made monthly, bimonthly, quarterly or at such other intervals as
may be determined by the Mayor and City Council. Where there is a joint billing
of various City utility charges, payment of part of the billing shall not be
accepted, and if not paid in full, water service may be discontinued until the
entire joint billing is paid in full. User charges are due on the last day of
the time period for which the billing is made and become delinquent twenty (20)
days thereafter. A delinquency charge of ten percent (10%) may be assessed on
any balance remaining unpaid at the time of the next succeeding billing. The
charges and fees must be received by the City prior to the due date shown on
the invoice or billing statement. All charges and fees not paid within or by
the time periods established by the City shall be considered delinquent and
such delinquent accounts shall be charged one and one-half percent (1.5%) per
month to be added to the balance. (Ord. 3097 §5, 2003: Ord. 1888 §2, 1985: Ord.
1743 §4, 1982: prior code §8-6-5)
13.08.060: HOOKUP FEES:
At the time any premises is connected to any part of the City sanitary sewage
system, the owner thereof shall be charged a hookup fee for such connection;

listed in the above Commercial Low Category.
   [3]   Institution, (other than hospital) category will be used to calculate
PE’s for Assisted care/group home with more than 8 occupants and 2 caregivers.
   [4]   Commercial high strength customer fees include a high strength

   B.   The sewer capitalization fees fixed herein are based upon population
equivalents (64.36 gallons per day, 0.0807 pound per day biochemical oxygen
demand (BODs), 0.0807 pound per day suspended solids (SS), and 0.0054 pound per
day total phosphorus (TP) and 0.0135 pound per day nitrogen). The present
population equivalent charge upon which the present residential and residential
strength commercial rates are fixed is two thousand nine hundred thirty-six
dollars ($2,936.00) for FY 2023-2024 through FY 2027-2028. The population
equivalent charge upon which individual high strength commercial sewer
connection charges are based includes a high strength surcharge to account for
the greater than residential strength of these classifications. Development of
these high strength population equivalent charges was tabulated in Appendix C
of the most recent and adopted City of Coeur d’Alene wastewater rate and fee
study, by HDR Engineering Inc., or its successor, and includes the following
steps:
      1.   Calculation of the incremental strengths for the commercial-high
customer classifications. “Incremental strength” is defined as the difference
between the strength of a high strength commercial classification and
residential strength (0.0807 pound/day BOD, 0.0807 pound/day SS, 0.0054 pound/
day TP, and 0.0135 pound/day nitrogen). The incremental strengths are shown in
Appendix C, table C-3.
      2.   Multiplication of the incremental strength(s) by the respective unit
costs ($295.26 pound/day BOD, $4,125.35 pound/day SS, $118,405.06 per pound/day
TP and $10,346.81 per pound/day nitrogen). Summing the results yields the high
strength surcharge of three hundred seventy-one dollars fifty-four cents
($371.54) as shown in Appendix C, table C-3.
      3.   Adding the high strength surcharge to the population equivalent
charge for residential strength customer yields the population equivalent
charge for the high strength commercial classification.
   C.   Industrial users or other businesses with industrial waste, and uses
not categorized above or not clearly defined as being within one or more of the
above classifications shall be charged at a rate to be determined by the City
Council upon application of the property owner, after considering all relevant
evidence pertaining thereto at a public hearing held for such purpose; the rate
shall be established based upon consideration of the nature and intensity of
the proposed use and total impact upon the City sewer system. The charge shall
be directly related to the cost of providing sewage facilities for such use,
and shall be proportionately consistent with the schedule set forth herein.
(Ord. 3715 § 3, 2023: Ord. 3655 §14, 2020: Ord. 3599, 2018)
13.16.015: OPTION:
The owners of property connecting to the Coeur d'Alene sewer system which prior
to 1979 had sewer service available and did not refuse to pay a monthly user
charge, and would have been billed a monthly user charge except for an apparent
error made by the City, shall, at the owner's option in place of the sewer
capitalization fee, established herein, pay to the City a sum equal to the
total monthly user charges that would have been collected prior to the date the
property is connected to the public sewer system. (Ord. 3655 §16, 2020: Ord.
3097 §12, 2003: Ord. 1849 §1, 1984)
13.16.020: EXPANDED USES:
The owners of any property expanding their use, by increased flow or sewage
strength, shall pay the difference between the charge fixed in section
13.16.010 of this chapter for such expanded use and the charge fixed in section
13.16.010 of this chapter for the past use. (Ord. 1586 §2, 1979)
13.16.025: RIGHT TO CONTINUE EXEMPTION:
   A.   Whenever a property for which a monthly sewer user charge was being
made prior to June 1, 1979, and which has not been assessed a sewer
capitalization fee for any use thereof becomes vacant and remains vacant for a
continuous period of not less than five (5) years, the sewer capitalization fee
exemption as set forth in section
13.16.010 of this chapter for the prior use of the property shall expire. The
property may be used thereafter, but shall be assessed a sewer capitalization
fee in an amount as set forth in section
13.16.010 of this chapter.
   B.   Regardless of subsection A of this section, where a monthly user charge
was being made prior to June 1, 1979, and which has not been assessed a sewer
capitalization fee, the sewer capitalization fee exemption set forth in section
13.16.010 of this chapter shall not expire after five (5) years from the time
that any use becomes and remains vacant if the owner can reasonably document
the past use of the service. In those cases, a reasonable credit shall be
transferred and applied to the then current sewer capitalization fee. (Ord.
3655 §17, 2020: Ord. 3097 §13, 2003: Ord. 2677 §1, 1995: Ord. 1960 §1, 1986)
13.16.027: TEMPORARY FEES FOR RESTAURANTS:
Restaurants which have paid a sewer capitalization fee pursuant to section
13.16.010 of this chapter for their normal business activities, and seek to
expand their business beyond their permanent seating whether outdoors or within
the enclosed business premises for a temporary period not to exceed five (5)
consecutive months in any calendar year, may pay for the temporary expanded
use, in lieu of the sewer capitalization fee as set out in section
13.16.010 of this chapter, an annual temporary charge of 0.016 population
equivalents per additional seat as set out in subsection
13.16.010B of this chapter. Said temporary fee shall not be applied as a credit
towards the capitalization fee required under section
13.16.010 of this chapter. (Ord. 3655 §18, 2020: Ord. 3097 §14, 2003: Ord. 1961
§1, 1986)
13.16.030: ADJUSTMENT:
The population equivalent charge (upon which the sewer capitalization fee is
based) is developed for a five (5) year study period using the system buy-in
method as presented for the City of Coeur d’Alene in the most recent and
adopted wastewater rate and fee study, by HDR Engineering Inc., or its
successor. The system buy-in method recovers the biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD), suspended solids (SS), total phosphorus (TP), and nitrogen (N) based on
replacement cost of existing infrastructure only, and divided by existing
capacity in equivalent units.
Adjustments to the population equivalent charge during the five (5) year period
shall be made if estimated growth in the city changes significantly.
At the end of the five (5) year study period, the population equivalent charges
shall be updated for the succeeding five (5) year study period. (Ord. 3715 § 3,
2023: Ord. 3655 §19, 2020: Ord. 3458, 2013, eff. 4-1-2013)
13.16.040: CALCULATION:
Upon application to the city for connection of property to the sewer system of
the city, the sewer capitalization fee shall be calculated according to the
provisions of section
13.16.010 of this chapter; provided, however, that such charge shall be based
upon the actual usage of the system and for connection of any parcel of
property containing combined or mixed uses each use shall be segregated and the
owner shall pay the total amount of charges set forth in section
13.16.010 of this chapter for all of such uses. (Ord. 3097 §16, 2003: Ord. 1586
§5, 1979)
13.16.050: PAYMENT:
The sewer capitalization fee provided in section
13.16.010 of this chapter shall be paid to the City Treasurer or designee:
   A.   With the application for a building permit; or
   B.   With the application for an plumbing permit for the connection to the
public sewer system in the event no building permit is at that time required
for the construction of improvements on the property.
   Such building or excavation permit shall not be issued until the sewer
capitalization fee required herein has been paid.
   C.   The sewer capitalization fee is required when uses are expanded and
would normally be paid with the application of a building or plumbing permit.
In a case where no building or plumbing permit is needed or requested, the fee
is due at the earlier of:
      1.   Time of the expanded use;
      2.   Approval of a special use permit; or
      3.   Time of initial licensing or relicensing of a childcare/daycare
facility. (Ord. 3655 §20, 2020: Ord. 3097 §17, 2003: Ord. 2590 §1, 1994: Ord.
1586 §4, 1979)
13.16.060: DELINQUENCY:
   A.   In case of nonpayment or delinquency in payment of charge provided
herein, the city may discontinue sewer services to the property for which such
charge is made. Where such property is also serviced by the water division for
the city, the discontinuance of sewer service may be affected by the
discontinuance of the water service. There will be no turn off and turn on fee
for such sewer service; however, to enforce these procedures, the existing
charges for water service turn off and turn on shall prevail. Water service may
be turned off in such cases due to any infraction of these rules and
regulations, and will not be turned on until such time as the infraction is
corrected and costs due resulting from such infractions are paid to the city.
   B.   The owner of such property using the city sewer system shall be liable
for all fees and charges assessed by the city. Such charges shall become a lien
upon and against the property liable for the charge or fee to the extent
permitted by laws of the state and the ordinances of the city, and may be
collected in any manner permitted or hereafter permitted by law. (Ord. 3655
§21, 2020: Ord. 2934 §35, 1999: Ord. 1586 §6, 1979)
13.16.070: DISPOSITION OF FUNDS:
All charges received and collected pursuant to this chapter shall be by the
City Treasurer or designee deposited and credited to a special fund, to be
designated as the sewer system capital improvement fund, which fund is
established pursuant to Idaho Code section 59-236. The sewer system capital
improvement fund shall be used only for expansion of the public sewer system,
storm sewer separation, improvement or expansion of the present sewage disposal
plant or the construction of additional sewage treatment facilities. (Ord. 3655
§22, 2020: Ord. 1586 §8, 1979)
13.16.080: VIOLATION DECLARED MISDEMEANOR:
Any person violating the provisions of this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor,
and each day shall be deemed to constitute a separate offense. (Ord. 1586 §7,
1979)

I.    GENERAL PROVISIONS
13.20.1.1: PURPOSE AND POLICY:
This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for users of the publicly owned
treatment works (POTW) for the city of Coeur d'Alene and enables the city to
comply with all applicable state and federal laws, including the clean water
act (33 USC 1251 et seq.) and the general pretreatment regulations (40 CFR part
403). The objectives of this chapter are:
   A.   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that will
interfere with the operation of the POTW; and
   B.   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will pass
through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or otherwise be
incompatible with the POTW; and
   C.   To ensure that the quality of the wastewater treatment plant sludge is
maintained at a level which allows its use and disposal in compliance with
applicable statutes and regulations; and
   D.   To protect POTW personnel who may be affected by wastewater and sludge
in the course of their employment and to protect the general public; and
   E.   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and sludge
from the POTW.
This chapter applies to all users of the POTW. This chapter authorizes the
issuance of wastewater discharge permits; authorizes monitoring, compliance,
and enforcement activities; establishes administrative review procedures;
requires user reporting; and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable
distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein. (Ord. 3374
§2, 2010)
13.20.1.2: ADMINISTRATION:
Except as otherwise provided, the superintendent will administer, implement,
and enforce the provisions of this chapter. Any powers granted to or duties
imposed upon the superintendent may be delegated to other city personnel. (Ord.
3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.1.3: DEFINITIONS:
Unless a provision explicitly states otherwise, the following terms and
phrases, as used in this chapter, have the following meanings:
ACT OR THE ACT: The federal water pollution control act, also known as the
clean water act, as amended, 33 USC 1251 et seq.
ADMINISTRATIVE ORDERS: Administrative Orders (AOs) are enforcement documents
which direct industrial users to undertake or to cease specified activities.
The four common types of administrative orders are Cease and desist, Consent,
Show cause, and Compliance.
APPLICABLE PRETREATMENT STANDARDS: For any specified pollutant, city
prohibitive standards, city specific pretreatment standards (local limits),
state of Idaho pretreatment standards, or EPA's categorical pretreatment
standards (when effective), whichever standard is appropriate or most
stringent.
APPROVAL AUTHORITY: The Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) is the
approval authority.
AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE USER:
   A.   If the user is a corporation:
      1. The president, secretary, treasurer, or a vice president of the
corporation in charge of a principal business function, or any other person who
performs similar policy or decision making functions for the corporation; or
      2. The manager of one or more manufacturing, production, or operation
facilities, provided, the manager is authorized to make management decisions
which govern the operation of the regulated facility including having the
explicit or implicit duty of making major capital investment recommendations
and initiating and directing other comprehensive measures to assure long term
environmental compliance with environmental laws and regulations; can ensure
that the necessary systems are established or actions taken to gather complete
and accurate information for control mechanism requirements; and where
authority to sign documents has been assigned or delegated to the manager in
accordance with corporate procedures.
   B.   If the user is a partnership or sole proprietorship: a general partner
or proprietor, respectively.
   C.   If the user is a federal, state, or local governmental facility: a
director or highest official appointed or designated to oversee the operation
and performance of the activities of the government facility, or his/her
designee.
   D.   The individuals described in subsections A through C of this definition
may designate another authorized representative if the authorization is in
writing, the authorization specifies the individual or position responsible for
the overall operation of the facility from which the discharge originates or
having overall responsibility for environmental matters for the company, and
the written authorization is submitted to the city.
BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMPs): Schedules of activities, prohibitions of
practices, maintenance procedures, and other management practices to implement
the prohibitions listed in section 403.5(a)(1) and (b). BMPs also include
treatment requirements, operating procedures, and practices to control plant
site runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or waste disposal, or drainage from raw
materials storage.
BIOCHEMICAL OXYGEN DEMAND (BOD): The quantity of oxygen utilized in the
biochemical oxidation of organic matter under standard laboratory procedures
for five (5) days at twenty degrees centigrade (20°C), usually expressed as a
concentration milligrams per liter (mg/l).
CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARD OR CATEGORICAL STANDARD: Any regulation
containing pollutant discharge limits promulgated by the U.S. EPA in accordance
with sections 307(b) and (c) of the act (33 USC 1317) which apply to a specific
category of users and which appear in 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N, parts
405-471.
CATEGORICAL USER: A user covered by one of EPA's categorical pretreatment
standards.
CITY: The city of Coeur d'Alene.
COLOR: The optical density at the visual wavelength of maximum absorption,
relative to distilled water. One hundred percent (100%) transmittance is
equivalent to zero optical density.
COMPOSITE SAMPLE: The sample resulting from the combination of individual
wastewater samples taken at selected intervals based on an increment of either
flow or time.
CONTROL AUTHORITY:
   A.   The POTW if the POTW's pretreatment program submission has been
approved in accordance with the requirements of section 403.11; or
   B.   The approval authority if the submission has not been approved.
COOLING WATER/NONCONTACT COOLING WATER: Water used for cooling which does not
come into direct contact with any raw material, intermediate product, waste
product, or finished product. Cooling water can be generated from any use, such
as air conditioning, heat exchangers, cooling or refrigeration to which the
only pollutant added is heat.
DOMESTIC USER (RESIDENTIAL USER): Any person who contributes, causes, or allows
the contribution of wastewater into the city POTW that is of a similar volume
and/or chemical makeup as that of a residential dwelling unit. Dischargers from
a residential dwelling unit typically include up to one hundred (100) gallons
per capita per day, two-tenths (2/10) pounds of BOD per capita, and seventeen
one-hundredths (0.17) pounds of TSS per capita.
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA): The U.S. environmental protection agency
or, where appropriate, the director of the region 10 office of water, or other
duly authorized official of said agency.
EXISTING SOURCE: A categorical industrial user, the construction or operation
of whose facility commenced prior to the publication by EPA of proposed
categorical pretreatment standards, which would be applicable to such source if
and when the standard is thereafter promulgated in accordance with section 307
of the act.
EXISTING USER: Any noncategorical user which was discharging wastewater prior
to the effective date hereof.
GOOD FAITH: The user's "good faith" in correcting its noncompliance is a factor
in determining which enforcement response to invoke. "Good faith" may be
defined as the user's honest intention to remedy its noncompliance coupled with
actions which give support to this intention. Generally, a user's demonstrated
willingness to comply should predispose the city to select less stringent
enforcement responses. However, good faith does not eliminate the necessity of
an enforcement action. For example, if the POTW experiences a treatment upset,
it should recover its costs regardless of prior good faith. Good faith is
typically demonstrated by cooperation and completion of corrective measures in
a timely manner (although compliance with previous enforcement orders is not
necessarily good faith).
GRAB SAMPLE: A grab sample is an individual sample collected over a period of
time not exceeding fifteen (15) minutes.
INDIRECT DISCHARGE OR DISCHARGE: The introduction of pollutants into the POTW
from any nondomestic source regulated under section 307(b), (c), or (d) of the
act. The discharge into the POTW is normally by means of pipes, conduits,
pumping stations, force mains, constructed drainage ditches, surface water
intercepting ditches, and all constructed devices and appliances appurtenant
thereto.
INSTANTANEOUS LIMIT OR INSTANTANEOUS MAXIMUM LIMIT: The maximum allowable
concentration of a pollutant determined from the analysis of any discrete or
composite sample collected, independent of the flow rate and the duration of
the sampling event.
INTERFERENCE: A discharge which alone or in conjunction with a discharge or
discharges from other sources inhibits or disrupts the POTW, its treatment
processes or operations or its sludge processes, use or disposal or is a cause
of a violation of the city's IPDES permit or of the prevention of sewage sludge
use or disposal in compliance with any of the following statutory/regulatory
provisions or permits issued thereunder (or more stringent state or local
regulations): section 405 of the clean water act; the solid waste disposal act
(SWDA), including title II commonly referred to as the resource conservation
and recovery act (RCRA); any state regulations contained in any state sludge
management plan prepared pursuant to subtitle D of the SWDA; the clean air act;
the toxic substances control act.
MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE DISCHARGE LIMIT: The maximum concentration (or loading) of a
pollutant allowed to be discharged at any time, determined from the analysis of
any discrete or composited sample collected, independent of the industrial flow
rate and the duration of the sampling event.
MEDICAL WASTES: Isolation wastes, infectious agents, human blood and blood
products, pathological wastes, sharps, body parts, contaminated bedding,
surgical wastes, potentially contaminated laboratory wastes, and dialysis
wastes.
NEW SOURCE:
   A.   Any building, structure, facility, or installation from which there is
(or may be) a discharge of pollutants, the construction of which commenced
after the publication of proposed pretreatment standards under section 307(c)
of the act which will be applicable to such source if such standards are
thereafter promulgated in accordance with that section, provided that:
      1. The building, structure, facility, or installation is constructed at a
site at which no other source is located;
      2. The building, structure, facility, or installation totally replaces
the process or production equipment that causes the discharge of pollutants at
an existing source; or
      3. The production or wastewater generating processes of the building,
structure, facility, or installation are substantially independent of an
existing source at the same site. In determining whether these are
substantially independent, factors such as the extent to which the new facility
is integrated with the existing plant, and the extent to which the new facility
is engaged in the same general type of activity as the existing source, should
be considered.
   B.   Construction on a site at which an existing source is located results
in a modification rather than a new source if the construction does not create
a new building, structure, facility, or installation meeting the criteria of
subsections A1 or A3 of this definition but otherwise alters, replaces, or adds
to existing process or production equipment.
   C.   Construction of a new source as defined under this definition has
commenced if the owner or operator has:
      1. Begun, or caused to begin as part of a continuous on site construction
program:
         a. Any placement, assembly, or installation of facilities or
equipment; or
         b. Significant site preparation work including clearing, excavation,
or removal of existing buildings, structures, or facilities which is necessary
for the placement, assembly, or installation of new source facilities or
equipment; or
      2. Entered into a binding contractual obligation for the purchase of
facilities or equipment which are intended to be used in its operation within a
reasonable time. Options to purchase or contracts which can be terminated or
modified without substantial loss, and contracts for feasibility, engineering,
and design studies do not constitute a contractual obligation under this
definition.
NEW USER: A user that is not regulated under federal categorical pretreatment
standards but that applies to the city for a new building permit or occupies an
existing building and plans to commence discharge of wastewater to the city's
collection system after the effective date hereof. Any person that buys an
existing facility that is discharging nondomestic wastewater will be considered
an "existing user" if no significant changes are made in the manufacturing
operation.
PASS-THROUGH: A discharge which exits the POTW into waters of the United States
in quantities or concentrations which, alone or in conjunction with a discharge
or discharges from other sources, is a cause of a violation of any requirement
of the city's IPDES permit (including an increase in the magnitude or duration
of a violation).
PERMITTEE: A person or user issued a wastewater discharge permit.
PERSON: Any individual, partnership, copartnership, firm, company, corporation,
association, joint stock company, trust, estate, governmental entity, or any
other legal entity; or their legal representatives, agents, or assigns. This
definition includes all federal, state, or local governmental entities.
pH: A measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a substance, expressed in
standard units.
POLLUTANT: Any dredged spoil, solid waste, incinerator residue, sewage,
garbage, sewage sludge, munitions, medical wastes, chemical wastes, biological
materials, radioactive materials, heat, wrecked or discharged equipment, rock,
sand, cellar dirt, agricultural and industrial wastes, and the characteristics
of the wastewater, i.e., pH, temperature, TSS, turbidity, color, BOD, chemical

II.   GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
13.20.2.1: PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS:
   A.   General Prohibitions: No user may introduce or cause to be introduced
into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater which causes pass-through or
interference. These general prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW whether
or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other
national, State, or local pretreatment standards or requirements.
   B.   Specific Prohibitions: No user may introduce or cause to be introduced
into the POTW the following pollutants, substances, or wastewater:
      1.   Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the POTW,
including, but not limited to, waste streams with a closed cup flashpoint of
less than one hundred forty degrees Fahrenheit (140°F) (60°C) using the test
methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21; or
      2.   Wastewater having a pH less than 6 or more than 12, or otherwise
causing corrosive structural damage to the POTW or equipment; or

(Ord. 3655 §25, 2020: Ord. 3558, 2017: Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.2.2: FEDERAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS:
The national categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR chapter I,
subchapter N, parts 405-471 are hereby incorporated and are enforceable under
this Code.
   A.   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed
only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the Superintendent
may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of
pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of
calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users.
(Line 638 in EPA Model SUO, 2.2B.) (Ord. 3675 §1, 2021: Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.2.3: STATE REQUIREMENTS:
State requirements and limitations on discharges to the POTW must be met by all
users who are subject to those standards in any instance where they are more
stringent than Federal requirements and limitations, or those in this chapter
or any other ordinance. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.2.4: LOCAL LIMITS:
   A.   No significant industrial user or other permitted non- significant
industrial user shall discharge wastewater that exceeds the following limits:
Pollutant1 Daily Maximum
           Discharge Limit1 mg/l
Pollutant1 Daily Maximum
           Discharge Limit1 mg/l
Ammonia    147
Arsenic    0.13
Cadmium    0.146
Chromium   5.48
Copper     1.96
Lead       0.86
Mercury    0.043
Molybdenum 0.46
Nickel     2.0
Phosphorus 258
Selenium   0.53
Silver     0.69
Zinc       1.25
 
Note:
   1.    All pollutants as total and in mg/l unless otherwise specified.
 
   B.   The Superintendent may, at his sole discretion, implement local limits
through allocation of the maximum allowable industrial load (MAIL) to
significant industrial users which correspond to the uniform concentration
local limits shown in the table above. The MAIL that corresponds to the daily
maximum discharge limits is hereby incorporated by reference.
   C.   The Superintendent may establish more stringent pollutant limits,
additional site-specific pollutant limits, Best Management Practices, or
additional pretreatment requirements when, in the judgment of the
Superintendent, such limitations are necessary to implement the provisions of
this chapter.
   D.   The Superintendent may impose mass limitations in addition to, or in
place of, the concentration-based limitations above.
   E.   The Superintendent may develop Best Management Practices (BMPs), by
ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, to implement local limits and the
requirements of this title. (Ord. 3558, 2017)
13.20.2.5: CITY'S RIGHT OF REVISION:
The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater
discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to
the POTW. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.2.6: SPECIAL AGREEMENT:
The city reserves the right to enter into special agreements with users setting
out special terms under which they may discharge to the POTW. In no case will a
special agreement waive compliance with a categorical pretreatment standard or
federal pretreatment requirement. However, the user may request a net gross
adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. They may
also request a variance from the categorical pretreatment standard from the
approval authority in accordance with 40 CFR section 403.13. (Ord. 3374 §2,
2010)
13.20.2.7: DILUTION:
Users cannot increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute
a discharge, as a substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with
a pretreatment standard or requirement unless expressly authorized by an
applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The superintendent may impose
mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable
pretreatment requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass
limitations is appropriate. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.2.8: PRETREATMENT FACILITIES:
Users must provide necessary wastewater treatment required to comply with this
chapter and must achieve compliance with all applicable pretreatment standards
and requirements set out in this chapter within the time limitations specified
by the EPA, the state, or the superintendent, whichever is more stringent. Any
facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city
will be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans
showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures must be submitted
to the city for review and approval before construction of the facility. The
review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user
from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an
acceptable discharge to the city under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord.
3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.2.9: DEADLINE FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS:
Compliance by existing users (categorical users) covered by categorical
pretreatment standards must be achieved within three (3) years of the date the
standard is effective unless a shorter compliance time is specified in the
appropriate standard. The city will establish a final compliance deadline date
for any existing user not covered by categorical pretreatment standards or for
any categorical user when the local limits for the user are more restrictive
than EPA's categorical pretreatment standards.
New source dischargers and new users are required to comply with applicable
pretreatment standards within the shortest feasible time (not to exceed 90 days
from the beginning of discharge). New sources and new users must install and
have in operating condition, and must start up all pollution control equipment
required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to
discharge.
Any wastewater discharge permit issued to a categorical user will not contain a
compliance date beyond any deadline date established in EPA's categorical
pretreatment standards. Any other existing user or a categorical user that must
comply with a more stringent local limit, which is in noncompliance with any
local limits will be provided with a compliance schedule placed in an
industrial wastewater permit to ensure compliance within the shortest time
feasible. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.2.10: ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT MEASURES:
   A.   Whenever deemed necessary, the superintendent may require users to
restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate
points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste
streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and
determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   B.   Each person discharging into the POTW may be required to install and
maintain, on his property and at his expense, a suitable storage and flow
control facility to ensure equalization of flow over a twenty four (24) hour
period. The facility must have a capacity for a city designated percent of the
daily discharge volume and must be equipped with alarms and a rate of discharge
controller, the regulation of which will be directed by the superintendent. A
wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
   C.   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors must be provided when, in the
opinion of the superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of
wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that
such interceptors will not be required for residential users. All interception
units must be of type and capacity approved by the superintendent and must be
located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors
must be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at
his expense.
      1.   A grease interceptor or a grease trap is not considered to be
properly maintained if for any reason it is not in good working condition with
all internal required plumbing of proper design and length in place, or if the
operational fluid capacity has been reduced by more than twenty five percent
(25%) by the accumulation of floating and settled solids, oils, and greases.
The owner of any premises required to install a grease interceptor, the lessee
and sublessee, if any, and any proprietor, operator, or superintendent of such
facility are individually and severally liable for any failure of proper
maintenance of such grease interceptor.
If the grease interceptor is not maintained adequately under the conditions of
use, the grease interceptor must be resized and the user must install one which
is effective in accomplishing the intended purpose.
When a grease interceptor/trap is cleaned, the sidewalls must be scraped and
hosed down, while all the solids and liquids contained are removed. All wastes
removed from any grease interceptor/trap must be legally disposed of other than
to the sewer. The city of Coeur d'Alene specifically prohibits the following
grease interceptor/trap practices:
         a.   Pumping to remove only accumulated sediments or floating
materials;
         b.   Pumping operations which specifically separate floating or
sediment interceptor solid wastes from wastewater and then return or decant the
separated wastewater back into the grease interceptor/trap;
         c.   Transporting any hauled pollutants from another location for
discharge into a grease interceptor/trap.
Use of grease trap/interceptor treatment products, including bacteria, designed
to digest the grease, is specifically prohibited.
   D.   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
(Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.2.11: ACCIDENTAL SPILL PREVENTION PLAN (ASPP)/SLUG CONTROL PLANS:
The superintendent may require any user to develop and implement an accidental
spill prevention plan (ASPP) or slug control plan. Where deemed necessary by
the city, facilities to prevent accidental discharge or slug discharges of
pollutants must be provided and maintained at the user's cost and expense. An
accidental spill prevention plan/slug control plan showing facilities and
operating procedures to provide this protection must be submitted to the city
for review and approval before implementation. The city will determine which
user is required to develop a plan and require the plan be submitted within
ninety (90) days after notification by the city. Each user must implement its
ASPP/slug control plan as submitted or as modified after such plan has been
reviewed and approved by the city. Review and approval of such plans and
operating procedures by the city does not relieve the user from the
responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of
this section.
   A.   Any user required to develop and implement an accidental spill
prevention plan (ASPP)/slug control plan must submit a plan which addresses, at
a minimum, the following:
      1.   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges; and
      2.   Description of stored chemicals; and
      3.   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental or
slug discharge. Such notification must also be given for any discharge which
would violate any of the prohibited discharge standards in section
13.20.2.1 of this chapter; and
      4.   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
   B.   Users must notify the city wastewater treatment plant immediately upon
the occurrence of a "slug" or "accidental discharge" of substances prohibited
by this chapter. The notification must include location of discharge, date and
time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions.
Any affected user will be liable for any expense, loss, or damage to the POTW,
in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the city on account thereof
under state or federal law.
   C.   Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge/slug discharge,
the user must submit to the superintendent a detailed written report describing
the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent
similar future occurrences. Such notification does not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor
will such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other
liability which may be imposed by this chapter or other applicable law.
   D.   Within thirty (30) days of a slug discharge, the user must resample its
discharge and demonstrate that the user is in compliance with its discharge
limitations.
   E.   Signs must be permanently posted in conspicuous places on the user's
premises advising employees whom to call in the event of a slug or accidental
discharge. Employers must instruct all employees who may cause or discover such
a discharge with respect to emergency notification procedures. (Ord. 3374 §2,
2010)
13.20.2.12: SEPTIC TANK WASTES:
   A.   Septic tank waste generated in city limits may be introduced into the
POTW only at a designated receiving structure within the treatment plant area,
and at such times as are established by the superintendent. Such wastes cannot
violate this section or any other requirements established or adopted by the
city. Wastewater discharge permits for individual vehicles to use such
facilities will be issued by the superintendent.
   B.   Septage haulers may only discharge loads at locations specifically
designated by the superintendent. No load may be discharged without prior
consent of the superintendent. The superintendent may collect samples of each
hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. The superintendent
may require the hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to
discharge.
   C.   Septage haulers must provide a waste tracking form for every load. This
form must include, at a minimum, the name and address of the waste hauler,
permit number, truck identification, sources of waste, and volume and
characteristics of waste.
   D.   Fees for dumping hauled wastes will be established as part of the user
fee system as authorized in section
13.20.13.1 of this chapter. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
III.   WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT REQUIREMENTS
13.20.3.0: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT REQUIREMENTS:
No significant industrial user can discharge wastewater into the POTW without
first obtaining a wastewater discharge permit from the superintendent. Any
violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge permit is
deemed a violation of this chapter and subjects the wastewater discharge
permittee to the sanctions set out in this chapter. Obtaining a wastewater
discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of his obligation to comply with
all federal and state pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other
requirements of federal, state, and local law.
The superintendent may require other users, including liquid waste haulers, to
obtain wastewater discharge permits (as necessary) to carry out the purposes of
this chapter. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.3.1: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITTING; EXISTING SIU:
Any SIU that was discharging wastewater into the POTW prior to the effective
date of this chapter and that wishes to continue such discharges in the future
must, within sixty (60) days after notification by the superintendent, submit a
permit application to the city in accordance with section
13.20.3.4 of this chapter, and may not cause or allow discharges to the POTW to
continue after sixty (60) days of the effective date of this chapter except in
accordance with a wastewater discharge permit issued by the superintendent.
(Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.3.2: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITTING; NEW SOURCE AND NEW USER:
At least ninety (90) days prior to the anticipated startup, new sources,
sources that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an
applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and new users considered by the
city to fit the definition of SIU, must apply for a wastewater discharge permit
and will be required to submit to the city at least the information listed in
subsections
13.20.3.4A through E of this chapter. A new source or a new user cannot
discharge without first receiving a wastewater discharge permit from the city.
New sources and new users are also required to include in their application
information on the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet
applicable pretreatment standards. New sources and new users shall give
estimates of the information requested in subsections
13.20.3.4D and E of this chapter. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.3.3: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITTING; EXTRAJURISDICTIONAL USERS:
Any existing user located beyond the city limits required to obtain a
wastewater discharge permit must submit a wastewater discharge permit
application as outlined in section
13.20.3.1 of this chapter. New source and new users located beyond the city
limits required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit must comply with
section
13.20.3.2 of this chapter. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.3.4: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT APPLICATION CONTENTS:
All users required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit must submit, at a
minimum, the following information. The superintendent will approve a form to
be used as a permit application. Categorical users submitting the following
information have complied with 40 CFR 403.12(b).
   A.   Identifying Information: The user must submit the name and address of
the facility including the name of the operator and owners; and

Incomplete or inaccurate applications will not be processed and will be
returned to the user for revision. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.3.5: SIGNATORY AND CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENT:
All wastewater discharge permit applications and user reports must be signed by
a responsible officer or manager, or sole proprietor or general partner as
applicable, or duly authorized representative.
   A.   For the purpose of this section, a "responsible officer or manager"
means:
      1.   A president, vice president, secretary, or treasurer of the
corporation in charge of a principal business function, or any other person who
performs similar policy or decision making functions for the corporation, or
      2.   The manager of one or more manufacturing, production, or operating
facilities, provided the manager is authorized to make management decisions
which govern the operation of the regulated facility including having the
explicit or implicit duty of making major capital investment recommendations
and initiating and directing other comprehensive measures to assure long term
environmental compliance with environmental laws and regulations; can ensure
that the necessary systems are established or actions taken to gather complete
and accurate information for control mechanism requirements; and where
authority to sign documents has been assigned or delegated to the manager in
accordance with corporate procedures. This authorization must be made in
writing by the principal executive officer or ranking elected official and
submitted to the approval authority prior to or together with the report being
submitted of the user and contain the following certification statement:
I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were
prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed
to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system,
or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the
information submitted is to the best of my knowledge and belief, true,
accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and
imprisonment for knowing violations.
   B.   A "duly authorized representative" is an individual designated by the
responsible officer, manager, sole proprietor or general partner in writing.
The written authorization must be submitted to the city and also specifies
either an individual or a position having the responsibility of the overall
operation of the facility from which the industrial discharge originates, such
as the position of plant manager, operator of a well, or well field
superintendent, or a position of equivalent responsibility, or having overall
responsibility for environmental matters for the company. If an authorization
in this section is no longer accurate because a different individual or
position has responsibility for the overall operation of the facility, or
overall responsibility for environmental matters for the company, a new
authorization satisfying the requirements of this section must be submitted to
the city prior to or together with any reports to be signed by an authorized
representative. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.3.6: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT DECISIONS:
The superintendent will evaluate the data furnished by the user and may require
additional information. Within sixty (60) days of receipt of a complete
wastewater discharge permit application, the superintendent will determine
whether or not to issue a wastewater discharge permit. Upon a determination to
issue, the permit will be issued within thirty (30) days of full evaluation and
acceptance of the data furnished. The superintendent may deny any application
for a wastewater discharge permit. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)

13.20.3.8: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT APPEALS:
Any person, including the user, may petition the city to reconsider the terms
of a wastewater discharge permit within ten (10) days of its issuance.
   A.   Failure to submit a timely petition for review is deemed to be a waiver
of the administrative appeal.
   B.   In its petition, the appealing party must indicate the wastewater
discharge permit provisions objected to, the reasons for this objection, and
the alternative condition, if any, it seeks to place in the wastewater
discharge permit.
   C.   The effectiveness of the wastewater discharge permit is not stayed
pending the appeal.
   D.   If the city fails to act within thirty (30) days, a request for
reconsideration is deemed to be denied. Decisions not to reconsider a
wastewater discharge permit, not to issue a wastewater discharge permit, or not
to modify a wastewater discharge permit, will be considered final
administrative actions for purposes of judicial review.
   E.   Aggrieved parties seeking judicial review of the final administrative
wastewater discharge permit decision must do so by filing a complaint with the
district court of the first judicial district in and for the county of
Kootenai. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.3.9: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT DURATION:
Wastewater discharge permits will be issued for a specified time period, not to
exceed five (5) years. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued for a period
less than five (5) years, at the discretion of the superintendent. Each
wastewater discharge permit will indicate a specific date upon which it will
expire. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.3.10: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT MODIFICATION:
The superintendent may modify the wastewater discharge permit for good cause
including, but not limited to, the following:
   A.   To incorporate any new or revised federal, state, or local pretreatment
standards or requirements;
   B.   To address significant alterations or additions to the user's
operation, processes, or wastewater volume or character since the time of
wastewater discharge permit issuance;
   C.   A change in the POTW that requires either a temporary or permanent
reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge;
   D.   Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a threat to
the city's POTW, city personnel, or the receiving waters;
   E.   Violation of any terms or conditions of the wastewater discharge
permit;
   F.   Misrepresentations or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in
the wastewater discharge permit application or in any required reporting;
   G.   Revision of or a grant of variance from categorical pretreatment
standards pursuant to 40 CFR 403.13;
   H.   To correct typographical or other errors in the wastewater discharge
permit; or
   I.   To reflect a transfer of the facility ownership and/or operation to a
new owner/operator. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.3.11: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT TRANSFER:
Wastewater discharge permits may be reassigned or transferred to a new owner
and/or operator only if the permittee gives at least thirty (30) days' advance
notice to the superintendent and the superintendent approves the wastewater
discharge permit transfer. The notice to the superintendent must include a
written certification by the new owner and/or operator which:
   A.   States that the new owner and/or operator has no immediate intent to
change the facility's operations and processes; and
   B.   Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur; and
   C.   Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing
wastewater discharge permit.
Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the wastewater
discharge permit voidable as of the date of facility transfer.
Provided that the notice required above occurred and that there were no
significant changes to the manufacturing, operation or wastewater discharge,
the new owner will be considered an existing user and will be covered by the
existing limits and requirements in the previous owner's permit. (Ord. 3374 §2,
2010)
13.20.3.12: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT REVOCATION:
Wastewater discharge permits may be revoked for, but not limited to, the
following reasons:
   A.   Failure to notify the city of significant changes to the wastewater
prior to the changed discharge;
   B.   Failure to provide prior notification to the city of changed
conditions;
   C.   Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in
the wastewater discharge permit application;
   D.   Falsifying self-monitoring reports;
   E.   Tampering with monitoring equipment;
   F.   Refusing to allow the city timely access to the facility premises and
records;
   G.   Failure to meet discharge limitations;
   H.   Failure to pay fines;
   I.   Failure to pay sewer charges;
   J.   Failure to meet compliance schedules;
   K.   Failure to complete a wastewater survey or the wastewater discharge
permit application;
   L.   Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of a permitted
facility; or
   M.   If the city has to invoke its emergency provision as cited in section
13.20.9.7 of this chapter; or
   N.   Violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement, or any terms of
the wastewater discharge permit or this chapter.
Wastewater discharge permits are voidable upon cessation of operations or
transfer of business ownership. All wastewater discharge permits issued to a
particular user are void upon the issuance of a new wastewater discharge permit
to that user. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.3.13: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT REISSUANCE:
A user, required to have a wastewater discharge permit, must apply for
wastewater discharge permit reissuance by submitting a complete wastewater
discharge permit application, in accordance with section
13.20.3.4 of this chapter, a minimum of ninety (90) days prior to the
expiration of the user's existing wastewater discharge permit. A user, whose
existing wastewater discharge permit has expired and who failed to submit its
reapplication in the time period specified herein, will be deemed to be
discharging without a wastewater discharge permit. (Ord. 3675 §2, 2021: Ord.
3374 §2, 2010)
IV. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
13.20.4.1: FINAL COMPLIANCE REPORT (INITIAL COMPLIANCE REPORT):
   A.   Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance by the
significant industrial user with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements set forth in this chapter, in federal categorical standards, or in
a wastewater discharge permit, or, in the case of a new source or a new user
considered by the city to fit the definition of SIU, within ninety (90) days
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, the
affected user must submit to the city a report containing the information
outlined in subsections
13.20.3.4D through F of this chapter.
   B.   For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established by the city in accordance with procedures established in 40 CFR
403.6(c), this report must contain a reasonable measure of the user's long term
production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production (or other measure of operation), this report must include the users
actual production during the appropriate sampling period. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.4.2: PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORT:
   A.   All significant industrial users that are required to have an
industrial waste discharge permit and perform self-monitoring must comply with
all applicable requirements under 40 CFR 403.12 and submit to the city during
the months of June and December, unless required on other dates or more
frequently by the city, a report indicating the nature of the effluent over the
previous reporting period. The frequency of monitoring will be prescribed
within the industrial waste discharge permit. At a minimum, users must sample
their discharge at least twice per year. (In cases where the pretreatment
standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution
prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the
superintendent or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the
compliance status of the user.) All required reports must be submitted to the
city within thirty (30) days of the end date of the reporting time frame and
must be representative of the entire reporting time frame.
   B.   The report must include a record of the concentrations (and mass if
specified in the wastewater discharge permit) of the pollutants listed in the
wastewater discharge permit that were measured and a record of all flow
measurements (average and maximum) taken at the designated sampling locations,
and must also include any additional information required by this chapter or
the wastewater discharge permit. Production data will be reported if required
by the wastewater discharge permit. Both daily maximum and average
concentration (or mass, where required) must be reported. If a user sampled
more frequently than what was required by the city or by this chapter, it must
submit all results of sampling and analysis of the discharge during the
reporting period.
   C.   Any user subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established
by the city or by unit production limits specified in the applicable
categorical standards, must report production data as outlined in subsection
13.20.4.1B of this chapter.
   D.   If the city calculated limits to factor out dilution flows or
nonregulated flows, the discharger will be responsible for providing flows from
the regulated process flows, dilution flows and nonregulated flows.
   E.   Flows will be reported on the basis of actual measurement; provided,
however, that the city may accept reports of average and maximum flows
estimated by verifiable techniques if the city determines that an actual
measurement is not feasible.
   F.   Sampling must be representative of the user's daily operations and must
be taken in accordance with the requirements specified in section
13.20.5.1 of this chapter. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement
facilities must be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good
working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring
facility in good working order will not be grounds for the user to claim that
sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
   G.   The city may require reporting by users that are not required to have
an industrial wastewater discharge permit if information or data is needed to
establish a sewer charge, determine the treatability of the effluent or
determine any other factor which is related to the operation and maintenance of
the sewer system.
   H.   The city may require self-monitoring by the user or, if requested by
the discharger, may agree to perform the periodic compliance monitoring needed
to prepare the periodic compliance report required under this section. If the
city agrees to perform such periodic compliance monitoring, it may charge the
user for such monitoring, based upon the costs incurred by the city for the
sampling and analyses. The city is under no obligation to perform periodic
compliance monitoring for a user.
   I.   All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with section
13.20.3.5 of this chapter. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.4.3: COMPLIANCE SCHEDULES FOR MEETING APPLICABLE PRETREATMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   The schedule will contain increments of progress in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing
preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major
components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc.).
   B.   No increment referred to in subsection A of this section may exceed
nine (9) months.
   C.   Not later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule
and the final date for compliance, the user must submit a progress report to
the city including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment
of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to
comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps
being taken by the user to return the construction to the schedule established.
In no event will more than nine (9) months elapse between such progress
reports.
   D.   It is the user's responsibility to come into compliance as soon as
possible. The user's "good faith" in correcting noncompliance is a factor in
determining enforcement response(s). (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.4.4: NOTIFICATION OF SIGNIFICANT PRODUCTION CHANGES:
Any user operating under any wastewater discharge permit incorporating
equivalent mass or concentration limits must notify the city within two (2)
business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production
level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not
providing a notice of such anticipated change will be required to comply with
the existing limits contained in its wastewater discharge permit. (Ord. 3374
§2, 2010)
13.20.4.5: HAZARDOUS WASTE NOTIFICATION:
Existing users that are discharging fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes
as defined in 40 CFR 261 (listed or characteristic wastes) in a calendar month
or any facility discharging any amount of acutely hazardous wastes as specified
in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) are required to provide a onetime
notification in writing to the city, EPA regional waste management division
director, Coeur d'Alene division of environment. Any existing user exempt from
this notification, must comply with the requirements contained herein within
thirty (30) days of becoming aware of a discharge of fifteen (15) kilograms of
hazardous wastes in a calendar month or the discharge of acutely hazardous
wastes to the city sewer system.
Such notification must include:
   A.   The name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR part 261;
   B.   The EPA hazardous waste number; and
   C.   The type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other).
   D.   If an industrial user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms
of such waste per calendar month to the sewer system, the notification must
also contain the following information to the extent it is known or readily
available to the industrial user:
      1.   An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes;
      2.   An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in
the waste streams discharged during that calendar month; and
      3.   An estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste streams
expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months.
These notification requirements do not apply to pollutants already reported
under the self-monitoring requirements.
Whenever the EPA publishes final rules identifying additional hazardous wastes
or new characteristics of hazardous waste, a user must notify the city of the
discharge of such a substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of
such regulations.
In the case of any notification made under this subsection, an industrial user
must certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.4.6: NOTICE OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS, INCLUDING ACCIDENTAL SPILLS, SLUG
LOADINGS:
   A.   All users must notify the city immediately of all discharges that could
cause problems to the POTW, including any slug loadings, as defined in section
13.20.1.3 of this chapter. The notification must include the concentration and
volume and corrective action. Steps being taken to reduce any adverse impact
should also be noted during the notification. Within five (5) days following
such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the city, submit a detailed
written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be
taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Any user who
discharges a "slug" (or slugs) of prohibited materials shall be liable for any
expense, loss, or damage to the POTW, in addition to the amount of any fines
imposed on the city under state or federal law.
   B.   Significant industrial users are required to notify the city
immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug
discharge. (Line 1773 in EPA Model SUO, 6.6D.) (Ord. 3675 §3, 2021: Ord. 3374
§2, 2010)
13.20.4.7: NONCOMPLIANCE REPORTING:
If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the
city within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user
must within five (5) days of the violation submit to the city in writing, a
detailed report that provides the circumstances of the violation, corrective
preventive action taken, and future actions to prevent reoccurrence of the
violation. The user must also repeat the sampling within five (5) days and
submit the results of the repeat analysis to the city within thirty (30) days
after becoming aware of the violation. Where the city has performed the
sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the city will perform the
repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation and
requires the user to perform the repeat analysis. Resampling is not required
if:
   A.   The city performs sampling at the industrial user's site at least once
per month; or
   B.   The city performs sampling at the user's site between the time when the
initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the city receives
the results of this sampling. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.4.8: NOTIFICATION OF CHANGED DISCHARGE:
All users must promptly notify the city in advance of any substantial change in
the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including significant
manufacturing process changes, pretreatment modifications, and the listed or
characteristic hazardous wastes for which the user has submitted initial
notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p). (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.4.9: REPORTS FROM UNPERMITTED USERS:
All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit will provide
appropriate reports to the city as the superintendent may require. (Ord. 3374
§2, 2010)
13.20.4.10: RECORDKEEPING:
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter must retain, and
make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained
pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter and any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and documentation
associated with best management practices established under subsection
13.20.2.4C of this chapter. Records include the date, exact place, method, and
time of sampling and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates
analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques
or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records must remain
available for a period of at least five (5) years. This period will be
automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user
or POTW, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention
period by the superintendent. (Ord. 3655 §26, 2020: Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
V.    SAMPLING AND ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS
13.20.5.1: SAMPLING REQUIREMENTS FOR USERS:
   A.   Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and
grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other pollutants,
twenty four (24) hour composite samples must be obtained through flow
proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city, the samples must be
representative of the discharge and the decision to allow the alternative
sampling must be documented in the industrial user file for that facility or
facilities. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in
40 CFR part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected
during the twenty four (24) hour period may be composited prior to the analysis
as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be
composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected
by compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the city, as appropriate.
   B.   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety (90)
day compliance reports, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH,
cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds
for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities
for which historical sampling data are available, the city may authorize a
lower minimum. For the reports by 40 CFR 403.12(e) and (h), the city will
require the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by
industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
   C.   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated or
manufacturing process if no pretreatment exists or as determined by the city
and contained in the user's wastewater discharge permit. For categorical users,
if other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to
pretreatment the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to
allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to
evaluate compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standards. For
other SIUs, for which the city has adjusted its local limits to factor out
dilution flows, the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary
to evaluate compliance with the adjusted pretreatment standard(s).
   D.   All sample results must indicate the time, date and place of sampling,
and methods of analysis, and certify that such sampling and analysis is
representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges from the
user. If a user is sampled more frequently than what was required in its
wastewater discharge permit, it must submit all results of sampling and
analysis of the discharge as part of its self-monitoring report. (Ord. 3374 §2,
2010)
13.20.5.2: ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS:
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, shall be performed in
accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR part 136, unless otherwise
specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR part
136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures
approved by the EPA. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.5.3: CITY MONITORING OF USER'S WASTEWATER:
The city will follow the procedures outlined in sections
13.20.5.1 and 13.20.5.2 of this chapter. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
VI.   COMPLIANCE MONITORING
13.20.6.1: INSPECTION AND SAMPLING:
The city has the right to enter the facilities of any user to ascertain whether
the purpose of this chapter, and any wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, is being met and whether the user is complying with all
requirements thereof. Users shall allow the superintendent ready access to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
   A.   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user must make
necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of
suitable identification, the superintendent will be permitted to enter without
delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
   B.   The superintendent has the right to set up on the user's property, or
require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/
or monitoring of the user's operations.
   C.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled must be promptly removed by the user at
the written or verbal request of the superintendent and may not be replaced.
The costs of clearing such access will be borne by the user.
   D.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the superintendent access to the user's
premises is a violation of this chapter. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.6.2: MONITORING FACILITIES:
Each user must provide and operate at its own expense a monitoring facility to
allow inspection, sampling and flow measurements of each sewer discharge to the
city. Each monitoring facility must be situated on the user's premises, except
where such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user,
the city may concur with the facility being constructed in the public street or
sidewalk area; provided, that the facility is located so that it will not be
obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. The superintendent, whenever
applicable, may require the construction and maintenance of sampling facilities
at other locations (for example, at the end of a manufacturing line, wastewater
treatment system).
There must be ample room in or near such sampling facility to allow accurate
sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling and
measuring equipment must be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition at the expense of the discharger.
All monitoring facilities will be constructed and maintained in accordance with
all applicable local construction standards and specifications.
The superintendent may require the user to install monitoring equipment as
necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment will be maintained
at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own
expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality must be
calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
All new commercial and industrial facilities constructed after September 1,
1993, are required to have installed a sewer service cleanout to facilitate
wastewater pretreatment sampling. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.6.3: SEARCH WARRANTS:
If the superintendent has been refused access to a building, structure or
property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need
to inspect as part of a routine inspection program of the city designed to
verify compliance with this chapter or any wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare
of the community, then the superintendent will seek issuance of a search and/or
seizure warrant from the district court of the first judicial district in and
for the county of Kootenai. Such warrant will be served by the superintendent
in the company of a uniformed police officer of the city. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.6.4: VANDALISM:
No person may wilfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface,
tamper with, or prevent access to any structure, appurtenance or equipment, or
other part of the POTW. Any person found in violation of this requirement shall
be subject to the sanctions set out in this chapter. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
VII.    CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
13.20.7.1: CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring
programs, and from city inspection and sampling activities, will be available
to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and
is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city, that the release of
such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. When
requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such
information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might
disclose trade secrets or secret processes will not be made available for
inspection by the public, but will be made available immediately upon request
to governmental agencies for uses related to the IPDES program or pretreatment
program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the
report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data as
defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and
will be available to the public without restriction. (Ord. 3655 §27, 2020: Ord.
3374 §2, 2010)
VIII. PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE
13.20.8.1: PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE:
The city will publish annually, in a newspaper(s) of general circulation that
provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction(s) served by the
POTW, a list of the users who, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in
significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements. For the purposes of this provision, an industrial user is in
significant noncompliance if its violation meets one or more of the following
criteria:
   A.   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined as those in
which sixty six percent (66%) or more of wastewater measurements taken for the
same pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period exceed (by any
magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including
instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1);
   B.   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined as those in which
thirty three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken for each
pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period equals or exceeds the product
of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous
limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1) multiplied by the TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD,
TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
   C.   Any other discharge violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement
as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1) (daily maximum, longer term average,
instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the POTW determines has
caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass-
through (including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general
public);
   D.   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the city's exercise of its
emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; or
   E.   Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or
attaining final compliance; or
   F.   Failure to provide within forty five (45) days after the due date, any
required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance
with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring
reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; or
   G.   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
   H.   Any other violation(s) which may include a violation of best management
practices which the city determines will adversely affect the operation or
implementation of the local pretreatment program. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
IX. ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
13.20.9.1: NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION:
When the superintendent finds that a user has violated (or continues to
violate) any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
superintendent may serve upon that user a written notice of violation via
certified letter. Within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of this notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and
prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, must be submitted by
the user to the superintendent. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the
user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the
notice of violation. Nothing in this section limits the authority of the city
to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement
action, without first issuing a notice of violation. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.9.2: CONSENT ORDERS:
The superintendent may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary
compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user
responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to
be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period
specified by the document. Such documents have the same force and effect as the
administrative orders issued pursuant to sections
13.20.9.4 and 13.20.9.5 of this chapter and are judicially enforceable. Use of
a consent order is not a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.9.3: SHOW CAUSE HEARING:
The superintendent may order, via a certified letter, a user who has violated
or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, to appear before the superintendent and show cause why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice will be served on the
user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement
action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why
the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting
will be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be
served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing is
not a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
user. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.9.4: COMPLIANCE ORDERS:
When the superintendent finds that a user has violated or continues to violate
any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that the user come into compliance within a time specified in the
order. If the user does not come into compliance within the time specified in
the order, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly
operated. Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A
compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a
federal pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order
relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing
violation. Issuance of a compliance order is not a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 3374 §2,
2010)
13.20.9.5: CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS:
When the superintendent finds that a user has violated (or continues to
violate) any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that
the user's past violations are likely to recur, the superintendent may issue an
order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and
directing the user to:
   A.   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
   B.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order is not a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.9.6: ADMINISTRATIVE FINES:
   A.   When the superintendent finds that a user has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
superintendent may fine such user in an amount not to exceed one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00). Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day
basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits,
fines will be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
   B.   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties will, after thirty (30) days, be
assessed an additional penalty of ten percent (10%) of the unpaid balance, and
interest will accrue thereafter at a rate of ten percent (10%) per month. A
lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and
penalties.
   C.   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the superintendent to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine
amount within fifteen (15) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request
has merit, the superintendent may convene a hearing on the matter within thirty
(30) days. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together
with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The
superintendent may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement
actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
   D.   Issuance of an administrative fine is not a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 3374 §2,
2010)
13.20.9.7: EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS:
The superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge (after informal
notice to the user) whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent
or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
superintendent may also immediately suspend a user's discharge (after notice
and opportunity to respond) that threatens to interfere with the operation of
the POTW, or which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment.
   A.   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge must immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the superintendent
will take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the
sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving
stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The superintendent will allow the
user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the
termination proceedings in section
13.20.9.8 of this chapter are initiated against the user.
   B.   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment must submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the superintendent prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under sections
13.20.9.3 and
13.20.9.8 of this chapter.
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to
any emergency suspension under this section. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.9.8: TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE; NONEMERGENCY PROCEDURES:
In addition to the provisions in section
13.20.3.12 of this chapter, any user that violates the following conditions is
subject to discharge termination:
   A.   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; or
   B.   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge; or
   C.   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge; or
   D.   Refusal of access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection,
monitoring or sampling; or
   E.   Violation of the pretreatment standards in sections
13.20.2.1 through
13.20.2.12 of this chapter.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be
offered an opportunity to show cause under section
13.20.9.3 of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise
of this option by the city is not a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
X.    JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
13.20.10.1: INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:
When the superintendent finds that a user has violated (or continues to
violate) any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
superintendent may petition the district court of the first judicial district
in and for the county of Kootenai, for the issuance of a temporary or permanent
injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance
of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this
chapter on activities of the user. The city may also seek such other action as
is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for
the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief
is not a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a
user. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.10.2: CIVIL PENALTIES:
   A.   A user who has violated or continues to violate any provision of this
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement is liable to the city for a maximum civil
penalty of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day. In the case
of a monthly or other long term average discharge limit, penalties will accrue
for each day during the period of the violation.
   B.   The superintendent may recover reasonable attorney fees, court costs,
and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling
and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the
city.
   C.   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court will take into
account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent
of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic
benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user,
the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires.
   D.   Filing a suit for civil penalties is not a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.10.3: CRIMINAL PROSECUTION:
   A.   A user who has wilfully or negligently violated any provision of this
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement is, upon conviction, guilty of a
misdemeanor punishable as provided in title 1, chapter 1.28 of this code.
   B.   A user who has wilfully or negligently introduced any substance into
the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage is, upon conviction,
guilty of a misdemeanor punishable as provided in title 1, chapter 1.28 of this
code. This penalty is in addition to any other cause of action for personal
injury or property damage available under state law.
   C.   A user who knowingly made any false statements, representations, or
certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation
filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter, wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsified, tampered with,
or knowingly rendered inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under
this chapter is, upon conviction, guilty of a misdemeanor punishable as
provided in title 1, chapter 1.28 of this code. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.10.4: REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE:
The provisions in sections
13.20.8 through
13.20.11 of this chapter are not exclusive remedies. The city reserves the
right to take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a
noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in
accordance with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the city
reserves the right to take other action against any user when the circumstances
warrant. Further, the city is empowered to take more than one enforcement
action against any noncompliant user. These actions may be taken concurrently.
(Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
XI. SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION
13.20.11.1: PERFORMANCE BONDS:
The superintendent may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge
permit to any user which has failed to comply with any provision of this
chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement unless such user first files a
satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum not to exceed a value
determined by the superintendent to be necessary to achieve consistent
compliance. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.11.2: LIABILITY INSURANCE:
The superintendent may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge
permit to any user which has failed to comply with any provision of this
chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user first submits
proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair
damage to the POTW caused by its discharge. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.11.3: WATER SUPPLY SEVERANCE:
Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed.
Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has
satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.11.4: PUBLIC NUISANCES:
A violation of any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, is
hereby declared a public nuisance and must be corrected or abated as directed
by the superintendent. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance will be subject
to the provisions of this code governing such nuisances, including reimbursing
the city for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or remedying said
nuisance. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.11.5: INFORMANT REWARDS:
The superintendent may pay up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for
information leading to the discovery of noncompliance by a user. In the event
that the information provided results in an administrative fine or civil
penalty levied against the user, the superintendent may disburse up to ten
percent (10%) of the collected fine or penalty to the informant. However, a
single reward payment may not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). (Ord.
3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.11.6: CONTRACTOR LISTING:
Users who have not achieved compliance with applicable pretreatment standards
and requirements are not eligible to receive a contractual award for the sale
of goods or services to the city. Existing contracts for the sale of goods or
services to the city held by a user found to be in significant noncompliance
with pretreatment standards or requirements may be terminated at the discretion
of the city. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
XII. AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
13.20.12.1: UPSET:
   A.   For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with applicable
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
   B.   An upset constitutes an affirmative defense to an action brought for
noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards if the requirements of
subsection C of this section are met.
   C.   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset must
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      1.   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      2.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      3.   The user has submitted the following information to the POTW and
treatment plant operator within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the
upset if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be
provided within five (5) days:
         a.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         b.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         c.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   D.   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset has the burden of proof.
   E.   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
applicable pretreatment standards.
   F.   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.12.2: PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS:
A user has an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it
for noncompliance with the prohibitions in subsections
13.20.2.1A and B3 through B7 of this chapter if it can prove that it did not
know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass-through or interference and
that either: a) a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user
was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass-
through or interference; or b) no local limit exists, but the discharge did not
change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge
when the city was regularly in compliance with its IPDES permit, and in the
case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements. (Ord. 3655 §28, 2020: Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)
13.20.12.3: BYPASS:
   A.   Definitions: For the purposes of this section:
BYPASS: The intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's
treatment facility.
SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE: Substantial physical damage to property, damage to the
treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and
permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur
in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss
caused by delays in production.
   B.   Essential Maintenance: A user may allow any bypass to occur which does
not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it
is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are
not subject to the provision of subsections C and D of this section.
   C.   Notice Of Bypass:
      1.   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it must submit
notice to the POTW, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if
possible.
      2.   A user must submit oral notice to the city of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty four (24)
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission will
also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission must contain a description of the bypass and its
cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the
bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue;
and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of
the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on a case by case basis if
the oral report has been received within twenty four (24) hours.
   D.   Bypass Conditions:
      1.   Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take an enforcement action
against a user for a bypass, unless:
         a.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         b.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         c.   The user submitted notices as required under subsection C of this
section.
      2.   The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three (3)
conditions listed in this subsection D. (Ord. 3374 §2, 2010)

any kind into the city water supply system. It is unlawful for any person
receiving water from the city water system to install or maintain any cross
connection within the city of Coeur d'Alene. (Ord. 3525, 2015)
13.24.040: BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICES AND ASSEMBLIES; REQUIREMENTS,
INSTALLATION AND TESTING:
   A.   An approved backflow prevention device or assembly must be installed by
the property owner, tenant, occupant, lessee or other user of city water where
the nature and extent of the activities conducted or the materials used or
stored on the premises would present an actual or potential hazard to the
public health or be deleterious to the quality of the city water supply should
a cross connection occur. The need for a backflow prevention device or assembly
must be reevaluated whenever a new potential hazard is introduced to the
property. The backflow assembly must be installed in a manner that complies
with city water department standard drawings. Even though cross connections may
not exist at the time, an approved backflow prevention device or assembly must
be installed under the following circumstances:
      1.   Premises having an auxiliary water supply (the unapproved auxiliary
supply or well may be abandoned in the manner required by IDAPA 37.03.09 rather
than installing a backflow prevention assembly/device. A subsequent inspection
by the water superintendent will be required to determine that all cross
connections have been eliminated at the property);
      2.   Premises having internal cross connections that are not correctable,
or having intricate plumbing arrangements which make it impracticable to
ascertain whether or not cross connections exist;
      3.   Premises where entry is restricted so that inspections for cross
connections cannot reasonably be made;
      4.   Premises having a history of cross connections being established or
reestablished;
      5.   Premises on which any substance is handled under pressure so as to
permit the entry of such substance into the public water supply;
      6.   Premises having pumps or other assemblies that may exceed dynamic
pressure in the city water mains and/or service lines between the mains and the
meters.
   B.   All backflow prevention devices or assemblies shall be installed by the
property owner at the owner's expense, and shall be of a type commensurate with
the highest degree of hazard which exists or which could exist. Appropriate
backflow protection shall meet the requirements of IDAPA 58.01.08.543.01 and
IDAPA 58.01.08.552.06b. All backflow prevention assemblies and the installation
thereof shall be approved by the city water superintendent.
   C.   All backflow prevention assemblies installed pursuant to this chapter,
except atmospheric vacuum breakers, shall be inspected and pass an approved
performance test by an Idaho licensed tester at the time of initial
installation and annually thereafter. The city water superintendent may require
more frequent testing if repeated performance failures, severe health hazards,
repeated annual noncompliance, or other factors that pose a risk to the city
public water system are encountered. Whenever a backflow prevention assembly is
found to be defective, it shall be repaired, or overhauled with original
manufacturer replacement parts, or replaced at the owner's expense. Only
approved test cock fittings or protective caps will be installed in the
assembly's test cocks. Test cocks will be kept free of other tangible physical
matter at all times. The city water superintendent shall retain adequate
records of all inspections, tests or repairs made pursuant to this chapter.
   D.   All residential and commercial irrigation backflow assemblies shall be
tested annually at start up or before July 1 of each calendar year, whichever
comes first.
   E.   If a backflow prevention assembly is found to be necessary, the owner,
tenant, occupant or lessee of the property shall apply in writing to the city
building department for a plumbing permit, specifying the type and location of
such assembly. It is unlawful to install, relocate or remove a backflow
prevention assembly without a permit. Any backflow prevention assembly that has
been installed, relocated, removed, and reinstalled shall pass a performance
test prior to being placed into service.
   F.   Pursuant to IDAPA 58.01.08.552.06.e if a backflow assembly fails
testing and it cannot be repaired immediately, the tester must notify the city
water superintendent of the failed test as soon as possible and in no event
later than two (2) business days following the failed test. If the assembly
cannot be repaired or replaced within ten (10) business days of notification,
water service to the property may be terminated until the approved backflow
prevention assembly can be repaired or replaced and pass a performance test.
   G.   A passing performance test report must be filed with the city water
superintendent by the backflow assembly tester within twenty (20) calendar days
of conducting the performance test. Test reports filed after this period of
time may be considered invalid. (Ord. 3525, 2015)
13.24.050: INSPECTION OF NEW OR EXISTING STRUCTURES OR IMPROVEMENTS AND
TERMINATION OF WATER SUPPLY:
Any new or existing building, improvement, or structure of any type receiving
water from the city public water system shall be open, at all reasonable times,
to inspections by the city water superintendent. Whenever a cross connection or
other source of contamination to the public water supply is found, or it is
determined that a backflow prevention assembly is necessary, the city may cease
delivery of water to such premises as provided for in section
13.24.060 of this chapter. (Ord. 3525, 2015)
13.24.060: ENFORCEMENT AND DAMAGES:
   A.   In addition to all other lawful measures, the city water superintendent
is authorized to disconnect city water system users from the city public water
system for violations of this chapter. Except in cases of emergency or where
the violation causes an imminent threat to the public water system, the water
superintendent will, prior to disconnection, send notice to the property owner
by first class mail at the address on record with the county assessor's office
at least thirty (30) days prior to disconnection. The notice will explain the
violation and the steps necessary to prevent disconnection. The property shall
be physically posted with a copy of said thirty (30) day notice and a
subsequent five (5) day disconnection notice prior to service termination.
   B.   An administrative fee, in an amount set by resolution of the city
council, will be added to the water bill of each customer sent a thirty (30)
day disconnection notice and the five (5) day disconnection notice for
violations of this chapter.
   C.   Irrigation contractors and others providing irrigation blow out
services for hire, will be held liable for all damages incurred by the city as
a result of improper connection or introduction of air into the customer's
domestic service and/or the city water mains. Damages may include, but not be
limited to:
      1.   All labor involved;

13.30.050: PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
The following performance standards are applicable to all design, construction,
implementation, and maintenance of stormwater management systems pursuant to
this chapter:
   A.   All activities subject to the requirements of this chapter shall be
carried out in a manner that ensures that runoff of storm or other natural
surface waters shall not be accelerated, concentrated, or otherwise conveyed
beyond the exterior property lines or project boundaries of the project in
question. Existing and/or proposed off site public street drainage shall be
detained separately from the on site drainage. All stormwater facilities and
BMPs required for the project must be constructed within the project boundary
or property lines.
      1.   Exceptions: Runoff of storm or other surface waters may be conveyed
beyond the exterior property lines or project boundaries if:
         a.   Done in accordance with the provisions of a joint stormwater
management agreement approved in writing by the city; or
         b.   The downstream property received drainage prior to development.
In this case, flow may not be concentrated onto downstream properties where
sheet flow previously existed. In no event will there be a measurable increase
in the peak rate of runoff from the site after development when compared with
the runoff rate in the undeveloped state for a 25-year storm.
         c.   Runoff may be conveyed beyond property lines onto public rights
of way where necessary to obtain site access via driveways, curb cuts or other
access points.
   B.   Erosion, sediment, or discharge of pollutants, resulting from
construction activities, which enter onto public property or private property
not controlled by the permit holder, shall be eliminated to the maximum extent
practicable unless otherwise permitted or exempted under this chapter.
   C.   All construction activity commenced pursuant to an approved stormwater
management plan or site development permit must at all times comply with the
conditions of the plan or permit. The permit holder is responsible for ensuring
their contractor(s), subcontractor(s), utility trenching subcontractor(s), and
all other persons entering the site abide by the conditions of the permit. The
permit holder's signature or that of his authorized agent on the permit shall
constitute an agreement by the permit holder to accept responsibility for
meeting the conditions of the permit.
   D.   No construction activity shall take place without a valid stormwater
management plan. If a permit has been suspended or revoked, or has expired, all
work covered by the plan shall cease until a new plan is issued.
   E.   All necessary action shall be taken to minimize the depositing and
tracking of mud, dirt, sand, gravel, rock or debris on or onto the public right
of way. The owner of the site of the construction activity or the permit holder
with respect to the construction site shall be responsible for any cleanup of
the public rights of way or private property not under the permit holder's
control necessitated from any tracking or depositing of mud, dirt, sand,
gravel, rock or debris, or shall reimburse the city for any expenses incurred
by the city to effectuate the cleanup. At a minimum, all public rights of way
shall be cleaned curb to curb on a weekly basis.
   F.   Construction ramps shall be constructed of material that will not erode
or deteriorate under adverse conditions, and shall not be placed in a manner as
to interfere with or block the passage of stormwater runoff.
   G.   No debris, dirt, aggregate or excavated materials, or construction
supplies, shall be placed on the public right of way unless specifically
permitted by the city in writing. In addition, public sidewalks shall not be
removed, blocked, or otherwise rendered unusable by construction activity,
equipment or materials, or portable toilets, unless a safe, usable alternate
walkway, as approved by the city, is placed on the same side of the right of
way by the contractor.
   H.   No owner or lessee of real property shall allow the property to be
unoccupied, unused, vacant or undeveloped after the topsoil has been disturbed
or the natural cover removed, unless control measures are undertaken to prevent
mud, sand, dirt and gravel, or other material from migrating off site and
entering the public right of way or a stormwater system.
   I.   All temporary erosion/sediment and construction waste control measures
shall be removed after final site stabilization. Trapped sediment and other
disturbed soil areas resulting from the removal of temporary measures shall be
permanently stabilized within twenty one (21) days from removal of the
temporary measures.
   J.   Channels which collect or concentrate stormwater shall be protected
against erosion and contain energy dissipation measures to prevent erosion on
adjoining lands. Existing unprotected channels shall be protected against
further erosion in the course of site development. Any site development or
construction shall preserve the existing stormwater management improvements.
   K.   Sediment resulting from erosion of disturbed soils shall be detained on
site. Sediment shall either be stabilized on site or removed in an approved
manner.
   L.   Any and all collected stormwater runoff shall be directed to
infiltration basins or to an approved BMP. Permanent treatment of stormwater
runoff shall be accomplished by directing all runoff to an infiltration basin
or to an approved BMP.
      1.   Exceptions: Runoff may be discharged directly into dry wells or
other overflow structures under the following circumstances:
         a.   When the increase in impervious surface, resulting from new
construction or addition to existing structures, is less than three thousand
(3,000) square feet.
         b.   Runoff from roofs.
   M.   When existing streets are widened or otherwise improved, runoff from
the new impervious surface may be directed into existing storm drain facilities
if the existing storm drain facility has sufficient capacity to accommodate the
increased runoff. (Ord. 3455, 2012)
13.30.060: DESIGN STANDARDS:
   A.   General Standards: All stormwater facilities shall incorporate the
following design standards:
      1.   All conveyance facilities shall be designed to accommodate a 25-year
storm event.
      2.   When on site facilities must accommodate drainage from off site,
such conveyance facilities shall be designed to accommodate a 50-year storm
event.
      3.   Peak flows shall be calculated by the rational method for areas ten
(10) acres or less. Peak flows shall be calculated by the soil conservation
service (SCS) method TR-55, for areas greater than ten (10) acres. Other
methods may be approved by the city.
      4.   The intensity-duration curves from the Idaho transportation
department shall be used for the rational method.
   B.   Erosion, Sediment And Construction Site Waste Control: The design,
testing, installation, and maintenance of erosion, sediment and construction
site waste controls, as detailed in the stormwater management plan, shall be in
accordance with city BMPs.

following design standards:
      1.   Infiltration basins shall be designed either to retain and treat a
volume equal to one-half inch (1/2") of runoff over the tributary impervious
area, including roofs or to infiltrate a storm event of 0.1 inch per hour.
      2.   Infiltration basins designed to detain the treatment volume shall be
a maximum of six inches (6") from the lowest point of the swale to the inlet of
the overflow structure.
      3.   Infiltration basins shall have a minimum infiltration rate of 0.5
inch per hour.
      4.   Infiltration basins shall be planted and maintained with grass and/
or other vegetative cover approved by the city. An encroachment permit issued
by the city pursuant to title 12, chapter 12.44 of this code must be obtained
before starting any landscaping work in infiltration basins located in city
rights of way.
      5.   Infiltration basins must be renovated when they do not meet the
minimum infiltration rate or when the vegetative cover dies.
      6.   Infiltration basins shall contain dry wells, or an equivalent
approved by the city engineer, to accommodate overflow.
      7.   Where infiltration basins will be located between curb and sidewalk,
both curb and sidewalk shall be considered an integral part of the storm
management system and shall be installed with the infiltration basin. (Ord.
3455, 2012)
13.30.070: GUARANTEE OF INSTALLATION:
   A.   No building permit, final plat approval, or other discretionary
approval shall be granted until the stormwater management plan has been
approved by the city.
   B.   Except as allowed by title 16, chapter 16.45 of this code, no building
permit will be issued for new subdivisions until the stormwater management
system, including infiltration basins, curb and sidewalks, has been constructed
for the developed portion and will accept the flow of stormwater as designed.
For all other cases, no certificate of occupancy will be issued until the
stormwater management system has been installed and will accept the flow of
stormwater as designed.
      1.   Exception: If, in the judgment of the administrator, project
occupancy can be achieved without harm to the environment or potential
occupants, occupancy may proceed upon receipt of an acceptable guarantee of
financial surety, pursuant to section
15.08.075 of this code, to complete installation when weather conditions or
other variables allow but in no event more than six (6) months after occupancy.
In no case shall such guarantee be allowed if the incomplete improvements would
result in increased erosion, sedimentation, or other damage to the development,
public improvements, surface or subsurface waters, the proposed stormwater
management system or otherwise endanger the public health or safety.
   C.   At any time, the city may stop work on the installation of subdivision
improvements, withhold further issuance of building permits in a development,
stop work on any individual building or development of any individual building
site, or otherwise take steps necessary to ensure that the development meets
the requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 3455, 2012)
13.30.080: INSPECTIONS:
All construction activities which require a permit or have the potential to
impact stormwater discharge or create a discharge to the stormwater collection
system shall be subject to the inspection provisions of this section.
   A.   The city maintains the right to inspect any site of construction
activity that has been issued a permit or is required to have a permit issued.
   B.   Sites shall be required to undergo and pass a city inspection upon
completion of the installation of temporary erosion, sediment and construction
waste controls, and upon completion of the final grading and/or the permanent
drainage and erosion control facilities. The permit holder shall be responsible
for scheduling these inspections through the city building department.
Inspections must be requested at least forty eight (48) hours prior to the
desired time of inspection. Additional inspections may also occur as deemed
necessary by the city.
   C.   When an inspection is required under this chapter, no work shall
proceed until completion of the inspection and approval from the authorized
city agent conducting the inspection. (Ord. 3455, 2012)

violation of this chapter. (Ord. 3455, 2012)
13.30.110: PROHIBITED CONDUCT:
No person shall damage, harm, fail to install, complete, or maintain, or
otherwise impair the functioning of infiltration basins or the future
functioning of areas designed as an infiltration basin or approved methods of
transmission of stormwater to an infiltration basin or any portion of a
stormwater management system installed pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 3455,
2012)
13.30.120: ENFORCEMENT:
Provisions of this chapter may be enforced in one or more of the following
manners:
   A.   Any person violating any of the provisions or failing to comply with
any of the mandatory requirements of this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor
and shall be punished as provided by title 1, chapter 1.28 of this code.
      1.   Each such person is guilty of a separate offense for each and every
day during which any violation of any provision of this chapter is committed,
continued, or permitted by any such person, and he shall be punished
accordingly.
   B.   By civil action to compel performance and completion of, or maintenance
of, facilities installed pursuant to this chapter.
   C.   Denying, revoking, or suspending building permits or certificates of
occupancy, as the case may be.

system except where such discharges satisfy one of the following three (3)
conditions:
   A.   The nonstormwater discharges are in compliance with a separate NPDES
permit, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all
requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and
regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted by the city
for any discharge to the storm drain system.
   B.   The nonstormwater discharges result from a spill and are the result of
an unusual and severe weather event where reasonable and prudent measures have
been taken to minimize the impact of such discharge; or consist of emergency
discharges required to prevent imminent threat to human health or severe
property damage, provided that reasonable and prudent measures have been taken
to minimize the impact of such discharges.
   C.   The nonstormwater discharges satisfy all of the following conditions:
      1.   The discharges consist of uncontaminated water line flushing;
potable water sources; landscape irrigation (provided all pesticides,
herbicides and fertilizer have been applied in accordance with the
manufacturer's instructions); flows from riparian habitats and wetlands;
diverted stream flows; springs; rising groundwater; uncontaminated groundwater
infiltration (as defined at 40 CFR 35.2005(20)) to separate storm sewers;

designated beneficial uses in receiving waters (deleterious materials are
generally substances that taint edible species of fish, cause taste in drinking
waters, or cause harm to fish or other aquatic life);
         d.   Contains radioactive materials or radioactivity at levels
exceeding the values listed in 10 CFR part 20 in receiving waters;
         e.   Contains floating, suspended, or submerged matter of any kind in
concentrations causing nuisance or objectionable conditions or in
concentrations that may impair designated beneficial uses in receiving waters;
         f.   Contains excessive nutrients that can cause visible slime growths
or other nuisance aquatic growths that impair designated beneficial uses in
receiving waters;
         g.   Contains oxygen demanding materials in concentrations that would
result in anaerobic water conditions in receiving waters; or
         h.   Contains sediment above quantities specified in IDAPA
58.01.02.250.02(e) or in the absence of specific sediment criteria, above
quantities that impair beneficial uses in receiving waters; or
         i.   Contains material in concentrations that exceed applicable
natural background conditions in receiving waters (IDAPA 58.01.02.200.09).
Temperature levels may be increased above natural background conditions when
allowed under IDAPA 58.01.02.401. (Ord. 3455, 2012)
13.32.080: PROHIBITION OF ILLICIT CONNECTIONS:
   A.   The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit
connections to the drainage system is prohibited.
   B.   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made prior to the enactment of this chapter, regardless of whether
the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing
at the time of connection.
   C.   A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the person
connects a line conveying sewage or other nonstormwater discharges to the
drainage system, or allows such a connection to continue, without written
approval from the city. (Ord. 3455, 2012)
13.32.090: SUSPENSION OF MUNICIPAL SEPARATE STORM SEWER SYSTEM ACCESS:
   A.   Suspension Due To Illicit Discharges In Emergency Situations: The city
may, without prior notice, suspend drainage system access to a person or entity
when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the drainage system
or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a
suspension order issued in an emergency, the city may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the drainage system or waters of the
United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
   B.   Termination Due To The Detection Of Illicit Discharge: Any person
discharging to the drainage system in violation of this chapter may have their
drainage system access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an
illicit discharge. The city will notify the violator of the proposed
termination of its drainage system access. Notification will be made in writing
by certified mail to the owner of the property from which the illicit discharge
is being made at the last known mailing address of said property owner on
record with the Kootenai County assessor. The notice will include a description
of the violation and set forth the time allowed for compliance.
   C.   Written Approval Required For Reinstatement: Written approval from the
city must be obtained prior to reinstating or reconnecting any access to the
drainage system that was terminated as authorized under this section. (Ord.
3455, 2012)

determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has security measures
in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into
its premises, the discharger must make the necessary arrangements to allow
access to the administrator.
      2.   Facility operators must allow the administrator ready access to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and
copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to
discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined
by state and federal law related to said discharges.
      3.   The city has the right to set up on any permitted facility such
devices as are necessary in the opinion of the administrator to conduct
monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge.
      4.   The city has the right to require the discharger to install

CALCULATION OF IMPACT FEES
SECTION:
14.05.010: Calculation of Impact Fees
14.05.010: CALCULATION OF IMPACT FEES:
   A.   Procedure: The City shall calculate the amount of the Impact Fee due
for each Building Permit, Site Development Permit, and Manufactured/Mobile Home
installation permit by the procedure set forth in the Report within thirty (30)
days of submittal of complete permit plans for residential Development and
within sixty (60) days of submittal of complete permit plans for non-
residential Development.
   B.   Validity: The calculation of a Development Impact Fee shall be in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Development Impact
Fee shall not be deemed invalid because payment of the fee may result in an
incidental benefit to owners or developers within the Service Area other than
the person paying the fee.
   C.   Levels Of Service: A Development Impact Fee shall be calculated on the
basis of Levels of Service for Public Facilities adopted in this Title and in
the Report that are applicable to existing Development as well as new growth
and Development. The construction, improvement, expansion, or enlargement of
new or existing Public Facilities for which a Development Impact Fee is imposed
must be attributable to the capacity demands generated by the new Development.
   D.   Mixed Uses: If the Development for which a Building Permit, Site
Development Permit, or Manufactured/Mobile Home installation permit is sought
contains a mix of uses, the Impact Fee will be calculated for each type of
Development.
   E.   Certification: Prior to making an application for a Building Permit,
Site Development Permit, Manufactured/Mobile Home installation permit, a
prospective applicant may request in writing a written certification of the
Development Impact Fee schedule or individual assessment for a particular
Project which shall establish the Development Impact Fee for a period of one
year from the date of certification. The certification shall include an
explanation of the calculation of the Impact Fee including an explanation of
Public Facilities considered under Idaho Code § 67-8207. The certification
shall specify the System Improvement(s) for which the Impact Fee is intended to
be used.
   F.   Individual Assessment: Individual assessment of Impact Fees is
permitted in situations where the Fee Payer can demonstrate by clear and
convincing evidence that the established Impact Fee is inappropriate.
      1.   An individual assessment of Development Impact Fees may be requested
by application to the Building Official, or designee, prior to submitting an
application for a Building Permit, Development Permit, Manufactured/Mobile Home
installation permit, or other necessary approval from the City. The Building
Official, or designee, shall evaluate the application for an individual
assessment under the guidelines provided for in paragraph 4 below.
      2.   Late applications for individual assessments may be submitted within
thirty (30) days after the receipt of a Building Permit only if the Fee Payer
makes a showing that the facts supporting such application were not known or
discoverable prior to receipt of a Building Permit and that undue hardship
would result if said application is not considered.
      3.   The Building Official, or designee, shall render a written decision
regarding the request for an individual assessment within thirty (30) days of
the date a complete application is submitted. The decision of the Building
Official, or designee, shall establish the Impact Fee for the Project in
question for a period of one (1) year from the date said decision becomes
final.
      4.   The Building Official, or designee, shall evaluate an application
for an individual assessment and may approve a different Impact Fee if the Fee
Payer has shown by clear and convincing evidence that the Impact Fee
established by this Chapter is inappropriate and that the following facts and
conditions exist:
         a.   Exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions apply to
the Development that do not apply generally to other properties in the
Development; and
         b.   An individual assessment is necessary for the reasonable and fair
Development of the property; and
         c.   The approval of the individual assessment will not be materially
detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property in the vicinity of
the Development; and
         d.   The approval of the individual assessment will not adversely
affect the Capital Improvements Plan of the City.
      5.   The applicant may appeal the determination by the Building Official,
or designee, on the application for an individual assessment by the filing of
an appeal with the City Clerk within thirty (30) days of the date of mailing or
personal delivery of written notice of the decision of the Building Official,
or designee. The appeal will be heard by the City Council, which shall make the
final determination on the application.
   G.   Determination Of Impact Fees and Trip Generation Rates: The Impact Fees
and trip generation rates (as determined by the latest edition of the Institute
of Traffic Engineers’ trip generation manual) are set forth in the Report,,
Addendum A. The City Council may set impact fees and trip generation rates by
Resolution and modify the same by Resolution as allowed by law.

14.17.060: INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENT:
   A.   Requesting an Individual Assessment. In lieu of paying the KCEMSS
Impact Fee pursuant to the adopted fee schedule, a person may file a request
with the City, at the time of permit application, to determine the amount of
the KCEMSS impact fee through an individual assessment process.
   B.   Required Information. An individual assessment requires a consideration
of studies, data, and any other relevant information submitted by the Applicant
in order to adjust the amount of the KCEMSS Impact Fee. If a person files a
request for an individual assessment, the person shall be responsible for
retaining, at the person’s sole expense, a qualified professional to calculate
an individual assessment that complies with the requirements of this Chapter.
The information provided by the Applicant must establish that the resulting
individual assessment complies with the requirements of this Chapter and that
the resulting individual assessment is a more accurate measure of the
Applicant’s proportionate share of the cost of System Improvements. The
analysis must be based on KCEMSS’s adopted levels of service and the unit costs
for System Improvements used in the Capital Improvement Plan, and use an
average cost (not a marginal cost) methodology. All information upon which the
calculated individual assessment is based must be provided to the City within
thirty (30) days after filing the request for individual assessment.
   C.   Transmission to KCEMSS. Upon receipt of information supporting a
request for individual assessment, the City will transmit the request and the

thirty (30) days following receipt of the request and information from the City
unless the Applicant and KCEMSS agree to an extension. KCEMSS may accept or
reject the calculated individualized assessment or accept the assessment in
part based on KCEMSS’s evaluation of whether the individual assessment is a
more accurate measure of demand for System Improvements created by the proposed
Development. KCEMSS shall provide its written determination to the Applicant
and the City. The evaluation shall document the relevant methodologies and
assumptions used by KCEMSS and include an explanation of the calculation of the
KCEMSS Impact Fee, specify the System Improvement(s) for which the KCEMSS
Impact Fee is intended to be used, and provide an explanation of those factors
identified in Idaho Code § 67-8207.
   E.   Assessment of Individual Impact Fee. Upon receipt of the final
determination from KCEMSS, the City will assess and collect the KCEMSS Impact
Fee for the Development Approval using the fee set out in KCEMSS’s final
determination. (Ord. 3717, 6-6-2023)
14.17.070: EXTRAORDINARY IMPACTS:
   A.   Initial Determination of Potential Extraordinary Impact. If the City
determines that an Extraordinary Impact exists, the City will notify the
Applicant and submit the application, along with the City’s determination, to
KCEMSS within seven (7) days after making its determination. KCEMSS must then
review the application and determine whether the Development will create an
Extraordinary Impact for KCEMSS. Unless the Applicant agrees to a longer time,
KCEMSS must notify the Applicant and the City within thirty (30) days after
KCEMSS’s receipt of the application whether KCEMSS believes that the
Development creates an Extraordinary Impact.
   B.   Establishment of Impact Fee if No Extraordinary Impact. If KCEMSS does
not believe that the Development creates Extraordinary Impact, or if KCEMSS
does not respond within the time allowed, the City will assess the KCEMSS
Impact Fees calculated in accordance with the adopted fee schedule. If KCEMSS
believes that the Development creates an Extraordinary Impact, KCEMSS must
include in its notice a statement that the potential impacts of such
Development Approval on System Improvements are not adequately addressed by the
Capital Improvements Plan, and that a supplemental study, at the Applicant’s
expense, will be required.
   C.   Meeting with Applicant. Within thirty (30) days after KCEMSS’s notice
to the City and the Applicant that the Development application may create an
Extraordinary Impact, KCEMSS must meet with the Applicant to discuss whether
the Applicant wants to:
      1.   Pay for the supplemental study necessary to determine the System
Improvements Costs related to the proposed Development Approval;
      2.   Modify the proposal to avoid generating Extraordinary Impact; or
      3.   Withdraw the application.
   D.   Additional Study. If the Applicant agrees to pay for a supplemental
study required to document the proposed Development Approval’s Proportionate
Share of System Improvements Costs, then KCEMSS and the Applicant will jointly
select a consultant to perform the study. The Applicant must agree to enter
into a written agreement with the consultant to pay the costs of the study. The
agreement must require that the supplemental study be completed within thirty
(30) days from the date the agreement is executed unless the Applicant agrees
to a longer time.
   E.   Results of Study. Once the study is completed, the Applicant may choose
to:
      1.   Pay the Proportionate Share of System Improvements Costs documented
by the supplemental study;
      2.   Modify the proposed Development to reduce such costs; or
      3.   Withdraw the application.
If the Applicant agrees to pay the System Improvements Costs documented in the
supplemental study, the Applicant and KCEMSS will provide the City a signed
written agreement indicating that both parties accept results of the
supplemental study and agree to the amount of the KCEMSS Impact Fees to be
assessed.
   F.   No Building Permit or other equivalent City approval shall be issued
for Development unless the required impact fee is paid. (Ord. 3723, 1-2-2024:
Ord. 3717, 6-6-2023)
14.17.080: CREDITS AND REIMBURSEMENTS:
   A.   Credits. A credit or reimbursement may be claimed for the present value
of any System Improvements constructed by the Applicant, or for the Present
Value of any dedication of land or money required by KCEMSS towards a System
Improvement of the category for which the KCEMSS Impact Fee is collected
including System Improvements paid for by the Applicant as a part of a local
improvement district. Credit will also be given for the present value of all
tax and user fee revenue paid by the Applicant within the Service Area that was
assessed and used by KCEMSS for System Improvements of the category for which
the KCEMSS Impact Fee is collected. Alternatively, an Applicant may request a
reimbursement of KCEMSS Impact Fees paid as provided by this Section.
   B.   Limitations. Credits or reimbursements against a KCEMSS Impact Fee will
not be given for Project Improvements. Credits issued for one Capital
Improvements Element may not be used to reduce the impact fee due for a
different Capital Improvement.
   C.   Requesting a Credit or Reimbursement. To request a credit or
reimbursement against a KCEMSS Impact Fee, an Applicant must submit a request
to KCEMSS to negotiate an agreement concerning the amount of the credit or
reimbursement as required by Idaho Code § 67-8209(4) prior to submitting a
Building Permit application with the City. The request should provide
sufficient detail to allow KCEMSS to determine whether a credit or
reimbursement is warranted.
   D.   Evaluation and Agreement. After receipt of the written request for
credit or reimbursement, KCEMSS must review the request and determine whether
the land or System Improvements meet the requirements of this Section and Idaho
Code § 67-8209. If a credit or reimbursement is due, KCEMSS and the Applicant
will negotiate an agreement, in good faith, setting forth the amount of credit
or reimbursement due the Applicant, the time and form of the credit or
reimbursement, and a term not exceeding ten (10) years. KCEMSS must complete
its review and determination of an application within thirty (30) days after
receipt of an application for credit or reimbursement.
   E.   Valuation. Credit or reimbursement will be given for the present value
of the land dedication or improvement as follows:
      1.   Credit for qualifying land dedications will, at the Applicant’s
option, be valued at one hundred percent (100%) of the most recent assessed
value for such land as shown in the records of the county assessor, or the fair
market value established by a private appraiser acceptable to KCEMSS in an
appraisal paid for by the Applicant.
      2.   Credit for qualifying acquisition or construction of System
Improvements will be valued by KCEMSS at the present value of such improvements
based on complete engineering drawings, specifications, and construction cost
estimates submitted by the Applicant to KCEMSS. KCEMSS will determine the
amount of credit due based on the information submitted, or, if it determines
that such information is inaccurate or unreliable, then on alternative
engineering or construction costs acceptable to KCEMSS as a more accurate
measure of the value of the offered System Improvements to KCEMSS.
   F.   Credits Exceeding Fee Amounts Due. If the credit due to an Applicant
exceeds the KCEMSS Impact Fee that would otherwise be due from the Applicant
pursuant to this Chapter, the Applicant may choose to receive such credit in
the form of either:
      1.   A credit against future KCEMSS Impact Fees for the same category of
System Improvements; or
      2.   A reimbursement from KCEMSS Impact Fees paid by future Development
that impacts the System Improvements contributed or dedicated by the Applicant.
   G.   Final Determination of Credit and Payment of Reimbursement. KCEMSS’s
determination of whether a credit or reimbursement is due is final, and KCEMSS
is solely responsible for the determination and payment of any reimbursement to
the Applicant. (Ord. 3717, 6-6-2023)
14.17.090: PAYMENT OF FEES:
   A.   Payment of Impact Fee. The KCEMSS Impact Fees assessed by this Chapter
will be paid to the City at the times listed in Coeur d’Alene Municipal Code §

Fee Schedule in effect at the time the application is submitted.
   B.   Transfer of Collected Fees to KCEMSS. All KCEMSS Impact Fees collected
by the City will be transferred to KCEMSS monthly.
   C.   Certification of Amount. After the KCEMSS Impact Fees for a proposed
Development have been calculated as authorized by this Chapter, the Applicant
may request that the City or KCEMSS, whichever calculated the fee, provide a
certification of the amount of KCEMSS Impact Fees for that Development. Within
thirty (30) days after receiving such request, the City or KCEMSS, whichever
calculated the fee, will issue a written certification to the Applicant of the
amount of the KCEMSS Impact Fees due for the Development. The certification
will be binding so long as there is no material change to the Development or to
the adopted impact fee schedule prior to the issuance of permits. The
certification must include an explanation of the calculation of the KCEMSS
Impact Fees, including an explanation of factors considered under Idaho Code §
67-8207, and specify the System Improvement(s) for which the KCEMSS Impact Fees
are intended to be used.
   D.   Payment Under Protest. Development Approval will not be granted until
the required KCEMSS Impact Fees have been paid. The Applicant may elect to pay
the fees under protest and seek a refund from KCEMSS. (Ord. 3723, 1-2-2024:
Ord. 3717, 6-6-2023)
14.17.100: METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING KCEMSS IMPACT FEES:
KCEMSS Impact Fees must be based on a study, prepared by KCEMSS in accordance

(3). (Ord. 3717, 6-6-2023)
14.17.120: KCEMSS ACCOUNTING FOR IMPACT FEES:
   A.   Trust Account. Prior to the City transferring Impact Fees to KCEMSS,
KCEMSS must establish a trust account, meeting the requirements of Idaho Code §
67-8210(1). Upon confirmation that KCEMSS has established the necessary trust
account, the City will begin remitting Impact Fees to KCEMSS. KCEMSS must
maintain an impact fee trust account while the City is collecting impact fees
on its behalf.
   B.   Expenditures. All expenditures of Impact Fees by KCEMSS must be in
accordance with Idaho Code § 67-8210.
   C.   Annual Capital Budget. KCEMSS must annually adopt a capital budget.

are to be observed in addition to the requirements of the currently adopted
edition of the international fire code. Where requirements conflict the
provisions of this section apply.
   B.   Permit Required: A blasting permit shall be required prior to the use
of any explosive within the city. Permits will be issued by the fire department
after compliance with the requirements of this section.
   C.   Site Plan Required: The application for a blasting permit must be
accompanied by a site plan of the proposed blasting operation that identifies
all utilities and structures within a one hundred foot (100') radius of each
explosive blast. The site plan must also identify the proposed location of all
seismographic sensing devices.
   D.   Insurance Required: Before a permit for the use of explosives is
issued, the applicant must file with the city a liability insurance policy,

principal amount of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) combined single limit
for the purpose of the payment of all damages to persons or property which
arise from or are caused by the conduct of any act authorized by the permit.
The insurance policy must be certified by the maker or underwriter to be
unencumbered by claims or legal proceedings which may reduce available coverage
below the one million dollar ($1,000,000.00) limit. The fire chief may require
a greater or lesser amount of coverage when, in his opinion, conditions at the
location of use indicate a greater or lesser amount of coverage is required.
Public agencies and utilities shall be exempt from this insurance requirement.
   E.   Release Of Liability: Before any permit shall issue the applicant for
said permit shall agree in writing to indemnify, defend and hold the city and
its officers, agents and employees harmless from any and all liability
resulting from the issuance of the blasting permit and any blasting activity
associated with the permit.
   F.   Demonstrated Lack Of Alternate Method: Prior to the issuance of a
blasting permit the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city
engineer that excavation cannot be accomplished by use of suitable power
excavation equipment. "Suitable power excavation equipment" is defined as a
single-tooth ripper pulled by a crawler type tractor having a flywheel rating
of not less than three hundred (300) horsepower. When, in the opinion of the
city engineer, the circumstances of the proposed blasting make the requirement
of this subsection impractical, the demonstration may be waived.

The legislature of the state of Idaho in Idaho Code 46-1020 through 46-1024,
authorized local government units to adopt a floodplain map and floodplain
management ordinance that identifies floodplains and that sets forth minimum
development requirements in floodplains that are designed to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. (Ord. 3380 §7, 2010)
15.32.020: PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   A.   Require that development that is vulnerable to floods, including
structures and facilities necessary for the general health, safety and welfare
of citizens, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   B.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights,
velocities, or erosion;
   C.   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage or erosion;
   D.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or that may increase flood hazards to other
lands;
   E.   Preserve and restore natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural
protective barriers which carry and store floodwaters. (Ord. 3380 §7, 2010)
15.32.030: APPLICABILITY:

15.32.040: DEFINITIONS:
Unless the context indicates otherwise, the following terms, used in this
chapter, have the following meanings:
ACCESSORY STRUCTURE: A structure on the same lot or parcel as a principal
structure, the use of which is incidental and subordinate to the principal
structure. An insurable building should not be classified as an accessory or
appurtenant structure.
APPEAL: A request for review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation
of provisions of this chapter.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO or AH zone on a community's flood
insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet (3'),
and/or where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of
flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be
evident.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
Zone designations on FIRMs include the letters A, AE, V. Also known as the
special flood hazard area (SFHA).
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded each year.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): The water surface elevation during the base flood
in relation to a specified datum. The base flood elevation (BFE) is depicted on
the FIRM to the nearest foot and in the FIS to the nearest 0.10 foot.
BASEMENT: The portion of a structure including crawl space with its floor
subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.
BUILDING: See definition of Structure.
CRITICAL FACILITY: A facility that is critical for the health and welfare of
the population and is especially important following hazard events. Critical
facilities include essential facilities, transportation systems, lifeline
utility systems, high potential loss facilities and hazardous material
facilities.
DATUM: The vertical datum is a base measurement point (or set of points) from
which all elevations are determined. The vertical datum currently adopted by
the federal government as a basis for measuring heights is the North American
vertical datum of 1988 (NAVD88).
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation, drilling operations, and permanent
storage of equipment or materials.
DIGITAL FIRM (DFIRM): Digital flood information rate map. It depicts flood risk
and zones and flood risk information. The DFIRM presents the flood risk
information in a format suitable for electronic mapping applications.
EXISTING CONSTRUCTION: A structure for which the "start of construction"
commenced before May 3, 2010.
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision where the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading
or the pouring of concrete pads) was completed before May 3, 2010.
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The preparation
of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of
utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the
pouring of concrete pads.
FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA): The agency with the overall
responsibility for administering the national flood insurance program.
FLOOD FRINGE: The portion of the floodplain outside of the floodway covered by
floodwaters during the regulatory flood.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): An official map of a community, issued by the
federal insurance administration, delineating the areas of special flood hazard
and/or risk premium zones applicable to the community.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS): The official report by the federal insurance
administration evaluating flood hazards and containing flood profiles, floodway
boundaries and water surface elevations of the base flood.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal
waters or the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (FPE): An elevation that corresponds to the
elevation of the one percent (1%) chance annual flood (100-year flood) plus any
increase in elevation due to floodway encroachment, plus any required
freeboard. The city does not allow an increase in water surface elevation in
the floodway and no additional freeboard is required. Therefore the flood
protection elevation is equal to the base flood elevation plus the floodway
elevation, if present, plus zero freeboard.
FLOODPLAIN 1 : The land that has been or may be covered by floodwaters, or is
surrounded by floodwater and inaccessible, during the occurrence of the
regulatory flood. The riverine floodplain includes the floodway and the flood
fringe.
FLOODWAY (REGULATORY FLOODWAY): The channel of a river or other watercourse and
those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to discharge
and store the floodwater or flood flows associated with the regulatory flood.
FREEBOARD: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for
the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the
many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the
height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as
wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams and the hydrologic
effects of urbanization in a watershed.
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT FACILITY: A facility that cannot be used for its
intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to
water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and
unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, or ship repair facilities. The
term does not include long term storage, manufacture, sales, or service
facilities.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE (HAG): The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed walls of a structure.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE: A structure that is:
   A.   Listed individually in the national register of historic places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. department of interior) or preliminarily
determined by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the national register.
   B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or to a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify
as a registered historic district.
   C.   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places and
determined as eligible by states with historic preservation programs which have
been approved by the secretary of the interior, or
   D.   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places and
determined as eligible by communities with historic preservation programs that
have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the
secretary of the interior, or directly by the secretary of the interior in
states without approved programs.
LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC): An official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs are issued in the following
categories:
   A.   Letter Of Map Amendment (LOMA): A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
   B.   Letter Of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data
showing that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones,
flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric
features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination that a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is excluded from the special flood hazard areas.
   C.   Conditional Letter Of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and comment
by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum national
flood insurance program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does not amend
or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and floodway
maps, or flood insurance studies.
LEVEE: A manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed according to sound engineering practices, to contain, control, or
divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.
LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees,
and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE (LAG): The lowest point of the ground level next to the
structure.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement)
used for living purposes, which includes working, storage, cooking and eating,
or recreation, or any combination thereof. This includes any floor that could
be converted to such a use including a basement or crawl space. An unfinished
or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building
access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a
structure's lowest floor. The lowest floor is a determinate for the flood
insurance premium for a building, home or business.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections built on
a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured
home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
MEAN SEA LEVEL: For purposes of the national flood insurance program, the
national geodetic vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base
flood elevations shown on a community's FIRM are referenced.

after May 3, 2010, and includes the subsequent improvements to the structure.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A place where the construction of
facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be
affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the
construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete
pads) is completed on or after May 3, 2010.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle that is:
   A.   Built on a single chassis,
   B.   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection,
   C.   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towed by a light duty
truck, and
   D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
REGULATORY FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation.
REPETITIVE LOSS: Flood related damages sustained by a structure on two (2)
separate occasions during a ten (10) year period for which the cost of repairs
at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds twenty
five percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before the damages
occurred.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement and means the date the
development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not the alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of its market value before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction"
of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred
"repetitive loss" or "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The market value of the structure should be the appraised value of
the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or, in
the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring.
This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage,
regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. The term does not
include either:
   A.   A project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations
of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications, which have
been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the
minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or
   B.   Alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the North American vertical
datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other specified datum) of floods of various magnitudes
and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. (Ord. 3386 §1,
2010: Ord. 3380 §7, 2010)

obligations or duties of the floodplain administrator. (Ord. 3380 §7, 2010)
15.32.080: DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE ADMINISTRATOR:
The duties of the floodplain administrator include, but are not limited to:
   A.   Review of all floodplain development permit applications to assure that
the permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
   B.   When base flood elevation data or floodway data are not available, then
the floodplain administrator will obtain, review and reasonably utilize any
base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other
source in order to administer the provisions of this chapter.
   C.   Obtain, verify and record the actual elevation in relation to the
vertical datum on the effective FIRM, or highest adjacent grade, of the lowest
floor level, including basement, of all new construction or substantially
improved structures.
   D.   Obtain, verify and record the actual elevation, in relation to the
vertical datum on the effective FIRM to which any new or substantially improved

   E.   When floodproofing is utilized for a structure, the floodplain
administrator must obtain certification of design criteria from a registered
professional engineer or architect.
   F.   Where interpretation is needed of the exact location of boundaries of
the areas of special flood hazard including regulatory floodway (for example,
where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions) the floodplain administrator will make the interpretation.
   G.   Review proposed development to assure that necessary permits have been
received from governmental agencies from which approval is required by federal
or state law, including section 404 of the federal water pollution control act
amendments of 1972, 33 USC 1334; the endangered species act of 1973, 16 USC
1531-1544; and state of Idaho stream channel alteration permits. (Ord. 3380 §7,

      5.   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of a proposed development; and
   B.   Construction stage:
      1.   For all new construction and substantial improvements, the permit
holder must provide to the floodplain administrator an as built certification
of the floor elevation or floodproofing level, using appropriate FEMA elevation
or floodproofing certificate, immediately after the lowest floor or
floodproofing is completed. When floodproofing is utilized for nonresidential
structures, the certification must be prepared by or under the direct
supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by same.
      2.   Certificate deficiencies identified by the floodplain administrator
must be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to work
proceeding. Failure to submit certification or failure to make the corrections
will be cause for the floodplain administrator to issue a stop work order for
the project.
      3.   The floodplain development permit will expire along with any
associated building and/or site development permit issued by the city or one
hundred eighty (180) days after the floodplain development permit is issued
whichever is later. (Ord. 3380 §7, 2010)

   G.   On site waste disposal systems must be located and constructed to avoid
functional impairment, or contamination from them, during flooding.
   H.   In areas where a regulatory floodway has not been designated, no new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill)
is permitted within zones A1-30 and AE on the FIRM, unless it is demonstrated
that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood at any point within the community. (Ord. 3380 §7,
2010)
15.32.130: SPECIFIC PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION IN RESIDENTIAL
CONSTRUCTION:
Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction or substantial
improvement of any residential structure or manufactured home must have the
lowest floor, including basement, constructed at or above the flood protection
elevation. All new construction or substantial improvements of an existing
residential structure that includes a fully enclosed area located below the
lowest floor formed by the foundation and other exterior walls must be designed
to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure must be
designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for
the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. Designs for complying with this
requirement must be certified by a licensed professional engineer or architect
or meet the following minimum criteria:
   A.   Provide a minimum of two (2) openings meeting the following criteria:
      1.   A total net area of not less than one square inch for every square
foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;

the higher of the exterior or interior grade or floor immediately below the
opening;
      3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in
both directions without manual intervention.
   B.   To comply with the "lowest floor" criteria of this chapter, the
unfinished or flood resistant enclosure can only be used for parking of
vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the
premises, or entry to the elevated area.
   C.   The interior portion of such enclosed area cannot be partitioned or
finished into separate rooms.
   D.   For crawl space foundation types, construction must follow FEMA
guidelines, specifically:
      1.   Below grade crawl spaces are prohibited at sites where the velocity
of floodwaters exceed five feet (5') per second;
      2.   Interior grade of the crawl space below the BFE cannot be more than
two feet (2') below the lowest adjacent exterior grade (LAG);
      3.   Height of the below grade crawl space, measured from the lowest
interior grade of the crawl space to the bottom of the floor joist must not
exceed four feet (4') at any point;
      4.   Contain an adequate drainage system that removes floodwaters from
the interior area of the crawl space. (Ord. 3380 §7, 2010)

CONSTRUCTION:
New construction or the substantial improvement of any nonresidential structure
located in zones A1-30, AE, or AH must be floodproofed if the new construction
or improvement is not elevated to or above the flood protection elevation. The
structure and attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be
watertight to the flood protection elevation or to one foot (1') above the base
flood elevation, whichever is higher, with walls substantially impermeable to
the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A
licensed professional engineer or architect must certify that the design and
methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice
for meeting these provisions, and must provide the certificate to the
administrator. (Ord. 3380 §7, 2010)
15.32.150: SPECIFIC PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION FOR MANUFACTURED
HOMES:
In all areas of special flood hazard where the base flood elevation is
established, these standards for manufactured homes apply:
   A.   All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in the
following areas must have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the
flood protection elevation:
      1.   On individual lots or parcels;
      2.   In new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or
subdivisions; and
      3.   In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions,
or on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a
manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood.
   B.   Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that either:
      1.   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to the flood
protection elevation or one foot (1') above the level of the base flood
elevation, whichever is higher; or
      2.   The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by
reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent
strength) of no less than thirty six inches (36") above the highest adjacent
grade.
   C.   Manufactured homes must be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement. Methods of anchoring include, but are not limited to, use of
over the top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard applies in addition
to, and consistent with, all applicable state requirements.
   D.   Manufactured homes placed on solid perimeter walls must meet the flood
vent requirements in section
15.32.130 of this chapter. (Ord. 3380 §7, 2010)
15.32.160: SPECIFIC PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION FOR ACCESSORY
STRUCTURES:
Relief from the elevation or dry floodproofing standards may be granted for an
accessory structure four hundred (400) square feet or smaller in size if the
structure meets the following standards:
   A.   It is not used for human habitation;
   B.   It is constructed of flood resistant materials;
   C.   It is constructed and placed on the lot so as to offer the minimum

system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and
security devices, and have no permanently attached structures or addition; or
   C.   The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new
construction of manufactured homes found in section
15.32.150 of this chapter, including the anchoring and elevation requirements.
(Ord. 3380 §7, 2010)
15.32.180: ENCROACHMENTS INTO A REGULATORY FLOODWAY:
The following provisions apply to encroachments into the regulatory floodway:
   A.   An encroachment in the floodway or floodplain cannot cause an increase
in the base flood elevation.
   B.   A project in the regulatory floodway must undergo an encroachment
review to determine its effect on flood flows. The encroachment analysis must
include:
      1.   Determination and documentation that filling, grading, or
construction of a structure will not obstruct flood flows and will not cause an
increase in the base flood elevation upstream or adjacent to the project site;
      2.   Determination and documentation that grading, excavation, channel
improvements, bridge and culvert replacements that remove an obstruction, do
not cause increases in downstream flood flows;
      3.   Certification and documentation by a licensed professional engineer
that the project will not result in a rise in flood heights.
   C.   When the proposed encroachment requires modifications to the regulatory
floodway in order to avoid raising the base flood elevation, the applicants are
required to obtain a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) from FEMA prior
to issuance of a floodplain development permit. Once construction is completed
the applicant must apply to FEMA for a letter of map revision for changes to
the flood hazard map proposed in the CLOMR. (Ord. 3380 §7, 2010)
15.32.190: ALTERATION OF A REGULATORY FLOODWAY:
   A.   Any proposed alterations to a regulatory floodway require a floodplain
development permit and the applicant is required to obtain a conditional letter
of map revision (CLOMR) from FEMA prior to start of construction. A floodway is
considered altered when there are any substantial changes to the cross
sectional area or geometry, horizontal or vertical location of the streambed,
or similar modifications. It is the responsibility of the applicant to have
technical data prepared in a format required for a conditional letter of map
revision or letter of map revision and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant. Proposed alterations include:
      1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
      2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures where
the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard area;
      3.   Alteration of floodways that result in a relocation or elimination
of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of culverts;
      4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring
establishment of base flood elevations.
   B.   The bank full flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the floodway cannot be diminished. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must perform an analysis meeting the
requirements of subsection
15.32.180B of this chapter and submit certification by a registered
professional engineer that the bank full flood carrying capacity of the
floodway will not be diminished.
   C.   The applicant must notify adjacent communities (if applicable), the
U.S. army corps of engineers, and the Idaho department of water resources
stream channel alteration program prior to any alteration or relocation of a
floodway. Evidence of notifications must be submitted to the floodplain
administrator and to the federal emergency management agency.
   D.   The applicant is responsible for providing the necessary maintenance
for the altered or relocated portion of the floodway so that the flood carrying
capacity will not be diminished.
   E.   Once construction is completed the applicant must apply to FEMA for a
letter of map revision for changes to the flood hazard map proposed in the
CLOMR. (Ord. 3380 §7, 2010)
15.32.200: VARIANCE PROCEDURE:
   A.   Application For Variance:
      1.   An application for a variance must be submitted to the city clerk on
the required form and include, at a minimum, the same information required for
a development permit and an explanation for the basis for the variance request.
      2.   Upon receipt of a completed application for a variance, the request
will be set for public hearing at the next city council meeting in which time
is available for the matter to be heard.
      3.   Prior to the public hearing, notice of the hearing will be published
in the official newspaper of the city at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
hearing. In addition to the newspaper publication, written notice shall be
provided to all adjoining property owners.
      4.   The applicant must show that the variance is warranted and meets the
criteria established in this section.
   B.   Variance Criteria:
      1.   Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the
elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a small or irregularly shaped lot contiguous to
and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level. As the lot size increases the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
      2.   Variances pertain to a physical piece of property; they are not
personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants,
economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in
densely populated residential neighborhoods.
      3.   Variances will only be issued for nonresidential buildings in very
limited circumstances.
      4.   Variances may be issued upon:
         a.   A showing by the applicant of good and sufficient cause;
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances;
         c.   A determination that a variance request within a designated
floodway will not result in any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge;
         d.   A determination that the variance request is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   C.   Decision: The decision to grant or deny a variance will be in writing
and explain the reasons for the approval or denial. If the variance is granted,
the decision will also advise the property owner that the permitted building
will have its lowest floor below the flood protection elevation and that the
cost of flood insurance likely will be commensurate with the increased flood
damage risk. (Ord. 3380 §7, 2010)
15.32.210: APPEAL PROCEDURE:
   A.   An appeal may be filed with the city clerk within fourteen (14) days of
the date of any permit denial or interpretation of this chapter by the
floodplain administrator. Failure to timely file an appeal shall be considered
a failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The appeal must set out the
denial or interpretation of the administrator and a narrative setting forth the
facts relied upon by the appellant and the appellant's claim regarding the
error made by the administrator.
   B.   Upon receipt of a completed appeal, the appeal will be scheduled for
hearing at the next available city council meeting. The city council will
consider the following in ruling on an appeal:
      1.   All technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified
in other sections of this chapter;
      2.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      3.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      4.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effects of such damage on the individual landowner;
      5.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      6.   The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      7.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      8.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      9.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;

15.50.110: FINDINGS, PURPOSE, INTENT, SEVERABILITY:
   A.   Based on evidence collected by and for multiple communities over many
years, the City has determined that Signs can obstruct views, distract
motorists, displace alternative uses for land, and affect the aesthetics of a
community.
   B.   The City finds and declares that it is necessary to regulate the
construction, erection, maintenance, electrification, illumination, type, size,
number, and location of Signs to:
      1.   protect the health, safety, property, and welfare of the public;
      2.   improve the neat, clean, and orderly appearance of the City;
      3.   provide for informational needs of the public;
      4.   preserve and protect the scenic beauty of the City;
      5.   promote traffic safety; and
      6.   promote a healthy business climate in the City.
   C.   It is the intent of the City to regulate Signs in a manner consistent
with the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I,
Section 9, of the Idaho Constitution.
   D.   The provisions of the Sign Code are severable. If any provision,
clause, sentence, subsection, word, or part hereof is held illegal, invalid,
unconstitutional, or inapplicable to any person or circumstance, such
illegality, invalidity, unconstitutionality, or inapplicability shall not
affect or impair any of the remaining provisions, clauses, sentences,
subsections, words, or parts of the Sign Code or their applicability to other
persons or circumstances. (Ord. 3698 §3, 2022)
15.50.120: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   No person shall erect or place a Sign without a permit issued by the
City unless exempted by the Sign Code.
   B.   A Sign must be constructed of suitable materials, in accordance with
sound structural practices, in compliance with all applicable codes, designed
and lettered in a professional manner, and maintained in good repair.
   C.   Except as specifically allowed by the Sign Code, no Sign shall be
erected or placed on public property, within a public right-of-way, in the
vision triangle of an intersection, or in such a manner as to obstruct a
traffic control device or governmental sign. The “vision triangle” is
determined by measuring from the intersection of the edges of two (2) adjacent
roadways forty feet (40') along each roadway and connecting the two (2) points
with a straight line.
   D.   No Sign shall be erected or placed on a tree, utility pole, retaining
wall, or fence not owned by the Sign owner, or in such a manner as to obstruct
a door, window, or fire escape.
   E.   A commercial Sign is not allowed in a residential zone or on property
used for non-transient residential purposes, except for a Sign related to a
home occupation for which a certificate has been issued pursuant to the Coeur
d’Alene Municipal Code.
   F.   A Sign which is obscene or which contains an obscene message, as
determined by community standards, is prohibited.
   G.   A Sign must comply with the requirements of the Sign Code in effect at
the time the application for the Sign is submitted.
   H.   The owner of the property on which the Sign is or will be located, the
applicant for the Sign permit, the campaign, and the owner of the Sign are
jointly responsible for compliance with the provisions of the Sign Code. (Ord.

   C.   Billboards and other Off-premises signs.
      1.   Except as otherwise provided in this section, Billboards are
prohibited in the City.
      2.   Billboards that were lawful on December 1, 2019, may remain in

record within three hundred feet (300') feet of the external boundaries of the
land where relocation is being considered. Notice shall also be posted on the
property on which the Billboard will be located not less than one (1) week
prior to the hearing;
         i.   Council may approve the relocation of a Billboard upon finding:
            (1)   That the purposes of the Sign Code, as set out in Coeur
d’Alene Municipal Code § 15.50.110, are furthered by the relocation; and
            (2)   That the proposed Billboard meets the Standards contained in
this section; and
            (3)   That the Billboard will not result in a negative impact to
the visual quality of general area as determined from the perspective of a
reasonable person applying community standards; and
            (4)   That the Billboard is designed to be as compatible in
appearance and layout with adjacent uses as is practical as determined from the
perspective of a reasonable person applying community standards; and
            (5)   That the Billboard does not block the view from a public
right-of-way of a structure of historical or architectural significance; and
            (6)   That the height of the Billboard is compatible with buildings

         g.   No Billboard shall be relocated within one hundred fifty feet
(150') of an intersection, measured perpendicular to the nearest public right-
of-way line for the crossing street; and

            (4)   Accurate architectural renderings and elevations, a scaled
site plan, and photo simulations showing the locations of all existing
structures and improvements, and the proposed Billboard;
         m.   A Billboard shall not be relocated in such a manner as to impede

15.50.400(C). The City Council will consider the request for a variance in
conjunction with the application for relocation. A variance may only be granted
upon a showing of undue hardship due to site characteristics and if approval of
the variance would not be contrary to the public interest or the purposes of
this Section.
   D.   Illumination and Electronic Message Displays.
      1.   Illumination must not create an unsafe or hazardous distraction to a
motorist, a pedestrian, or the general public.
      2.   Any illuminated or lighted Sign, including an Electronic Message

lot. (Ord. 3560, 2017: Ord. 3485, 2014)
16.15.170: LOT SIZE:
Lot widths and areas must conform with the requirements of the zoning district
and any zoning overlay district in which the lot is located, except that corner
lots for which side yards are required shall have extra width to permit
appropriate setbacks from and orientation to both streets. Lot depths must be
suitable for the land use proposed. (Ord. 3485, 2014)
16.15.180: DOUBLE FRONTAGE LOTS:
   A.   Residential lots that have street frontage along two (2) opposite
boundaries are not allowed except for reverse frontage lots which are essential
to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries, or to
overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
   B.   For such lots, in order to improve the visual quality of the
streetscape, and to provide adequate protection from the street, landscaped
buffer areas must be provided along single-family residential lots whose
property lines are adjacent and parallel to collector and/or arterial streets.
      1.   Perimeter Landscape Buffer:
         a.   The buffer must be located outside of any planned future right of
way, and should not be used for future roadway improvements.
         b.   The width of the buffer along arterial streets must be a minimum
of thirty feet (30'). The width of the buffer along collector streets must be a
minimum of twenty feet (20'). Where a subdivision requiring a buffer is less
than five (5) acres in size, and located in a developed area where existing
subdivisions without buffers abut the adjacent streets, the planting strip must
be at least ten feet (10') in width.
         c.   Buffer zones must be dedicated on the final plat as tracts.
      2.   Buffer Design Standards: The design of the buffer must comply with
the following standards:
         a.   Landscaping, as used herein, must include as a minimum, grass,
native and other drought resistant vegetation and street trees as required by
the city. Nonvegetative materials, such as decorative rock, bark, and
permabark, may not be used in lieu of landscaping. However, nonvegetative
material may be used to augment the landscape or around the base of shrub
groupings or flowerbeds as long as the coverage does not exceed twenty percent
(20%). The use of bark or other loose material shall be designed or located to
keep the bark from being blown onto the paved path.
         b.   The twenty percent (20%) limitation on nonvegetative material
does not apply if the landscape is designed by a licensed landscape architect
and the nonvegetative material is used to complement or visually enhance the
vegetative material.
         c.   A permanent irrigation system must be provided for all landscaped
areas. The use of hose bibs on the exterior of existing or proposed structures
is not an acceptable method of landscape irrigation, unless the landscaped area
is adjacent to the existing or proposed structure. All irrigation systems and
landscaped areas must be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained so as
to promote water conservation and prevent overflow or seepage into adjacent
streets or sidewalks/trails.
      3.   Maintenance: The developer is required to form a property owners'
association prior to final plat, with said buffers to be owned and maintained
by a perpetual property owners' association. Alternatively, if the subdivision
has only one lot fronting on a collector or minor arterial, a homeowners'
association will not be required for the maintenance of the greenbelt if a
nonrevocable covenant, approved by the city, is recorded against the property
fronting the greenbelt memorializing the obligation.
      4.   Completion Time:
         a.   All improvements required by this section must be installed prior
to final plat approval or occupancy of a building subject to development
review.
         b.   The planning director may authorize a delay in the completion of
planting during the months of October through March. Should a delay be granted,
a bond or other sufficient security, approved by the city attorney, equal to
one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the costs of landscaping, must be provided
by the owner/developer and held by the city until the required landscaping is
complete. No final certificate of occupancy will be issued until the
landscaping is complete. (Ord. 3485, 2014)

and open space development and connectivity to the city's parks and trail
system, the provision of city utility services, and to familiarize the
developer with the comprehensive plan, the parks master plan, the zoning
ordinance, and the subdivision ordinance. The planning director, after
consulting affected departments, may allow for application submission prior to
the six (6) week deadline in cases where adequate discussion of city criteria
and standards have taken place and may waive the requirement for a
preapplication meeting for short plats if he or she determines that the short

16.40.010: GENERALLY:
Developers seeking final plat approval must first design and install the
subdivision improvements required by this chapter and titles 15 and 17 of this
code or secure the completion of the required improvements as allowed by
chapter 16.45 of this title. Improvement design must be completed by an
engineer licensed by the state of Idaho and submitted to the city engineer for
approval prior to construction and final plat approval. All improvements must
be constructed under the supervision of the design engineer in a manner that
complies with the city's construction standards. (Ord. 3485, 2014)
16.40.020: CAPACITY AND DIMENSIONS OF UTILITIES TO PROVIDE FOR FUTURE
DEVELOPMENT:
The capacities and dimensions of water, sewerage, drainage and street
facilities must be adequate to provide for the future needs as identified in
the approved utility master plans. The city may share in the cost of these
improvements to the extent of the difference in cost between the capacities
needed to serve the subdivision and the capacities required to serve the
vicinity. (Ord. 3485, 2014)
16.40.030: STREET WIDTHS:
   A.   All streets must be improved in accordance with the following schedules
of widths, measured from the inside edge of opposite curbs. Street widths must
also conform to the requirements of the currently adopted fire code.
Class Of Street Width Of Street
Class Of Street                      Width Of Street
Arterial                             64 feet minimum
Collector                            40 feet minimum
Local streets:                        
 Primary frontage                   32 feet minimum
 Secondary frontage, parking 1 side 28 feet minimum
 Secondary frontage, no parking     24 feet minimum
Cul-de-sac                           50 foot radius
Rural minor access                   24 feet minimum
 
   B.   Existing improved streets lying along the boundary of a subdivision but
not improved to city standards, must be improved by the developer to the center
of the street. New unimproved streets adjacent to a subdivision must be
improved by the developer to the required full width if the subdivision will
directly access the street or use it for ingress or egress.
   C.   As an alternative to installing improvements on existing streets the
developer may/shall pay to the city, in lieu of said improvements, money in an
amount equal to one hundred ten percent (110%) of the estimated present cost of
such improvements. The estimate must be approved by the city engineer. This
alternative may be utilized if in the opinion of the city engineer the
following conditions are met:
      1.   The improvement of a street lying along the boundary of a
subdivision would create drainage problems due to difficulties matching the
existing centerline profile to the future curb profile; or
      2.   The improvement of the street only would create a significant

sufficient security acceptable to the city attorney for the purpose of
warrantying that the required public subdivision improvements will properly
perform free from defects for at least one year and that sufficient funds will
be available to maintain or correct defects for the one year period.
   B.   The maintenance/warranty bond or other security must be in an amount
approved by the city engineer and represent either ten percent (10%) of the
amount of the original improvement security, or ten percent (10%) of the
estimated cost of the public subdivision improvements. The maintenance/warranty
bond or other security must have a term of at least one year from the date of
acceptance by the city council of all required public subdivision requirements.
   C.   The maintenance/warranty bond or other security may be released by the
city clerk upon termination of the one year warranty period; provided, that all
defects have been satisfactorily repaired. The city engineer will provide

17.01.010: TITLE OF ZONING ORDINANCE:
The provisions of this title shall be known as the ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY
OF COEUR D'ALENE. (Ord. 1691 §1(part), 1982)
17.01.015: PURPOSES OF ZONING ORDINANCE:
   A.   The comprehensive plan and the zoning ordinance together make up part
of the land use control system for the city of Coeur d'Alene. Planning and
zoning, by its nature, is composed of two (2) time frames: the current day to
day zoning activity, and the future planning objectives. Zoning must be
specific and regulatory in nature. Planning, on the other hand, is abstract and
objectively oriented.
   B.   Zoning conforms and implements today's needs with the goals and
objectives of the future, as expressed in the comprehensive plan. Thus, the
zoning ordinance continues to be more restrictive than the comprehensive plan;
however, no conflict should be perceived from these differences. The following
zoning ordinance represents a first step toward the goals of the community as
established in the comprehensive plan. The consistency of this step must be
measured by the zoning ordinance, the comprehensive plan, and also by the
practicalities of daily life which moderate our city's strides toward those
goals. In this sense, the zoning ordinance can only be required to conform with
but not exactly replicate the comprehensive plan.
   C.   The general purposes of the zoning ordinance are to protect and promote
the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare and to achieve the
following objectives:
      1.   To promote the achievement of the policies of the Coeur d'Alene
comprehensive plan.
      2.   To protect the land resources, and residential, commercial,
manufacturing, civic, hazard and other specially designated areas from the
intrusion of incompatible uses.
      3.   To provide for desirable, appropriately located living areas in a
variety of dwelling types and at a wide range of population densities, with
adequate provision for sunlight, fresh air, and usable open space and with
minimal adverse environmental factors.
      4.   To ensure preservation of adequate space for agricultural,
commercial, manufacturing, and other activities necessary for a healthy
economy.
      5.   To provide opportunities for establishments to concentrate for
efficient operation in mutually beneficial relationship to each other and to
shared services.
      6.   To promote safe, and orderly movement of people and goods, and the
provision of adequate off street parking and loading.
      7.   To achieve excellence and originality of design in all future
developments and to preserve the natural beauty of the city of Coeur d'Alene.
      8.   To guide the growth and productivity of the city of Coeur d'Alene's
economy.
      9.   To plan for future development of the city of Coeur d'Alene, thereby
providing a basis for wise decisions with respect to such development.
      10.   To protect property rights and enhance property values.
      11.   To encourage beautification of existing and newly developed
neighborhoods or areas through the use of underground utilities and
landscaping.
      12.   To discourage the unnecessary destruction or impairment of
structures, or other physical features, sites and areas of special character or
special historical, cultural, educational, architectural, aesthetic or
environmental interest or value.
      13.   To encourage the highest and best use of land in conformance with
the Comprehensive Plan.
      14.   To ensure that land use decisions are not contrary to the public
interest. (Ord. 3380 §5, 2010)
17.01.020: APPLICABILITY OF ZONING ORDINANCE:
   A.   Property To Which Applicable: The zoning ordinance shall apply, to the
extent permissible under other laws, to all property within the City of Coeur
d'Alene.
   B.   Private Agreements: The zoning ordinance is not intended to abrogate,
annul or impair any easement, covenant, or other agreement between parties,
except that where the zoning ordinance imposes a greater restriction or higher
standard than that required by such agreement, the zoning ordinance shall
control.
   C.   Conflicting Provisions: Wherever the requirements of this section are
in conflict with the requirements of this or any other lawfully adopted
ordinances, rules, or regulations, the most restrictive or that imposing the
higher standards shall govern with the one exception that this provision shall
not be construed as to prohibit the use of planned unit developments.
   D.   Public Rights-Of-Way: Unless the context indicates otherwise, the
provisions of this title do not apply to the use of, or improvements or
projects occurring solely within, public rights-of-way. (Ord. 3379 §3, 2010)

The agreement must run with the land and not be terminable without the prior
authorization of the city council. (Ord. 3268 §23, 2006)
17.05.727: BASIC DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS; FEES IN LIEU OF PARKING:
Instead of furnishing the off street parking spaces required for uses within
the DC district, in-lieu payments may be made as set forth in this section.
   A.   Fee Established: The city council shall, after public hearing, adopt a
resolution setting out the value of off street parking spaces. The fees, at the
time of adoption, should reflect the cost of acquiring property within the DC
district for the construction of parking stalls based on the average tax
assessed market valuation of property within the district. The fee is to be
calculated as follows: Average tax assessed property value per square foot
multiplied by three hundred fifty (350) square feet (the size of a parking
stall and a portion of the access drive). The adopted fee shall be reviewed at
least every three (3) years by the city council.
   B.   Payment Of Fee: An applicant for payment of in-lieu costs instead of
providing parking shall pay an amount equivalent to the costs and value of one
parking lot space for each space of off street parking required for the
proposed use by this chapter. Such payment of fees in lieu of parking shall be
made in conjunction with the issuance of a building permit pursuant to section
17.44.130 of this title. To fulfill the total parking requirement, an applicant
may utilize a combination of actual spaces and fees in lieu of parking up to
the following limits:
      1.   If eight (8) or fewer parking spaces are required, all of the
parking spaces may be replaced with fees in lieu.
      2.   If nine (9) to twenty (20) required parking spaces are required,
sixty percent (60%) (rounded up to the next space) of the spaces may be
replaced with fees in lieu.
      3.   If twenty one (21) to forty (40) parking spaces are required, fifty
percent (50%) (rounded up to the next space) of the spaces may be replaced with
fees in lieu.
      4.   Fees in lieu may not be used to replace parking spaces above forty
(40) spaces.
   C.   Fund To Be Established: The city council shall set up a special fund
for revenues received from such payment of fees. Said revenues shall be used
only for the purpose of providing public parking facilities reasonably related
to serving the DC district by way of purchase of necessary land or improving
such land for public parking purposes.
   D.   Refund Of Fee If Unused: If such fees have not been utilized for the
stated purpose within fifteen (15) years of payment, or if a project or land
acquisition negotiations have not commenced for which the fees would be spent,
such fees with interest shall revert to original subdivider or its successor in
interest unless the city and the developer or its successor in interest agree
in writing to an alternative method to provide public parking facilities, land,
or parking spaces. Interest shall accrue at the average rate of interest
received by the city for funds invested in the Idaho state investment pool for
the period of time the city holds the fees paid in lieu of providing parking
spaces.
   E.   Certificate: An applicant for payment of in-lieu costs shall, with
payment of fees in lieu of off street parking, receive one nontransferable
certificate for each space of off street parking which would otherwise be
required by the terms of this chapter.
   F.   Changes Requiring Parking: Off street parking and/or fees shall only be
required for:
      1.   Existing Use: The amount a building is expanded above and beyond one
hundred twenty five percent (125%) of the existing gross floor area;
      2.   Vacant Lot: Any new use(s);
      3.   Off Street Parking And Loading: The number of off street parking
spaces and loading berths shall be fifty percent (50%) of the standards
specified in sections
17.44.030 through
17.44.090 and
17.44.500 through

VIII. HOME OCCUPATION REGULATIONS
17.06.705: INTENT AND PURPOSE:
The City of Coeur d'Alene recognizes the need for some citizens to use their
place of residence for limited nonresidential activities. However, the City
believes that the need to protect the integrity and essential residential
character of its residential areas is of paramount concern. The home occupation
regulations are the means used to allow and to regulate nonresidential activity
within the City's Residential Districts.
The objective of the home occupation regulations is to allow a limited
commercial service activity in areas of residential land use only to the extent
that neighbors will not be negatively impacted by such things as the outward
appearance, noise, smell, glare, traffic or activity level occurring on the
site. The home occupation regulations seek to balance the need of some
individuals to work at home with rights of other individuals to enjoy the
residential character of their neighborhood and their private property. The
purpose of the home occupation regulations is to protect the health, safety,
and welfare of neighborhood residents and the preservation of the neighborhood
as a comfortable place for the people who live there. The City believes that
these purposes can be accomplished while allowing for some limited commercial-
service activities through the use and application of the home occupation
regulations. (Ord. 2276 §2, 1990: Ord. 1691 §1(part), 1982)
17.06.710: APPLICABILITY:
The regulations set forth in this Chapter shall apply to all residential
dwelling units or residential accessory structures, irrespective of zoning
district. Should a residential use in a commercial zoning district fail to meet
the conditions necessary to qualify as a home occupation, it is then considered
a full commercial business and must comply with all regulations covering
commercial establishments. (Ord. 2276 §3, 1990)
17.06.715: HOME OCCUPATION CERTIFICATE REQUIRED:
A home occupation certificate is required for all home occupations conducted
within the City. A home occupation certificate shall be issued upon request to
all home occupations which meet the conditions set forth in Sections
17.06.720 and/or
17.02.725. The form shall include, but not be limited to, the following

   A.   Legal description of the property.
   B.   Type of use proposed.
   C.   Zoning district where located.
   D.   Building area involved in use.
   E.   Number and residence of people involved.
   F.   Proposed alterations to building.
   G.   Proposed use of utilities and community facilities, if any.
   H.   Proposed material and equipment.
   I.   Storage requirements.
   J.   Signage.
   K.   Anticipated traffic generation.

A nonconforming use certificate can be issued by the City to all nonconforming
uses which were in existence on the effective date of this title or any
subsequent rezoning or other amendment thereto which makes such use
nonconforming. This permit will include, but not be limited to, the following
information:
   A.   Legal description of property.
   B.   Type of use involved.
   C.   Reasons for its nonconformance.
   D.   Land area involved.
   E.   Number of people involved.
   F.   Type and area of building or portion of buildings involved in the
nonconforming activity.
This certificate shall not be used to grant a use that would be nonconforming
to the applicable development regulations. There shall be no fee required for a
nonconforming use certificate. (Ord. 1691 §1(part), 1982)
17.06.925: NONCONFORMING USE; ABANDONMENT OF USE:
   A.   Nonconforming As To Activity: Whenever a use, which is nonconforming
because it is not a permitted activity, discontinues active operation for a
continuous period of one year, such nonconforming use shall be considered to be
abandoned and may not be resumed. The facilities of such a use may be used
thereafter, but only for a permitted activity.
   B.   Nonconforming As To Facility: A use, which is nonconforming because of
the facility, may resume operations regardless of the period during which it
may have discontinued active operation. (Ord. 1691 §1(part), 1982)
17.06.930: NONCONFORMING USE; DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION OF FACILITIES:
   A.   Nonconforming As To Activity: Whenever a nonconforming facility is
damaged or destroyed to the extent that reconstruction, repairing, or
rebuilding will exceed fifty percent (50%) of the replacement costs of the
facility as it was immediately prior to the damage, as determined by a
qualified appraiser, the facility may only be restored to accommodate a
conforming activity. If restoration for a nonconforming activity is permitted
by special permit, the restoration must be substantially completed within one
year after damage or destruction. If it is not, the nonconforming activity is
considered to be abandoned, and cannot be restored except for use as a
permitted activity.
   B.   Nonconforming As To Facility: Whenever a nonconforming facility is
damaged or destroyed to the extent that reconstruction, repairing, or
rebuilding will exceed fifty percent (50%) of the replacement costs of the
facility as it was immediately prior to the damage, as determined by a
qualified appraiser, the facility must be restored in conformance with all
current Code requirements. However, single family dwellings may be restored
without conforming to current Code requirements provided that the following
requirements are met:
      1.   Foundation: The existing foundation of the older structure must be
kept and used for the proposed replacement structure or to verify the footprint
of the damaged structure. If the existing foundation is not structurally sound,
then the City building official or designee will need to verify in writing that
the existing foundation is unusable for the replacement structure. The
replacement structure must use the exact layout (foundation footprint) of the
damaged structure to site/locate for the replacement structure.
      2.   Bulk/Square Foot Above Ground: The proposed replacement structure
must not be greater in square footage above ground than was the structure that
was damaged.
      3.   Building Height: The proposed replacement structure must not be
greater in height above ground than was existing prior to the damage.
      4.   Zero Setback - Adjacent Affected Property: If a prior existing
structure was at zero feet (0') from the property line then a granting of a
maintenance easement from the adjoining property owner must be obtained. An
easement, in a form acceptable to the City Attorney, shall be executed between
the zero lot line property owner and the owner of the adjacent lot or structure
to provide for proper maintenance, repair, drainage and fire access. This
easement(s) shall be recorded.
      5.   Structure Over Property Line Or In Right-Of-Way: If prior existing
structure was over any property line or in the right-of-way (ROW), the new
proposed replacement structure cannot be rebuilt if it extends into a property
with a different ownership or into the ROW.
It is the owner's burden of proof to provide information relating to prior
existing conditions of the structure and site as it relates to the above
referenced items. (Ord. 3600, 2018: Ord. 2049 §47, 1987: Ord. 1691 §1(part),
1982)

made to a facility used for a nonconforming activity; provided, that this
provision shall not apply if the nonconforming activity occupies less than
fifty percent (50%) of the facility.
      2.   The costs of repairs and alterations to a facility which is used for
a nonconforming activity shall not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the market
value of the facility in any one year. The cost of repairs and alterations
required by law or permitted by section
17.06.930 of this chapter shall be exempt from such limit.
   B.   Nonconforming As To Facility: Any nonconforming facility used for a
permitted activity may be repaired or altered subject to the following

alterations, except those required by law, shall be made to the nonconforming
portion of any facility.
      2.   The costs of such repairs or alterations shall not exceed twenty
percent (20%) of the market value of the facility, in any one year period. The
costs of repairs or alterations required by law or permitted by section
17.06.930 of this chapter shall be exempt from such limit.
      3.   Except as clarified by subsection B4 of this section, such repairs
or alterations shall not result in a greater degree of nonconformity.
      4.   This section is not intended to preclude repairs or alterations
which do not increase the volume of the nonconforming portion of the building.

17.07.910: OVERLAY DISTRICTS CREATED:
   A.   Districts Described: The following infill overlay districts are subject
to the provisions of this article:
      1.   Downtown Overlay; Northside (DO-N): The boundaries of the DO-
N district are as depicted in subsection C of this section. The intent of this
district is to create a transition between the downtown core and purely
residential areas to the north. Infill development is encouraged, including
urban housing (e.g., townhouses, courtyard housing) with a height limit that is
compatible with lower scaled development. However, it is intended that
development within the district consists of sufficient density to warrant the
provision of parking below grade. Moreover, a limited array of goods and
services is appropriate to serve the neighborhood. Traffic calming measures
would be applied and there would be an emphasis on preserving existing large
trees and providing new ones.
      2.   Downtown Overlay; Eastside (DO-E): The boundaries of the DO-
E district are as depicted in subsection C of this section. The intent of this
district is to create a transition between the downtown core and residential
areas to the east. Infill development is encouraged, including urban housing
(e.g., townhouses, courtyard housing, cottages) with a height limit that is
compatible with lower scaled development. However, it is intended that
development within the district consists of sufficient density to warrant the
provision of parking below grade. Moreover, a limited array of goods and
services is appropriate to serve the neighborhood. Traffic calming measures
would be applied and there would be an emphasis on preserving existing large
trees and providing new ones.
      3.   Midtown Overlay (MO): The boundaries of the MO district are as
depicted in subsection C of this section. The intent of this district is to
create a lively, neighborhood business district with a mixture of uses,
including retail, services, and residential. Storefronts would be relatively
continuous along the street within the core of the district. Housing would be
encouraged both above and behind commercial uses. Traffic calming measures
would be applied and there would be an emphasis on creating a streetscape that
would offer safety, convenience and visual appeal to pedestrians.
   B.   Conflict With Provisions Governing Underlying Zoning District: The
infill overlay districts created by this article shall overlay the underlying
zoning district. In the case of conflict between the provisions of this article
and the provisions governing the underlying zoning district or other municipal
code provisions, the provisions of this article shall govern.
   C.   District Boundaries:

parking lot space for each space of off street parking required for the
proposed use by this chapter. Such payment of fees in lieu of parking shall be
made in conjunction with the issuance of a building permit pursuant to section
17.44.130 of this title. To fulfill the total parking requirement, an applicant
may utilize a combination of actual spaces and fees in lieu of parking up to
the following limits:
         a.   If eight (8) or fewer parking spaces are required, all of the
parking spaces may be replaced with fees in lieu.

         c.   Fees in lieu may not be used to replace parking spaces above
twenty (20) spaces.
      3.   Fund To Be Established: The city council shall set up a special fund
for revenues received from such payment of fees. Said revenues shall be used
only for the purpose of providing public parking facilities reasonably related
to serving the in-lieu parking area of the MO district by way of purchase of
necessary land or improving such land for public parking purposes.
      4.   Refund Of Fee If Unused: If such fees have not been utilized for the
stated purpose within fifteen (15) years of payment, or if a project or land
acquisition negotiations have not commenced for which the fees would be spent,
such fees with interest shall revert to original subdivider or its successor in
interest unless the city and the developer or its successor in interest agree
in writing to an alternative method to provide public parking facilities, land,
or parking spaces. Interest shall accrue at the average rate of interest
received by the city for funds invested in the Idaho state investment pool for
the period of time the city holds the fees paid in lieu of providing parking
spaces.
      5.   Certificate: An applicant for payment of in-lieu costs shall, with
payment of fees in lieu of off street parking, receive one nontransferable
certificate for each space of off street parking which would otherwise be
required by the terms of this chapter.

towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance
with standards contained in applicable State or local building codes and the
applicable industry standards for towers, as amended from time to time.
Compliance with this article is subject to the City's Code enforcement
procedures pursuant to chapter 17.09, article IX of this title, and other
applicable provisions of this Code. If, upon inspection, the City concludes
that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a
danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of
the tower, the owner shall have thirty (30) days to bring such tower into
compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower into compliance
within said thirty (30) days shall constitute grounds for the removal of the
tower at the owner's expense.
   G.   Notice: For purposes of this article, any special use permit or appeal
of a special use shall require notice as required by section
17.09.215 of this title and other applicable provisions of this Code to all
abutting property owners, in addition to any other notice otherwise required by
this Code.
   H.   Signs: No facilities may bear any signage or advertisement(s) other
than signage required by law or expressly permitted/required by the City.
   I.   Visual Impact: All WCFs in residential uses and zones and within two
hundred feet (200') of residential zones shall be sited and designed to
minimize adverse visual impacts on surrounding properties and the traveling
public to the greatest extent reasonably possible, consistent with the proper
functioning of the WCF. Such WCFs and equipment enclosures shall be integrated
through location and design to blend in with the existing characteristics of
the site. Such WCFs shall also be designed to either resemble the surrounding
landscape and other natural features where located in proximity to natural
surroundings, or be compatible with the built environment, through matching and
complimentary existing structures and specific design considerations such as
architectural designs, height, scale, color and texture or be consistent with
other uses and improvements permitted in the relevant zone.
   J.   Use Of Stealth Design/Technology: The applicant shall provide
justification why it is not employing stealth technology. Stealth design is
required for macrocell facilities in residential zones, and to the extent shown
in subsection
17.08.825D, table 1 of this article and elsewhere as provided in this article.
Stealth and concealment techniques must be appropriate given the proposed
location, design, visual environment, and nearby uses, structures, and natural
features. Stealth design shall be designed and constructed to substantially
conform to surrounding building designs or natural settings, so as to be
visually unobtrusive. Stealth design that relies on screening wireless
communication facilities in order to reduce visual impact must screen all
substantial portions of the facility from view. Stealth and concealment
techniques do not include incorporating faux-tree designs of a kind that are
not native to the State.
   K.   Building-Mounted WCFs:
      1.   All transmission equipment shall be concealed within existing
architectural features to the maximum extent feasible. Any new architectural
features proposed to conceal the transmission equipment shall be designed to
mimic the existing underlying structure, shall be proportional to the existing
underlying structure or conform to the underlying use and shall use materials
in similar quality, finish, color and texture as the existing underlying
structure.
      2.   All roof-mounted transmission equipment shall be set back from all
roof edges to the maximum extent feasible consistent with the need for "line-
of-sight" transmission and reception of signals.
      3.   Antenna arrays and supporting transmission equipment shall be
installed so as to camouflage, disguise or conceal them to make them closely
compatible with and blend into the setting or host structure.
   L.   Antenna Arrays: Wireless communication antenna arrays are permitted in
any zone as long as they are located upon an existing structure (except on
single family houses, duplexes, signage or a building less than 60 feet in
height), that provides sufficient elevation for the array's operation without
the necessity of constructing a tower or other apparatus to extend the antenna
array more than fifteen feet (15') above the structure. Installation on City
property requires the execution of necessary agreements. However, if any
support tower is needed to achieve the needed elevation, then a special use
permit is required. If a new equipment cabinet is to be installed, it must be
screened if it is higher than the existing screened facility.
   M.   WCFs In The Public Rights-Of-Way:
      1.   Utility Support Structure - Mounted Equipment: All pole- mounted
transmission equipment shall be mounted as close as possible to the pole so as
to reduce the overall visual profile to the maximum extent feasible.
      2.   License Or Agreement: For all WCFs to be located within the right-
of-way, prior to submitting for a permit, the applicant must have a valid
Municipal agreement, license, franchise agreement, right-of-way agreement,
encroachment permit or exemption otherwise granted by applicable law. If the
applicant is willing to install its ancillary facilities underground, that
determination by the City shall be subject to administrative review.
   N.   Accessory Uses:
      1.   Accessory uses shall be limited to such structures and equipment
that are necessary for transmission or reception functions, and shall not
include broadcast studios, offices, vehicles or equipment storage, or other
uses not essential to the transmission or reception functions.
      2.   All accessory buildings shall be constructed of building materials
equal to or better than those of the primary building on the site and shall be
subject to applicable permits.
      3.   No equipment shall be stored or parked on the site of the tower,
unless used in direct support of the antennas or the tower or antennas that are
being repaired.
   O.   Accessory Equipment: In residential zones, all accessory equipment
located at the base of a WCF shall be located or placed (at the applicant's
choice) in an existing building, underground, or in an equipment shelter or
cabinet that is: 1) designed to blend in with existing surroundings, using
architecturally compatible construction and colors; and 2) be located so as to
be unobtrusive as possible consistent with the proper functioning of the WCF.
   P.   Site Design Flexibility: Individual WCF sites vary in the location of
adjacent buildings, existing trees, topography and other local variables. By
mandating certain design standards, there may result a project that could have
been less intrusive if the location of the various elements of the project
could have been placed in more appropriate locations within a given site.
Therefore, the WCF and supporting equipment may be installed so as to best
camouflage, disguise them, or conceal them, to make the WCF more closely
compatible with and blend into the setting or host structure, upon approval by
the City.
   Q.   General Standards And Construction Provisions:
      1.   Construction: All structures shall be constructed and installed to
manufacturer's specifications, and constructed to withstand the minimum wind
speed as required by the City's currently adopted International Building Code,
as amended.
      2.   Building Code Compliance: Structures shall be permitted and
constructed to meet current, adopted City Building Code requirements.
      3.   FCC And FAA Regulations: All structures shall conform to FCC and FAA
regulations, if applicable.
      4.   Setback Or Bufferyard: If any setback or bufferyard as prescribed
within this Code requires a greater distance than required of this article, the
greater distance shall apply.
      5.   Landscaping, Screening And Fencing: In all zoning districts, the
following additional landscaping shall be required beyond that which is
required for the zone in which it is located:
         a.   Equipment shelters and cabinets and other on the ground ancillary
equipment shall be screened with buffer yard and street tree landscaping as
required for the zone in which located or with another design acceptable to the
Planning Director. Artwork may also be used to screen ground equipment. At the
City's discretion, as an alternative to general landscaping and screening
requirements, the applicant, at its expense, shall do an artistic wrap designed
by a local artist around the equipment cabinets. Alternatively, where
technically feasible, the applicant shall incorporate the cabinet and other
equipment into the base of a new pole (for example, for a small cell) provided
there is adequate space in the right-of-way and that ADA sidewalk accessibility
requirements can be met. All provisions of the ADA (including, but not limited
to, clear space requirements) shall be met by the applicant.
         b.   In particular, the ground level view of towers shall be mitigated
by additional landscaping provisions as established through the special use
permit process. The use of large trees from the approved urban forestry list of
recommended species or native conifers is required at the spacing specified for
the specific trees chosen. Alternatively, a landscaping plan may be submitted
with the special use permit and, if approved, shall take precedence over the
foregoing requirement.
         c.   Except for locations in the right-of-way, a site-obscuring fence
(for example, wrought iron as opposed to barbed wire) no less than six feet
(6') in height from the finished grade shall be constructed around each tower
and around related support or guy anchors. Access shall only be through a
locked gate. Any fence shall comply with the other design guidelines of this
Code.
      6.   New Poles: To the extent technically feasible, new poles must be
designed to match the existing street furniture, light fixtures and other
poles, and they shall serve a dual purpose (for example, a new light fixture,
flag pole or banner clips).
      7.   Other Published Materials: All other information or materials that
the City may reasonably require, from time to time, make publicly available and
designate as part of the application requirements. (Ord. 3590, 2017)
17.08.825: SHARING OF SUPPORT TOWERS AND COLLOCATION OF FACILITIES:
   A.   Policy: It is the policy of the City to minimize the number of wireless
communication support towers and to encourage the collocation of antenna arrays
of more than one wireless communication service provider on a single support
tower.
   B.   Provisions: No new tower may be constructed within three- quarters (3/
4) of a mile of an existing tower, unless it can be demonstrated that an
existing tower is not available or feasible for collocation of an additional
wireless communication facility, or that its specific location does not satisfy
the operational requirements of the applicant or that another departure from
this standard is needed and the applicant can demonstrate that a significant
gap in coverage or capacity exists and the applicant's submittal is the least
intrusive means to fill the gap in coverage or capacity. Factors to be
considered in determining whether applicant has made this demonstration include
those listed in subsection C of this section.
   C.   Factors Considered In Granting Special Use Permits For Towers: In
addition to any standards for consideration of special use permit applications
pursuant to this Code, the Planning Commission shall consider the following
factors in determining whether to issue a special use permit, although the
commission may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one or more of
these criteria if the commission concludes that the goals of this article are
better served thereby.
      1.   Height of the proposed tower. Towers exceeding a height of seventy
five feet (75') shall be able to accommodate collocation of one additional
provider. Additional height to accommodate additional collocation may be
approved if the applicant submits information certifying the tower has capacity
for at least two (2) additional providers. The applicant shall provide a letter
indicating their good faith intent to encourage collocation on the tower.
      2.   Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential
district boundaries.
      3.   Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties.
      4.   Surrounding topography.
      5.   Surrounding tree coverage and foliage.
      6.   Design of the tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual
obtrusiveness.
      7.   Proposed ingress and egress.
      8.   No existing structures are located within the geographic area which
meet applicant's engineering requirements.
      9.   Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural
strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment.
      10.   The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic
interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the
antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the
applicant's proposed antenna.
      11.   The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in
order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or
structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development
are presumed to be unreasonable.
      12.   The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors
not enumerated herein that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
   D.   Placement Provisions - Towers: Towers shall be located only in those
areas described in table 1 of this subsection, provided that towers that are
proposed to be located in a residential zone or within two hundred feet (200')
of a residential zone shall be subject to the siting priorities set forth for
preferred tower locations in section
17.08.835 of this article.

Notes:
   1.    If an applicant wants to construct a tower in a residential zone or
within 200 feet of a residential zone, then stealth design is required.
   2.    An additional 20 feet in height is allowed if applicant uses stealth
design.
   3.    DC Zone requires stealth design. Preferred location on top of existing
structure.
   4.    An additional 30 feet in height is allowed if applicant uses stealth
design.
Towers in industrial zones (M and LM) are subject to administrative review as
long as the other requirements of this article are met. (Ord. 3590, 2017)
17.08.830: SETBACK REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Notwithstanding the setbacks provided for in subsection
17.08.825D, table 1, of this article when a residence is located on an adjacent
property, the support tower structures shall be set back from property lines as
required by that zone or a minimum of one foot (1') for every foot of tower
height, whichever produces the greater setback, unless:
      1.   The setback is waived by the owner of the residence; or
      2.   The tower is constructed with breakpoint design technology. If the
tower has been constructed using breakpoint design technology, the minimum
setback distance shall be equal to one hundred ten percent (110%) of the
distance from the top of the structure to the breakpoint level of the
structure, or the applicable zone's minimum side setback requirements,
whichever is greater. For example, on a one hundred foot (100') tall monopole
with a breakpoint at eighty feet (80'), the minimum setback distance would be
twenty two feet (22') (110 percent of 20 feet, the distance from the top of the
monopole to the breakpoint) or the minimum side yard setback requirements for
that zone, whichever is greater. Provided, that if an applicant proposes to use
breakpoint design technology to reduce the required setback from a residence,
the issuance of building permits for the tower shall be conditioned upon
approval of the tower design by a structural engineer.
   B.   All equipment shelters, cabinets, or other on the ground ancillary
equipment shall meet the setback requirement of the zone in which it is
located. (Ord. 3590, 2017)
17.08.835: PREFERRED TOWER LOCATIONS:
   A.   All new towers proposed to be located in a residential zone or within
two hundred feet (200') of a residential zone, or in the Downtown Core or
Infill Zoning Districts, are permitted only after application of the following
siting priorities, ordered from most-preferred (1) to least- preferred (7):
      1.   City-owned or operated property and facilities not in the Downtown,
Infill or Residential Zones and not including right-of-way;
      2.   Industrial Zones (M and LM);
      3.   Commercial Zones (C-17 and C-17L);
      4.   Other non-residential zones (NC and CC);
      5.   City rights-of-way in residential zones;
      6.   Parcels of land in residential zones;
      7.   Designated historic structures, Downtown Core (DC) Zoning District
and overlay zoning districts, including neighborhoods with additional
protections.
The applicant for a tower located in a residential zone or within two hundred
feet (200') of a residential zone, or in the Downtown Core or Infill Zoning
Districts, shall address these preferences in an alternative sites analysis
prepared pursuant to section
17.08.840 of this article. (Ord. 3590, 2017)
17.08.840: SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Alternative Sites Analysis:
      1.   For towers in a residential zone or within two hundred feet (200')
of a residential zone, or in the Downtown Core or Infill Zoning Districts, the
applicant must address the City's preferred tower locations with a detailed
explanation justifying why a site of higher priority was not selected. The
City's tower location preferences must be addressed in a clear and complete
written alternative sites analysis that shows at least three (3) higher ranked,
alternative sites considered that are in the geographic range of the service
coverage objectives of the applicant, together with a factually detailed and
meaningful comparative analysis between each alternative candidate and the
proposed site that explains the substantive reasons why the applicant rejected
the alternative candidate.
      2.   A complete alternative sites analysis provided under this subsection
may include less than three (3) alternative sites so long as the applicant
provides a factually detailed written rationale for why it could not identify
at least three (3) potentially available, higher ranked, alternative sites.
      3.   For purposes of disqualifying potential collocations or alternative
sites for the failure to meet the applicant's service coverage or capacity
objectives the applicant will provide: a) a description of its objective,
whether it be to close a gap or address a deficiency in coverage, capacity,
frequency or technology; b) detailed technical maps or other exhibits with
clear and concise RF data to illustrate that the objective is not met using the
alternative (whether it be collocation or a more preferred location); and c) a
description of why the alternative (collocation or a more preferred location)
does not meet the objective.
   B.   Collocation Consent: A written statement will be signed by a person
with the legal authority to bind the applicant and the project owner, which
indicates whether the applicant is willing to allow other transmission
equipment owned by others to collocate with the proposed wireless communication

The qualified employee of the applicant shall submit his or her qualifications
with the application. (Ord. 3590, 2017)
17.08.845: EXCEPTIONS TO STANDARDS:
   A.   Applicability: Except as otherwise provided in this article (under
subsection
17.08.820P, "Site Design Flexibility", of this article), no WCF shall be used
or developed contrary to any applicable development standard unless an
exception has been granted pursuant to this section. These provisions apply
exclusively to WCFs and are in lieu of the generally applicable variance and
design departure provisions in this Code; provided this section does not
provide an exception from this article's visual impact and stealth design.
   B.   Procedure Type: A WCF's exception is subject to approval by the
Planning Commission.
   C.   Submittal Requirements: An application for a wireless communication
facility exception shall include:
      1.   A written statement demonstrating how the exception would meet the
criteria.
      2.   A site plan that includes:
         a.   Description of the proposed facility's design and dimensions, as
it would appear with and without the exception.
         b.   Elevations showing all components of the wireless communication
facility, as it would appear with and without the exception.
         c.   Color simulations of the wireless communication facility after

with and without the exception.
   D.   Criteria: An application for a wireless communication facility
exception shall be granted if the following criteria are met:
      1.   The exception is consistent with the purpose of the development
standard for which the exception is sought.
      2.   Based on a visual analysis, the design minimizes the visual impacts
to residential zones through mitigating measures, including, but not limited
to, building heights, bulk, color, and landscaping.
      3.   The applicant demonstrates the following:
         a.   A significant gap in the coverage, capacity, or technologies of
the service network exists such that users are regularly unable to connect to
the service network, or are regularly unable to maintain a connection, or are
unable to achieve reliable wireless coverage within a building;
         b.   The gap can only be filled through an exception to one or more of
the standards in this article; and
         c.   The exception is narrowly tailored to fill the service gap such
that the wireless communication facility conforms to this article's standards
to the greatest extent possible.
   E.   Exceptions In Residential Zones: For a new tower proposed to be located
in a residential zone or within two hundred feet (200') of a residential zone,
or in the Downtown Core or Infill Zoning Districts, unless the proposal
qualifies as a preferred location on City-owned or operated property or
facilities, the applicant must also demonstrate that the manner in which it
proposes to fill the significant gap in coverage, capacity, or technologies of
the service network is the least intrusive on the values that this article
seeks to protect. (Ord. 3590, 2017)
17.08.850: REMOVAL OF ABANDONED ANTENNAS AND TOWERS:
Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of twelve
(12) months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or
tower shall so notify the City in writing and remove the same within ninety
(90) days of giving notice to the City of such abandonment. Failure to remove
an abandoned antenna or tower within said ninety (90) days shall be grounds to
remove the tower or antenna at the owner's expense, including all costs and
attorneys' fees. Irrespective of any agreement between them to the contrary,
the owner of such unused facility and the owner of a building or land upon
which the WCF is located, shall be jointly and severally responsible for the
removal of abandoned WCFs and the WCFs' foundation, if any. If there are two
(2) or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become
effective until all users cease using the tower. (Ord. 3590, 2017)
17.08.855: INDEPENDENT RF TECHNICAL REVIEW:
Although the City intends for City staff to review applications to the extent
feasible, the City may retain the services of an independent RF expert of its
choice to provide technical evaluation of permit applications for WCFs, when
they are subject to special use permits, conditional use or administrative
review. The third party expert shall have recognized training and
qualifications in the field of radio frequency engineering. The RF expert's
review may include, but is not limited to: a) the accuracy and completeness of
the items submitted with the application; b) the applicability of analysis and
techniques and methodologies proposed by the applicant; c) the validity of
conclusions reached by the applicant; and d) whether the proposed WCF complies
with the applicable approval criteria set forth in this article. The applicant
shall pay the cost for any independent consultant fees through a deposit,
estimated by the City, paid within ten (10) days of the City's request. When
the City requests such payment, the application shall be deemed incomplete for
purposes of application processing timelines until the deposit is received. In
the event that such costs and fees do not exceed the deposit amount, the City
shall refund any unused portion within thirty (30) days after the final permit
is released or, if no final permit is released, within thirty (30) days after
the City receives a written request from the applicant. If the costs and fees
exceed the deposit amount, then the applicant shall pay the difference to the
City before the permit is issued. (Ord. 3590, 2017)
17.08.860: FINAL INSPECTION:
   A.   A certificate of completion will only be granted upon satisfactory
evidence that the WCF was installed in substantial compliance with the approved
plans and photo simulations.
   B.   If it is found that the WCF installation does not substantially comply
with the approved plans and photo simulations, the applicant shall make any and
all such changes required to bring the WCF installation into compliance
promptly and in any event prior to putting the WCF in operation. (Ord. 3590,
2017)
17.08.865: COMPLIANCE:
   A.   All wireless communication facilities must comply with all standards
and regulations of the FCC and any State or other Federal government agency
with the authority to regulate wireless communication facilities.
   B.   The site and wireless communication facilities, including all
landscaping, fencing and related transmission equipment must be maintained at
all times in a neat and clean manner and in accordance with all approved plans.
   C.   All graffiti on wireless communication facilities must be removed at
the sole expense of the permittee after notification by the City to the owner/
operator of the WCF.
   D.   If any FCC, State or other governmental license or any other
governmental approval to provide communication services is ever revoked as to
any site permitted or authorized by the City, the permittee must inform the
City of the revocation within thirty (30) days of receiving notice of such
revocation. (Ord. 3590, 2017)
17.08.870: INDEMNIFICATION:
Each permit issued for a WCF located on City property shall be deemed to have
as a condition of the permit a requirement that the applicant defend, indemnify
and hold harmless the City and its officers, agents, employees, volunteers, and
contractors from any and all liability, damages, or charges (including
attorneys' fees and expenses) arising out of claims, suits, demands, or causes
of action as a result of the permit process, a granted permit, construction,
erection, location, performance, operation, maintenance, repair, installation,
replacement, removal, or restoration of the WCF. (Ord. 3590, 2017)

The title of this article shall be the HILLSIDE OVERLAY ORDINANCE. The purpose
of these regulations is to establish a Hillside Overlay Zone and to prescribe
procedures whereby the development of lands within the Hillside Overlay Zone
occurs in such a manner as to protect the natural and topographic development
character and identity of these areas, environmental resources, the aesthetic
qualities and restorative value of lands, and the public health, safety, and
general welfare by ensuring that development does not create soil erosion,
sedimentation of lower slopes, slide damage, flooding problems, that it
prevents surface water degradation, severe cutting or scarring, and to reduce
the risk of catastrophic wildfire in the wildland-urban interface. It is the
intent of these development standards to encourage a sensitive form of
development and to allow for a reasonable use that complements the visual
character and the nature of the City. (Ord. 3091 §2, 2003)
17.08.905: APPLICABILITY:

17.08.920: GRADING AND EROSION CONTROL:
Prior to development, grading and erosion control plans conforming to the
following requirements shall be submitted and approved by the city. Erosion
control measures conforming to best management practices (BMPs) approved by the
city, or identified in the DEQ manual entitled "Catalog Of Storm-Water Best
Management Practices For Idaho Cities And Counties", shall be required.
   A.   Plans: All grading and erosion control plans shall include the
following:
      1.   Property boundaries.
      2.   All existing natural and manmade features and facilities within
twenty feet (20') of the area to be disturbed, including, but not limited to,

   B.   Review By Geotechnical Engineer: The project geotechnical engineer
shall provide written proof of review and compliance to all grading plans. All
grading shall conform to the most current adopted building code and the
recommendations of the geotechnical engineer.
   C.   Installation Of Temporary Erosion Control: Temporary erosion control
measures shall be installed and functional prior to start of any grading and/or
land disturbing activity. They shall be maintained in a functional condition
until the permanent measures are installed.
   D.   Retention In Natural State: All development shall retain an area or
areas equal to twenty five percent (25%) of the total parcel plus the
percentage figure of the average slope of the total parcel, in its natural
state. Lands to be retained in a natural state shall be protected from damage
through the use of temporary construction fencing or the functional equivalent.
For example, on a twenty five thousand (25,000) square foot lot with an average
slope of twenty nine percent (29%), 25% + 29% = 54% of the total lot area shall
be retained in a natural state. In this example a maximum of eleven thousand
five hundred (11,500) square feet could be disturbed. Also, see exhibit
17.08.940A of this chapter.
Lots less than twenty five thousand (25,000) square feet, legally created prior
to adoption of this article, shall be required to retain an area equal to fifty
percent (50%) of the area calculated by the above formula. In the above
example, on a lot created prior to this article, a twenty four thousand nine
hundred ninety nine (24,999) square foot lot would need to leave twenty seven
percent (27%) retained in the natural state. The area that could be disturbed
would be a maximum of eighteen thousand two hundred forty nine (18,249) square
feet.
   E.   Grading: All cut slopes shall be constructed in such a manner so that
sloughing or raveling is minimized. The maximum allowable vertical height of
any cut or fill slope shall be thirty feet (30'). The maximum inclination of
fill slopes shall be two to one (2:1) (horizontal to vertical). For public
roadways, the maximum allowable vertical height for cut and fill slopes in
combination shall be sixty feet (60').
   F.   Temporary Erosion Control For Slopes With Erodable Surface Materials:
All slopes with erodable surface material shall be protected with erosion
control netting, blankets, or functional equivalent. Netting or blankets shall
only be used in conjunction with organic mulch such as straw or wood fiber. The
blanket must be applied so that it is in complete contact with the soil so that
erosion does not occur beneath it. Erosion netting or blankets shall be
securely anchored to the slope in accordance with manufacturer's
recommendations. Temporary slope erosion control measures shall be installed
upon completion of slope grading if permanent erosion control measures are not
completed at the same time.
   G.   Revegetation Requirements: All areas with erodable surface materials
that are graded and not paved shall be revegetated. The vegetation used for
these areas shall be native or similar species that will reduce the visual
impact of the slope and provide long term slope stabilization. All revegetation
measures shall be installed, inspected by the city, and approved prior to the
issuance of a certificate of occupancy, or other time as determined by the
city. Vegetation shall be installed in such a manner as to be substantially
established within one year of installation.
   H.   Maintenance Of Erosion Control Measures: All measures installed for the
purposes of long term erosion control, including, but not limited to,
vegetative cover, rock walls, and landscaping, shall be maintained in
perpetuity on all areas which have been disturbed, including public rights of
way. The applicant shall indicate the mechanisms in place to ensure maintenance
of these measures.
   I.   Security: After an erosion control plan for a building site is approved
by the city and prior to issuance of a building permit, the applicant shall
provide a performance bond or other security in the amount of one hundred fifty
percent (150%) of the value of the erosion control measures shown on the
approved plan. The city attorney shall approve all security. The financial
guarantee instrument shall be in effect for a period of at least one year from
the project completion date. All or a portion of the security retained by the
city may be withheld for a period up to three (3) years beyond the one year
maintenance period if it has been determined by the city that the site has not
been sufficiently stabilized against erosion.
   J.   Inspections And Final Report: Prior to the acceptance of a subdivision
by the city or issuance of a certificate of occupancy for individual
structures, the project geotechnical engineer shall provide a final report
indicating that the project was constructed in accordance with their
recommendations, and that all recommended inspections were conducted by the
project geotechnical engineer.
   K.   Protecting Bare Soil During Development: All surfaces where bare soil
is exposed during clearing and grading operations, including spoil piles, shall
be covered or otherwise protected from erosion.
   L.   Construction Ways And Vehicles: Stabilized construction entrances and
driveways shall be required for all construction sites to minimize sediment
tracking onto roadways. Parking of vehicles shall be restricted to paved or
stabilized areas. (Ord. 3160 §3, 2003: Ord. 3091 §6, 2003)
17.08.925: SURFACE AND GROUND WATER DRAINAGE:
The requirements for storm water management plans as set forth in this code
shall apply to all development within the hillside overlay zone including
single-family residences. In addition, the following requirements shall apply:

with street construction, facilities for infiltration, treatment, and/or
conveyance of drainage from driveways, parking areas and other impervious
surfaces, and roof drainage systems.
   B.   Storm water facilities, when part of the overall site improvements,
shall be, to the greatest extent feasible, the first improvements constructed
on the development site.
   C.   Storm water facilities shall be designed to divert surface water away
from cut faces or sloping surfaces of a fill.
   D.   Existing natural drainage systems shall be utilized in their natural
state to the greatest extent feasible.
   E.   Storm water facilities shall be designed, constructed and maintained in
a manner that will avoid erosion on site and to adjacent and downstream
properties. (Ord. 3091 §7, 2003)
17.08.930: TREE PRESERVATION, PROTECTION AND REMOVAL:
The preservation, protection, and removal of trees shall meet the following
requirements:
   A.   Tree Removal: Prior to the development, a tree removal plan must be
submitted to and approved by the city. Removal of trees less than six inches
(6") dbh are not regulated as long as the method of cut and removal does not
create soil disturbance. (The acts of walking and falling trees are not to be
construed to create soil disturbance.) Trees can be removed if they meet one or
more of the following conditions:
      1.   Trees within a construction zone:
         a.   The tree is located within the building envelope.
         b.   The tree is located within a proposed street right of way,
driveway, or parking area.
         c.   The tree is located within water, sewer, or other public utility
easement.

      2.   Trees located within other areas to be disturbed: Trees can be
removed within other areas except areas to remain in a natural state. Trees
removed within these areas must be replaced on a one for one basis with trees
that will have approximately the same size and crown at maturity. The
replacement trees must meet the requirements of this article and be located on
the same property.
      3.   Trees located within areas to remain in a natural state: Trees may
be removed from these areas with the approval of the city if they meet any of
the following conditions:
         a.   Removal is required in order to achieve the wildfire mitigation
goals established by the city. Trees removed for this reason need not be
replaced.
         b.   The tree is dead or dying. Trees removed meeting this criteria
must be replaced on a one for one basis with trees that will have approximately
the same size and crown at maturity. The replacement trees must meet the
requirements of this article and be located on the same property.
   B.   Inventory Of Existing Trees: Prior to any soil disturbing activities on
the building lot, including tree removal, an inventory shall be completed
locating all trees greater than six inches (6") dbh within the area(s) to be
developed. A plan shall be prepared at the same scale as the site plan. Trees
shall be identified by dbh, species, and approximate extent of tree canopy. All
tree locations shall have an accuracy of plus or minus two feet (±2'). The
name, signature, and address of the person responsible for the survey shall be
provided on the plan.
   C.   Protection Of Natural Areas And Trees: The developer shall adhere to
the following protection standards for all trees not to be removed and for all
areas to remain in a natural state:
      1.   All areas to remain in a natural state and all trees designated for
preservation shall be clearly marked on the project site plan. Prior to the
start of any clearing, stripping, stockpiling, trenching, grading, compaction,
paving, or change in ground elevation, the applicant shall install temporary
delineation to clearly identify areas to be retained in a natural state. Trees
to be preserved that are located adjacent to or in the area to be disturbed
shall be clearly identified and protected by placing temporary fencing or
similar approved method outside the drip line of each tree. The fences may be
inspected and their location approved by the city.
      2.   Construction site activities, including, but not limited to,
parking, material storage, soil compaction and concrete washout, shall be
arranged so as to prevent disturbances within tree protection areas.
      3.   No grading, stripping, compaction, or significant change in ground
elevation shall be permitted within the drip line of trees designated for
preservation unless indicated on the approved grading plans. If grading or
construction is approved within the drip line, a landscape professional may be
required to be present during grading operations, and shall have authority to
require protective measures to protect the roots.
      4.   Changes in soil hydrology and site drainage within tree protection
areas shall be minimized. Runoff should be directed away from trees designated
for preservation.
   D.   Tree Replacement: Trees designated or approved for removal in
accordance with subsections A2 and A3b of this section shall be replaced in
accordance with the following standard:
      1.   Replacement trees shall be indicated on a tree replanting plan. The
replanting plan shall include all locations for replacement trees, and shall
also indicate tree planting details, including species.
      2.   Replacement tree locations shall adhere to the wildfire mitigation
goals for the project. The city's urban forester shall have the discretion to
adjust the proposed replacement tree species or location based upon site
specific conditions.
      3.   Replacement trees shall be a minimum of one inch (1") caliper for
deciduous trees and a minimum height of four feet (4') for evergreen trees.
      4.   Maintenance of replacement trees shall be the responsibility of the
property owner. Required replacement trees shall be continuously maintained in
a healthy manner. Trees that die within the first five (5) years after initial
planting must be replaced in kind, after which a new five (5) year replacement
period shall begin. Replanting must occur within thirty (30) days of
notification unless otherwise noted.
   E.   Enforcement:
      1.   All tree removal shall be done in accordance with the provisions of
this article. No trees designated for preservation shall be removed without
prior approval of the city.
      2.   Should the developer or developer's agent remove, destroy, or damage
any tree that has been designated for preservation, the city shall require the
developer to replace the tree in accordance with this article and may fine the
developer an amount established by the city. For trees that are removed or
destroyed, the minimum amount of the fine shall be equal to the appraised value
of the tree. The appraised value of a tree will be determined by a qualified
appraiser using the standards specified by the International Society of
Arboriculture as set forth in the most recent edition of their official
publication "Guide For Plant Appraisal", developed by the Council of Tree and
Landscape Appraisers. (Ord. 3091 §8, 2003)
17.08.935: BUILDING LOCATION AND DESIGN STANDARDS:
All buildings shall be designed and constructed in compliance with the
following standards. To reduce hillside disturbance, buildings shall
incorporate the following design requirements:
   A.   Building Design Requirements:
      1.   Roof Material: Only class A roof coverings listed and identified by
an approved testing agency or approved noncombustible roof covering shall be
used for new roofs or replacement of existing roofs.
      2.   Foundations: All structures shall have foundations that have been
designed by a professional engineer licensed in the state of Idaho. The
foundation design shall be based on a geotechnical engineer's recommendations.
      3.   Architectural Features: Architectural features such as bay windows,
decks, building step back, etc., shall be required on all exterior walls
greater than twenty feet (20') in height, as measured from lowest adjoining
finish grade, not including gables. All architectural features shall have a
minimum depth of one foot (1').
      4.   Color: A palette of colors approved by the council shall be used for
exterior walls, facades, and roofs. They shall have a light reflective value
(LRV) of forty (40) or less, per the manufacturers' specifications. When such
data is unavailable, compliance will be determined by a comparison of samples
where data is available. This light reflective value standard shall not apply
within established residential areas. Window and door glazing shall be
nonmirrored. (Ord. 3091 §9, 2003)
17.08.940: SENSITIVE SURFACE WATERS:
For development within five hundred feet (500') of a sensitive surface water
body, the following additional standards shall apply:
   A.   Storm Water Management Plan: A storm water management plan shall be
prepared by an Idaho licensed professional engineer or registered landscape
architect with water quality training and experience. The plan shall include an
evaluation of the impacts of the development as it relates to surface water
quality of the adjacent water body, and provide recommendations for mitigation.
The development of the property shall not create any impacts that cannot be
mitigated. The quality of surface water runoff shall be protected by
utilization of best management practices (BMPs) identified in the DEQ manual
entitled "Catalog Of Storm-Water Best Management Practices For Idaho Cities And
Counties". Development shall comply with Idaho water quality standards.
   B.   Density: The following densities shall apply to divisions of land,
unless a deviation is granted pursuant to the planned unit development process,
up to but not to exceed the density allowed in the underlying zone. The density
ratio standard shall not apply to individual building permit applications on
existing parcels recorded prior to the adoption of this article nor portions of
a lot beyond the five hundred foot (500') boundary. See example below:
 
Average Slope  Density    See Example     Cluster    Maximum Driveway
Within 500     Below                     Lots            Length
Foot Boundary
   15 – 25   0.5 acre               Encouraged   250 feet
   25.01 –   1 acre                 Encouraged   100 feet
   Over 35%    2.5 acres              Required     100 feet
 
Example of a parcel split by the five hundred foot (500') overlay boundary:
Fifteen (15) acre lot zoned R-1;
Five (5) acres are within five hundred feet (500') of the water and that has a
greater than thirty five percent (>35%) slope;
Exhibit 17.08.940A
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/7a42564e020da69f232cb6cef495f416359b1024/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4626.gif]
 
Example: Fifteen Acre Lot With Portion
Within Five Hundred Feet Of Water
The zoning density (theoretical lot density) for the area within 500 foot
boundary = 5 (area within boundary) divided by 2.5 (density factor for over 35%
slope) = 2.0 units;
Development within this area must be clustered and a part of a planned unit
development. Exhibit 17.08.940A of this section.
The density for the area outside of the 500 foot boundary = lot area divided by
34,500 (standard minimum lot size for the R-1 district) = 37. Note that the
actual lot density would be affected by street design and other design factors.
   C.   Interagency Coordination: The city may request comments on the project
from affected agencies, where appropriate. Where coordinated permits are
necessary, approvals from permitting agencies may be required.
   D.   Waterfront Lots: For lots with frontage on sensitive water body, an
undisturbed natural vegetation buffer shall be retained at the waterfront. A
stairway, walkway, stairway landing, or a tram shall be allowed to encroach
within the buffer. The buffer shall be a minimum of twenty five feet (25') from
the high water mark of the water body. For purposes of this article, high water
marks shall be considered to be the following elevations:
Coeur d'Alene Lake 2,125.0 (NGVD 1929 datum), (2128 WWP datum)
Fernan Lake 2,131.37 (Kootenai County site disturbance ordinance)
The high water marks for the Spokane River shall be determined by on site
inspection of evidence of historical water levels. (Ord. 3160 §4, 2003: Ord.
3091 §10, 2003)
17.08.943: FERNAN LAKE PLANNING AREA:
   A.   Applicability:
      1.   All land within five hundred feet (500') of the high water mark of
Fernan Lake, as defined in section
17.08.940 of this chapter, shall be subject to the following additional
requirements.
      2.   The Fernan watershed management plan, plan goals and action plan

safety and general welfare, to protect the integrity of the City's
neighborhoods, to establish a system to track the short-term rental inventory
in the City, to ensure compliance with local performance standards, to provide
a means of contact for the responsible party of a short-term rental, to
establish a Good Neighbor Policy for occupants of short-term rentals and their
guests, and to allow private property owners the right to fully and efficiently
utilize their property without undue regulation or interference.
   B.   Nothing in this article shall be construed so as to nullify or override
any lease agreements, or covenants, conditions, and restrictions applicable to
the property that may prohibit or restrict its use for short-term rental
purposes. (Ord. 3594, 2017)

meeting, the applicant shall be allowed up to fifteen (15) minutes to present
to the Commission. Response to questions from commissioners shall not be
counted against the fifteen (15) minutes. The chair of the Commission has the

or grant the application with such conditions as are, in its judgment,
necessary to ensure conformity to the adopted standards and guidelines. The
Commission shall make written findings to support its decision, specifically
stating how the project conforms to the adopted design standards and guidelines
or how it does not. A copy of the Commission's decision shall be mailed to the
applicant and the Director shall make the commission's decision available for
public inspection. The Commission has the power to table a decision to a later
date and request an additional meeting.
   B.   The final decision by the commission shall be provided to anyone
seeking information or a building permit for said property. (Ord. 3651 § 4,

   B.   Appeal on The Record: The Council's review of the decision of the
Commission shall be based on the record developed before the Commission. No new
evidence or materials shall be allowed by any party in the appeals proceedings.
   C.   Hearing: The applicant, City staff, the appellant, and their
representatives, and members of the public may participate in the appeal
hearing. Any participant in the appeal may only provide testimony and argument
based on the established record concerning the decision of the Commission. The
Mayor may establish time limits for each speaker and shall enforce the rules of
procedures set out in Municipal Code §

   D.   Burden Of Proof: The appellant must establish by a preponderance of
evidence that an error was made in the decision or that design standards or
guidelines were ignored or incorrectly applied, and further that the appellant
was prejudiced thereby. No testimony shall be taken on matters which cannot be
modified by the Commission, including, but not limited to, Zoning Code
requirements, FAR, building height, density, use, parking, or traffic impacts
because they are not design review criteria. Basic zoning standards and
allowances embodied within the Code shall be presumed to be correct and are not
subject to the appeal. Factual findings by the Commission will be accepted by
the Council if they are supported by substantial evidence.
   E.   Council Action: The Council may affirm or reverse the Commission
decision, or refer the project back to the Commission for further action or
clarification. The Council shall issue its decision within fifteen (15) days
after the Council takes the matter under advisement. If the project is referred
back to the Commission, the Commission shall hold a public meeting to consider
the referral and shall render a report to the Council within forty (40) days of

of the substantive elements of the approved design, the developer or applicant
must submit a revised plan to the Director.

revised plan substantially complies with the approved design and conditions. If
it does not, the Director shall determine at which point in the design review

process is that point at which the extent of the proposed modifications can be
best addressed.
   C.   Lapse Of Approval: Unless a different termination date is prescribed by
the Commission, the design approval shall terminate one year from the date of
mailing of the decision unless substantial development or actual commencement
of authorized activities has occurred. The termination date may be extended by

filed at any time before the approval has expired and upon a showing of undue
hardship not caused by the developer or applicant.

commence in order to obtain Commission approval of the new plan. The
appropriate point in the design review process is that point at which the
extent of the new plan can be best addressed. (Ord. 3651 § 4, 2020)

17.50.010: PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY:
The purpose of this Chapter is to provide for the creation, form, recording,
modification, enforcement, and termination of development agreements. This
Chapter is adopted pursuant to section 67-6511A, Idaho Code, and is intended to
authorize development agreements to the fullest extent of the law. (Ord. 3704,
2022)
17.50.020: DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS:
   A.   As a condition for approval of an application which requires an
amendment to the zoning ordinance and map, including a zone change in
conjunction with annexation, a planned unit development, a special use permit
for a density increase, and a conditional zoning request, the developer and/or
owner may be required to enter into a development agreement with the City.
   B.   The Community Planning Director shall determine if a development
agreement should be required considering all the circumstances and may
determine, in the case of a minor entitlement request (e.g., a zone change
without a subdivision, a variance, a special use permit, etc.), that a
development agreement will serve no public purpose and should not be required.
In addition, the Planning and Zoning Commission may require a development
agreement as a condition for approval of an application following a public
hearing on the application. In making the determination that a development
agreement should be required, the best interests of the City, and the purpose
and intent of this Chapter, shall be considered.
   C.   If it is determined that a development agreement should be required,
the Planning and Zoning Commission shall include such agreement as a condition
for the approval of an application.
   D.   If a development agreement is included as a condition for approval of
an application by the Planning and Zoning Commission, the Community Planning
Director, in consultation with the City Attorney, shall prepare the development
agreement. The development agreement shall thereafter be presented to City
Council for review. After reviewing the development agreement, City Council may
approve, approve with modifications, or reject it, together with any associated
conditions contained in the approval of an application by the Planning and
Zoning Commission. A development agreement shall not be effective until
approved by City Council.
   E.   The development agreement shall constitute a binding contract between
the developer and/or owner of property and the City, and their successors-in-
interest, and shall contain at least those terms and conditions required by
this Chapter.    
   F.   The terms and conditions of the development agreement shall be in
addition to the requirements of the applicable zoning district as provided by
Titles 16 and 17, Coeur d’Alene Municipal Code, to the extent those
requirements are not specifically modified by the development agreement, shall
ensure compatibility of the resulting land use with the surrounding area, and
shall be consistent with the current Comprehensive Plan.
   G.   The City may revert the zoning designation of the property established
pursuant to the development agreement to the property’s prior zoning
designation or, if done as part of an annexation, rezone the property to the
lowest intensity zoning district which is appropriate under all the
circumstances (unless a de-annexation is warranted) upon termination of the
development agreement due to the developer and/or owner’s failure to comply
with the terms and conditions of the development agreement. The City shall
consider all of the attendant circumstances and other possible remedies prior
to changing the zoning designation of property established pursuant to a
development agreement. (Ord. 3704, 2022)
17.50.030: TERMS:
   A.   A development agreement shall be reasonably specific and its terms
shall bear a reasonable relationship to the development/entitlement request.
   B.   A development agreement shall include at least the following:
      1.   A description of the reason and purpose for the development
agreement;
      2.   The legal description of the subject property;
      3.   A list clearly noting allowed uses and deviations, and any
limitation on permitted uses that would otherwise be permitted by the zoning
entitlement;
      4.   A description and timing of the improvements to be constructed;
      5.   Any conditions imposed during the review and approval process, as
well as applicable conditions from other entitlement approvals, e.g.,
Annexation Agreement, Planned Unit Development, Special Use Permit, Conditional
Zoning, and associated Subdivision requests;
      6.   A description of the phasing plan, if any;
      7.   A description of any required temporary improvements and the
duration of those improvements;
      8.   Covenants, if any, made by the developer and/or owner to the City;
      9.   Covenants, if any, made by the City;
      10.   The details of dedications beyond those required by the Subdivision
and Zoning Codes;
      11.   The duration of the development agreement, and the provisions,
conditions, and procedures for extending, amending, or terminating the
development agreement; and
      12.   Payment and timing of applicable fees.
   C.   A development agreement may include the following:
      1.   A conceptual site plan showing the proposed arrangement of any
structure(s), free-standing signage, landscaping, and parking area design;
      2.   A set of building elevations showing exterior building treatments
and designs;
      3.   The requirement that a set of As-Built Drawings be provided prior to
issuance of occupancy permits, or approval of infrastructure and open space
areas; and/or
      4.   Conditions on the use, design, conservation, roads and other
infrastructure, open space, workforce housing, and other aspects of the
development which are in the public interest, as well as the timing for
completion of the conditions. (Ord. 3704, 2022)
17.50.040: PERFORMANCE:
   A.   The following standards shall apply to all property subject to a
development agreement:
      1.   If a substantial amount of land adjacent to or abutting a property
zoned in conjunction with a development agreement is rezoned to the same zoning
designation as the property subject to the development agreement, the Planning
and Zoning Commission may recommend that the development agreement be
terminated after a public hearing complying with the notice and hearing
provisions of section 67-6509, Idaho Code, if termination is equitable and in
the best interests of the City. The recommendation shall be presented to City
Council, which may approve, approve with conditions, or deny the termination.
      2.   The existence of a development agreement shall not prevent the City
from subsequently applying new rules, regulations, or policies to the property,
provided they do not conflict with the development agreement.
      3.   Construction shall be halted if a developer and/or owner is found to
be out of compliance with the development agreement and further building
permits shall not be issued until there is compliance.
   B.   The City, without incurring any liability, may engage in actions that
otherwise would constitute a breach of a development agreement if the City
Council makes a determination, after a public hearing, that the action is
necessary to address a substantial risk to public health, safety, or the
general welfare. In addition, the City may, without incurring any liability,
engage in actions that would constitute a breach of a development agreement if
required by federal or state law, or court order.
   C.   Except as expressly provided in a development agreement, the
development agreement shall not be construed so as to create any right
enforceable by a person who is not a party to the development agreement.
Purchasers of lots in approved subdivisions shall not be third-party
beneficiaries of a development agreement.
   D.   Any breach of a development agreement by the City shall not give rise
to monetary damages, but the sole remedy for the developer and/or owner of
property, or successor-in-interest, shall be an action for specific
performance.
   E.   Performance of the City’s duties pursuant to a development agreement
are expressly conditioned upon the developer and/or owner’s substantial
compliance with each and every term, condition, provision, and covenant of the
agreement, and with all applicable federal, state and local laws and
regulations.
   F.   A development agreement shall run with the land and bind all
successors, heirs, and assignees of the developer and owner.
   G.   No provision of any development agreement which is contrary to law may
be enforced. (Ord. 3704, 2022)
17.50.050: AMENDMENTS:
   A.   A development agreement may be amended only in a writing signed by the
original parties or their successors-in-interest. An amendment requested by the
Community Planning Director as provided in subsection B shall first be
presented to the Planning and Zoning Commission which, following notice and a
public hearing as required by section 67-6509, Idaho Code, shall make a
recommendation to the City Council to approve, approve with modifications, or
reject the amendment. An amendment shall not be effective until approved by the
City Council following notice and a public hearing as required by section 67-
6509, Idaho Code.
   B.   An amendment may be requested if the Community Planning Director
determines that:
      1.   The developer and/or owner has proposed a substantial change to the
approved land uses, development standards, and/or approved site plan associated
with the project;
      2.   The developer and/or owner has proposed a substantial change to any
approved parking or landscaping;
      3.   The developer and/or owner has proposed a substantial change to any
approved set of building elevations, or exterior appearance or design;
      4.   The developer and/or owner has proposed a substantial change to any
approved freestanding commercial or industrial center signage or multi-family
complex freestanding signage;
      5.   The amendment would be reasonable and necessary to satisfy a
compelling City interest which could not reasonably have been known or
anticipated by the City at the time the development agreement was approved; or
      6.   Circumstances have substantially changed so that amendment of the
terms of the development agreement is needed to further the goals and purposes
of the City and is in the public interest.
   C.   For purposes of this section, the term “substantial change” shall mean
any change which may have a significant impact on the ability of the developer
and/or owner to meet the purpose or intent of, or to comply with, the critical
terms of the development agreement.
   D.   A request to amend a development agreement by the developer and/or
owner, or their successor-in-interest, shall state the nature of the
modification and the reason(s) amendment is necessary and reasonable, how the
amendment is in the public interest, and provide plans showing approved and
requested changes. (Ord. 3704, 2022)
17.50.060: RECORDING:
Development agreements and any amendments thereto shall be recorded in the
office of the county recorder. Should a development agreement be terminated,
the zoning designation upon which the use was based shall revert to its prior
zoning designation at the sole discretion of the City or, if done as part of an
annexation, rezoned to the lowest intensity zoning district within the City
which is appropriate under all the circumstances (unless a de-annexation is
warranted), and a document recording such termination and reversion shall be
recorded in the office of the county recorder. The developer and/or owner shall
pay all recording fees. (Ord. 3704, 2022)
17.50.070: REVIEW AND ENFORCEMENT:
   A.   The Community Planning Director shall monitor the developer and/or
owner’s compliance with the terms and conditions of the development agreement.
   B.   Upon the request of the Community Planning Director, the developer and/
or owner, or their successors-in-interest, shall demonstrate compliance with
the terms and/or conditions of the development agreement.
   C.   If the Community Planning Director determines that the developer and/or
owner, or their successors-in-interest, are not in compliance with the terms
and conditions of the development agreement, and such lack of compliance is not
resolved by the developer and/or owner within a reasonable time set by the
City, the Community Planning Director may recommend that the City seek specific
performance of the terms of the development agreement, terminate the agreement,
or seek any other available remedy at law or equity. (Ord. 3704, 2022)
17.50.080: TERMINATION:
   A.   Upon the failure of the developer and/or owner, or their successors-in-
interest, to comply with the terms and/or conditions of the development
agreement, the City may terminate the development agreement. If the development
agreement is terminated, at the sole discretion of the City the zoning
designation of the property or any undeveloped portion of the property shall
revert to the prior zoning designation or, if zoned with annexation, may be
rezoned to the lowest intensity zoning district within the City which is
appropriate under all the circumstances (unless a de-annexation is warranted).
Prior to termination, the developer and/or owner shall be afforded a reasonable
time, as determined by the Community Planning Director, to bring the property
into compliance with the development agreement.
   B.   Upon the sale of property subject to a development agreement, the
purchaser may request termination of the development agreement in accordance
with subparagraph C.
   C.   When termination of a development agreement is contemplated, a public
hearing shall be conducted before the Planning and Zoning Commission in
accordance with the notice and hearing procedures of § 67-6509, Idaho Code. The
Planning and Zoning Commission shall determine if the circumstances support
termination and termination is in the best interests of the City. In such case,
the zoning designation of the property shall revert to the zoning designation
of the property prior to the development agreement. The Planning and Zoning
Commission’s determination may be appealed to the City Council utilizing the
procedures set out in §§
17.09.705 to
17.09.715, Coeur d’Alene Municipal Code.
   D.   The City and the developer and/or owner, or their successors-in-
interest, of the property may mutually agree to terminate a development
agreement. In such case, at the sole discretion of the City, the zoning
designation of the property shall revert to the zoning designation it held
prior to the development agreement, in whole or in part.
   E.   The developer and/or owner of property subject to a development
agreement may terminate the development agreement as to any remaining
undeveloped land if the City modifies the development agreement without their
consent. In the event the developer and/or owner choose to terminate the
development agreement under these circumstances, the zoning designation of the
property shall revert to the zoning designation it held prior to the
development agreement in the sole discretion of the City. (Ord. 3704, 2022)
17.50.090: FEES:
The City Council shall set the fee for a development agreement by resolution.
(Ord. 3704, 2022)
