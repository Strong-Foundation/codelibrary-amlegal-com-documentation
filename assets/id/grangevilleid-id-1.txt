Therefore, the City of Grangeville, Idaho County, Idaho does ordain the
following regulations. (Ord. 565, 10-3-1983; amd. Ord. 954, 12-20-2021)
4-5-1-2: FINDINGS OF FACT:
   A.   The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation
which may result in loss of life and property, health, and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   B.   These flood losses may be caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazards, which increase flood heights
and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas.
Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from
flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. 565, 10-3-1983; amd. Ord.
954, 12-20-2021)
4-5-1-3: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety, and

   B.   To minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control
projects;
   C.   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   D.   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   E.   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   F.   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   G.   To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an
area of special flood hazard; and
   H.   To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 565, 10-3-1983; amd. Ord. 954,
12-20-2021)
4-5-1-4: METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
In order to accomplish its purposes, this Chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   A.   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   B.   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
constructions;
   C.   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
   D.   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   E.   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas. (Ord. 565, 10-3-1983; amd. Ord. 954, 12-20-2021)

               principally above ground or manufactured home that is principally above ground.
SUBSTANTIAL    Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the
DAMAGE:        structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent
               (50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
               Any, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other improvement of a structure,
               the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
               structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term
               includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the
               actual repair work performed.
SUBSTANTIAL    The term does not, however, include either:
IMPROVEMENT:   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of
               State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been
               identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum
               necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
               B.   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will
               not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure."
VARIANCE:      A grant of relief from the requirements of this Chapter which permits construction
               in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this Chapter.
               The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the
               community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development
VIOLATION:     without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of
               compliance required in this Chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time
               as that documentation is provided.
               The height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, or

4-5-3-1: LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES:
This Chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the
incorporated limits of the City. (Ord. 565, 10-3-1983; amd. Ord. 954, 12-20-
2021)
4-5-3-2: BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD:
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance
Administrator in a scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood
Insurance Study for the City of Grangeville, Idaho, Idaho County" dated
December 1, 1983, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps dated June 1,
1984 are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this Chapter.
The Flood Insurance Study and Flood Insurance Rate Maps are on file at City
Hall, Grangeville, Idaho. (Ord. 565, 10-3-1983; amd. Ord. 954, 12-20-2021)

reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This Chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages.
This Chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City, any officer or
employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administrator, for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this Chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder. (Ord. 565, 10-3-1983; amd. Ord. 954, 12-20-2021)
4-5-4: ADMINISTRATION:
4-5-4-1: ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT:
A development permit shall be obtained before construction or development
begins within any area of special flood hazard established in Section
4-5-3-2. The permit shall be for all structures including mobile homes, as set
forth in Section
4-5-2, Definitions, and for all other development including fill and other
activities, also as set forth in Section
4-5-2. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished by
the City Clerk and may include, but not be limited to: plans in duplicate drawn
to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area
in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials,

   D.   Description of the extent to which a watercourse will be altered or
relocated as a result of proposed development. (Ord. 565, 10-3-1983; amd. Ord.
954, 12-20-2021)
4-5-4-2: DESIGNATION OF THE BUILDING INSPECTOR:
The Building Inspector of the City is hereby appointed to administer and
implement this Chapter by granting or denying development permit applications
in accordance with its provisions. (Ord. 565, 10-3-1983; amd. Ord. 954, 12-20-
2021)
4-5-4-3: DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE BUILDING INSPECTOR:
Duties of the Building Inspector shall include, but not be limited to:
   A.   Permit Review:
      1.   Review all development permits to determine that the permit
requirements of this Chapter have been satisfied.
      2.   Review all development permits to determine that all necessary
permits have been obtained from those Federal, State, or local governmental
agencies from which prior approval is required.
      3.   Review all development permits to determine if the proposed
development is located in the floodway. If located in the floodway, assure that
the encroachment provisions of Subsection
4-5-5-3A of this Chapter are met.
   B.   Use Of Other Base Flood Data: When base flood elevation data has not
been provided in accordance with Section
4-5-3-2, Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard, the Building
Inspector shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation
data available from a Federal, State or other source, in order to administer
Subsection
4-5-5-2A, Specific Standards, Residential Construction, and Subsection
4-5-5-2B, Specific Standards, Nonresidential Construction.
   C.   Information To Be Obtained And Maintained:
      1.   Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially
improved structures, and whether or not the structure contains a basement.
      2.   For all new or substantially improved floodproofed structures:
         a.   Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level); and
         b.   Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in Subsection
4-5-4-1C.
      3.   Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the
provisions of this Chapter.
   D.   Interpretation Of FIRM Boundaries: Make interpretations where needed,
as to exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards
(for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary
and actual field conditions). The person contesting the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
4-5-4-4.
   E.   In areas where a floodway has not been designated, require that no new
construction, substantial improvements or other development (including fill)
shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the
community.
   F.   Whenever a watercourse is to be altered or relocated, notify adjacent
communities and the State Coordinating Office prior to such alteration or
relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the
Federal Insurance Administrator through appropriate notification means, and
assure that the flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion of
said watercourse is maintained.
   G.   Base Flood Elevations may increase or decrease resulting from physical
changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as practicable, but not later
than six months after the date such information becomes available, the
Floodplain Administrator shall notify the Federal Insurance Administrator of
the changes by submitting technical or scientific data in accordance with 44
CFR Section 65.3. Such a submission is necessary so that upon confirmation of
those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and
floodplain management requirements will be based upon current data.
   H.   Notify the Federal Insurance Administrator in writing of acquisition by
means of annexation, incorporation or otherwise, of additional areas of
jurisdiction. (Ord. 565, 10-3-1983; amd. Ord. 954, 12-20-2021)
4-5-4-4: VARIANCE PROCEDURES:
   A.   Appeal Board:
      1.   The City Council is hereby established by the City to hear and
decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this
Chapter;
      2.   The City Council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged
there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the
Building Inspector in the enforcement or administration of this Chapter;
      3.   Those aggrieved by the decision of the City or any taxpayer, may
appeal such decision to the District Court in and for Idaho County, as provided
by law;
      4.   In passing upon such applications, the City shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of this Chapter; and
         a.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         b.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         c.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owners;
         d.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         e.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         f.   The availability of alternative locations, for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         g.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         h.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
         i.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         j.   The expected heights, if applicable, expected at the site; and
         k.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      5.   Generally, the only condition under which a variance may be issued
is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of
one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items a
through k in Subsection A4 have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required
for issuing the variance increases.
      6.   Upon consideration of the factors of Subsection A4 and the purposes
of this Chapter, the City may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this Chapter.
      7.   The City Clerk shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and
report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administrator upon request.
   B.   Conditions For Variances:
      1.   Variances may be issued for the repair, rehabilitation or
restoration of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
      2.   Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      3.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      4.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         a.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public
as identified in Subsection A4, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
      5.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
      6.   The Building Inspector shall maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance. (Ord. 565, 10-3-1983; amd.
Ord. 954, 12-20-2021)

business and such other information as the Governing Body may deem necessary in

The Governing Body shall then conduct an investigation, comparing applicant's
business with other businesses of like nature and shall make findings of fact
from which it shall determine whether the fee fixed by this chapter is unfair,
unreasonable or discriminatory as to applicant's business and shall fix as the
license fee for the applicant an amount that is fair, reasonable and
undiscriminatory, or, if the fee has already been paid, shall order a refund of
the amount over and above the fee so fixed. In fixing the fee to be charged,
the Governing Body shall have the power to base the fee upon a percentage of
gross sales, or any other method which will assure that the fee assessed shall
be uniform with that assessed on business of like nature, so long as the amount
assessed does not exceed the fees as prescribed in this chapter. Should the
Governing Body determine the gross sales measure of the fee to be the fair
basis, it may require the applicant to submit, either at the time of
termination of applicant's business or at the end of each three (3) month
period, a sworn statement of the gross sales and to pay the amount of fee
therefor, provided that no additional fee during any one calendar year shall be

last known address at least five (5) days prior to the date set for the

the denial of a permit as provided herein, or the action of the Governing Body
in the assessing of the fee as provided shall have the right of appeal to the

commercial collector exists for the collection of refuse under this title,
require such collector to post a twenty five thousand dollar ($25,000.00)
performance bond to guarantee satisfactory performance of any contractual
obligations entered into by the City and such commercial collector. The City
may, at its option, require such bond at the time any contract is initially
negotiated and executed with a commercial collector or may waive such
requirement initially and add such requirement later during the pendency of any
contract. If the City shall believe a bond requirement is appropriate while any
contract is pending, the contractor shall be entitled to at least fourteen (14)

contractor shall be entitled to participate prior to the City's final
determination concerning whether a bond requirement will be added to any such
existing contract.

collector, it may increase the bonded amount to such rate as a two-thirds (2/3)
vote of the City Council deems appropriate under the then existing
circumstances.

sidewalk adjacent thereto to be or remain in such condition as to cause or
create a nuisance, obstruction, hazard to the public health, or offensive odor

provisions and conditions of this chapter pertaining to collection of garbage
and refuse, and the collector shall also comply with all applicable ordinances,

                     foot of water discharged into the sewer system as
USAGE RATE:          calculated in subsection C1 of this section. For billing
                     purposes, quantities will be rounded off to the nearest
                     one hundred (100) cubic feet of water on a monthly basis.
                     The combined charges for water, sewer, and sanitation
                     services and any combination of fees or penalties
UTILITY BILL:        incidental thereto. This definition shall apply not only
                     to this section, but also all references to water charges
                     and sewer charges throughout this Code.
 
   B.   System Of Periodic Service Charges And Fees: There is hereby
established a system of periodic service charges and fees in order to equitably
impose upon all users of the public sewerage system, the costs and expenses of
maintenance, operation, replacement, repair and expenses of the sewerage
system. Sewer usage bills shall become a part of the "utility bill" as defined
above, and shall be calculated based upon a percentage of water usage during
the same period of time. The said service charges and fees for the purposes of
computation shall be based upon:
      1.   The volume and content of effluent discharged into the sewer system
of the City; and
      2.   The actual and expected expense of maintenance, operation,
replacement, bonded indebtedness, upgrading and repair of the sewerage systems,
such charges and fees being determined to be the benefit derived by each
building, structure or user from the system.
   C.   Rates For Sewer:
      1.   Owners of a single facility, multi-facility, and/or commercial unit
connected to separate sewer lines shall pay a monthly basic rate based upon
seven hundred twenty-two (722) cubic feet of water passing through the water
meter for that facility, plus a usage rate equal to an incremental fee for each
one hundred (100) cubic feet of water passing through each water meter. The
basic rate and schedule for overage shall be as determined in subsection D of
this section.
      2.   Owners of multi-facility units connected to a single sewer line
shall pay the monthly basic rate described above for each unit using that line,
plus the usage rate for any water discharged into the system as described
above. Each residential living unit shall pay the monthly basic rate. For
mixed-use facilities, the number of units will be determined by an equivalent
residence (ER) using the winter consumption average as calculated in subsection
D of this section. The ER will be rounded up to the nearest tenth.
   D.   Basic Rate And Overage:
      1.   Basic Rate: "Basic rate or base monthly fee" shall be defined as the
charge applicable to one typical single-family residence that discharges a base
flow of seven hundred twenty two (722) cubic feet per month. It shall be
determined in the following manner:
         a.   Total cost (TC) equals the total annual estimated costs of
operation, maintenance, bonded indebtedness, expense, reasonable replacement
and repair expense shall be calculated and fixed by the City Council;
         b.   The total costs in subsection D1a of this section shall then be
the total average volume of water passing through the City water meters,
considering only the flows for the billing period from November through March
for the year prior to the calculated date.
      Step 1:
 
Residential and commercial users = Total flows from each user for 5 months
volume/year                        (most recent)
 
      Step 2:
 
Total flow (TF) = (flows for 5 months) ÷(5 months) x 12 months
 
      Step 3:
 
Unit cost (UC) or usage                               TF (commercial and
rate                    = TC (sewer utility budget) ÷residential annual use
                                                      cubic feet)
 
      Multiply the base residential average monthly volume of 722 cubic feet
per month per user times the cost per cubic foot (UC) (step 3) to find the base
rate.
 
Base rate or base = 722 cfm x UC per = 722 cubic feet per month x (unit cost)
monthly fee         residential user   per residential user       (cubic feet)
 
      2.   Overage:
         a.   Commercial users' monthly billing rates will be based on the base
monthly fee, as calculated above, plus the usage rate times all flows above a
meter reading of seven hundred twenty-two (722) cubic feet per month (overage)
for the billing period of November through March; and for the billing period of
April through October the base monthly fee plus the monthly average of all
flows above seven hundred twenty-two (722) cubic feet per month meter readings
for the billing period of November through March.
            (1)   The formula stated above shall be applicable to all
commercial accounts except for those businesses described below specifically.
            (2)   Hotels and motels within the city or on city services shall
be based upon an eight (8) month average of the months of October through May
inclusive each year.
            (3)   Car washes and laundromats shall not be based on an average
and shall be based upon the actual water usage through their respective meters.
            (4)   Any additional business which in the future demonstrates a
sewer usage not consistent with regular commercial business described herein or
any of the exceptions above described shall be independently analyzed by the
city council and an average will be assigned to that new business based upon
actual sewage use.
         b.   Residential and multi-facility units shall pay a monthly bill
based on the base monthly fee, as calculated above, plus the usage rate times
all flows above a meter reading of seven hundred twenty-two (722) cubic feet
per month (overage) for the billing period November through March; and for the
billing period April through October, the base monthly fee plus the monthly
average of all flows above seven hundred twenty-two (722) cfm water meter
reading for the billing period November through March.
   E.   Nonmetered Water Service: Owners of any unit, whether it be commercial
or single-family unit, not receiving metered water service from the city shall
pay the monthly basic rate calculated above and such additional usage rate as
would be charged to a similar user whose water flow is metered.
   F.   High Strength Users; Billing Calculations; Connection Fees: Users of
the system who contribute high strength wastewater loading to the system shall
have a bill based upon the same flow charges per unit volume plus an additional
surcharge based upon excess Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), total suspended
solids (TSS), Nitrogen, and/or Phosphorus as are determined to be fair and
equitable. In determining the actual bill for high strength users, it shall be
calculated based upon standards set forth in the "Wastewater Engineering
Treatment and Resource Recovery" by Metcalf & Eddy (Fifth Edition), or similar
standards as are most current at the time a determination needs to be made. If
necessary, actual sewage flow for a representative period of time shall be
calculated and actual sewer samples shall be taken to determine a fair and
equitable charge for any such user. "Average residential sewage strength" shall
be defined as 200 mg/L BOD (5-day), 200 mg/L TSS, 5.6 mg/L Total Phosphorus (as
P), and 35 mg/L Total Nitrogen (as N).
   Any person aggrieved by a sewer charge, shall be permitted to monitor at his
expense his wastewater flows for a representative period of time and shall have
the right to appeal to the city council demonstrating an appropriate charge
based upon the standards set forth in this chapter for similar flows.
   Any exception to the flow charges as herein established shall be as directed
only by a majority vote of the city council based upon extraordinary
circumstances tending to demonstrate that water usage would be an inaccurate
indicator of the use of the sewer system.
      1.   Review Of Sewer Rates: The City Council may review the sewer rates
biannually and based upon the actual costs to provide wastewater treatment
services, shall revise the sewer rates accordingly. The City shall notify each
user of any changes in the sewer use charges attributable to the wastewater
treatment services.
      2.   All users of the Grangeville sewer system outside of the City limits
shall pay two (2) times the basic rate plus the usage rate attributable to that
kind of business.
      3.   Notice Of Termination: The City Council is hereby authorized and
directed to provide notice as is provided in section
8-5-7 of this chapter, concerning water bills, to provide that services will be
terminated and a failure to pay the sewer bill or any portion thereof shall be
treated as a failure to pay any portion of the utility bill including water
bills, and services may be terminated in accordance with said section.
      4.   Map Of Water And Sewer System: The Water Superintendent shall keep
on file in his office a map of said water and sewer system showing the
locations of all mains, gates, fire hydrants, crosses, tees, plugs, underground

Superintendent shall also tend to the ordering of supplies for the maintenance,
repair, and operation of said system when approved by the Mayor and Council and
shall perform such other duties as may be required of him from time to time by
the City Council in connection with the maintenance and operation of said
system.
      5.   Record Of Costs: The Water Superintendent shall keep a record of the
cost of labor and materials of each connection made or for any service
rendered, which cost record shall be completed immediately following each job
and shall be kept on file in the Office of the Water Superintendent.
      6.   Connection Mandatory; Fees:
         a.   Within The City Of Grangeville: Any person occupying or using
premises within the City limits, but not connected with the sewer and producing
sewage effluent, shall be required to connect with the Grangeville sewer
collection system. Written application for sewer connection shall be made on
forms to be furnished by the City Clerk. The charges for making the connection
shall be deposited with the City Clerk at the time of making the application

whether in residential or commercial properties, those tenants shall be
entitled to continue to receive utility billings in their own name until that
property shall be vacated by that tenant. Thereafter, the property owner as
described in subsection A of this section shall receive future billings.
   C.   Furthermore, in the event a current tenant who is receiving billings on
either residential or commercial properties becomes delinquent in the payment
of his utility bills and has not paid the bill by the time the additional
delinquent charge created in subsection
8-5-9 of this chapter can be added to a bill, then the tenant forfeits his
right to have future billings in his own name, his account will be closed, and
the property owner will receive all future billings. The tenant in that
circumstance will still be liable to the City for all delinquency charges and
other costs. (Ord. 836, 11-19-2007; amd. Ord. 946, 11-2-2020)
8-5-9: CHARGES; TIME OF PAYMENT; SHUT OFF FOR DELINQUENCY AND NOTICE:
   A.   Payment Of Charges: All water rates and other charges shall be due and
payable at the Office of the City Clerk during office hours by the tenth of
each month for the last preceding billing period. Billing periods shall be as
prescribed by the City Clerk and this Code. All accounts shall become
delinquent at five o'clock (5:00) P.M. on the tenth day of the month if not
paid as aforesaid. Whenever any customer becomes delinquent the City Clerk
shall be authorized to send notice of any past due charges and any delinquency
charges by ordinary mail to the customer. The City Clerk shall likewise be
entitled and authorized by ordinary mail to deliver to the customer a notice of
intent to discontinue water and sewer services from the premises to which the
services were furnished. Such notice shall be on forms provided by the City
Clerk and notify the occupant that services will be discontinued and will
remain cut off until all charges, penalties, and fees under this title have
been paid to the City.
   B.   Additional Delinquent Charge: In the event water, sewer, or garbage
bills are not paid prior to the fifteenth of each month, a service fee as
established in the master fee schedule will be added to such billing for each
month that said bill remains delinquent and unpaid. Said charge shall be in
addition to all other penalties or interest charges provided in the ordinances
concerning water, sewer, and garbage billings.
   C.   Accounts Subject To Shutoff: Any account which remains delinquent on
the tenth day of the month following the initial billing month will be subject
to shutoff if the account is not paid in full (approximately 45 days from the
date of initial billing). Any account which is subject to shutoff shall be
subject to placement of a hang tag delivered to the place where service is
provided. If delinquency proceeds to the hang tag stage and a hang tag is
placed on the account, the customer shall be responsible for a hang tag fee as
established in the master fee schedule which shall constitute a service charge
for collection expenses. If payment is made after the hang tag has been placed,
said hang tag fee shall be paid in addition to all current and past due water
service charges to avoid shutoff of water service.
   D.   Notice Of Shutoff: At least forty eight (48) hours' notice of shutoff
for delinquent payment should be provided by posting a notice on the property
or hanging it from the doorknob of the front door or other nearby feature. A
fee as established in the master fee schedule will be charged to any service
which has been shut off due to delinquency in payment. If an account is shut
off for failure to pay, the account shall not be reconnected until all current
and past due charges are paid in full, in addition to payment of the hang tag
fee.
   F.   Will Pay Agreements: The City Clerk/Treasurer may make arrangements
with customers (known as a will pay agreement) before hang tag morning and
before shutoff morning. This agreement is a promise to pay the outstanding bill
later than the due date. Will pay agreements are to be made only in the
circumstances where future payment can be assured and resources for payment are
identified. No more than three (3) will pay agreements may be accepted per
calendar year unless documented extenuating circumstances exist, e.g., medical
reasons, death, or other at the City Council's discretion. Delinquency fees
will not be waived in connection with a will pay agreement. Will pay agreements
enable the City Clerk/Treasurer to collect outstanding bills without shutting
off service when clear means of future payment can be demonstrated. Failure to
make any payment on a will pay agreement shall make the entire amount due and
payable immediately and the account shall be subject to immediate shutoff.
(Ord. 850, 4-20-2009; amd. Ord. 925, 10-1-2018; Ord. 946, 11-2-2020)
8-5-10: TREASURER TO CREDIT SUMS COLLECTED TO WATER FUND:
The City Treasurer shall credit all sums received from the City Clerk, as
hereinabove provided, to a fund to be known as the Water Fund, and no
disbursements shall be made therefrom except on order of the City Council by
warrant issued as in other cases. (1959 Code; amd. Ord. 946, 11-2-2020)
8-5-11: TURN OFF REQUEST; CHARGES FOR TURN OFF:
   A.   Request:
      1.   Water shall be turned off on the written or verbal request from a
consumer. If turned off for violation of rules or nonpayment of bills, service
shall not be reinstated until the account is paid in full.
      2.   It is declared policy of the City that all properties receiving
water from the Grangeville water system at the time of passage hereof must
continue to contribute monthly bond fees until the bond is paid, as set forth
in this section and ordinance 766.
         a.   Therefore, all water service bills for all accounts that exist on
the date of the passage hereof will continue to be required to pay the bond
payment fee as established in the master fee schedule and required in
Grangeville City ordinance 766, passed on January 20, 2004. If any property
that was receiving a water bill on the effective date hereof shall be turned
off either voluntarily, at the request of a property owner, or involuntarily
for nonpayment, the water bond fee shall continue to be paid until the water
bond has been fully paid.
         b.   If an account relates to a property that includes a primary
residence or business, and also that same property has a supplementary
irrigation account, the bond fee herein required shall only be billed to the
primary residence or business.
         c.   However, properties that have only an irrigation account shall be
billed the bond payment fee.
      3.   All properties receiving City utilities will be required to pay the
monthly base rate for each service, regardless of whether the water is turned
on or off. If the water is turned off, the monthly base rate will be calculated
at 1 ER (equivalent residence). When the water is turned on, the appropriate
calculated ER would then be charged.
   B.   Reconnection Deposit Refunded: In the event a three hundred percent
(300%) deposit has been posted with the City Clerk as previously required by
this section and thereafter a customer shall timely pay all utility bills
without any delinquencies for at least a twenty-four (24) month period, then
the bond can be refunded to the customer. Furthermore, upon the closing of any
account, any posted deposit shall be applied against any unpaid utility bills
and the customer shall be refunded any unapplied balance.
   C.   Discontinued Service Request:
      1.   In order to discontinue a service the customer shall make written
request to the City Clerk's Office on forms provided. The Water Department will
then remove and take possession of the water meter and plug each end of the
meter setter. The service line and appurtenances other than the meter will
remain intact unless the customer requests that the service be shut off at the
main and the meter boxes removed. This additional work will be billed on a time
and material basis. Discontinuance of the service will end the current bond
payment for the account and the account will become dormant/inactive.
      2.   After the date of service discontinuance should a request to
reconnect the discontinued service for any reason be received, the charges for
reconnection and equity buy ins as established in the master fee schedule shall
apply and be paid in advance.
      3.   Reconnecting any service that has been cut off at the main and had
the meter boxes removed will be charged on a time and material basis. An
estimate of the charges will be provided at the time the reconnection request
is made with the City Clerk's Office. The actual costs for reconnecting the
service will be billed and shall be paid before the service is turned on.
      4.   At no time, may a customer choose to discontinue water service and
keep the sewer service. Irrigation only services are an exception and shall not
be required to have sewer. (Ord. 850, 4-20-2009; amd. Ord. 851, 7-6-2009; Ord.
925, 10-1-2018; Ord. 946, 11-2-2020; amd. Ord. 948, 3-15-2021)
8-5-12: CITY RESERVES RIGHT TO TURN OFF FOR REPAIRS AT ANY TIME:
The water may be shut off at any time for mains, laterals, or service pipes,
without notice, for the purpose of making repairs or extensions or in other
cases of necessity, and the City will not be responsible for any damages caused
thereby or resulting therefrom. (1959 Code; amd. Ord. 946, 11-2-2020)
8-5-13: REGULATION OF SERVICE FOR SPRINKLING:
The City reserves the right to regulate the use of water for sprinkling and
irrigating purposes and the Water Superintendent shall give notice by
publication, of any restrictions on the use of water for such purposes; and
thereafter any consumer using or permitting water to be used for sprinkling or
irrigating purposes except as limited in such notice, shall be subject to a
penalty as established in the master fee schedule for each offense and in
default of payment thereof, the water shall be shut off. It shall be the duty
of the Water Superintendent, whenever the consumption of water threatens to
exceed the capacity of the pumping system, to report such conditions to the
Mayor and City Council thereof in order that the use of water for sprinkling
and irrigation may be restricted. (1959 Code; amd. Ord. 925, 10-1-2018; Ord.
946, 11-2-2020)
8-5-14: INTERFERENCE WITH SYSTEM PROHIBITED; CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR

bypass by piping, or destroy any fire hydrant, pipe, main, meter, service box,
or other appurtenance of said water system, or shall open any fire hydrant or
cap or make connection with any water main, lateral, or pipe, without first
having obtained permission from the proper official, or shall divert or
appropriate water from any hydrant, main, lateral, or water pipe without paying
therefor the rentals and charges hereinafter specified, shall be subject to the
civil and criminal penalties set out in this section. It is to be specifically
included that no person shall be permitted to adjust, change, or turn on any
water valve that has been turned off by the City for any reason whatsoever,

City water bills.
   Any person violating this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and be
subject to the general misdemeanor penalties prescribed in Idaho State law for
general misdemeanors.
   B.   In all prosecutions under the foregoing section proof that any of the
acts herein forbidden were done on or about the premises owned or occupied by
the defendant charged with the commission of such offense or that said person
received the benefit of water service at that premises on account of the
commission of such acts shall be prima facie evidence of the guilt of such
defendant. Specifically, if the defendant knew or should have known that the
water had been turned off by the City authority for any reason whatsoever,
including, but not limited to, turning the same off because of a failure to pay
water bills, then proof of subsequent use of water at that premises shall be
sufficient proof of guilt.
   C.   Any person aiding, abetting, or counseling the acts or any of them
mentioned in the preceding section shall, upon conviction thereof, be equally
guilty with the principals and be subject to the same criminal penalties.
   D.   Any person doing any of the above prohibited acts shall, in addition,
be subject to a civil penalty in the amount established in the master fee
schedule and in addition, shall be subject to a triple charge for all water
that can be reasonably proven to have been delivered to that premises after the
improper diversion or improper adjustment of any valve. The civil penalty
herein prescribed shall be assessable either as a restitution order in any
criminal case after conviction or independently assessable in the Small Claims
Division of the District Court within this State. The civil penalties set forth
herein shall be in addition to the criminal penalties set forth for misdemeanor
violation and shall constitute additional sums to which the City would be
entitled to a lien. (Ord. 731, 3-19-2001; amd. Ord. 925, 10-1-2018; Ord. 946,

cause incrustations to chemically or physically attach so as to corrode or
erode the sewer or sewage disposal system or facilities.
   B.   Any property owner, occupant, tenant or sewer user violating the
provisions of this section shall, upon notice by the Water Superintendent,
immediately install such preliminary treatment through separators, traps, and/
or chemical, physical or biochemical processes, as will make and assure that
the sewage contributed from such property or premises will meet the
requirements of this chapter.
   C.   Any person violating the provisions of this section after notice above
specified shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and each day shall be deemed to
constitute a separate offense. (1959 Code; amd. Ord. 946, 11-2-2020)

to adequately service whatever building to which the same would be connected.
(Ord. 572, 4-16-1984; amd. Ord. 946, 11-2-2020)

months in which the bill is not read what the water usage should be and having
the City Clerk bill accordingly on the estimates. During those months that the
meter is in fact read, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the bill so
that the customer at the end of each quarter has paid for the water actually
used in accordance with the other provisions of this Code.
   B.   Where, in the discretion of the Public Works Director and the City
Clerk, it is impractical or imprudent to bill on the basis of quarterly
estimates, monthly meter readings may be made and the bills sent to customers
accordingly.
   C.   Any person objecting to monthly estimates and quarterly adjustments may
file their objection with the City Clerk and thus be entitled to monthly meter
readings, so long as the objection shall be on file with the City Clerk. (Ord.

   B.   In the event that the applicant owns other property outside of the
incorporated limits of the City that will not actually be served with water
and/or sewer and has a separately identifiable legal description, that property
need not be annexed until it would later be connected to the City water and/or
sewer systems.
   C.   All existing properties outside the City limits of the City of
Grangeville currently connected to the City water and/or sewer systems are
entitled to continue to be served with water and/or sewer and pay therefor the

and storm sewage collection and treatment, public safety services, fire
protection, and other community service facilities, and to promote the land use
capability, street alignment, and traffic flow objectives consistent with
orderly growth. (Ord. 863, 11-15-2010)
10-9-2: AREAS OF CITY IMPACT DEFINED:
   A.   Area: The area of city impact shall consist of any area where
development or land use affects and/or may affect the city of Grangeville in
consideration of trade areas, geographic factors, and areas that can be
reasonably expected to be annexed to the city in the future.
   B.   Geographic Area:
      1.   The officially adopted area of city impact is hereby established and
is shown on the map entitled "Grangeville area of impact", which is attached as
exhibit A to the ordinance codified herein, and is officially made part hereof
by reference. The legal description of that area is attached as exhibit B to
the ordinance codified herein, which is likewise incorporated by this
reference.

structure or dwelling intended or used for continuous or periodic habitation,
occupancy, or use requiring or using water by human beings is constructed or
placed on the property on or after May 1, 2010. Nothing in this subsection
shall be deemed to require a variance in the event a domestic water well is not
being utilized on a temporary basis due to repairs or maintenance of the well
or water delivery system. "Temporary basis" shall be defined as less than one
year. Such repairs and maintenance shall not include digging the well deeper.

cross connected to the Grangeville municipal water system without first
obtaining the approval of the city. In addition to all other authority of the
city recognized or authorized under this chapter, the city may refuse to permit
connection or may discontinue any connection to the municipal water system in
the area of city impact if it finds the connection poses an unreasonable risk
of cross connection or contamination of the municipal water system from a

fifty percent (50%) of the replaced valuation of the building remains after
such damage, such structure may be restored to the same nonconforming use as
existed before such damage.
      1.   This section shall not be applicable to the destruction of already
established and set up mobile homes that might be located in an improper zone
thus constituting a nonconforming use. If such mobile home is destroyed to the
extent described above, the owner shall be permitted to either rebuild the
existing unit or to replace the existing unit with a substantially similar
mobile home or one that is of better quality, without being required to comply
with this section.
      2.   If the owner of any parcel of property upon which a nonconforming
mobile home has been located shall voluntarily choose to upgrade the mobile
home on that particular lot or parcel then said owner shall be permitted to
install a replacement unit with a substantially similar mobile home or one that
is of better quality without being required to comply with this section.

mobile home has been located sells that real property and the mobile home is
voluntarily removed from such parcel of land, then the provisions of this
section shall be applicable and the subject property shall thereafter be
brought into compliance with the provisions of this section.
   D.   The use of a nonconforming building may be changed only to a use
conforming to the zone in which the property is located. (Ord. 737, 6-18-2001)

The Planning and Zoning Commission may vary a zoning regulation:
   A.   Hearing:
      1.   When in its judgment the public convenience and welfare will be
substantially served, regulations, restrictions and boundaries may from time to
time be amended, supplemented, changed, modified or relaxed.
      2.   With any application for a variance, the applicant shall, at the
time the application is filed with the City, provide the City Clerk with the
names and addresses of all persons owning any real property within three
hundred feet (300') of any portion of the area for which the variance is
sought. Thereafter, those persons owning property within three hundred feet
(300') shall be delivered either personally, or by certified mail, a notice of
a hearing that this section requires with the mailing and notice having
occurred at least fifteen (15) days prior to the time of such hearing. In any
notice of hearing there shall be language therein that includes the content of
subsection A3 of this section, describing the City's protest procedure, in the
event of objection.
      3.   At such hearing, if there be then a protest against such change
signed by the owners of twenty percent (20%) or more of the property owners
within the said three hundred foot (300') area, such variance shall not become
effective except by the favorable vote of five-sixths (5/6) of all the members
of the City Council. (Ord. 685, 7-8-1996)
      4.   In addition, no such regulation, restriction or boundary shall
become effective until a public hearing in relation thereto is held before the

have an opportunity to be heard. In addition to the personal notices required
in subsection A2 of this section, notice of hearing shall be published in the

the time set for the hearing in order to provide notice to the public at large.
(Ord. 764, 11-17-2003)
      5.   All initial applications for a variance shall be submitted to the
Planning and Zoning Commission who shall make its recommendation to the City
Council for consideration at the next meeting following the decision of the
Planning and Zoning Commission. The City Council shall have the duty to
formally pass any application for a variance unless the same shall have been
withdrawn by the applicant prior to the action of the City Council. (Ord. 685,
7-8-1996)
   B.   Form; Fee: Any person wishing to make application for a variance under
the terms hereof shall make such application on forms to be provided by the

herein provided, requesting the placement of a pre-March 8, 1971, Idaho built
mobile home, or a mobile home manufactured in another state, that does not bear
a mobile home insignia tag, in residence Zone B, the Planning and Zoning
Commission and the City Council, in determining whether to grant that
application for variance, shall take into account the following community
standards: the character, type, style and use of the structures in the
surrounding neighborhood, together with the public input received at the time
of any hearings, including any objections by neighbors and any potential
objection by the Grangeville Fire Department, who must be notified of the
variance application. After the matter has been fully considered by both the
Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council, the request may be denied
if those bodies find that the mobile home, would not be compatible or
harmonious with existing housing or would adversely affect property values. If
a variance is denied, the City Council shall make written findings and approve
the same by motion as to the reasons for the denial, and retain those findings
in the City records.
Furthermore, in any variance relating to the location of a manufactured home,
or a mobile home, in an area where it is generally not allowed, any home
located with a variance must additionally comply with the standards of this
Code and the Federal Emergency Management Agency within flood zones, so that
