CHAPTER 1
STREET AND RIGHT OF WAY IMPROVEMENTS
SECTION:

7-1-2: Permits Required
7-1-3: Application; Requirements; Fees
7-1-4: Construction Inspection
7-1-5: Infrastructure Improvement Policy (Rep. by Ord. 417, 10-25-1996)
7-1-6: Permit Revocation
7-1-7: Penalty
7-1-1: PURPOSE; IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED:
The purpose of this chapter is to require and to regulate the construction and/
or capital maintenance of public facilities or the facilities of private
utilities within the public rights of way by reviewing construction design
drawings, by issuance of construction permits and oversight of inspection of
such facilities in order to assure, to the greatest extent practical, that
utility construction work and/or other construction work within the public
right of way complies with applicable city ordinances and construction
standards adopted by the city.
It is the intent of the city by enactment hereof, and the city hereby does
establish physical improvement standards for land uses to be constructed,
established, materially added to or otherwise developed from an unimproved
state. No building permit shall issue nor shall any development permit issue
until the city council has approved construction plans for public right of way
improvements adjoining any such development site. Further, no certificate of
occupancy, business license or approval to operate any land use shall be
authorized for any owner or occupant of unplatted lands within the city or for
any owner or occupant of any lands platted prior to enactment of the city’s
subdivision ordinance until the site in question has been improved in a manner
equivalent to the standards for public improvements for developments
established by the subdivision ordinance of the city as of the date of the
proposal to establish occupancy or initiate a land use regulated by the zoning
ordinance of the city.
At a minimum, said required site improvements shall include a paved surface on
the fronting street, sidewalk for pedestrian travel, extension of water and
sewer lines and continuation of surface water drainage across the full frontage
of the lands in question. If improvements must be installed in the midst of
lots, tracts or parcels that have been partially improved to comply with
previously adopted standards, the city council may authorize improvements to
standards that will integrate with improvements already in place. In no
instance shall such authority to integrate improvements compromise efforts of
the city to maintain continuity in utility extension, continuity of
pedestrianways and extension of paved street rights of way.
Construction excavation shall not be allowed within City rights-of-ways from
November 1 until March 31. Should extended freezing conditions prevail before
or after those dates, the City may impose additional restrictions for
construction excavation with City rights-of-way. Construction excavation shall
not be allowed within City streets that have received Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA)
surfacing within 5 years of the date of proposed construction excavation,
unless special conditions imposed by the City are met. Those special conditions
could include backfill with Controlled Density Fill (CDF), or other means
through which to minimize settlement and provide a smooth, durable surface
across the excavation area.
In the end, the city engineer shall recommend in writing whether plans for
right of way improvements are consistent with the purposes and requirements
established by this chapter, by the city’s zoning ordinance and by sound
engineering practices. The city engineer shall forward any such recommendation
for final decision to the Spirit Lake city council no more than seven (7) days
after the date of the written recommendation by the city engineer, and after
allowing a reply from the property owner, either on the record during a public
meeting or in writing, shall decide the standards of site improvement that
shall apply to the specific site. The city council shall render its decision as
promptly as practical, but no later than ninety eight (98) days subsequent to
the date of transmission of the written recommendation from the city engineer
unless otherwise approved by the applicant. In extraordinary circumstances
where practical difficulties may be presented, the city engineer or city
council may allow payment of estimated cost equivalents in lieu of installation
of required improvements. (Ord. 508, 7-10-2007; amd. Ord. 626, 12-14-2021)

   A.    Kootenai County Addressing Standard Adopted: Addressing along the city
roads shall be based on the address grid established by Kootenai County, which
is:
      Kootenai County shall be divided into four (4) quadrants with the address
origination point located at the southwest corner of Section 13, Township 50
North, Range 4 West, B.M., being approximately the intersection of Northwest
Boulevard and Government Way in the City of Coeur d'Alene as follows:
      A. To the north, from the origination point as defined above, to the
Kootenai County's north boundary.

center of Coeur d'Alene Lake to Kootenai County's south boundary.
      D. To the west, from the origination point as defined above, to the
center of the Spokane River, then westerly down the center of the Spokane River
to Kootenai County's west boundary.

      1.   Address numbers will run consecutively to the north, south, east and
west from the point of beginning.
      2.    From the point of beginning, 1600 address numbers will be
designated per linear mile.
      3.    All addresses shall be defined with a direction letter (N, S, E, W)
predirectional following the address number, pursuant to the grid defined in
subsection A of this section (address grid) (example: 409 E. Maine).

assigned one number, with the owner of the structure responsible for providing
a designated individual numbering of each unit before an address will be
issued.
      3.    Mobile home parks shall be assigned one number for each lot within
the park based on the addressing system coordinates. The owner of the mobile
home park shall be responsible for providing designated individual numbering of
each mobile home space. Roads within the mobile home park shall be signed

point of the road closest to the address origination point and shall proceed in
a clockwise direction using a consecutive numerical order with the odd/even
numbers based on the starting point of the circle road as if the road were
straight.
         b.   For loop roads, the beginning of the road is designated by the
closest intersection to the origination point and increases numerically to that
point that is the farthest from the origination point.
      6.    Properties with structures, or bare land parcels, that have a
driveway shall be assigned an address based on a primary access point on a
named road or common driveway.
      7.    Properties that have multiple driveways shall have a designated
primary access point designated by the property owner that will be used for the

assign an official address for each adjacent parcel.
      10.    All plats produced as a result of subdivisions, short plats,
planned unit developments, or other projects that require the establishment of
primary access points from public or private roads for driveways shall have
predesignated primary access points. These points shall be utilized to assign
addresses to the associated parcels. In all cases, the primary access points
shall be verified by the planning and building department prior to the receipt
of a certificate of occupancy for new structures to determine the actual
address. The property owner may be required to pay a fee to cover the costs
incurred to provide this service. If it becomes necessary to provide addresses
for other navigable lakes and water bodies within the city, addresses shall be
established starting at a readily identified point on the water body and the
above addressing convention will be applied. (Ord. 470, 9-9-2003)
7-3-4: ROAD NAMING:
   A.    Road Naming Policy: In selecting road names, consideration shall be

assemble, update and maintain an official list of all road names throughout the
city for use by all jurisdictions.
      3.   Names of similar pronunciation and/or spelling shall be prohibited
(example: Briar Lane, Brier Lane).

      2.    In the case of other new roads or naming of unnamed roads, the
owner or owners and/or contract buyers of properties abutting said road, may
petition, in writing on a form provided by the city, to the city council, to
request an official name for a new road. The council shall give due
consideration to any and all road name petitions, only after all road naming
requirements of this chapter are met. The council shall officially designate
the road name having the greatest percentage of approval in the event a fifty
one percent (51%) approval is not obtained.
   C.    Renaming Of Existing Duplicated Road Names:

   A.    City Maintains And Operates: The city will maintain and operate the
city water system from the source of the water supply up to, and including, the
water meter where one is installed on the individual water service line. If the
water meter is found to have been installed within the property boundary of
landowner, but without a documented easement, any person shall be deemed to
have granted an easement across his/her property to allow the city access to
the water meter. If this implied easement is not satisfactory to the landowner,
it will be the landowner's financial responsibility to have the service
connection and water meter moved by the city, or the city's designee to a
location where the city has documented easement rights to access the water
meter. In addition to such costs, the property owner is responsible for all
costs of meter relocation and of meter connection and the costs of reconnection
of any private water service line made necessary by the relocation of any meter
as provided by this section. If such implied easement is not acknowledged and
accepted by the property owner, or if the property owner refuses to pay for the
relocation of a meter so affected, water service to the premises may be
terminated after notice to the property owner until such permission or water
meter movement has been accomplished. No person shall receive water from the
city water system without providing ready access to the water meter to allow
reading and maintenance thereof.

landowner must retain a licensed and bonded plumbing contractor to make
installation. Such licensed contractor shall make the installation under the
direct supervision of the city's public works staff. It may be determined by
the mayor or public works director that it would be in the city's best
interests to make the installation of any lateral with city forces. If
conditions are such that the city's crew makes the installation of the lateral,
a lateral installation fee as determined by resolution of the city council,
shall be prepaid by the landowner. This lateral installation fee is in addition
to regular water hookup fees which are to be paid at time of obtaining building
permit.
   C.    Liability For Damage: Whenever an agent or person other than the city
work crew, performs any excavation in the public right of way that results in
damage to the city's utility system, the cost of repairing any such damage to
city utilities shall be borne by that agent or person causing such damage, or
by the landowner who employed him/her. No excavation shall begin until response
has been received from the state mandated one call service.
   D.    Property Owner Bears Cost Of Materials: The cost of pipe, meters,
meter boxes, connective joints, shutoff valves, fire hydrants and all other
necessary materials for any given lateral installation and hookup shall be paid

7-4-4: SERVICE CONNECTION AND ASSOCIATED FEES:
   A.   Water Hookup Fee: Prior to connecting to the city water system, users
shall pay a hookup fee for capital maintenance and capacity expansion in the
amount set by resolution of the city council.
   B.    Single-Family Residence: Each standard service connection is a one
inch (1") meter and shall service one residence only. In the event that a
single-family residence has installed a meter that is larger than the standard
service connection, the user fees will be charged at the rates established by
resolution for commercial service of an equivalent meter size.
   C.    Other Buildings Or Structures: Whenever a service connection is to any
building or for any use that is not a permanent family residence, it is
considered a commercial service and shall pay the user fee set for the size of
meter that has been installed, with the minimum fee being the fee for a one
inch (1") meter.
   D.    Service Outside Of City Limits; Special Approval Required: No service
connection to property located outside the corporate limits of the city of
Spirit Lake shall be authorized without express approval by the city council.
   E.   Fees Paid In Full; Building Permit: The hookup fee and a water
construction non-refundable fee shall be paid at the time of the issuance of a
building permit. No building permit shall be issued until such fees are paid in
full.
   F.   Turnoff And Turnon Fees: Any time that the water is either turned on or
shut off at the meter by the city staff due to a request or actions of the
customer, the customer shall pay a turnoff or turnon fee in an amount set by
resolution of the council.
   G.   Multi-Family Structures: Each unit of a multi-family structure shall

CHARGES; ABUSE OF FLAT MONTHLY RATE:
   A.    Installation Of Remote Meters: Whenever the city determines that it is
necessary to assure ready access to meter supplied information, a water meter
with a remote, electrically powered readout, shall be installed, said readout
to be placed outside of a structure in a manner and location readily visible to
a meter reader. Whenever such installation shall be required, the costs thereof
shall be borne by the landowner.
   B.    Charges For Service: The charges, rates and fees for the various water
services shall be those established by council resolution, subject to change as
the council deems necessary. Each unit in a building with multiple units shall
be considered a separate service for the purpose of calculating the water
service charges.
   C.    Hauling Of Water: Drawing water from the city water system for the
purpose of hauling or transporting it away shall be done only under the
supervision of an officer or employee of the city, and then only after the
applicable fees and deposits have been paid to the city clerk. Said fee may be
set by resolution of the city.
   D.    Open Account Required Prior To Drawing Water: Whenever a water hookup
service has been installed to provide city water service to a property, no
water shall be drawn through that hookup by an owner, tenant or guest of either
if there is not currently on file with the city clerk an open water account for
that service. The fact that water service may be on at the time an owner,
tenant or guest of either should move onto a property shall not relieve such
person from the requirements of this section. The city may, without further
notice, shut off any service which is used without establishing an account. Any
person using water from the city system without establishing an account shall
be in violation of this chapter. (Ord. 485, 5-17-2005)

   B.    Deposit May Be Applied To The Account Balance: Any customer having a
water deposit on file with the city shall, upon acquiring a satisfactory water
credit rating, be entitled to have the deposit applied to payment on the
account. However, if a satisfactory water credit rating should subsequently be
lost because of delinquency of an account, another deposit, in accordance with
subsection A of this section shall become due and payable to the city
immediately. If said deposit is not paid within ten (10) days, the account
shall be considered delinquent and shall be processed in accordance with
section
7-4-8 of this chapter. (Ord. 475, 5-11-2004)
7-4-7: NOTIFICATION OF CHARGES:
It is the policy of the city to mail monthly billing statements to all utility
accounts as a courtesy. Irrespective of whether a billing statement has been
received, all city utility accounts are due the first day of each month. Any
water associated charges accrued during any month shall be deemed past due
after the twentieth day of the succeeding month. (Ord. 430, 8-22-1998)
7-4-8: DELINQUENT ACCOUNT; SHUTOFF AND LIABILITY FOR PAYMENT:
   A.    Delinquent Account: An account becomes delinquent when it has gone
into the subsequent billing cycle without full payment. Delinquent accounts
shall be assessed a late charge in an amount to be set by resolution of the
city council. Whenever an account becomes delinquent, the city clerk shall
notify any tenant and landowner of the property concerned, by U.S. mail, that,
unless a payment in the amount determined by the most recent bill is received
by the city within five (5) working days after the mailing of said notice,

11-2000)
7-6-4: MONTHLY FEES:
   A.   The minimum monthly user service fee for all users shall be based on
one residential equivalent connection per residence. This service fee will be
established by resolution and will be subject to periodic change by the city
council. The purpose of the monthly service fee is to pay for system
maintenance and operation, including depreciation of the public sewer system.
All other service connections shall be prorated as to the number of residential
user equivalents assigned to that user by this chapter or as determined by the
city council based on historical metered water usage or other special
circumstances. Sewer service fees as determined by water usage per equivalent
for nonsingle- family residences shall be established by resolution. The
monthly sewer billing will be included in conjunction with the periodic water
bill. Payment shall be due as for water service. The city is hereby authorized
to shut off city supplied water to a delinquent sewer customer, to physically
disconnect the sewer service connection to any property, or to seek such other
legal remedy as may be necessary to discontinue into the sewer system, if the
monthly sewer service fee for that property is delinquent, or if use by the
property is in violation of the Sewer Use Ordinance. The service connection may
be disconnected or otherwise blocked if the delinquent charge or ordinance
violation continues for more than ten (10) days after the City has notified the
property owner of the pending disconnection. The property owner is required to
pay the City all expenses related to disconnecting the service connection
before issuance of a reconnection permit. All back charges and fees shall be
paid in full before reconnection. An applicable fee as set forth by resolution
will be charged in the event the water is turned on after a shutoff for a
delinquent account or for nonpayment of sewer charges. It shall be unlawful to
occupy or use a structure to which sewer service has been disconnected.
   B.    Existing and future nonresidential establishments may be assessed
additional user fees based on water meter reading if water usage exceeds the
established monthly allowance of user equivalents or if other extraordinary
treatment requirements must be met.
   C.    Where a residence, apartment(s), retail store or other commercial
establishment is provided sewer service in conjunction with another
establishment in the same building, the minimum user equivalent rating for that
building shall be determined based on the number of establishments contained
therein. (For example, a retail store with a residence attached would be rated
at a minimum of 2 residential user equivalents. A commercial/office building
with 3 apartments would be rated at 4 user equivalents, minimum.) (Ord. 517, 5-
29-2008)
   D.    The following schedule lists a number of users and the number of user
equivalents assigned to each user. All other users shall require special
appraisal by the Council and will be computed on an individual basis.

and waste to which reference is made shall be determined in accordance with
standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater, and shall be
determined from samples taken at the control manhole or port. In the event no
special manhole is required, the control manhole shall be considered to be that
downstream manhole in the public sewer nearest to the point at which the
building sewer is connected or such other location as the city may determine.
   H.   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as preventing
any special agreement or arrangement between the city and the owner of any
industrial building whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or
character may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment
therefor by the owner of the industrial building of fair user equivalent charge
consistent with the schedule set forth in this chapter and consistent with
federal and state law. It shall be the responsibility of each discharging user
to pay its fair share of the costs of discharge and treatment of its
wastewater. (Ord. 448, 7-11-2000)
7-6-7: FOOD WASTE DISPOSAL UNITS:
It is the declared policy of the city to prevent discharge of food wastes into
the sanitary sewer system when such food wastes could be disposed in a manner
other than discharge in the said sewer system.
   A.   Scope and Purpose: To aid in the prevention of sanitary sewer blockages
and obstructions from contributions and accumulation of fats, oils, and greases
into the sanitary sewer system from industrial or commercial establishments,
particularly food preparation and servinR facilities.
   B.   Definitions:
      1.   Fats, Oils, and Greases: Organic polar compounds derived from animal
and/ or plant sources that contain multiple carbon chain triglyceride
molecules. These substances are detectable and measurable using analytical test
procedures established in the United States Code of Federal Regulations 40 CFR
136, as may be amended from time to time. All are sometimes referred to herein
as “grease” or “greases”.
      2.   Grease Trap: A device for separating and retaining waterborne
greases and grease complexes prior to the wastewater exiting the trap and
entering the sanitary sewer collection and treatment system. Such traps are
typically compact under-the-sink units that are near food preparation areas.
      3.   Grease Interceptor: A structure or device designed for the purpose
of removing and preventing fats, oils, and grease from entering the sanitary
sewer collection system. These devices are often below-ground units in outside
areas and are built as two or three chamber baffled tanks.
      4.   Food Service Establishments. Those establishments primarily engaged
in activities of preparing, serving, or otherwise making available for
consumption by the public such as restaurant, commercial kitchen, caterer,
hotel, school, hospital, prison, correctional facility, and care institution.
These establishments use one or more of the following preparation activities:
cooking by frying (all methods), baking (all methods), grilling, sauteing,
rotisserie cooking, broiling (all methods), boiling, blanching, roasting,
toasting, or poaching. Also included are infrared heating, searing, barbecuing,
and any other food preparation activity that produces a hot, non-drinkable food
product in or on a receptacle that requires washing.
      5.   Minimum Design Capability: The design features of a grease
interceptor and its ability or volume required to effectively intercept and
retain greases from grease-laden wastewaters discharged to the public sanitary
sewer.
      6.   User: Any person, including those located outside the jurisdictional
limits of the City of Spirit Lake, who contributes, causes, or permits the
contribution or discharge of wastewater into sewers within the city’s
boundaries, including persons who contribute such wastewater from mobile
sources, such as those who discharge hauled wastewater.
   C.   Food Service Establishment Requirement: All permitted food service
establishments discharging wastewater to the City of Spirit Lake sanitary sewer
collection system are subject to the following requirements:
      1.   Grease Interceptor Requirements: All permitted food service
establishments are required to install, operate, and maintain an approved type
and adequately sized grease interceptor necessary to maintain compliance with
the objectives of this Ordinance. All grease interceptors must meet the
requirements of the City of Spirit Lake and the Idaho State Plumbing Code.
      2.   Implementation: All new food service establishment facilities are
subject to grease interceptor requirements. All such facilities must obtain
prior approval from the Public Works Director/ City Engineer for grease
interceptor sizing prior to submitting plans for a building permit. All grease
interceptors shall be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection. Existing facilities with planned modification in plumbing
improvements, with a building permit evaluation of ($20,000) or more will be
required to include plans to 1 comply with the grease interceptor requirements.
These facilities must obtain approval from the Public Works Director/ City
Engineer for grease interceptor sizing prior to submitting plans for a building
permit. All existing food service establishments, determined by the Public
Works Director/ City Engineer, to have a reasonable potential to adversely
impact the City’s sewer system will be notified of their obligation to install
a grease interceptor within the specified period set forth in the notification
letter.
      3.   Variance from Grease Interceptor Requirements: Grease interceptors
required under this Ordinance shall be installed unless the Public Works
Director/ City Engineer authorizes the installation of an indoor grease trap or
other alternative pretreatment technology and determines that the installation
of a grease interceptor would not be feasible. The food service establishment
bears the burden of demonstrating that the installation of a grease interceptor
is not feasible. The Public Works Director/ City Engineer may authorize the
installation of an indoor grease trap where the installation of a grease
interceptor is not feasible due to space constraints or other considerations.
If an establishment believes the installation of a grease interceptor is
infeasible, because of documented space constraints, the request for an
alternate grease removal device shall contain the following information:
         a.   Location of sewer main and easement in relation to available
exterior space outside building.
         b.   Existing plumbing at or in a site that uses common plumbing for
all services at that site.
Alternative pretreatment technology includes, but is not limited to, devices
that are used to trap, separate, and hold grease from wastewater and prevent it
from being discharged into the sanitary sewer collection system. All
alternative pretreatment technology must be appropriately sized and approved by
the Public Works Director/ City Engineer.
   D.   Wastewater Discharge Limitations:
      1.   No User shall allow wastewater discharge concentration from subject
grease interceptor, grease trap or alternative pretreatment technology to
exceed 325 milligrams per liter(2), as defined by method EPA test method 1664
or 275 milligrams per liter, as identified by method EPA test method 413.
   E.   Grease Interceptor Requirements:
      1.   Grease interceptor sizing and installation shall conform to the
current edition of the (Uniform Plumbing Code or other applicable plumbing code
used by the local agency).
      2.   Grease interceptors shall be constructed in accordance with design
approved by the Public Works Director/ City Engineer and shall have a minimum
of two compartments with fittings designed for grease retention.
      3.   Grease interceptors shall be installed at a location where it shall
be easily accessible for inspection, cleaning, and removal of intercepted
grease. The grease interceptor may not be installed in any part of the building
where food is handled. Location of the grease interceptor must meet the
approval of the Public Works Director/ City Engineer.
      4.   All such grease interceptors shall be serviced and emptied of
accumulated waste content as required in order to maintain Minimum Design
Capability or effective volume. These devices should be inspected at least
monthly. Users who are required to maintain a grease interceptor shall:
         a.   Provide for a minimum hydraulic retention time in accordance with
the Uniform Plumbing Code (or other applicable plumbing code used by the local
agency).
         b.   Remove any accumulated grease cap and sludge pocket as required.
Grease interceptors shall be kept free of inorganic solid materials such as
grit, rocks, gravel, sand, eating utensils, cigarettes, shells, towels, rags,
etc., which could settle into this pocket and thereby reduce the effective
volume of the device.
      5.   The User shall maintain a written record of inspection and
maintenance for five (5) years. All such records will be made available for on-
site inspection by representative of the City of Spirit Lake during all
operating hours.
      6.   Sanitary wastes are not allowed to be connected to sewer lines
intended for grease interceptor service.
      7.   Except as provided herein, for a period of one year following
adoption of this Ordinance, although installation of grease interceptors will
be required to be installed, no enforcement actions will be taken under this
Ordinance for failure to achieve limits on grease discharges from grease
interceptors. If, during this one year period an obstruction of a sewer main(s)
occurs that causes a sewer overflow to the extent that an impact on the
environment is realized and that said overflow or failure of the sanitary sewer
collection system to convey sewage can be attributed in part or in whole to an
accumulation of grease in the sewer main(s), the City of Spirit Lake will take
appropriate enforcement actions, as stipulated in the Industrial Pretreatment
Enforcement Plan and Sewer Use Ordinance, against the generator or contributor
of such greases’ Access manholes, with a minimum diameter of 24 inches, shall
be provided over each grease interceptor chamber and sanitary tee. The access
manholes shall extend at least to finished grade and be designed and maintained
to prevent water inflow or infiltration. The manholes shall also have readily
removable covers to facilitate inspection, grease removal, and wastewater
sampling activities.

      1.   Upon approval by the Public Works Director/ City Engineer, a grease
trap complying with the provisions of this section must be installed in the
waste line leading from sinks, drains, and other fixtures or equipment in food
service establishments where grease may be introduced into the drainage or
sewage system in quantities that can affect line stoppage or hinder sewage
treatment or private sewage disposal.
      2.   Grease traps sizing and installation shall conform to the (Uniform
Plumbing Code or other applicable plumbing code used by the local agency).
      3.   No grease trap shall be installed which has a stated rate flow of
more than fifty-five (55) gallons per minute, nor less than twenty (20) gallons
per minute, except when specially approved by the Public Works Director/ City

be discharged into a grease trap.
      7.   Except as provided herein, for a period of one year following
adoption of this Ordinance, although installation of grease traps will be
required to be installed, no enforcement actions will be taken under this
Ordinance for failure to achieve limits on grease discharges from the facility.
If, during this one year period an obstruction of a sewer main(s) occurs that
causes a sewer overflow to the extent that an impact on the environment is
realized and that said overflow or failure of the sanitary sewer collection
system to convey sewage can be attributed in part or in whole to an
accumulation of grease in the sewer main(s), the City of Spirit Lake will take
appropriate enforcement actions, as stipulated in the Industrial Pretreatment
Enforcement Plan and Sewer Use Ordinance, against the generator or contributor
of such grease. (Ord. 448, 7-11-2000; amd. Ord. 627, 12-14-2021)

FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
SECTION:
8-2-1: Statutory Authorization, Findings Of Fact, Purpose, And Objectives
8-2-2: Definitions
8-2-3: General Provisions
8-2-4: Administration
8-2-5: Provisions For Flood Hazard Reduction
8-2-6: Variance And Appeal Procedures
8-2-7: Penalties For Violation
8-2-1: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND OBJECTIVES:
   A.   Statutory Authority: The legislature of the state of Idaho in Idaho
Code 46-1020 through 46-1024, authorized local government units to adopt a
floodplain map and floodplain management ordinance that identifies floodplains
and that sets forth minimum development requirements in floodplains that are
designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizenry.
   B.    Findings Of Fact: The flood hazard areas of Spirit Lake are subject to
periodic inundation that results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare.
      1.    These flood losses are caused by structures in flood hazard areas,
which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from
flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains
causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
      2.   Local government units have the primary responsibility for planning,
adoption and enforcement of land use regulations to accomplish proper
floodplain management.
   C.    Statement Of Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      1.   Require that development that is vulnerable to floods, including
structures and facilities necessary for the general health, safety and welfare
of citizens, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      2.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights,
velocities, or erosion;
      3.    Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage or erosion;
      4.    Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or that may increase flood hazards to other
lands;
      5.   Preserve and restore natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which carry and store floodwaters.
   D.    Objectives: The objectives of this chapter are to:
      1.    Protect human life, health and property;
      2.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
purification and sewage treatment plants, water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
      3.    Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas;
      4.    Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      5.   Minimize the need for rescue and emergency services associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      6.    Minimize prolonged business interruptions. (Ord. 537, 4-13-2010,
eff. 5-3-2010)

the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the
many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the
height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as
wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams and the hydrologic
effects of urbanization in a watershed.
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT FACILITY: A facility that cannot be used for its
intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to
water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and
unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, or ship repair facilities. The
term does not include long term storage, manufacture, sales, or service

revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps,
or flood insurance studies.
   Letter Of Map Amendment (LOMA):A revision based on technical data showing
that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood hazard
area. An LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
   Letter Of Map Revision (LOMR):A revision based on technical data showing,
usually due to manmade changes, changes to flood zones, flood elevations,
floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One common type
of LOMR, an LOMR-F, is a determination that a structure or parcel has been
elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is excluded from the
special flood hazard area.

used for living purposes, which includes working, storage, cooking and eating,
or recreation, or any combination thereof. This includes any floor that could
be converted to such a use including a basement or crawl space. An unfinished
or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building
access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a
structure's lowest floor. The lowest floor is a determinant for the flood
insurance premium for a building, home or business.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, built on
a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured
home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".

National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base
flood elevations shown on a community's FIRM are referenced.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: A structure for which the "start of construction" commenced
after May 3, 2010, and includes subsequent improvements to the structure.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A place where the construction of
facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be
affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction
of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is
completed on or after May 3, 2010.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle that is:
   A.    Built on a single chassis,
   B.    Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection,
   C.    Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towed by a light duty
truck, and
   D.    Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
REPETITIVE LOSS: Flood related damages sustained by a structure on two (2)
separate occasions during a ten (10) year period for which the cost where the
construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the cost of repairs
at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds twenty
five percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before the damages
occurred.
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA: The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
Zone designations on FIRMs include the letters A, AE, V.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement and means the date the
development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not the alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of its market value before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction"
of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred
"repetitive loss" or "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The market value of the structure should be: a) the appraised value
of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or b)
in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage
occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial
damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. The term
does not include either:
   A.   A project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations
of State or local Health, Sanitary, or Safety Code specifications, which have
been identified by the local Code enforcement official and which are the
minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or
   B.   Alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure.
VARIANCE: A grant of relief by the Governing Body from a requirement of this
chapter.
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter is a violation. A new or substantially improved
structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other
certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR section 60.3
(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in
violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the North American Vertical
Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other specified datum) of floods of various magnitudes
and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. (Ord. 537, 4-

review to determine its effect on flood flows. An encroachment analysis must
include:
         a.    Determination and documentation that the filling, grading or
construction of a structure will not obstruct flood flows and will not cause an
increase in flood heights upstream or adjacent to the project site;
         b.    Determination and documentation that grading, excavation,
channel improvements, bridge and culvert replacements that remove an
obstruction, do not cause increases in downstream flood flows;
         c.    Certification and documentation by a licensed professional

apply to FEMA for a letter of map revision for changes to the flood hazard map
proposed in the CLOMR.
      5.    Drainage Paths: In AH zones, drainage paths shall be provided to
guide floodwater around and away from proposed and existing structures.
   H.   Standards For Zones Without Base Flood Elevations And/Or Floodway (A
Zones): These standards apply in special flood hazard areas where streams exist
but no base flood elevation data have been provided (A zones), or where base
flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated.
      1.    When base flood elevation or floodway data have not been identified
by FEMA in a flood insurance study and/or flood insurance rate maps, then the
floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize
scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a
federal, state, or other source, in order to administer this chapter. If data
are not available from any source, only then subsections H2 and H3 of this
section shall apply.
         a.    Where the floodplain administrator has obtained base flood
elevation data, applicants of proposed projects that increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot (1') shall obtain a conditional letter of map
revision preconstruction and a letter of map revision postconstruction.
      2.    No encroachments, including structures or fill, shall be located
within an area equal to the width of the stream or fifty feet (50'), whichever
is greater, measured from the ordinary high water mark, unless certification by
a licensed professional engineer documents that the encroachment will not
result in any increase in flood levels during the base flood.
      3.    In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data,
new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have
the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement or crawl
space) elevated no less than two feet (2') above the highest adjacent grade at
the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of
floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the construction standards in
subsection B4 of this section.
   I.    Standards For Areas Of Shallow Flooding (AO Zones): Shallow flooding
areas designated AO zones, are areas of special flood hazard that have base
flood depths of one to three feet (3'), with no clearly defined channel. The
following provisions apply:
      1.    All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated above the adjacent grade at least as high as the flood depth number
specified in feet on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM). If no flood depth
number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at
least two feet (2') above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to
facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters shall be provided in
accordance with the construction standards in subsection B4 of this section.
      2.    New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential
structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure and attendant
utility and sanitary facilities must be designed to be watertight to the
specified base flood level or at least two feet (2') above highest adjacent
grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and
structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional
engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction
are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting these
provisions, and shall provide certification to the Floodplain Administrator.
      3.    Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and
away from all proposed and existing structures.
   J.    Alteration Of A Watercourse: A watercourse is considered altered when
any change occurs within its banks.
      1.    The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development and submit certification by a registered professional
engineer that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not
be diminished.
      2.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Idaho
Department of Water Resources Stream Channel Alteration Program must be
notified prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of
notification must be submitted to the Floodplain Administrator and to the
Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      3.    The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse so that the
flood carrying capacity will not be diminished.
      4.    The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in subsections K1 and K2 of this section when an alteration of a watercourse
results in the relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area,
including the placement of culverts.
   K.    Requirement To Submit New Technical Data:
      1.    For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or
base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six (6) months of the date
such information becomes available. These development proposals include:
         a.    Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
         b.    Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
         c.    Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts;
         d.    Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring
establishment of base flood elevations according to subsection A3 of this
section.
      2.    It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data
prepared in a format required for a conditional letter of map revision or
letter of map revision and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for
these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the applicant. (Ord. 537, 4-
13-2010, eff. 5-3-2010)
   L.    Anchoring:
      1.    All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored
to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.
      2.    All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved shall
be anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or
frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable
State and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. (Ord. 582, 4-
10-2018)
8-2-6: VARIANCE AND APPEAL PROCEDURES:
   A.    Variance:
      1.    An application for a variance must be submitted to the City Clerk
on the form provided by the City and include at a minimum the same information
required for a development permit and an explanation for the basis for the
variance request.
      2.    Upon receipt of a completed application for a variance, the
variance request will be set for public hearing at the next City Council
meeting in which time is available for the matter to be heard.
      3.    Prior to the public hearing, notice of the hearing will be
published in the official newspaper of the City at least fifteen (15) days
prior to the hearing. In addition to the newspaper publication, written notice
shall be provided to all adjoining property owners.
      4.    The burden to show that the variance is warranted and meets the
criteria set out herein is on the applicant.
   B.    Criteria For Variances:
      1.   Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the
elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a small or irregularly shaped lot contiguous to
and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level. As the lot size increases the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
      2.    Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      3.    Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      4.    Variances may be issued upon:
         a.    A showing by the applicant of good and sufficient cause;
         b.    A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances.
      5.   Variances pertain to a physical piece of property; they are not
personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants,
economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in
densely populated residential neighborhoods.
      6.    Variances should be issued for nonresidential buildings in very
limited circumstances.
   C.    Variance Decision: The decision to either grant or deny a variance
shall be in writing and shall set forth the reasons for such approval and
denial. If the variance is granted, the property owner shall be put on notice
along with the written decision that the permitted building will have its
lowest floor below the flood protection elevation and that the cost of flood
insurance likely will be commensurate with the increased flood damage risk.
   D.    Appeals: The City Council shall hear and decide appeals from the
interpretations of the Administrator.
      1.   An appeal must be filed with the City Clerk within fourteen (14)
days of the date of any permit denial or interpretation of the Administrator.
Failure to timely file an appeal shall be considered a failure to exhaust the
administrative remedies. The appeal must set out the interpretation of the
Administrator and a narrative setting forth the facts relied upon by the
appellant and the appellant's claim regarding the error in the interpretation.
      2.    Upon receipt of a completed appeal, the appeal will be scheduled
for the next available City Council meeting to be heard. The City Council shall
consider the following in ruling on an appeal:
         a.    All technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this chapter, including:
            (1)    The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to
the injury of others;
            (2)    The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
            (3)    The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effects of such damage on the individual landowner;
            (4)    The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
            (5)    The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location,
where applicable;
            (6)    The availability of alternative locations for the proposed
use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
            (7)    The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
            (8)    The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive
Plan and Floodplain Management Program for that area;
            (9)    The safety of access to the property in times of flooding
for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
            (10)    The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
            (11)    The cost of providing government services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   E.    Decision: The City Council decision on appeal shall be in writing and
set out the facts, technical information and the legal basis for the decision.
(Ord. 537, 4-13-2010, eff. 5-3-2010)
8-2-7: PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION:
No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or altered
unless in full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable
regulations.
Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions shall constitute a
misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any
of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisoned for not more than one hundred eighty
(180) days, or both. Each day the violation continues shall be considered a
separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City from taking
such other lawful actions as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
(Ord. 537, 4-13-2010, eff. 5-3-2010)

other means acceptable to or required by the permit authority to guarantee that
work is completed in compliance with all local government requirements.
CLEARING: The destruction and removal of vegetation by manual, mechanical or
chemical methods.
CONVEYANCE: A mechanism for transporting water from one point to another,
including pipes, ditches and channels.
CONVEYANCE SYSTEM: The drainage facilities, both natural and man-made, which
collect, contain, and provide for the flow of surface and storm water from the
highest points on the land down to a receiving water. The natural elements of
the conveyance system include swales and small drainage courses, streams,
rivers, lakes and wetlands. The human-made elements of the conveyance system
include gutters, ditches, pipes, channels and most retention/detention
facilities.
DESIGN STORM: A rainfall event of specific return frequency and duration that
is used to calculate the runoff volume and peak discharge rate.
DETENTION: The temporary storage of storm runoff in a BMP, which is used to
control the peak discharge rates, and which provides gravity settling of
pollutants.
EROSION: The wearing away of the land surface by running water, wind, ice or
other geological agents, including such processes as gravitational creep. Also,
detachment and movement of soil or rock fragments by water, wind, ice or
gravity.
EROSION/ SEDIMENTATION CONTROL: Any temporary or permanent measures taken to
reduce erosion; control siltation and sedimentation; and insure that sediment-
laden water does not leave the site.
GROUND WATER: Water in a saturated zone or stratum beneath the land surface or
a surface water body.
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE: A hard surface area which either prevents or retards the
entry of water into the soil mantel as under natural conditions prior to
development, and/or a hard surface area which causes water to run off the
surface in greater quantities or at an increased rate of flow from the flow
present under natural conditions prior to development. Common impervious
surfaces include, but are not limited to, roof tops, walkways, patios,
driveways, parking lots or storage areas, concrete or asphalt paving, gravel
roads, packed earthen materials, and oiled, macadam or other surfaces which
similarly impede the natural filtration of storm water. Open, uncovered
retention/detention facilities shall not be considered as impervious surfaces.
INFILTRATION: The downward movement of water from the surface to the subsoil.
The infiltration capacity is expressed in terms of inches/hour.
INTERMITTENT STREAM: A stream or portion of a stream that flows only in direct
response to precipitation. It receives little or no water from springs and no
long continued supply from melting snow or other sources. It is dry for a large
part of the year, ordinarily more than three (3) months.
LAND DISTURBING ACTIVITY: Any activity that results in a change in the existing
soil cover (both vegetative and nonvegetative) and/or the existing soil
topography. Land disturbing activities include, but are not limited to
demolition, construction, clearing, grading, filling and excavation.
NUTRIENTS: Essential chemicals needed by plants or animals for growth.
Excessive amounts of nutrients can lead to degradation of water quality and
algal blooms. Some nutrients can be toxic at high concentrations.
QUALIFIED, LICENSED PROFESSIONALS: Licensed engineer, landscape architect, soil
scientist or other individual who has demonstrated a professional ability to
design storm water systems and certify their effectiveness with a registered
stamp.
RECONSTRUCTION: Road reconstruction shall be considered any modification of the
cross-section or subgrade. Paving or repaving shall not be considered
reconstruction.
RETENTION: The holding of runoff in a basin without release except means of
evaporation, infiltration or emergency bypass.
RUNOFF: Water originating from rainfall and other precipitation that is found
in drainage facilities, rivers, streams, springs, seeps, ponds, lakes, and
wetlands, as well as shallow ground water.
SEDIMENT: Fragmented material that originates from weathering and erosion of
rocks or unconsolidated deposits, and is transported by, suspended in, or
deposited by water.
SEDIMENTATION: The deposition of sediment on ground surfaces and in
watercourses.
STORM FREQUENCY: The time interval between major storms of predetermined
intensity and volumes of runoff for which storm sewers and other structures are
designed and constructed to handle hydraulically without surcharging and
backflooding, e.g., a 2-year, 25-year or 100-year storm.
STORM WATER: That portion of precipitation that does not naturally percolate
into the ground or evaporate, but flows via overland flow, interflow, channels
or pipes into a defined surface water channel, or a constructed infiltration
facility.
SWALE: A shallow drainage conveyance or infiltration area with relatively
gentle side slopes, generally with flow depths less than one-half foot (1/2').
TREATMENT BMP: A BMP that is intended to remove pollutants from storm water. A
few examples of treatment BMPs are detention ponds, oil/water separators,
biofiltration swales and constructed wetlands.
UNIQUE SITE CHARACTERISTICS: Soil, slope or depth to bedrock conditions that
will not accommodate on-site treatment through infiltration to the standards
specified in the ordinance. (Ord. 380, 5-2-94)
8-3-2: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this Chapter shall be to require implementation of surface water
management techniques which rely upon natural on-site treatment and recycling
of storm water as opposed to collection and conveyance of untreated storm water
into ground water sources or into surface bodies of water. The underlying
purposes to be achieved by implementation of such regulations are the
protection of ground water quality through pretreatment of storm water prior to
infiltration and protection of surface water resources from the effects of
contaminants, sedimentation and erosion. (Ord. 380, 5-2-94)
8-3-3: APPLICABILITY:
The achievement of standards, employment of methods, and techniques required by
this Chapter shall be applicable in the following circumstances:
   A.    New Development: Development of every new subdivision of land within
the jurisdiction of Spirit Lake.
   B.    Commercial; Industrial Sites: All commercial and industrial site
development for which grading, site development, construction, or building
permits may be required pursuant to the land use regulations of Spirit Lake.
   C.    Public Projects: All public projects within the jurisdiction of Spirit
Lake including, but not limited to, street construction or reconstruction
(modification of the cross-section, not to include resurfacing), park
development, building development, or other public works construction or
development. Except as necessary to maintain the continuity of existing storm
water handling systems, all new construction as outlined in this subsection
shall employ the methods for storm water management required by this Chapter
and shall otherwise be designed to minimize adverse impacts upon surface and
ground water quality.
   D.    Slope: Every building or land development permit where land-disturbing
activity is to occur on any part of sites with a slope greater than fifteen
percent (15%) or on sites less than five hundred feet (500') distant
horizontally from, and located vertically above, any surface water in the form
of a perennial or intermittent stream, river, pond, lake, wetland, or similar
surface feature which can be determined from USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle
topographic maps. Storm water management plans may not be necessary for
individual building sites if runoff from the site has been accommodated by an
approved storm water management plan for the subdivision in which the site is
located. However, detailed erosion control plans may still be required. The
Administrator of this Chapter may allow a building permit to be issued for
minor additions to existing improvements without the preparation of a storm
water management plan if, in using their professional judgment, the
requirements of this Chapter can be met by existing site conditions. (Ord. 380,
5-2-94)
8-3-4: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
Unless otherwise lawfully excused from compliance with the standards set forth
in this Chapter, all development to which this Chapter is applicable shall
comply with the following requirements and methods for storm water management
control:
   A.    Storm Water: Storm water, in accordance with the performance standards
set forth herein, shall be directed by nonerosive means to grass infiltration
areas when appropriate. Expected contaminant removals are as follows:
Total suspended solids 95%
Total dissolved solids 50%
Nutrients:
Nitrate                20%-50%
Total nitrogen         80%
Phosphorus             90%
Metals                 80%+
Organic chemicals      60%+
Bacteria               99%
 
If the proposed development exceeds site limitations as defined in Appendix D
of the "Storm Water Management Plan Criteria and Engineering Standards", for
grass infiltration methods, then an acceptable alternative storm water
collection, treatment, and disposal system shall be implemented in accordance
with an approved storm water management plan, subject to review by the City.
Said grass infiltration areas or other approved alternative on-site storm water
collection and treatment systems may be approved in either nodal or dispersed
form, subject to specific approval by the City during the development review
process.
   B.    Storm Water Runoff: All development subject to this Chapter shall be
carried out such that the runoff of storm or other surface waters shall not be
accelerated, concentrated, or otherwise conveyed beyond the exterior property
lines or project boundaries of the project in question except in compliance
with the provisions of BMPs adopted pursuant to this Chapter or as allowed
through joint management of storm water with adjoining property owners pursuant
to agreement approved by the City. The quality of surface runoff shall be
protected by strict compliance with the design standards and BMPs adopted
pursuant to this Chapter or by implementation of measures shown by a qualified,
licensed professional, as defined in Section
8-3-1, to have an effective design capability which exceeds the BMPs adopted
hereby.
   C.    Storm Water Management Plan: Each landowner developing real property
subject to the terms of this Chapter shall develop a comprehensive storm water
management plan which addresses and complies with the requirements and
standards established by this Chapter and the plan criteria, design standards
and BMPs adopted by resolution pursuant to this Chapter. Each plan for storm
water management shall be approved by a qualified, licensed professional, who
shall submit both construction- quality design drawings and supporting
calculations for review by the City prior to start of construction. Each storm
water management plan shall also identify necessary maintenance requirements.
   D.    Funding: Each developer who proposes and implements a storm water
management system for collection or treatment of storm water in accordance with
this Chapter shall also establish, including assurance of adequate funding, the
necessary maintenance system including an acceptable plan for sustained
functioning of the collection and treatment system, and, when requested, grant
the necessary easements, to the local government which may choose to provide
continued maintenance of the system by public authorities or may require the
owner to accomplish same. The City is hereby authorized to establish a
department of City government to perform maintenance service for storm water
management system components or to contract for such maintenance in order that
drainage system components can be maintained. Such services shall be financed
by charging fees to owners and/or occupants of real property benefitted by such
service.
For purposes of application of the design standards and other related documents
and standards, Spirit Lake shall be designated as the permit authority. (Ord.
380, 5-2-94)
8-3-5: PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
The following performance standards shall be applicable to all design,
construction, implementation, and maintenance of storm water management systems
pursuant to the jurisdiction exercised through this Chapter.
   A.    Runoff Rate: There shall be no increase in the peak rate of runoff
from this site when compared with the dissipation of storm water in the
undeveloped state for a 25-year storm. Within project boundaries, sufficient
retention capacity shall be constructed to detain surface flow to meet the
performance standard established by this Section. For purposes of this Chapter,
"undeveloped state" shall mean the natural soils and vegetation in place prior
to the start of any construction or clearing activity on a site.
   B.   Storm Water Collection: No storm water shall be collected or
concentrated except within a channel protected against erosion and containing
energy dissipation measures to prevent further erosion on adjoining lands.
Existing unprotected channels shall be protected against further erosion in the
course of site development. Any site development or construction shall preserve
installed components of a storm water management plan. All disturbed soils
shall be protected during the course of construction to prevent exposure to
storm water and to contain eroded materials should contact be made.
   C.   Grass Infiltration Areas: Any and all collected storm water shall be
directed to grass infiltration areas which shall be established with grass and
other approved plant materials or to an acceptable alternative storm water
management design. Grass infiltration areas or their acceptable alternatives
shall be sized to hold and treat the first one-half inch (1/2") of storm water
runoff from all impervious surfaces. The overall storm water disposal system
shall have a capacity to handle a 25-year storm based upon the appropriate
Idaho Transportation Department IDF curve, without damage to the storm water
management system or adjacent land and improvements. (Ord. 380, 5-2-94)
8-3-6: GUARANTEE OF INSTALLATION:
No final plat shall be recorded until the storm water management facilities are
in place and functioning as designed or until a guarantee of financial surety
is provided to and accepted by the City. No certificate of occupancy will be
issued until the storm water management system has been installed and is
functioning as designed. If, in the judgment of the storm water ordinance
administrator, as appointed by the City Council, project occupancy can be
achieved without harm to the environment or potential occupants, occupancy may
proceed upon receipt of an acceptable guarantee of financial surety to complete
installation when weather conditions or other variables allow. In no case shall
such guarantee be allowed if the incomplete improvements would result in
increased erosion, sedimentation, or other damage to the development, public
improvements, subsurface or surface waters, or the proposed storm water
management system. At any time, the City is authorized to stop work on the
installation of subdivision improvements, to embargo further issuance of
building permits on a development, to stop work on any individual building or
development of any individual building site, or to otherwise take steps
necessary to protect the waters of the City from damage as a result of
development. (Ord. 380, 5-2-94)
8-3-7: ADOPTION OF SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION:
The City may adopt, by resolution, design standards, definitions of
terminology, administrative procedures, etc., intended to implement the general
requirements and performance standards set forth in this Chapter. Changes in
the design standards may be accomplished by subsequently adopted resolutions.
Such design standards may be complied with in alternative ways that will
contribute to rational achievement of the general requirements and performance
standards set forth in this Chapter; provided, that any such changes must be
proposed by a qualified, licensed professional, subject to review and approval
by the City. (Ord. 380, 5-2-94)
8-3-8: PROHIBITED CONDUCT:
No person shall damage, harm, fail to install or complete or otherwise impair
the grass infiltration areas, approved methods of transmission of storm water
to grass infiltration areas or any portion of a storm water management system
installed pursuant to this Chapter. Unless other provisions are made in the
process of development review and approval, responsibility for maintenance of
storm water system elements remains with the property owner and violation of
these maintenance requirements shall constitute a violation of this Chapter.
(Ord. 380, 5-2-94)
8-3-9: VARIANCE:
A variance from the requirements of this Chapter or from the design standards
adopted pursuant to this Chapter granting a variance due to unique site
characteristics may only be granted in such circumstances if the approval of
the variance would not otherwise impair achievements of the standards of
purpose of this Chapter, would not impose additional burden upon adjoining or
downstream lands or landowners, or otherwise disrupt the scheme of storm water
management in the community. It shall be incumbent upon anyone requesting a
variance to provide data showing that alternative methods of storm water
handling proposed will produce comparable efficacy of the storm water
management measures required by this Chapter. No variance shall be issued
unless all elements of this Section are met. Any request for variance from the
terms of this Chapter shall be first submitted to the Storm Water Ordinance
administrator, who shall conduct a hearing in accord with provisions of Idaho
Code, section 67-6516 and forward a recommendation to the City Council, who
shall make the final decision concerning the variance. (Ord. 380, 5-2-94)
8-3-10: PENALTIES:
Provision of this Chapter may be enforced in the following manner:
   A.    Violation of the terms of this Chapter may be considered a criminal
misdemeanor and shall be punishable as provided in Section
1-4-1 of this Code. Each day of violation shall constitute a separate offense.
   B.    May be enforced by civil action, compel performance and completion of,
or maintenance of, facilities installed pursuant to this Chapter.
   C.    May have building permits or certificates of occupancy denied or
revoked as the case may be. Occupancy of a dwelling or building without an
approved certificate of occupancy shall constitute a violation of this Chapter
in addition to any building or zoning ordinance from which the occupancy
requirement derives. (Ord. 380, 5-2-94; 1995 Code)

of this franchise; provided that nothing contained therein shall be deemed to
require the granting of additional CATV franchises if, in the opinion of the
city council, it is in the public interest to restrict such franchise to one or
more. (Ord. 468, 6-10-2003)
11-1-4: POLICE POWER:
Grantee shall at all times during the term of this franchise be subject to all

developer shall make or agree to make, at its sole cost, shall include
provision for a cable television service available to each separate lot within
the subdivision. The developer may engage the franchised cable television
operator within the city to perform the foregoing construction, or may engage
an independent contractor of its choice to do so. If an independent contractor

cable television operator within the city.
The city council shall have authority to promulgate such policy or policies as
it deems are required to effect the implementation of this section. (Ord. 468,

defend the city at its expense on account of any suit, judgment, execution,
claim or demand whatsoever against the city resulting from negligence on the
part of the grantee in the construction, operation or maintenance of its cable
television system in the city; and for this purpose grantee shall carry
property damage and personal injury insurance with some responsible insurance
company or companies qualified to do business in the state of Idaho. The
amounts of insurance to be carried for liability due to property damage shall
be one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) as to any one person and three
hundred thousand dollars ($300,000.00) as to any one occurrence. A current

filed with the city clerk. The grantee shall instruct its insurance agent in
writing that the city shall be listed as a "required notice party" with
reference to any notice or cancellation or any notice of the need to renew the
above described insurance coverage. In the event that the city should receive
such a notice, the city clerk shall provide the grantee with a written notice
of demand to correct the situation described by the insurance carrier within
the time limits provided for by the insurance carrier. Failure to provide said
certificate shall be grounds for revocation of this franchise.
The city shall notify grantee in writing ten (10) days after the presentation
of any claim or demand, either by suit or otherwise, made against the city on
account of any negligence as aforesaid on the part of the grantee. Where any
such claim or demand against the city is made by suit or other legal action,
written notice thereof shall be given by the city to grantee not less than five
(5) days prior to the date upon which an answer to such legal action is due or
within ten (10) days after the claim or demand is made upon the city, whichever
method yields grantee the larger amount of time within which to prepare an
answer. (Ord. 468, 6-10-2003)
11-1-7: COMPLAINT PROCEDURE:
Grantee shall maintain a toll free telephone number that may be answered by
mechanical device, with the understanding that an employee or agent of the

initial call. The grantee shall keep and maintain a complaint log reflecting
the name of the caller, the time of the initial call, the nature of the
complaint or service problem, the date and time of the personal telephone
response, and the date of the corrective action taken. This log shall upon
reasonable notice be open for inspection by the city. In the event that the
city clerk receives a written complaint about the service of the grantee, the
city clerk shall provide the grantee with written notice of the complaint. The
grantee shall provide all new customers with a written notice of the above
described procedure and the telephone number or numbers, and shall annually, as
part of the grantee's billing procedure, readvise the customers concerning the

customers. The grantee shall maintain and operate its system and render
efficient service in accordance with the rules and regulations as are, or may
be, set forth by the council as provided for in section

immediately necessary, it shall give reasonable notice thereof to its
customers. (Ord. 468, 6-10-2003)

be installed or erected by the grantee within the city until the plans and
specifications therefore have been prepared, submitted to and approved by the
city council. The grantee shall periodically supply to the city of Spirit Lake,
revisions to the map of the grantee's system, with the understanding that the
exact location of an underground line will by necessity have to be determined
by an actual "locate" request before excavation should be authorized.
   B.   All structures, lines and equipment erected by the grantee within the
city shall be so located as to cause minimum interference with the proper use
of streets, alleys, easements and other public ways and places and to cause
minimum interference with the rights or reasonable convenience of property
owners, and grantee shall comply with all reasonable, proper and lawful
policies, practices and ordinances of the city now or hereafter in force.
Existing poles, posts, conduits and other such structures of any electric power
system, telephone company, public utility, or other cable television system
located in the city shall be made available to grantee by mutual agreement for
leasing or licensing upon reasonable terms and rates and shall be used to the
extent practicable in order to minimize interference with travel and avoid
unnecessary duplication of facilities. Grantee shall make all arrangements and
bear the costs for agreements, leasing or licensing directed in this
subsection.

driveway or other surfacing, grantee shall, at its own cost and expense and in
a manner approved by the city, replace and restore all roadways, paving,
sidewalk, driveway or surface so disturbed in as good a condition as before
said work was commenced.
   D.    In the event that at any time during the period of this franchise the
city shall lawfully elect to alter or change any street, alley, easement,
sewer, drain, water line or other public way requiring the relocation of
grantee's facilities, then in such event, grantee, upon reasonable notice by
the city, shall remove, relay and relocate the same at its own expense.
   E.    Grantee shall, on the request of any person holding a building moving
permit, issued by the city, temporarily raise or lower its lines to permit the
moving of the building. The expense of such temporary removal shall be paid by
the person requesting the same, and grantee shall have the authority to require
such payment in advance.
   F.    Grantee shall have the authority to trim trees upon and overhanging
all streets, alleys, easements, sidewalks and public places of the city so as
to prevent the branches of such trees from coming into contact with grantee's
facilities. Any debris resulting from subject trimming shall be removed by and
at the expense of the grantee. All tree trimming allowed under this chapter
shall be under the supervision of a certified arborist.
   G.    All poles, lines, structures and other facilities of grantee in, on,
over and under the streets, sidewalks, alleys, easements and public grounds or
places of the city, shall be kept by grantee at all times in a safe condition.
   H.    Grantee shall provide a minimum service level of ten (10) channels, at
least nine (9) of which shall be included in the basic service. Additionally,
the system installed by grantee shall have the capacity for at least thirty six
(36) channels. (Ord. 468, 6-10-2003)

which must be incorporated into this franchise, the city and grantee agree that
such incorporation shall be accomplished within one year after the effective

revenues are properly earned or accrued: January 31, April 30, July 31, and
October 31.

The grantee shall provide, without charge, one service outlet to each fire
station, school and police station within the city, and to such other
municipally owned buildings, city hall, civic center, hospitals, emergency
medical services and libraries, as may be designated by the grantor; provided,
however, that if it is necessary to extend grantee's trunk or feeder lines more
than five hundred feet (500') solely to provide service to any such school or
public building, that school or institution shall have the option of paying the
grantee's direct costs for such extension in excess of five hundred feet
(500'). If this option is not exercised, the grantee shall be released from the
obligation to provide service to such buildings. Further, grantee shall be
permitted to recover from any public or private building owner entitled to free
service, the direct cost of installing more than one outlet, or concealed
inside wiring, or a service outlet requiring more than two hundred fifty feet
(250') of drop cable.
The grantee shall provide access to the city to all channels in the event of an
emergency. The city shall be the sole determiner of what constitutes an
emergency under this section.
In accordance with applicable FCC regulations, franchisee shall make available
its facilities for carriage of "educational access" and "local government
access" programming and will exercise due diligence and its best efforts to
accommodate reasonable demands from educational interests within the city as
well as the city of Spirit Lake to such requests concerning the aforementioned
access programming. (Ord. 468, 6-10-2003)

substantial part of the system, or upon the termination of any lease covering
all or a substantial part of the system, the grantee shall notify the grantor

change in control of the grantee has taken place, and the provisions of the
section of this franchise entitled "receivership" shall apply.
   C.    Receivership: The grantor shall have the right to revoke this
franchise one hundred twenty (120) days after appointment of a receiver, or

option by grantee, the city shall conduct a full, open, and public renewal
proceeding upon prior notice and opportunity of all interested parties to be
heard. The renewal proceeding shall be held for the purpose of considering
grantee's performance under this franchise in order to determine whether to

operation of this cable television system. If this franchise is renewed by the
city, all of the terms and provisions contained herein shall be controlling
during the renewal period, except to the extent that said terms and provisions
are modified by the city, or unless this franchise is superseded by a new
franchise. Should the city, for any reason, be unable to complete the renewal
proceeding prior to expiration of this franchise, such denial shall be

Grantee shall have the right to request review of any such denial by any court
of competent jurisdiction. Furthermore, in the event that the city denies
renewal, grantee shall be afforded a period of six (6) months following denial

the right to purchase and take over the property of the franchisee to that
effect, the franchisee shall immediately execute such deeds or instruments of
conveyance to the city as shall be required to convey to the city title to the

Avista Corporation, its successors and assigns, is hereby granted a franchise
for the purposes identified below, subject to the following terms and
conditions.
   A.    Term: The rights, privileges and franchise are hereby granted to, and
conferred upon the grantee, as the grantee has made a long term investment in
constructing, maintaining and operating the electric utility system in and upon
the streets, alleys, and public rights of way of the grantor, as necessary to
provide electric service to the citizens of the grantor. Use of other public
lands of grantor may be permitted without additional charge in the sole
discretion of the discretion of the city upon determination that such
facilities can be installed and operated without impairment of the public value
of the lands in question. This franchise shall, unless it is sooner terminated,
as herein provided, extend for a term of twenty five (25) years.
   B.    Nonexclusive Franchise: This franchise is not, and shall not be deemed
to be, an exclusive franchise. This franchise shall not in any manner prohibit
the grantor from granting other and further franchises over, upon, and along
the franchised area that do not interfere with grantee's rights under this
franchise. This franchise shall not prohibit or prevent the grantor from using
the franchised area or affect the jurisdiction of the grantor over the same or
any part thereof.
   C.    Franchise As Contract: This franchise shall have the effect of and
shall be a contract between grantor and grantee and shall be the measure of the
rights and liabilities of the grantor as well as of grantee. Both grantor and
grantee shall have input and discussion prior to the final passage of this
franchise.
   D.    Effect Of Invalidity: The franchise is granted pursuant to the laws of
the state of grantor relating to the granting of such rights and privileges by
grantor. If any article, section, sentence, clause, or phrase of this franchise
is for any reason held illegal, invalid, or unconstitutional, such invalidity
shall not affect the validity of the franchise or any of the remaining
portions. The invalidity of any portion of this franchise shall not abate,
reduce, or otherwise affect any obligation required of grantee. (Ord. 505, 9-
12-2006)
11-2-2: PURPOSE OF FRANCHISE:
Grantor hereby grants to grantee, its successors and assigns, the right, power,
privilege and authority to enter upon all roads, rights of way, streets,
alleys, and highways lying within the boundaries of grantor and owned or
maintained by grantor now or in the future ("franchised area"), to locate,
construct, operate and maintain poles, wires, underground cables and all
necessary or desirable appurtenances ("facilities") for the purpose of
transmitting and distributing electricity. This franchise shall allow for the
placement of such facilities as may be necessary to provide service within the
city.
   A.    Trimming/Removal Of Trees: The right of grantee to maintain its lines,
facilities and appurtenances shall include the right, as exercised in grantee's
sole discretion, to utilize an integrated vegetation management program.
Grantee or grantee's contractor may prune all trees and vegetation which
overhang a public right of way, property or place, whether such trees or
vegetation originate within or outside said right of way, property or place, in
such a manner and to such an extent as will prevent the branches or limbs or
other parts of such trees or vegetation from growing to interfere with
grantee's facilities. Such pruning shall comply with the American national
standard for tree care operation (ANSI A300) and be conducted under the
direction of an arborist certified with the International Society of
Arboriculture or equivalent professional organization. Nothing contained in
this section shall prevent grantee, when necessary and with the approval of the
owner of the property on which they may be located, from cutting down and
removing any trees which overhang streets.
   B.    Right Of Excavation: For the purpose of carrying into effect the
privileges granted hereunder, grantee is authorized at any time to make all
necessary excavations in the streets, alleys, roads, and rights of way within
the franchised area, but such excavation shall be carried out with reasonable
dispatch and with as little interference with or inconvenience to the rights of
the public as may be feasible. Grantee shall restore all streets, alleys,
roads, rights of way and public grounds to a standard as agreed upon for
conditions of safety and use after excavation. Except in cases of emergency,
such excavations shall require prior city approval. (Ord. 505, 9-12-2006)
11-2-3: CONDUCT OF GRANTEE'S BUSINESS:
The grantor shall have the right to make and enforce reasonable rules and
regulations pertaining to the conduct of the grantee's business. Service shall
be supplied to the grantor and its inhabitants in accordance with the grantee's
rules and regulations and tariffs filed or hereafter filed with the appropriate
regulatory body of this state having jurisdiction over the grantee. This
franchise is subject to the provisions of any applicable tariff on file with
this state's public utilities commission or its successor. In the event of any
conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of this franchise and such
tariff, the provisions of such tariff shall control.
   A.    Noninterference With Existing Facilities: All construction,
installation, repair or relocation of lines and appurtenances performed by
grantee along or under the roads, rights of way or properties subject to this
franchise shall be done in such a manner as not to interfere with the
construction and maintenance of other utilities, public or private, drains,
drainage ditches and structures, irrigation ditches and structures located
therein, nor with the grading or improvement of such roads, rights of way or
other public property subject to this franchise.
Grantee shall provide the grantor, upon the grantor's reasonable request,
copies of available drawings in use by grantee showing the location of its
facilities at specific locations within the franchised area. As to any such
drawings so provided, grantee does not warrant the accuracy thereof and, to the
extent the location of facilities are shown, such facilities are shown in their
approximate location. With respect to any excavations within the franchised
area undertaken by or on behalf of grantee or the grantor, nothing herein is
intended (nor shall be construed) to relieve either party of their respective
obligations arising under applicable law with respect to determining the
location of utility facilities.
   B.   Necessary Construction/Maintenance By Grantor: The laying,
construction, operation and maintenance of grantee's facilities authorized by
this franchise shall not preclude the grantor, its agents or its contractors,
from blasting, grading, excavating, or doing other necessary road work
contiguous to the said facilities of grantee, provided that grantee shall be
given reasonable notice of said blasting or other work. (Ord. 505, 9-12-2006)
11-2-4: VACATION OF PROPERTIES BY GRANTOR:
If, at any time, the grantor shall vacate any road, right of way or other
public property which is subject to rights granted by this franchise, such
vacation shall be subject to the reservation of a perpetual easement to the
grantee for the purpose of operating and maintaining the existing facilities of
the grantee and other public utilities. The grantor shall, in its vacation
procedure, reserve and grant said easement to the grantee for grantee's
facilities and shall also expressly prohibit any use of the vacated properties,
which will interfere with grantee's full enjoyment and use of said easement,
provided that the grantor has notified the grantee of such pending vacation and
the grantee has notified grantor of the presence of its facilities or needs.
(Ord. 505, 9-12-2006)
11-2-5: RELOCATION OF FACILITIES:
Upon request of the grantor, the grantee shall relocate its facilities as
necessary within the present and future streets, alleys, highways and other
public places owned by the grantor. The grantor shall have no responsibility
for the costs of such relocations. The grantee shall bear the cost of
relocating its facilities at the grantor's request, unless the facilities are
to be relocated for the benefit of a third party, in which case the third party
shall pay the costs of relocation. Grantee agrees to defend and hold grantor
harmless when any third party is required to move grantee's facilities pursuant
to this franchise.
   A.    Public Right Of Way Improvement: Whenever the grantor causes a public
right of way improvement to be undertaken within the franchised area, and such
public right of way improvement requires the relocation of grantee's then
existing facilities within the franchised area (for purposes other than those
described in subsection B of this section), the grantor shall:
      1.    Provide grantee, within a reasonable time prior to the commencement
of such public right of way improvement, written notice requesting such
relocation; and
      2.    Provide grantee with reasonable plans and specifications for such
public right of way improvement.
   B.   Public Or Private Development: Whenever any public or private
development within the franchised area, other than a public right of way
improvement, requires the relocation of grantee's facilities within the
franchised area to accommodate such development; or the grantor requires the
relocation of grantee's facilities within the franchised area for the benefit
of any person or entity other than the grantor, then in such event, grantee
shall have the right as a condition of such relocation, to require such
developer, person or entity to make payment to grantee, at a time and upon
terms acceptable to grantee, for any and all costs and expenses incurred by
grantee in the relocation of grantee's facilities.
It is understood that the person or persons benefiting from a relocation of
facilities should bear the expense of such relocation. Grantee agrees to defend
and hold grantor harmless when any third party is required to move grantee's
facilities pursuant to this franchise.
   C.    Required Relocation: Any condition or requirement imposed by the
grantor upon any person or entity, other than grantee, that requires the
relocation of grantee's facilities shall be a required relocation for purposes
of subsection B of this section.
   D.    Costs: Nothing in this section shall require grantee to bear any cost
or expense in connection with the location or relocation of any facilities then

city's streets, alleys or other public places to provide electrical service
within the city, during the term of this franchise.

charges or imposes upon grantee any fees, taxes or other costs in connection
with the issuance, maintenance, existence, continuation, or use of the
franchise, or the public rights of way governed hereby, granted pursuant to

all prior gas franchises for the above stated purpose heretofore granted to
grantee or its predecessors, by grantor, or its predecessors, and shall affirm,
authorize and ratify all prior installations authorized by permits or other

11-3-2: PURPOSE:
Grantor hereby grants to grantee, its successors and assigns, the right, power,
privilege and authority to enter upon all roads, rights of way, streets,
alleys, highways, lying within the boundaries of grantor and owned or
maintained by grantor now or in the future ("franchised area") to construct, or
otherwise acquire, and to own, maintain, equip, and operate plants and works,
and all necessary or desirable appurtenances thereto ("facilities"), for the
purchase, transmission and distribution of gas, including the right to
construct, lay, maintain, operate, extend, renew, remove, replace, repair, use
and operate a gas distribution system, in, under, upon, over, across, and along
the present and future public rights of way within the present or any future
corporate limits of the grantor, including streets and bridges, for the purpose
of transporting, distributing and selling gas (with the right and privilege to
make such connections with said pipes as will enable the grantee to supply gas)
for heating, lighting, power and any and all domestic, commercial, and
industrial purposes, and other reasons and purposes within and through the
grantor's corporate limits and to the grantor and its inhabitants, and to other
persons, firms, entities or municipal corporations.
   A.    Service To Be Furnished: At all times during the term of this
franchise, the grantee, subject to its tariffs, rules and regulations as filed
with the appropriate regulatory body and subject to available natural gas
supplies, shall supply natural gas to the city, its successors, and to its
inhabitants and persons and corporations thereof and any other consumers who

equip, and operate all necessary facilities for the purchase, transmission and
distribution of natural gas for the benefit and convenience of the city of

11-3-3: CONDUCT OF GRANTEE'S BUSINESS:
   A.    Noninterference With Existing Facilities: All construction,
installation, repair or relocation of lines and appurtenances performed by
grantee along or under the roads, rights of way or properties subject to this
franchise shall be done in such a manner as not to interfere with the
construction and maintenance of other utilities, public or private, drains,
drainage ditches and structures, irrigation ditches and structures located
therein, nor with the grading or improvement of such roads, rights of way or
other public property subject to this franchise.
Grantee shall provide the grantor, upon the grantor's reasonable request,
copies of available drawings in use by grantee showing the location of its
facilities at specific locations within the franchised area. As to any such
drawings so provided, grantee does not warrant the accuracy thereof and, to the
extent the location of facilities are shown, such facilities are shown in their
approximate location. With respect to any excavations within the franchised
area undertaken by or on behalf of grantee or the grantor, nothing herein is
intended (nor shall be construed) to relieve either party of their respective
obligations arising under applicable law with respect to determining the
location of utility facilities.
   B.   Trimming/Removal Of Trees: The right of grantee to maintain its
facilities and appurtenances shall include the right, as exercised in grantee's
sole discretion, to utilize an integrated vegetation management program.
Grantee or grantee's contractor may prune all trees and vegetation which
overhang a public right of way, property or place, whether such trees or
vegetation originate within or outside said right of way, property or place, in
such a manner and to such an extent as will prevent the branches or limbs or
other parts of such trees or vegetation that obstructs or may obstruct the
grantee's facilities. Such pruning shall comply with the "American National
Standard For Tree Care Operation" (ANSI A300) and be conducted under the
direction of an arborist certified with the International Society Of
Arboriculture or equivalent professional organization. A growth inhibitor
treatment may be utilized for trees and vegetation species that are fast
growing and problematic. Nothing contained in this section shall prevent
grantee, when necessary and with the approval of the owner of the property on
which they may be located, from cutting down and removing any trees which
overhang public rights of way that may interfere with grantee's facilities.
   C.   Right Of Excavation: For the purpose of carrying into effect the
privileges granted hereunder and after all necessary and required permits are
secured, grantee is authorized at any time to make all necessary excavations in
the streets, alleys, roads, rights of way within the franchised area, but such
excavation shall be carried out with reasonable dispatch and with as little
interference with or inconvenience to the rights of the public as may be
feasible. Grantee shall restore all streets, alleys, roads, rights of way to a
standard as agreed upon for conditions of safety and use after excavation.
Except in cases of emergency, such excavations shall require prior city
approval.
   D.   Expansion Of Grantee's Facilities: Any facilities and appurtenances in
streets, alleys, rights of way and public places, incidental to the franchised
area, that have been, or are at any future time acquired, leased, or utilized
in any manner by grantee are thereupon to be deemed authorized by and shall be
subject to all provisions of this franchise. (Ord. 507A, 7-24-2007)
11-3-4: VACATION OF PROPERTIES BY GRANTOR:
If, at any time, the grantor shall vacate any road, right of way or other
public property which is subject to rights granted by this franchise, such
vacation shall be subject to the reservation of a perpetual easement to the
grantee for the purpose of operating and maintaining the facilities of the
grantee and other public utilities. The grantor shall, in its vacation
procedure, reserve and grant said easement to the grantee for grantee's
facilities and shall also expressly prohibit any use of the vacated properties,
which will interfere with grantee's full enjoyment and use of said easement.
(Ord. 507A, 7-24-2007)
11-3-5: RELOCATION OF FACILITIES:
Upon request of the grantor, the grantee shall relocate its facilities as
necessary within the present and future streets, alleys, highways and other
public places owned by the grantor. The grantor shall have no responsibility
for the costs of such relocations. The grantee shall bear the cost of
relocating its facilities at the grantor's request, unless the facilities are
to be relocated for the benefit of a third party, in which case the third party
shall pay the costs of relocation. Grantee agrees to defend and hold grantor
harmless when any third party is required to move grantee's facilities pursuant
to this franchise.
   A.   Public Right Of Way Improvement: Whenever the grantor causes a public
right of way improvement to be undertaken within the franchised area, and such
public right of way improvement requires the relocation of grantee's then
existing facilities within the franchised area, the grantor shall:
      1.   Provide grantee, within a reasonable time prior to the commencement
of such public right of way improvement, written notice requesting such
relocation; and
      2.    Provide grantee with reasonable plans and specifications for such
public right of way improvement.
After receipt of such notice and such plans and specifications, grantee shall
relocate such facilities within the franchised area at no charge to the
grantor. As used in this section, the term "public right of way improvement" is
a grantor funded capital improvement to the public right of way identified in
the grantor's transportation improvement program. (Ord. 507A, 7-24-2007)
11-3-6: PRESERVATION OF GRANTOR'S RIGHTS TO CONTROL:

now have or may hereafter acquire with respect to road rights of way or other
property of grantor under this franchise, and this franchise shall not be
construed to deprive the grantor of any such powers, rights or privileges which
it now has or may hereafter acquire to regulate the use of and to control the
grantor's roads, rights of way and other public property covered by this
franchise.
   A.    Change Of Boundaries Of Grantor: Any subsequent additions or
modifications of the boundaries of the grantor, whether by annexation,
consolidation or otherwise, shall be subject to the provisions of this
franchise as to all such areas. Grantor shall endeavor to notify grantee of any
change of boundaries promptly upon such change becoming effective.

construction, operation and maintenance of grantee's facilities authorized by
this franchise shall not preclude the grantor, its agents or its contractors,
from blasting, grading, excavating, or doing other necessary road work
contiguous to the said facilities of grantee, provided that grantee shall be
given reasonable notice of said blasting or other work.
   C.    Removal Of Abandoned Facilities: Only under circumstances of
demonstrated threat to public health and safety or obstruction of public
construction projects within the right of way, the grantor may require the
grantee to remove affected abandoned facilities. Upon a forfeiture of this
franchise, or nonrenewal of this franchise, the grantor may require the
grantee, to remove such of its facilities from the public properties at its own
expense and as soon as practicable, but only where such abandoned facilities
constitute a demonstrated threat to public health and safety. If it becomes
necessary for the grantor to do so, the grantor shall be paid the reasonable
and actual costs of removal by the grantee. (Ord. 507A, 7-24-2007)
11-3-7: EQUALITY OF FRANCHISE FEES AND COSTS:
In the event that grantor charges or imposes upon grantee any fees, taxes or
other costs in connection with the issuance, maintenance, existence,
continuation, or use of this franchise, or the public rights of way governed
hereby, granted pursuant to this document, then grantor shall impose equivalent
charges, fees, taxes or costs upon any other franchisee in the same business or
competing with grantee. (Ord. 507A, 7-24-2007)

of this franchise through wilful and unreasonable neglect or wilful and
unreasonable failure to heed or comply with any notice given grantee under the
provisions of this grant, then grantee shall forfeit all rights conferred
hereunder and this franchise may be revoked or annulled by the grantor;

12-11-4: Appeal Procedure
12-11-5: Notification To The Applicant
12-11-6: Expiration Of Variance Approval
12-11-1: PURPOSE:
The planning and zoning commission may authorize in specific cases such
variance from the bulk requirements of this title as will not be contrary to
the public interest, where owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement
of the provisions of this title would result in unnecessary hardship. No
nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures or buildings in the same
district and not permitted or nonconforming use of lands, structures or
buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for issuance of a
variance. Variances shall not be granted on the grounds of convenience or
profit, but only where strict application of the bulk provisions of this title
would result in unnecessary hardship or inequity. Variance shall not be granted
to allow a use within a district where such use is prohibited by this title.
(Ord. 518, 6-10-2008)
12-11-2: APPLICATION PROCEDURE:
An application for a variance shall be filed with the administrator by at least
one owner or lessor of the property for which such variance is proposed.
   A.   At a minimum, the application shall contain the following information:
      1.    Name, address and phone number of the applicant.
      2.    Legal description of the property.
      3.    Descriptions of existing use.
      4.    Zone district.
      5.    Description of proposed variance.
      6.    Site plan, as set forth in section
12-9-5 of this title.
      7.    An objective narrative stating the reasoning for a variance and
justification of the variance.
      8.    Certificate of ownership.
      9.    A list of all property owners and their mailing addresses within
three hundred feet (300') of the external boundaries of the subject property.
      10.    Application fees. (Ord. 518, 6-10-2008)
12-11-3: HEARING PROCEDURES:
   A.    Notification: At least fifteen (15) days prior to the date of the
public hearing the administrator shall cause notice of the time and place and a
summary of the variance request to be published in the official newspaper or
paper of general circulation within the city and its impact area. Notice by
first class U.S. mail shall be sent to all property owners within three hundred
feet (300') of the external boundaries of the subject property at least fifteen
(15) days prior to the public hearing date. The administrator shall cause
notice to be posted upon three (3) distinctly visible areas of the subject site
not less than seven (7) days prior to the public hearing in a clear plastic
protector.
   B.    Action By The Hearing Body: The planning commission shall consider the
facts and circumstances of each variance application. In order to grant a
variance the commission must make the following findings:
      1.    That special conditions and circumstances exist that are peculiar
to the land involved and that are not applicable to other lands in the same
district.
      2.    That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this title would
deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the
same district under the terms of this title.
      3.    That the hardship and/or unique circumstances do not result from
actions or desires of the applicant.
      4.    That granting the variance will not confer on the applicant any
special privilege that is denied by this title to other lands, structures or
buildings in the same district.
      5.    The relief granted by the variance will not be detrimental to the
public health, safety or welfare, or injurious to the property or improvements
of other property owners, or the quiet enjoyment of such property or
improvement.
   C.    Conditions Of Approval: In recommending approval of any variance
request, the commission may prescribe appropriate conditions in conformity with
this title.
   D.    Decision: Within a reasonable time period following the public hearing
the commission shall make a decision either approving, approving with
conditions or deny the request for a variance. The decision shall be in writing
and shall specify:
      1.    The standards used in evaluating the application.
      2.    The reason(s) for the decision. (Ord. 518, 6-10-2008)
12-11-4: APPEAL PROCEDURE:
Any person denied a variance or aggrieved by a variance decision of the
planning and zoning commission may within seven (7) days following receipt of
the written decision file an appeal with the administrator and pay all
associated fees. Notice shall be considered to have been received three (3)
days after the date of mailing.
   A.    Action By The Council: The council shall hold a public hearing,
subject to the same noticing requirements as the original public hearing before
the commission, to consider the appeal. The council may approve, conditionally
approve or deny the variance. (Ord. 518, 6-10-2008)
12-11-5: NOTIFICATION TO THE APPLICANT:
Within a reasonable time period following the expiration of the appeal period
the administrator shall provide written notice of the council's decision to
approve, conditionally approve, or deny the variance application to the
applicant. (Ord. 518, 6-10-2008)
12-11-6: EXPIRATION OF VARIANCE APPROVAL:
Unless a longer time is specifically established as a condition of approval, a
variance approval shall be considered void twelve (12) months following the
effective date of the approval by council if construction is not being
diligently pursued toward completion. (Ord. 518, 6-10-2008)

shall be determined by the planning and zoning commission and such
determination shall be based upon the requirements for the most comparable
building or use specified herein. (Ord. 518, 6-10-2008)
12-12-8: COMMON FACILITIES FOR MIXED USES:
   A.    Requirements: In the case of mixed uses, the total requirements for
off street parking spaces shall be the sum of the requirements for the various
uses. Off street parking facilities for one use shall not be considered to
provide parking facilities for any other use except as provided below.
   B.    Joint Uses Of Parking Facilities: The city council may, upon
application, authorize the joint use of parking facilities required by said
uses and any other parking facility, provided that:
      1.   The applicant shows that there is no substantial conflict in the
principal operating use of the building or use for which the joint use of
parking facilities is proposed.
      2.    The parking facility for which joint use is proposed is not farther
than four hundred feet (400') from the building or use required to have
provided parking.

number of berths required:
 
Loading Berths Required
Gross Floor Area Of The Building In Square Feet Number Of Berths

   B.    A loading berth shall contain a space ten feet (10') wide and thirty
five feet (35') long, and have a vertical clearance of fourteen feet (14').

12-12-10: GENERAL PROVISIONS; OFF STREET LOADING:
The following provisions shall apply to off street loading facilities:
   A.    Requirements: The provision and maintenance of off street loading
space is a continuing obligation of the property owner. No building permit
shall be issued until plans are presented that show property that is and will
remain available for exclusive use of property for which the building permit is
issued and shall be conditional upon the unqualified continuance and
availability of the amount of loading space required by this title. Should the
owner or occupant of any building change the use to which the building is put,
thereby increasing off street loading requirements, it shall be unlawful and a
violation of this title to begin or maintain such altered use until such time
as the increased off street loading requirements are met.
   B.   Joint Use: Owners of two (2) or more buildings may agree to utilize
jointly the same loading spaces when the hours of operation do not overlap;
provided, that satisfactory legal evidence is presented to the city attorney in
the form of deeds, leases or contracts to establish the joint use.
   C.    Loading Area Plan: A plan drawn to scale, indicating how the off
street loading requirements are to be fulfilled shall accompany an application
for loading areas.
   D.   Design Requirements For Loading Areas:
      1.    Areas used for standing and maneuvering of vehicles shall have
durable and dustless surfaces of asphaltic concrete or Portland cement
concrete, maintained adequately for all weather use and so drained as to avoid
flow of water across sidewalks.
      2.    Loading areas adjacent to residential districts or adjacent to
residential uses shall be designed to minimize disturbance of residents.
Artificial lighting which may be provided shall be so deflected as not to shine
or create glare in residential districts or on any adjacent dwelling.
      3.    Access aisles shall be of sufficient width for all vehicular
turning and maneuvering.
      4.    Service drives shall have a minimum vision clearance area formed by
the intersection of the driveway centerline, the street right of way line and a
straight line joining said lines through points twenty feet (20') from their
intersection. (Ord. 518, 6-10-2008)

It is the intent of this title to permit nonconforming uses, buildings, and
lots to continue until they are removed or altered in such a manner to bring
them into conformance. It is further the intent of this title that
nonconforming uses, buildings, and lots shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or
extended in such a manner as to increase their nonconformity, without approval

with the standards of this title.
   C.    If a nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of six (6)
consecutive months, further use of the property shall conform to this title.
   D.    A nonconforming use, if changed to a conforming use, may not
thereafter be changed back to a nonconforming use.
   E.    A nonconforming use may be changed with the approval of the council,
if recommended by the commission, to another nonconforming use of the same or
of a more restricted nature.
   F.    Normal repairs and alterations may be made to a lawful nonconforming
building, provided that no structural alteration shall be made, except those
required by law. No existing nonconforming structure designed, arranged,
intended for or devoted to a use not permitted under this title for the
district in which such structure is located shall be enlarged, extended,
reconstructed, structurally altered or moved unless such use is changed to a
use permitted under the regulations specified by this title for the district in
which said building is located; and provided further, that nothing in this
title shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe
condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe and ordered to
be strengthened or restored to a safe condition, unless such building has been
destroyed by an extent exceeding seventy five percent (75%) of full value, as
determined by consideration of the assessed value referred to above.
   G.    When a building or other structure containing a nonconforming use is
damaged by fire or by any other cause so that the cost of renewal of the
damaged parts exceeds seventy five percent (75%) of the cost of the replacement
of the entire building (exclusive of foundations) using new materials, then
such building shall not be rebuilt unless the building and its construction and
uses conform fully to this title and other codes of the city as applied to new
buildings. The determination of whether a building is destroyed to the extent
described above shall rest with the council. (Ord. 518, 6-10-2008)
12-13-3: NONCONFORMITIES UNDER PERMIT AUTHORITY:
Nothing contained in this regulation shall require any change in the plans,
construction, alteration or designated use of a structure upon which
construction has commenced or a permit has been obtained prior to the effective
date hereof. If the designated use or structure will be nonconforming, the
construction of such use shall be commenced within six (6) months of permit
issuance. (Ord. 518, 6-10-2008)
12-13-4: NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD:
   A.   For a lot of record created prior to April 14, 2020 and that does not
meet the minimum lot size or width required by this Zoning Code, structures for
single unit dwellings may be built, expanded, reconstructed, occupied or used.
Such structures and uses shall meet all other applicable requirements of this
Zoning Code.
   B.   For two (2) or more lots, combinations, or portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership created prior to January 1, 1975, and
do not meet the requirements for minimum lot size or width required by this
Zoning Code, the lands involved shall be treated as an undivided parcel.
      1.   No portion of such a parcel shall be used which does not meet lot
size or width requirements established by this title.
      2.   No division of such a parcel shall be made which leaves remaining
any lot size or width below the requirements established by this title. (Ord.
