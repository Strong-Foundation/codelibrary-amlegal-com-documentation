license officer prior to issuing, denying or renewing any license.

or proposes to conduct any business in violation of the provisions of an
ordinance of the City of Long Beach, specifically including the city’s zoning
laws, or of the laws of the state of Washington. The granting of a business
license shall in no way be construed as permission or acquiescence in a
prohibited activity or other violation. Because the issuance of a license under
this chapter specifically denies the applicant authority to violate any law or
regulation, the city shall not be held liable for the actions of any licensed
business by virtue of having issued a license to conduct business.

business in the City, and establishes safe harbors for certain of those
activities so that a person who meets the criteria may engage in de minimus
business activities in the City without having to pay a business license fee.
The activities listed in this section are illustrative only and are not
intended to narrow the definition of "engaging in business" in subsection (1).
If an activity is not listed, whether it constitutes engaging in business in
the City shall be determined by considering all the facts and circumstances and
applicable law.
(3) Without being all inclusive, any one of the following activities conducted
within the City by a person, or its employee, agent, representative,
independent contractor, broker or another acting on its behalf constitutes
engaging in business and requires a person to register and obtain a business

constitute the creation of a duty by the city to indemnify the licensee for any
wrongful acts against the public, or to guarantee the quality of goods,
services or expertise of a licensee. The issuance of a license does not shift
responsibility from the licensee to the city for proper training, conduct or
equipment of the licensee or their agents, employees or representatives, even
if specific regulations require standards of training, conduct or inspection.

CHAPTER 10
PUBLIC RECORDS ACT RULES
SECTION:
1-10-1: Authority, Purpose And Findings
1-10-2: Public Records Index Order
1-10-3: Purpose
1-10-4: Public Records Officer
1-10-5: Processing Of Public Records Requests
1-10-6: Processing Of Public Records Requests - Electronic Records
1-10-7: Public Records Requests
1-10-8: Availability Of Public Records
1-10-9: Costs Of Providing Copies Of Public Records
1-10-10: Review Of Denials Of Public Records Requests
1-10-11: Exemptions Provided By Other Statutes
1-10-1: AUTHORITY, PURPOSE AND FINDINGS:
   A.   Authority: Section 42.56.070(1) of the Revised Code of Washington (RCW)
requires the city to make available for inspection and copying nonexempt public
records in accordance with published rules. The Public Records Act ("the Act")
under RCW 42.56.010 defines "public record" to include any "writing containing
information relating to the conduct of government or the performance of any
governmental or proprietary function prepared, owned, used, or retained by any
state or local agency regardless of physical form or characteristics."
   B.   Purpose Of Rules: The purpose of these Rules is to establish the
procedures the City of Long Beach ("the City") will follow in order to provide
full access to public records, fullest assistance to inquirers and the
timeliest possible action as required by RCW 42.56.100, mindful of the further
requirement that the Rules must also protect the records from damage or
disorganization and prevent excessive interference with other essential
functions of the City.
   These Rules provide information to persons wishing to request access to
public records of the City and establish processes for both requestors and City
staff that are designed to best assist members of the public in obtaining such
access.
   C.   Findings Regarding Index:
      1.   RCW 42.56.070(1) requires all cities and public agencies to maintain
and make available a current index of various public records. RCW 42.56.070(4)
provides that if maintaining such an index would be unduly burdensome, a city
need not maintain such an index but it must issue and publish a formal order
specifying the reasons why and the extent to which compliance would be unduly
burdensome.
      2.   The City of Long Beach is comprised of many departments which
maintain separate databases and/or record keeping systems. The City produces or
receives many records each day. The records are diverse, complex and stored in
multiple locations and multiple computer systems and databases. It would be
extremely difficult, unduly burdensome, and would interfere with City
operations to compile and maintain a central index of records.
      3.   The development and maintenance of a city index would be extremely
costly and would provide little benefit to the public compared to the expense
in maintaining the index. The City's operations do not allow for the addition,
revision, or reassignment of duties of existing personnel so that an index may
be developed and maintained. Anticipated city revenues do not allow for
additional staff for the purpose of creating and maintaining such an index.
(Ord. 1019, 6-5-2023)
1-10-2: PUBLIC RECORDS INDEX ORDER:
Pursuant to RCW 42.56.070(4), the City Council orders the following:
   A.   The City of Long Beach is not required to maintain a current index of
public records due to findings of the City Council that the requirement to do
so is unduly burdensome and would interfere with City operations and such a
list is nearly impossible to create and/or maintain; and
   B.   Pursuant to RCW 42.56, the City of Long Beach shall disclose all public
records and any indexes of public records maintained by the City to the extent
not exempt from disclosure pursuant to RCW Chapter 42.56 or other applicable
laws. (Ord. 1019, 6-5-2023)
1-10-3: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to establish the procedure for obtaining public
records from the City of Long Beach as required by RCW 42.56 as currently
enacted or hereafter amended. (Ord. 1019, 6-5-2023)
1-10-4: PUBLIC RECORDS OFFICER:
Any person wishing to request access to public records of the City, or seeking
assistance in making such a request, should follow the procedures set forth in
these Rules and contact the Public Records Officer (the "PRO") of the City to
submit such a request or to obtain assistance in making such a request:
   Clerk
   City of Long Beach
   115 Bolstad Ave W
   PO Box 310
   Long Beach, WA 98631
   Phone (360) 642-4421
   Fax (360) 642-8841
The PRO shall complete training as required by RCW 42.56.152 on the Public
Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and records retention (chapter 40.14 RCW). This
training is required after the PRO assumes responsibilities and under the
schedule in RCW 42.56.152 for refresher courses. (Ord. 1019, 6-5-2023)
1-10-5: PROCESSING OF PUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS:
   A.   Providing "Fullest Assistance:" Mindful of the requirements of RCW
42.56.100, to the extent reasonably possible, the PRO will process requests in
the order allowing the most requests to be processed in the most efficient
manner. In an effort to better understand the request and provide all
responsive records, the PRO can inquire about the purpose for the request, but
the requestor is not required to answer except to establish whether inspection
and copying would violate RCW 42.56.070(9) (see subsection E below) or other
statute which exempts or prohibits production of specific information or
records to certain persons.
   B.   Acknowledging Receipt Of Request: Within five (5) business days of
receipt of the request, not including the day the request was received, the
weekend or holiday as provided by RCW 1.12.040, the PRO will do one or more of
the following:
      1.   Make the records available for inspection or copying;
      2.   If copies are requested and payment or payment of a deposit is made
as provided in section
1-10-7 below, or terms of payment are agreed upon, send the copies to the
requestor;
      3.   Provide a reasonable estimate of any additional time needed to
respond to the request and a date by which the records will be produced in
whole or in part depending on whether the records are being provided in
installments. The factors used to estimate the additional time needed must be
based upon objective criteria. Additional time is allowed under the following
circumstances:
         a.   To request clarification from the requestor if the request is
unclear or does not sufficiently identify the requested records. Such
clarification may be requested and provided by telephone. If the clarification
is made by telephone, the PRO will confirm the scope of the clarification in
writing. The confirmation will be deemed the correct statement of the scope of
the request unless the requestor responds with a supplemental request;
         b.   To locate and assemble the information requested;
         c.   To notify third persons or agencies in the event the requested
records contain information that may affect rights of others and may be exempt
from production; or
         d.   To determine whether any of the information requested is exempt
from production and that a denial should be made as to all or part of the
request; or
      4.   Deny or redact the request, specifying the reasons for denial or
redaction, including supporting legal citations.
   C.   Failure To Respond:
      1.   By The PRO: If the PRO does not respond in writing within five
business days of receipt of the request for disclosure, the requestor should
consider contacting the PRO to determine the reason for the failure to respond.
      2.   By The Requestor: If the requestor fails to respond to an agency
request to clarify the request, and the entire record is unclear, the City need
not respond to it. Otherwise, the City must respond to those portions of the
request that are clear.
   D.   Injunction: Pursuant to RCW 42.56.565, the City may seek to enjoin the
inspection or copying of any nonexempt public record by persons serving
criminal sentences in state, local, or privately operated correctional
facilities.
   E.   Records Exempt From Production: Some records are exempt from
production, in whole or in part. If a record is exempt from production and
subject to denial, the PRO will state the specific exemption and provide a
brief explanation of the denial and how the exemption applies to the record
being withheld. This explanation should be sufficient to enable the requestor
to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption and denial
is proper. If only a portion of a record is exempt from production, but the
remainder is not exempt, the PRO will redact the exempt portions, produce the
nonexempt portions, and indicate to the requestor why portions of the record
are being redacted. (For the purposes of these Rules, redact means the exempt
information will be covered in some manner and then the record will be
photocopied and the photocopy then disclosed.)
   Some records by law require third party notification or consent. The PRO
will notify the requestor of the notification or consent requirement and add
sufficient time to the estimated response time.
   The City is also prohibited by statute from producing lists of individuals
for commercial purposes. Therefore, if a request is received for any type of
list of individuals, an inquiry as to whether the requestor intends to use the
list for commercial purposes must be answered before the list can be provided.
If the answer is that it will be used for such purposes, the list cannot be
produced.
   F.   Inspection Of Records:
      1.   Consistent with other demands, the City shall promptly provide space
to inspect public records. No member of the public may remove a document from
the viewing area or disassemble or alter any document. The requestor shall
indicate which documents he or she wishes the City to copy or scan, if any, and
provide payment for those copies or scans.
      2.   The requestor must claim or review the assembled records within
thirty (30) days of the PRO'S notification to him or her that the records are
available for inspection or copying/scanning. The PRO will notify the
requestor, in writing, of this requirement and inform the requestor that he or
she should contact the PRO to make arrangements to claim or review the records.
If the requestor or a representative of the requestor fails to claim or review
the records within the thirty (30) day period or make other arrangements, the
PRO may close the request and re-file the assembled records. Other public
records requests can be processed ahead of a subsequent request by the same
person for the same or almost identical records, which can be processed as a
new request.
   G.   Providing Records In Installments: When the request is for a large
number of records, the PRO may provide access for inspection and copying in
installments, if he or she reasonably determines that it would be practical to
provide the records in that manner. If, within thirty (30) days, the requestor
fails to inspect the entire set of records or one or more of the installments,
the PRO may stop searching for the remaining records and close the request.
   H.   Closing Withdrawn Or Abandoned Request: When the requestor either
withdraws the request or fails to fulfill his or her obligations to inspect the
records or pay the deposit or final payment for the requested copies, the PRO
will close the request and so inform the requestor.
   I.   Later Discovered Documents: If, after the PRO has informed the
requestor that he or she has provided all available records, the PRO becomes
aware of additional responsive documents existing at the time of the request
that had not been provided previously, he or she will promptly inform the
requestor of the additional documents and provide them on an expedited basis.
   J.   Requests For Information Or Nonexistent Records: Requests for
information are not public records requests. An agency is not required to
conduct legal research for a requestor. An agency is not required to create
records to respond to a request. (Ord. 1019, 6-5-2023)
1-10-6: PROCESSING OF PUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS - ELECTRONIC RECORDS:
   A.   Requesting Electronic Records: The process for requesting electronic
public records is the same as for requesting paper public records.
   B.   Providing Electronic Records: If public records are requested in an
electronic format, the PRO will provide the nonexempt records or portions of
such records that are reasonably locatable in an electronic format that is used
by the agency and is generally commercially available, or in a format that is
reasonably translatable from the format in which the agency keeps the record.
Costs for providing electronic records are governed by PRA Rule 070 below.
   C.   Retaining Electronic Copies: Because an electronic record is usually
more susceptible to manipulation and alteration than a paper record, the City
will keep, when feasible, an electronic copy of the electronic records it
provides to a requestor to be able to show the exact records it provided if
necessary. (Ord. 1019, 6-5-2023)
1-10-7: PUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS:
   A.   Any person wishing to inspect or copy public records of the City should
make the request in writing on the City's request form attached as Exhibit A,
or by letter, fax, or email addressed to the PRO and including the following
information:
   Name of requestor; address of requestor; other contact information,
including telephone number and any e-mail address; identification of the public
records adequate for the PRO to locate the records; and the date and time of
day of the request.
   B.   A public record request must be for identifiable records. A request for
all or substantially all records prepared, owned, used, or retained by an
agency is not a valid request for identifiable records, provided that a request
for all records regarding a particular topic or containing a particular keyword
or name shall not be considered a request for all of the City's records.
   C.   If the requestor wishes to have copies or scans of the records made
instead of simply inspecting them, he or she should so indicate and make
arrangements with the PRO to pay for copies or scans of the records as provided
in
1-10-9 below.
   D.   A form is available for use by requestors at the office of the PRO and
on-line at www.longbeachwa.gov.
   E.   Public records requests are public records and subject to inspection or
copying.
   F.   The PRO shall accept requests for public records that contain the above
information by telephone or in person. The PRO will confirm receipt of the
information and the substance of the request in writing. The confirmation will
be deemed the correct statement of the scope of the request unless the
requestor responds with a different statement of the scope.
   G.   Records requests may only include existing records. They cannot be used
to obtain copies of records not yet in existence.
   H.   The City may deny a bot request that is one of multiple requests from
the requestor to the agency within a twenty-four (24) hour period, if the City
establishes that responding to the multiple requests would cause excessive
interference with other essential functions of the City. A "bot" request means
a request for public records that the City reasonably believes was
automatically generated by a computer program or script. (Ord. 1019, 6-5-2023)
1-10-8: AVAILABILITY OF PUBLIC RECORDS:
   A.   Availability: Public records are available for inspection and copying
during normal business hours of the City, Monday through Friday, eight o'clock
(8:00) A.M. to five o'clock (5:00) P.M., excluding legal holidays. Inspection
of records shall occur at the central offices of the City unless another
location is approved by the PRO or designee.
   B.   Organization Of Records: The City will maintain its records in a
reasonably organized manner. While committed to fully comply with the Act and
these Rules, the City must also take reasonable actions to protect records from
damage and disorganization and prevent excessive interference with other
essential functions of the City. A requestor shall not take City records from
City offices. A variety of records are available on the City's web site at
www.longbeachwa.gov. Requestors are encouraged to view the documents available
on the web site prior to submitting a records request. (Ord. 1019, 6-5-2023)
1-10-9: COSTS OF PROVIDING COPIES OF PUBLIC RECORDS:
   A.   No fee will be charged for the inspection of public records or locating
public records and making them available for copying, except as described in
RCW 52.56.120(3).
   B.   The City shall charge the following costs for providing copies of
public records:
      1.   Fifteen cents ($0.15) per page for photocopies of public records,
printed copies of electronic public records when requested by the person
requesting records, or for the use of City equipment to photocopy public
records;
      2.   Ten cents ($0.10) per page for public records scanned into an
electronic format or for the use of agency equipment to scan the records;
      3.   Five cents ($0.05) per each four (4) electronic files or attachment
uploaded to e-mail, cloud-based data storage service or other means of
electronic delivery;
      4.   Ten cents ($0.10) per gigabyte for the transmission of public
records in an electronic format or for the use of agency equipment to send the
records electronically. The City shall take reasonable steps to provide the
records in the most efficient manner available to the agency in its normal
operations;
      5.   The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by
the City, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies
to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.
      6.   Sixty-seven cents ($0.67) per minute of staff time for redaction of
any law enforcement requested body-worn camera footage. These charges are based
on the average per-minute salaries of the city employees responsible for video
redaction. See RCW 42.56.240 (14)(f)(1).
   C.   The charges in subsection B of this section may be combined to the
extent that more than one type of charge applies to copies produced in response
to a particular request.
   D.   The City may charge a flat fee of up to two dollars ($2.00) for any
request as an alternative to fees authorized under subsection B of this section
when the City reasonably estimates and documents that the costs allowed under
this subsection are clearly equal to or more than two dollars ($2.00). An
additional flat fee shall not be charged for any installment after the first
installment of a request produced in installments. If the City has elected to
charge the flat fee in this subsection for an initial installment, it may not
charge the fees authorized in subsection B2 on subsequent installments.
   E.   The City shall not impose copying charges under this section for access
to or downloading of records that the City routinely posts on its Website prior
to receipt of a request, unless the requestor has specifically requested that
the City provide copies of such records through other means.
   F.   A requestor may ask the City to provide, and if requested, the City
shall provide a summary of the applicable charge before any copies are made and
the requestor may revise the request to reduce the number of copies to be made
and reduce the applicable charges.
   G.   The City may include a customized service charge, as allowed by RCW
42.56.120(3).
   H.   The City may require a deposit in an amount not to exceed ten percent
of the estimated cost of providing copies for a request. If the City makes a
request available on a partial or installment basis, the City may charge for
each part of the request as it is provided. If an installment of a records
request is not claimed or reviewed, the City is not obligated to fulfill the
balance of the request. The City may waive any charge assessed for a request
pursuant to City rules and regulations. The City may enter into any contract,
memorandum of understanding or other agreement with a requestor that provides
an alternative fee arrangement to the charges authorized in this section, or in
response to a voluminous or frequently occurring request.
   H.   The PRO will not charge sales tax when it makes copies or scans of
public records but if the records are sent to a third party for copying/
scanning, that third party may charge sales tax and the requestor will be
responsible for payment of that tax as well as the third party's actual charges
for copies or scans.
   I.   Payment: Payment may be made by cash, check, or money order made
payable to the City.
   J.   Other Copying Charges: The Act generally governs copying charges for
public records, but several specific statutes govern charges for particular
kinds of records. The following non-exhaustive list provides some examples: RCW
46.52.085 (charges for traffic accident reports); RCW 10.97.100 (copies of
criminal histories) and RCW 70.58.107 (charges for birth certificates). The
City will charge the amount authorized pursuant to these other statutes rather
than as provided under the Act.
   K.   Use Of Outside Vendor: An agency is not required to copy/scan records
at its own facilities. An agency can send the project to a commercial copying/
scanning center and bill the requestor for the amount charged by the vendor. An
agency can arrange with the requestor to pay the vendor directly. An agency
cannot charge the default per page copying/scanning charge when its cost at a
vendor is less. (Ord. 1019, 6-5-2023)
1-10-10: REVIEW OF DENIALS OF PUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS:
   A.   Internal Administrative Review Of Denial Of Access: If the City makes a
denial or partial denial of a records request, the City shall immediately
conduct an internal review of that decision. The denial or partial denial shall
be immediately sent to the City Attorney, who shall consult with the City
Administrator on the decision.
   B.   Consideration Of Petition For Review: The denial or partial denial
shall be deemed complete at the end of the second business day following the
denial or partial denial of inspection, and shall constitute final agency
action.
   C.   Judicial Review: Any person may obtain court review of: (1) the City's
denials or partial denial of public records requests; or the reasonableness of
the estimate of the amount of time provided by the City; or the reasonableness
of the City's estimate of the charges to produce copies of public records, as
provided in RCW 42.56.550. (Ord. 1019, 6-5-2023)
1-10-11: EXEMPTIONS PROVIDED BY OTHER STATUTES:
   A.   Exemptions. RCW 42.56.070(2) requires the city to set forth "for
informational purposes" every law, in addition to the Act, that exempts or
prohibits the production of public records. Requestors should be aware of the
following exemptions, outside the Act, that may restrict the availability of
some records held by the City for inspection and copying/scanning:

   A.   Review And Approval Required; Reimbursement: The city shall allow the
contracting out of city services after review and approval by the city council.
The city council shall review each individual project and determine if it is
suitable for city involvement. If the city council determines that a given
project is appropriate for city work forces to undertake, the city council
shall then establish to what extent the city shall be reimbursed for costs and
administrative overhead. It is specifically stipulated that the city council

cost of any city service be paid in advance of providing such service.
   C.   Time Of Providing Service: The city council, after consultation with

Code § 3.32.010)
3-2-2: SMALL WORKS ROSTER 1 :
   A.   Purpose And Intent: This section provides uniform small works roster
provisions to award contracts for construction, building, renovation,
remodeling, alteration, repair, or improvement of real property. These
provisions may be used in lieu of other procedures to award contracts for such
work with an estimated cost of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00) or
less. The city may award contracts using the small works roster process under
this section using the limited public works process under subsection C of this
section.
   B.   Creating Rosters; Procedure For Awarding Contracts:
      1.   The city may create a single general small works roster, or may
create a small works roster for different specialties or categories of
anticipated work. Where applicable, small works rosters may make distinctions
between contractors based upon different geographic areas served by the
contractor. The small works roster or rosters shall consist of all responsible
contractors who have requested to be on the list and, where required by law,
are properly licensed or registered to perform such work in the state. The city
may require eligible contractors desiring to be placed on a roster or rosters
to keep current records of any applicable licenses, certifications,
registrations, bonding, insurance, or other appropriate matters on file with
the city as a condition of being placed on a roster or rosters. At least once a
year, the city shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation within the
city a notice of the existence of the roster or rosters and solicit the names
of contractors for such roster or rosters. In addition, responsible contractors
shall be added to an appropriate roster or rosters at any time they submit a
written request and necessary records. Master contracts may be required to be
signed that become effective when a specific award is made using a small works
roster.
      2.   The city shall secure telephone, written, or electronic quotations
from contractors on the appropriate small works roster to assure that a
competitive price is established and to award contracts to the lowest
responsible bidder, as defined in Revised Code of Washington 43.19.1911.
Invitations for quotations shall include an estimate of the scope and nature of
the work to be performed as well as materials and equipment to be furnished.
However, detailed plans and specifications need not be included in the
invitation. This subsection does not eliminate other requirements for
architectural or engineering approvals as to quality and compliance with
building codes. Quotations may be invited from all appropriate contractors on
the appropriate small works roster.
      3.   A contract awarded from a small works roster under this section need
not be advertised.
      4.   Immediately after an award is made, the bid quotations obtained
shall be recorded, open to public inspection, and available by telephone
inquiry.
   C.   Limited Public Works Process:
      1.   In lieu of awarding contracts under subsection B of this section,
the city may award a contract for work, construction, alteration, repair, or
improvement projects estimated to cost less than thirty five thousand dollars
($35,000.00) using the limited public works process provided under this
subsection. Public works projects awarded under this subsection are exempt from
the other requirements of the small works roster process provided under
subsection B of this section and are exempt from the requirement that contracts
be awarded after advertisement, as provided under Revised Code of Washington
39.04.010.
      2.   For limited public works projects, the city shall solicit electronic
or written quotations from a minimum of three (3) contractors from the
appropriate small works roster and shall award the contract to the lowest
responsible bidder, as defined under Revised Code of Washington 43.19.1911.
After an award is made, the quotations shall be open to public inspection and
available by electronic request. The city shall attempt to distribute
opportunities for limited public works projects equitably among contractors
willing to perform in the geographic area of the work. The city shall maintain
a list of the contractors contacted and the contracts awarded during the
previous twenty four (24) months under the limited public works process,
including the name of the contractor, the contractor's registration number, the
amount of the contract, a brief description of the type of work performed, and
the date the contract was awarded. For limited public works projects, the city
may waive the payment and performance bond requirements of Revised Code of
Washington chapter 39.08 and the retainage requirements of Revised Code of
Washington chapter 60.28, thereby assuming the liability for the contractor's
nonpayment of laborers, mechanics, subcontractors, materialmen, suppliers, and
taxes imposed under Revised Code of Washington title 82 that may be due from
the contractor for the limited public works project; however, the city shall
have the right of recovery against the contractor for any payments made on the
contractor's behalf.
   D.   Breaking Project Into Units Or Accomplishing In Phases: The breaking of
any project into units or accomplishing any projects by phases is prohibited if
it is done for the purpose of avoiding the maximum dollar amount of a contract
that may be let using the small works roster process or limited public works
process. (2007 Code)

11-4-2019)
3-4-4: DEFINITIONS:
In construing the provisions of this chapter, the following definitions shall
be applied. Words in the singular number shall include the plural, and the
plural shall include the singular.
BUSINESS: Includes all activities engaged in with the object of gain, benefit,
or advantage to the taxpayer or to another person or class, directly or
indirectly.
BUSINESS AND OCCUPATION TAX OR GROSS RECEIPTS TAX: A tax imposed on or measured
by the value of products, the gross income of the business, or the gross
proceeds of sales, as the case may be, and that is the legal liability of the
business.
COMMERCIAL OR INDUSTRIAL USE: The following uses of products, including
byproducts, by the extractor or manufacturer thereof:
   A.   Any use as a consumer; and
   B.   The manufacturing of articles, substances or commodities.
DELIVERY: The transfer of possession of tangible personal property between the
seller and the buyer or the buyer's representative. Delivery to an employee of
a buyer is considered delivery to the buyer. Transfer of possession of tangible
personal property occurs when the buyer or the buyer's representative first
takes physical control of the property or exercises dominion and control over
the property. "Dominion and control" means the buyer has the ability to put the
property to the buyer's own purposes. It means the buyer or the buyer's
representative has made the final decision to accept or reject the property,
and the seller has no further right to possession of the property and the buyer
has no right to return the property to the seller, other than under a warranty
contract. A buyer does not exercise dominion and control over tangible personal
property merely by arranging for shipment of the property from the seller to
itself. A buyer's representative is a person, other than an employee of the
buyer, who is authorized in writing by the buyer to receive tangible personal
property and take dominion and control by making the final decision to accept
or reject the property. Neither a shipping company nor a seller can serve as a
buyer's representative. It is immaterial where the contract of sale is
negotiated or where the buyer obtains title to the property. Delivery terms and
other provisions of the uniform commercial code 1  do not determine when or
where delivery of tangible personal property occurs for purposes of taxation.
DIGITAL CODE AND DIGITAL GOODS: Have the same meaning as in Revised Code of
Washington 82.04.192.
DIGITAL PRODUCTS: Means digital goods, digital codes, digital automated
services, and the services described in Revised Code of Washington 82.04.050(2)
(g) and (6)(b).
DIRECTOR: The finance and administrative services director of the city or any
officer, agent or employee of the city designated to act on the director's
behalf.
ELIGIBLE GROSS RECEIPTS TAX: A tax which:
   A.   Is imposed on the act or privilege of engaging in business activities
within section
3-4-5 of this chapter; and
   B.   Is measured by the gross volume of business, in terms of gross receipts
and is not an income tax or value added tax; and
   C.   Is not, pursuant to law or custom, separately stated from the sales
price; and
   D.   Is not a sale or use tax, business license fee, franchise fee, royalty
or severance tax measured by volume or weight, or concession charge, or payment
for the use and enjoyment of property, property right or a privilege; and
   E.   Is a tax imposed by a local jurisdiction, whether within or without the
state of Washington, and not by a country, state, province, or any other
nonlocal jurisdiction above the county level.
ENGAGING IN BUSINESS:
   A.   Commencing, conducting, or continuing in business, and also the
exercise of corporate or franchise powers, as well as liquidating a business
when the liquidators thereof hold themselves out to the public as conducting
such business.
   B.   This definition sets forth examples of activities that constitute
engaging in business in the city, and establishes safe harbors for certain of
those activities so that a person who meets the criteria may engage in de
minimis business activities in the city without having to register and obtain a
business license or pay city business and occupation taxes. The activities
listed in this definition are illustrative only and are not intended to narrow
the definition of "engaging in business" in subsection A of this definition. If
an activity is not listed, whether it constitutes engaging in business in the
city shall be determined by considering all the facts and circumstances and
applicable law.
   C.   Without being all inclusive, any one of the following activities
conducted within the city by a person, or its employee, agent, representative,
independent contractor, broker or another acting on its behalf constitutes
engaging in business and requires a person to register and obtain a business
license 2 :
      1.   Owning, renting, leasing, maintaining, or having the right to use,
or using, tangible personal property, intangible personal property, or real
property permanently or temporarily located in the city;

975, 11-4-2019)
3-4-9: ASSIGNMENT OF GROSS INCOME DERIVED FROM INTANGIBLES:
Gross income derived from the sale of intangibles such as royalties,
trademarks, patents, or goodwill shall be assigned to the jurisdiction where
the person is domiciled (its headquarters is located). (Ord. 829, 12-17-2007,
eff. 1-1-2008; amd. Ord. 975, 11-4-2019)
3-4-10: ALLOCATION AND APPORTIONMENT OF INCOME WHEN ACTIVITIES TAKE PLACE IN
MORE THAN ONE JURISDICTION:
Gross income, other than persons subject to the provisions of chapter 82.14A
Revised Code of Washington, shall be allocated and apportioned as follows:
   A.   Gross income derived from all activities other than those taxed as
service or royalties under subsection
3-4-5A7 of this chapter shall be allocated to the location where the activity
takes place.
   B.   In the case of sales of tangible personal property, the activity takes
place where delivery to the buyer occurs.
   C.   In the case of sales of digital products, the activity takes place
where delivery to the buyer occurs. The delivery of digital products will be
deemed to occur at:
      1.   The seller’s place of business if the purchaser receives the digital
product at the seller’s place of business;
      2.   If not received at the seller’s place of business, the location
where the purchaser or the purchaser’s donee, designated as such by the
purchaser, receives the digital product, including the location indicated by
instructions for delivery to the purchaser or donee, known to the seller.
      3.   If the location where the purchaser or the purchaser’s donee
receives the digital product is not known, the purchaser’s address maintained
in the ordinary course of the seller’s business when use of this address does
not constitute bad faith;
      4.   If no address for the purchaser is maintained in the ordinary course
of the seller’s business, the purchaser’s address obtained during the
consummation of the sale, including the address of the purchaser’s payment
instrument, if no other address is available, when use of this address does not
constitute bad faith; and
      5.   If no address for the purchaser is obtained during the consummation
of the sale, the address where the digital good or digital code is first made
available for transmission by the seller or the address from which the digital
automated service or service described in Revised Code of Washington 82.04.050
(2)(g) or (6)(b) was provided, disregarding for these purposes any location
that merely provided the digital transfer of the product sold.
   D.   If none of the methods in subsection C for determining where the
delivery of digital products occurs are available after a good faith effort by
the taxpayer to apply the methods provided in subsection C1 through C5, then
the city and the taxypayer may mutually agree to employ any other method to
effectuate an equitable allocation of income from the sale of digital products.
The taxpayer will be responsible for petitioning the city to use an alternative
method under this subsection D. The city may employ an alternative method for
allocating the income from the sale of digital products if the methods in
subsections C1 through C5 are not available and the taxpayer and the city are
unable to mutually agree on an alternative method to effectuate an equitable
allocation of income from the sale of digital products.
   E.   For purposes of subsections C1 through C5, the following definitions
apply:
 
DIGITAL AUTOMATED SERVICES, DIGITAL Have the same meaning as in Revised Code
CODES, AND DIGITAL GOODS:           of Washington 82.04.192.
                                    Digital goods, digital codes, digital
DIGITAL PRODUCTS:                   automated services, and the services
                                    described in Revised Code of Washington
                                    82.04.050(2)(g) and (6)(c).
RECEIVE:                            Has the same meaning as in Revised Code of
                                    Washington 82.32.730.
 
   F.   Gross income derived from activities taxed as services and other
activities taxed under
3-4-5A. shall be apportioned to the city by multiplying apportionable income by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the payroll factor plus the service
income factor and the denominator of which is two (2).
      1.   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the
total amount paid in the city during the tax period by the taxpayer for
compensation and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid
everywhere during the tax period. Compensation is paid in the city if:
         a.   The individual is primarily assigned within the city;
         b.   The individual is not primarily assigned to any place of business
for the tax period and the employee performs fifty percent (50%) or more of his
or her service for the tax period in the city; or
         c.   The individual is not primarily assigned to any place of business
for the tax period, the individual does not perform fifty percent (50%) or more
of his or her service in any city and the employee resides in the city.
      2.   The service income factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is
the total service income of the taxpayer in the city during the tax period, and
the denominator of which is the total service income of the taxpayer everywhere
during the tax period. Service income is in the city if: the customer location
is in the city.
      3.   Gross income of the business from engaging in an apportionable
activity must be excluded from the denominator of the service income factor if,
in respect to such activity, at least some of the activity is performed in the
city, and the gross income is attributable under F2 to a city or unincorporated
area of a county within the United States or to a foreign country in which the
taxpayer is not taxable. For purposes of this subsection F3, “not taxable”
means that the taxpayer is not subject to a business activities tax by that
city or county within the United States or by that foreign country, except that
a taxpayer is taxable in a city or county within the United States or in a
foreign country in which it would be deemed to have a substantial nexus with
the city or county within the United States or with the foreign country under
the standards in Revised Code of Washington 35.102.050 regardless of whether
that city or county within the United States or that foreign country imposes
such a tax.
      4.   If the allocation and apportionment provisions of this subsection F
do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer’s business activity in the
city, the taxpayer may petition for, or the tax administrators may require, in
respect to all or any part of the taxpayer’s business activity, if reasonable:
         a.   Separate accounting;
         b.   The exclusion of any one (1) or more of the factors;
         c.   The inclusion of one (1) or more additional factors that will
fairly represent the taxpayer’s business activity in the city; or
         d.   The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable
allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income.
      5.   The party petitioning for, or the tax administrator requiring, the
use of any method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of
the taxpayer’s income pursuant to subsection F4 must prove by a preponderance
of the evidence:
         a.   That the allocation and apportionment provisions of this
subsection F do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer’s business
activity in the city; and
         b.   That the alternative to such provisions is reasonable. The same
burden of proof shall apply whether the taxpayer is petitioning for, or the tax
administrator is requiring, the use of an alternative, reasonable method to
effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income.
      6.   If the tax administrator requires any method to effectuate an
equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income, the tax
administrator cannot impose any civil or criminal penalty with reference to the
tax due that is attributable to the taxpayer’s reasonable reliance solely on
the allocation and apportionment provisions of this subsection F.
      7.   A taxpayer that has received written permission from the tax
administrator to use a reasonable method to effectuate an equitable allocation
and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income shall not have that permission
revoked with respect to transactions and activities that have already occurred
unless there has been a material change in, or a material misrepresentation of,
the facts provided by the taxpayer upon which the tax administrator reasonably
relied in approving a reasonable alternative method.
   G.   The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section.

2008)
3-10-4: LICENSE REQUIREMENTS:
(Rep. by Ord. 914a, 8-3-2015)
3-10-5: PROCEDURES:
   A.   Other than any annual license fee or registration fee assessed under
this title, the tax imposed by this chapter shall be due and payable in
quarterly installments. At the director's discretion, businesses may be
assigned to a monthly or annual reporting period depending on the tax amount
owing or type of tax. Tax payments are due on or before the last day of the
next month following the end of the assigned reporting period covered by the
return.
   B.   Taxes shall be paid as provided in this chapter and accompanied by a
return on forms as prescribed by the director. The return shall be signed by
the taxpayer personally or by a responsible officer or agent of the taxpayer.
The individual signing the return shall swear or affirm that the information in
the return is complete and true.
   C.   Tax returns must be filed and returned by the due date whether or not
any tax is owed.
   D.   For purposes of the tax imposed by chapter 4 of this title, any person
whose value of products, gross proceeds of sales, or gross income of the
business, subject to tax after all allowable deductions, is equal to or less
than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) in the current quarter, shall file a
return, declare no tax due on their return, and submit the return to the
director. The gross receipts and deduction amounts shall be entered on the tax
return even though no tax may be due.
   E.   A taxpayer that commences to engage in business activity shall file a
return and pay the tax or fee for the portion of the reporting period during
which the taxpayer is engaged in business activity.
   F.   Except as otherwise specifically provided by any other provision of
this chapter, in computing any period of days prescribed by this chapter the
day of the act or event from which the designated period of time runs shall not
be included. The last day of the period shall be included unless it is a
Saturday, Sunday, or city or federal legal holiday, in which case the last day
of such period shall be the next succeeding day which is neither a Saturday,
Sunday, or city or federal legal holiday.
   G.   If any taxpayer fails, neglects or refuses to make a return as and when
required in this chapter, the director is authorized to determine the amount of
the tax or fees payable by obtaining facts and information upon which to base
the director's estimate of the tax or fees due. Such assessment shall be deemed
prima facie correct and shall be the amount of tax owed to the city by the
taxpayer. The director shall notify the taxpayer by mail or e-mail of the
amount of tax so determined, together with any penalty, interest, and fees due;
the total of such amounts shall thereupon become immediately due and payable.
(Ord. 828, 12-17-2007, eff. 1-1-2008)
3-10-6: PAYMENTS:
   A.   Taxes shall be paid to the director in United States currency by bank
draft, certified check, cashier's check, personal check, money order, cash, or
by wire transfer or electronic payment if such wire transfer or electronic
payment is authorized by the director. If payment so received is not paid by
the bank on which it is drawn, the taxpayer, by whom such payment is tendered,
shall remain liable for payment of the tax and for all legal penalties, the
same as if such payment had not been tendered. Acceptance of any sum by the
director shall not discharge the tax or fee due unless the amount paid is the
full amount due.
   B.   A return or remittance that is transmitted to the city by United States
mail shall be deemed filed or received on the date shown by the cancellation
mark stamped by the post office upon the envelope containing it. The director
may allow electronic filing of returns or remittances from any taxpayer. A
return or remittance which is transmitted to the city electronically shall be
deemed filed or received according to procedures set forth by the director.
   C.   If a written request is received prior to the due date, the director,
for good cause, may grant, in writing, additional time within which to make and
file returns.
   D.   The director shall keep full and accurate records of all funds received
or refunded. The director shall apply payments first against all penalties and
interest owing, and then upon the tax, without regard to any direction of the
taxpayer.
   E.   For any return not accompanied by a remittance of the tax shown to be
due thereon, the taxpayer shall be deemed to have failed or refused to file a
return and shall be subject to the penalties and interest provided in this
chapter.
   F.   Any payment made that is returned for lack of sufficient funds or for
any other reason will not be considered received until payment by certified
check, money order, or cash of the original amount due, plus a "nonsufficient
funds" (NSF) charge as per the fee resolution is received by the director. Any
license issued upon payment with an NSF check will be considered void, and
shall be returned to the director. No license shall be reissued until payment
of the NSF fee is received.
   G.   The director is authorized, but not required, to mail tax return forms
to taxpayers, but failure of the taxpayer to receive any such forms shall not
excuse the taxpayer from filing returns and making payment of the taxes or
fees, when and as due under this chapter. (Ord. 828, 12-17-2007, eff. 1-1-2008)
3-10-7: RECORDS; RETENTION, INSPECTION:
Every person liable for any fee or tax imposed by this chapter shall keep and
preserve, for a period of five (5) years after filing a tax return, such
records as may be necessary to determine the amount of any fee or tax for which
the person may be liable; which records shall include copies of all federal
income tax and state tax returns and reports made by the person. All books,
records, papers, invoices, vendor lists, inventories, stocks of merchandise,
and other data including federal income tax and state tax returns and reports
shall be open for examination at any time by the director or its duly
authorized agent. Every person's business premises shall be open for inspection
or examination by the director or a duly authorized agent.
   A.   If a person does not keep the necessary books and records within the
city, it shall be sufficient if such person:
      1.   Produces within the city such books and records as may be required
by the director; or
      2.   Bears the cost of examination by the director's agent at the place
where such books and records are kept; provided that the person electing to
bear such cost shall pay in advance to the director the estimated amount
thereof including round trip fare, lodging, meals and incidental expenses,
subject to adjustment upon completion of the examination.
   B.   Any person who fails, or refuses a department request, to provide or
make available records, or to allow inspection or examination of the business
premises, shall be forever barred from questioning in any court action, the
correctness of any assessment of taxes made by the city for any period for
which such records have not been provided, made available or kept and
preserved, or in respect of which inspection or examination of the business
premises has been denied. The director is authorized to determine the amount of
the tax or fees payable by obtaining facts and information upon which to base
the estimate of the tax or fees due. Such fee or tax assessment shall be deemed
prima facie correct and shall be the amount of tax owing the city by the
taxpayer. The director shall notify the taxpayer by mail the amount of tax so
determined, together with any penalty, interest, and fees due; the total of
such amounts shall thereupon become immediately due and payable. (Ord. 828, 12-
17-2007, eff. 1-1-2008)
3-10-8: ACCOUNTING METHODS:
   A.   A taxpayer may file tax returns in each reporting period with amounts
based upon cash receipts only if the taxpayer's books of account are kept on a
cash receipts basis. A taxpayer that does not regularly keep books of account
on a cash receipts basis must file returns with amounts based on the accrual
method.
   B.   The taxes imposed and the returns required hereunder shall be upon a
calendar year basis. (Ord. 828, 12-17-2007, eff. 1-1-2008)
3-10-9: PUBLIC WORK CONTRACTS:
The director may, before issuing any final payment to any person performing any
public work contract for the city, require such person to pay in full all
license fees or taxes due under this title from such person on account of such
contract or otherwise, and may require such taxpayer to file with the director
a verified list of all subcontractors supplying labor and/or materials to the
person in connection with said public work. (Ord. 828, 12-17-2007, eff. 1-1-
2008)
3-10-10: UNDERPAYMENT OF TAX:

has been paid, the director shall assess the additional amount found to be due
and shall add thereto interest on the tax only. The director shall notify the
person by mail or e-mail of the additional amount, which shall become due and
shall be paid within thirty (30) days from the date of the notice, or within
such time as the director may provide in writing.
   B.   1. The director shall compute interest in accordance with Revised Code
Of Washington 82.32.050 as it now exists or as it may be amended; or

penalties, or interest due more than four (4) years after the close of the
calendar year in which they were incurred, except that the director may issue
an assessment:
   A.   Against a person who is not currently registered or licensed or has not
filed a tax return as required by this chapter for taxes due within the period
commencing ten (10) years prior to the close of the calendar year in which the
person was contacted in writing by the director;
   B.   Against a person that has committed fraud or who misrepresented a
material fact; or
   C.   Against a person that has executed a written waiver of such
limitations. (Ord. 828, 12-17-2007, eff. 1-1-2008)
3-10-12: OVERPAYMENT OF TAX:
   A.   Any person having paid any tax, original assessment, additional
assessment, or corrected assessment of any tax may apply to the city
administrator or his/her designee within the time limitation for refund
provided in this section by applying in writing for a correction of the amount
paid, in which application the petitioner shall set forth the reasons the
amount in which the tax, interest, or penalty should be refunded.
   B.   If, upon receipt of a timely application for a refund, or during an
audit or examination of the taxpayer's records and tax returns, the city
administrator or his/her designee determines that the amount of tax, penalty,
or interest paid is in excess of that properly due, the excess amount shall be
credited to the taxpayer's account or shall be refunded to the taxpayer. Except
as provided in subsection C of this section, no refund or credit shall be made
for taxes, penalties, or interest paid more than three (3) years prior to the
beginning of the calendar year in which the refund application is made or
examination of records is completed.
   C.   The execution of a written waiver shall extend the time for applying
for, or making a refund or credit of any taxes paid during, or attributable to,
the years covered by the waiver if, prior to the expiration of the waiver
period, an application for refund of such taxes is made by the taxpayer or the
city administrator or his/her designee discovers that a refund or credit is
due.
   D.   Refunds shall be made by means of vouchers approved by the city
administrator or his/her designee and by the issuance of a city check or
warrants drawn upon and payable from such funds as the city may provide.

competent jurisdiction for tax, penalties, interest, or costs paid by any
person shall be paid in the same manner, as provided in subsection D of this
section, upon the filing with the city administrator or his/her designee a
certified copy of the order or judgment of the court.
   F.   1. The city administrator or his/her designee shall compute interest on
refunds or credits of amounts paid or other recovery allowed a taxpayer in
accordance with Revised Code Of Washington 82.32.060 as it now exists or as it
may be amended; or
      2.   If subsection F1 of this section is held to be invalid, then the

received by the director by the due date, the director shall add a penalty in
accordance with Revised Code Of Washington 82.32.090(1), as it now exists or as
it may be amended.
   B.   If the director determines that any tax has been substantially

has not obtained from the director a license as required by title 4, chapter 1
of this code, the director shall impose a penalty in accordance with Revised
Code Of Washington 82.32.090(4), as it now exists or as it may be amended. No
penalty shall be imposed under this subsection if the person who has engaged in
business without a license obtains a license prior to being notified by the
director of the need to be licensed.
   E.   If the director determines that all or any part of a deficiency
resulted from the taxpayer's failure to follow specific written tax reporting
instructions, there shall be assessed a penalty in accordance with Revised Code
Of Washington 82.32.090(5), as it now exists or as it may be amended.
   F.   If the director finds that all or any part of the deficiency resulted
from an intent to evade the tax payable, the director shall assess a penalty in

it may be amended.
   G.   The penalties imposed under subsections A through E of this section can
each be imposed on the same tax found to be due. This subsection does not
prohibit or restrict the application of other penalties authorized by law.
   H.   The director shall not impose both the evasion penalty and the penalty
for disregarding specific written instructions on the same tax found to be due.
   I.   For the purposes of this section, "return" means any document a person
is required by the city of Long Beach to file to satisfy or establish a tax or
fee obligation that is administered or collected by the city, and that has a
statutorily defined due date.
   J.   If incorporation into the city of Long Beach code of future changes to
Revised Code Of Washington 82.32.090 is deemed invalid, then the provisions of
Revised Code Of Washington 82.32.090 existing at the effective date hereof
shall apply. (Ord. 828, 12-17-2007, eff. 1-1-2008)
3-10-14: CANCELLATION OF PENALTIES:
   A.   The director may cancel any penalties imposed under subsection 3-10-13A
of this chapter if the taxpayer shows that its failure to timely file or pay
the tax was due to reasonable cause and not wilful neglect. Wilful neglect is
presumed unless the taxpayer shows that it exercised ordinary business care and
prudence in making arrangements to file the return and pay the tax but was,
nevertheless, due to circumstances beyond the taxpayer's control, unable to
file or pay by the due date. The director has no authority to cancel any other
penalties or to cancel penalties for any other reason except as provided in
subsection C of this section.
   B.   A request for cancellation of penalties must be received by the
director within thirty (30) days after the date the department mails the notice
that the penalties are due. The request must be in writing and contain
competent proof of all pertinent facts supporting a reasonable cause
determination. In all cases the burden of proving the facts rests upon the
taxpayer.
   C.   The director may cancel the penalties in subsection 3-10-13A of this
chapter one time if a person:
      1.   Is not currently licensed and filing returns;
      2.   Was unaware of its responsibility to file and pay tax; and
      3.   Obtained business licenses and filed past due tax returns within
thirty (30) days after being notified by the department.

(Ord. 828, 12-17-2007, eff. 1-1-2008)
3-10-15: BUSINESS SUCCESSOR:
   A.   Whenever any taxpayer quits business, sells out, exchanges, or
otherwise disposes of his business or his stock of goods, any tax payable
hereunder shall become immediately due and payable. Such taxpayer shall, within
ten (10) days thereafter, make a return and pay the tax due.
   B.   Any person who becomes a successor shall become liable for the full
amount of any tax owing. The successor shall withhold from the purchase price a
sum sufficient to pay any tax due to the city from the taxpayer until such time
as:
      1.   The taxpayer shall produce a receipt from the city showing payment
in full of any tax due or a certificate that no tax is due; or
      2.   More than six (6) months has passed since the successor notified the
director of the acquisition and the director has not issued and notified the
successor of an assessment.
   C.   Payment of the tax by the successor shall, to the extent thereof, be
deemed a payment upon the purchase price. If such payment is greater in amount
than the purchase price, the amount of the difference shall become a debt due
such successor from the taxpayer.
   D.   Notwithstanding the above, if a successor gives written notice to the
director of the acquisition, and the department does not within six (6) months
of the date it received the notice issue an assessment against the taxpayer and
mail a copy of that assessment to the successor, the successor shall not be
liable for the tax. (Ord. 828, 12-17-2007, eff. 1-1-2008)

the city administrator to be required under the provisions of this chapter may
pay the amount due and appeal from such determination by filing a written
notice of appeal with the hearings examiner within thirty (30) days from the
date written notice of such amount was mailed to the taxpayer. A fifty dollar
($50.00) filing fee shall be submitted with the appeal, which filing fee is
required to process the appeal. The city clerk shall, as soon as practical, fix
a time and place for the hearing of such appeal, and shall cause a notice of
the time and place thereof to be delivered or mailed to the parties. The
decision of the hearings examiner shall indicate the correct amount of the fee
or tax owing.
The decision of the city administrator or his/her designee on an application
for refund under section

notice of appeal to the hearings examiner within thirty (30) days of the city
administrator's or his/her designee's action. A fifty dollar ($50.00) filing
fee shall be submitted with the appeal, which filing fee is required to process

examiner shall affirm, modify, or reverse the decision of the city
administrator or his/her designee, and the hearings examiner's decision shall
be final. (Ord. 914a, 8-3-2015)

decision by applying for a writ of review with the Pacific County superior
court within thirty (30) days from the date of the hearings examiner's decision
in accordance with the procedure set forth in chapter 7.16 Revised Code Of
Washington, other applicable law, and court rules. Review by the superior court
shall be on, and shall be limited to, the record on appeal created before the
hearing examiner. The city shall have the same right of review from the
administrative decision as does a taxpayer. (Ord. 914a, 8-3-2015)
3-10-18: RULES AND REGULATIONS:
The director shall have the power, from time to time, to adopt, publish and
enforce rules and regulations not inconsistent with this chapter or with law
for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this chapter and it shall be
unlawful to violate or fail to comply with, any such rule or regulation. (Ord.
828, 12-17-2007, eff. 1-1-2008)
3-10-19: AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER CITIES:

3-10-20: MAILING OF NOTICES:
Any notice required by this chapter to be mailed to any taxpayer or licensee
shall be sent by ordinary mail, addressed to the address of the taxpayer or
licensee as shown by the records of the director. Failure of the taxpayer or
licensee to receive any such mailed notice shall not release the taxpayer or
licensee from any tax, fee, interest, or any penalties thereon, nor shall such
failure operate to extend any time limit set by the provisions of this chapter.
It is the responsibility of the taxpayer to inform the director in writing
about a change in the taxpayer's address. (Ord. 828, 12-17-2007, eff. 1-1-2008)

zoning laws, or of the laws of the State of Washington. The granting of a
business license shall in no way be construed as permission or acquiescence in
a prohibited activity or other violation. Because the issuance of a license
under this chapter specifically denies the applicant authority to violate any
law or regulation, the City shall not be held liable for the actions of any
licensed business by virtue of having issued a license to conduct business.

out to the public as conducting such business.
      2.   This subsection K sets forth examples of activities that constitute
engaging in business in the City, and establishes safe harbors for certain of
those activities so that a person who meets the criteria may engage in de

license fee. The activities listed in this subsection K are illustrative only
and are not intended to narrow the definition of "engaging in business" in

section.
The City expressly intends that engaging in business includes any activity
sufficient to establish nexus for purposes of applying the license fee under
the law and the Constitutions of the United States and the State of Washington.
Nexus is presumed to continue as long as the taxpayer benefits from the
activity that constituted the original nexus generating contact or subsequent
contacts. (Ord. 958, 9-4-2018)

4-5-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The purpose and intent of the city council in enacting this chapter is to
maintain and protect the health, safety and welfare of its citizens, through
the regulation of the operations of sexually oriented business uses. The
regulations set forth herein are intended to prevent health and safety problems
and dangerous and unlawful conduct in and around such uses and premises. (Ord.
805, 10-5-2005)
4-5-2: FINDINGS OF FACT:
Based upon a wide range of evidence presented to the Long Beach city council
and to other cities within the region and in other jurisdictions, nonprofit
organizations and other legislative bodies, the city council makes the
following findings:
   A.   Certain conduct occurring at sexually oriented businesses creates
secondary impacts that are detrimental to the public health, safety and general
welfare of the citizens of the city, and therefore such conduct must be
regulated as provided herein.
   B.   Regulation of sexually oriented businesses is necessary, because in the
absence of such regulation significant criminal activity has historically and
regularly occurred. This history of criminal activity has included
prostitution, illegal employment of minors, narcotics trafficking and use,
alcoholic beverage law violations, assault, theft, breaches of the peace, tax
evasion, and the presence within the industry of individuals with outstanding
arrest warrants and past criminal behavior that may be indicative of intended
future conduct.
   C.   It is necessary to license entertainers in the adult entertainment
industry: to prevent the exploitation of minors; to ensure that each such
entertainer is an adult; and to ensure that such entertainers have not assumed
a false name, which would make regulation of the entertainer difficult or
impossible.
   D.   It is necessary to have a licensed manager on the premises of sexually
oriented businesses so that there will at all necessary times be an individual
responsible for the overall operation of the establishment, including the
actions of patrons, entertainers and other employees.
   E.   The license fees required herein are nominal fees imposed as necessary
cost measures designed to help defray the substantial expenses incurred by the
city in regulating sexually oriented businesses.
   F.   Sexually oriented businesses are increasingly associated with ongoing
prostitution, disruptive conduct and other criminal activity. Such businesses
constitute a threat to the public peace, health and safety. The hours of
operation of such businesses have a significant impact on the occurrence of
criminal activity.
   G.   Due to the information presented regarding the connection of
prostitution with adult entertainment, there is concern over sexually
transmitted diseases which is a legitimate health concern of the city and thus
requires regulation of sexually oriented businesses in order to protect the
health, safety and well being of the public.
   H.   The city may rely on the experiences and studies of other cities and
organizations in assessing the need for regulation of sexually oriented
business uses, operations and licensing.
   I.   Regulation of sexually oriented businesses is necessary to prevent
deterioration and/or degradation of the vitality of the community before the
problem exists, rather than in response to an existing problem.
   J.   Increased levels of criminal activities occur in the vicinity of
sexually oriented businesses.
   K.   Close physical proximity between entertainers and patrons during adult
entertainment performances facilitates illegal sexual contact, prostitution,
and related crimes. Concerns about crime and public sexual activity are
legitimate and compelling concerns of the city, which concerns require the
reasonable regulation of sexually oriented businesses in order to protect the
health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Long Beach.
   L.   The city council, therefore, finds that the protection and the
preservation of the public health, safety and welfare requires establishment of
this chapter. (Ord. 805, 10-5-2005)
4-5-3: APPLICABILITY:
This chapter shall constitute the exclusive means of licensing sexually
oriented businesses. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of other
regulations of the city and this chapter, the provisions of this chapter shall
control. (Ord. 805, 10-5-2005)
4-5-4: EXEMPTIONS:
This chapter shall not be construed to prohibit:
   A.   Plays, operas, musicals or other dramatic works that are not obscene.
   B.   Classes, seminars and lectures held for serious scientific or
educational purposes that are not obscene.
   C.   Exhibitions, performances, expression or dances that are not obscene.
   D.   Massage facilities employing licensed massage therapists adjunct to
athletic clubs, health clubs, medical facilities, hotels, motels or beauty
salons; or massage enterprises licensed by the state and operating as approved
home occupations. (Ord. 805, 10-5-2005)

      1.   For those proposals for which the city is the lead agency, the
responsible official shall be the city administrator or such other person as
designated in writing by the mayor.
      2.   For all proposals for which the city is the lead agency, the
responsible official shall make the threshold determination, supervise scoping
and preparation of any required environmental impact statement (EIS) and
perform any other functions assigned to the "lead agency" or "responsible
official" by those sections of the SEPA rules that were adopted by reference.
      3.   The city shall retain all documents required by the SEPA rules
(Washington administrative code chapter 197-11) and make them available in
accordance with Revised Code Of Washington 42.56.100.
   E.   Lead Agency Determination And Responsibilities:
      1.   The department within the city receiving an application for or
initiating a proposal that involves a nonexempt action shall determine the lead
agency for that proposal under Washington administrative code 197-11-050 and
197-11-922 through 197-11-940, unless the lead agency has been previously
determined or the department or agency is in the process of determining the
lead agency.
      2.   When the city is the lead agency for a proposal, the department
receiving the application shall determine the responsible official who shall
supervise compliance with the threshold determination requirements, and if an
EIS is necessary, shall supervise preparation of the EIS.
      3.   When the city is not the lead agency for a proposal, all departments
of the city shall use and consider, as appropriate, either the DNS or the final
EIS of the lead agency in making decisions on the proposal. No city department
shall prepare or require preparation of a DNS or EIS in addition to that
prepared by the lead agency, unless required under Washington administrative
code 197-11-600. In some cases the city may conduct supplemental environmental
review under Washington administrative code 197-11-600.
      4.   If the city or any of its departments receives a lead agency
determination made by another agency that appears inconsistent with the
criteria of Washington administrative code 197-11-922 through 197-11-940, it
may object to the determination. Any objection must be made to the agency
originally making the determination and resolved within fifteen (15) days of
receipt of the determination or the city must petition the department of
ecology for a lead agency determination under Washington administrative code
197-11-946 within the fifteen (15) day time period.
      5.   Departments of the city are authorized to make agreements as to lead
agency status or shared lead agency duties for proposal under Washington
administrative code 197-11-942 and 197-11-944; provided, that the responsible
official and any department that will incur responsibilities as the result of
such agreement approve the agreement.
      6.   Any department making a lead agency determination for a private
project shall require sufficient information from the applicant to identify
other agencies with jurisdiction over the proposal. (That is: Which agencies
require nonexempt licenses?)
   F.   Transfer Of Lead Agency Status To State Agency: For any proposal for a
private project whether the city would be the lead agency and for which one or
more state agencies have jurisdiction, the city's responsible official may
elect to transfer the lead agency duties to a state agency. The state agency
with jurisdiction appearing first on the priority listing in Washington
administrative code 197-11-936 shall be the lead agency and the city shall be
the agency with jurisdiction. To transfer lead agency duties, the city's
responsible official must transmit a notice of the transfer together with any
relevant information available on the proposal to the appropriate state agency
with jurisdiction. The responsible official of the city shall also give notice
of the transfer to the private applicant and any other agencies with
jurisdiction over the proposal.
   G.   Time Limits (Washington Administrative Code 197-11-310): The time
limits (expressed in calendar dates) contained in this section shall apply when
the city processes licenses for all private projects and those governmental
proposals submitted to the city by other agencies. For the purpose of this
section, the word "day" shall mean a day upon which the city's administrative
offices are open for business. These time estimates shall not be construed to
be mandatory.
      1.   Categorical Exemptions: The city shall identify whether an action is
categorically exempt within seven (7) days of receiving a completed
application.
      2.   Threshold Determinations:
         a.   The city should complete threshold determinations that can be
based solely upon review of the environmental checklist for the proposal within
fifteen (15) days of the date an applicant's adequate application and completed
checklist are submitted.
         b.   When the responsible official requires further information from
the applicant or consultation with other agencies with jurisdiction:
            (1)   The city should request such further information within
fifteen (15) days of receiving an adequate application and completed
environmental checklist;
            (2)   The city shall wait no longer than thirty (30) days for a
consulted agency to respond;
            (3)   The applicant shall have one hundred eighty (180) days to
submit additional information requested before the permit application expires.
            (4)   The responsible official should complete the threshold
determination within fifteen (15) days of receiving the requested information
from the applicant or the consulted agency.
         c.   When the city must initiate further studies, including field
investigations, to obtain the information to make the threshold determination,
the city should complete the studies within thirty (30) days of receiving an
adequate application and a completed checklist.
         d.   The city shall complete threshold determinations on actions where
the applicant recommends in writing that an EIS be prepared, because of the
probable significant adverse environmental impact(s) described in the
application, within fifteen (15) days of receiving an adequate application and
completed checklist.
         e.   The city may extend the threshold determination to fifteen (15)
days after receipt of a changed or clarified proposal, environmental checklist,
and/or permit application.
   H.   Additional Timing Considerations:
      1.   For nonexempt proposals, the DNS or draft EIS for the proposal shall
accompany the city's staff recommendation to any appropriate advisory body,
such as the planning commission.
      2.   If the city's only action on a proposal is a decision on a building
permit or other license that requires detailed project plans and
specifications, the applicant may request in writing that the city conduct
environmental review prior to submission of the detailed plans and
specifications. (Ord. 916, 8-3-2015)
5-1-2: CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS AND THRESHOLD DETERMINATIONS:
   A.   Purpose Of Section; Adoption By Reference: This section contains the
rules for deciding whether a proposal has a probable significant, adverse
environmental impact requiring an environmental impact statement (EIS) to be
prepared. This section also contains rules for evaluating the impacts of
proposals not requiring an EIS. The city adopts the following sections by
reference, as supplemented in this chapter:
WAC 197-11-300 Purpose of this part
WAC 197-11-300 Purpose of this part
-305           Categorical exemptions
-310           Threshold determination required
-315           Environmental checklist
-330           Threshold determination process
-335           Additional information
-340           Determination of nonsignificance (DNS)
-350           Mitigated DNS
-360           Determination of significance (DS/initiation of scoping)
-390           Effect of threshold determination
-800           Categorical exemptions
-880           Emergencies
-890           Petitioning DOE to change exemptions
 
   B.   Flexible Thresholds For Categorical Exemptions: The city establishes
the following exempt levels for minor new construction under Washington
administrative code 197-11-800 based on local conditions:
      1.   For residential dwelling units in Washington administrative code
197-11-800(1)(b)(i): Up to twenty (20) dwelling units;
      2.   For agricultural structures in Washington administrative code 197-
11-800(1)(b)(ii): Up to thirty thousand (30,000) square feet;
      3.   For office, school, commercial, recreational, service or storage
buildings in Washington administrative code 197-11-800(1)(b)(iii): Up to twelve
thousand (12,000) square feet and up to forty (40) parking spaces;
      4.   For parking lots in Washington administrative code 197-11-800(1)(b)
(iv): Up to forty (40) parking spaces;
      5.   For landfills and excavations in Washington administrative code 197-
11-800(1)(b)(v): Up to five hundred (500) cubic yards.
   C.   Exemption Use:
      1.   When the city receives an application for a license or, in the case
of governmental proposals, a department initiates a proposal, the responsible
official shall determine if the application and/or proposal is exempt. The
department's determination that a proposal is exempt shall be final and not
subject to administrative review. If a proposal is exempt, none of the
procedural requirements of this chapter apply to the proposal. The city shall
not require completion of an environmental checklist for an exempt proposal.
      2.   In determining whether or not a proposal is exempt, the responsible
official shall make certain the proposal is properly defined and shall identify
the governmental licenses required (Washington administrative code 197-11-060).
If a proposal includes exempt and nonexempt action, the department shall
determine the lead agency, even if the license application that triggers the
department's consideration is exempt.
      3.   If a proposal includes both exempt and nonexempt actions, the city
may authorize exempt actions prior to compliance with the procedural
requirements of this chapter, except that:
         a.   The city shall not give authorization for:
            (1)   Any nonexempt action,
            (2)   Any action that would have an adverse environmental impact,
            (3)   Any action that would limit the choice of alternatives;
         b.   A department may withhold approval of an exempt action that would
lead to modification of the physical environment, when such modification would
serve no purpose if nonexempt action(s) were not approved; and
         c.   A department may withhold approval of exempt actions that would
lead to substantial financial expenditures by a private applicant when the
expenditures would serve no purpose if nonexempt action(s) were not approved.
   D.   Environmental Checklist: A completed environmental checklist in the
form provided in Washington administrative code 197-11-960 shall be filed at
the same time as an application for a permit, license, certificate, or other
approval not specifically exempted in this chapter; except, a checklist is not
needed if the city and applicant agree an EIS is required, SEPA compliance has
been completed, or SEPA compliance has been initiated by another agency. The
city shall use the environmental checklist to determine the lead agency and, if
the city is the lead agency, for determining the responsible official and for
making the threshold determination.
   E.   Mitigated DNS:
      1.   As provided in this section and Washington administrative code 197-
11-350, the responsible official may issue a DNS based on conditions attached
to the proposal by the responsible official or on changes to, or clarification
of, the proposal made by the applicant.
      2.   An applicant may request in writing early notice of whether a DS is
likely under Washington administrative code 197-11-350. The request must:
         a.   Follow submission of a permit application and environmental
checklist for a nonexempt proposal for which the department is lead agency; and
         b.   Precede the city's actual threshold determination for the
proposal.
      3.   The responsible official should respond to the request for early
notice within seven (7) working days. The response shall:
         a.   Be written;
         b.   State whether the city currently considers issuance of a DS
likely and, if so, indicate the general or specific area(s) of concern that is/
are leading the city to consider a DS; and
         c.   State that the applicant may change or clarify the proposal to
mitigate the indicated impacts, revising the environmental checklist and/or
permit application as necessary to reflect the changes or clarification.
      4.   As much as possible, the city should assist the applicant with
identification of impacts to the extent necessary to formulate mitigation
measures.
      5.   When an applicant submits a changed or clarified proposal, along
with a revised or amended environmental checklist, the city shall base its
threshold determination on the changed or clarified proposal and should make
the determination within fifteen (15) days of receiving the changed or
clarified proposal:
         a.   If the city indicated specific mitigation measures in its
response to the request for early notice, and the applicant changed or
clarified the proposal to include those specific mitigation measures, the city
shall issue and circulate a DNS under Washington administrative code 197-11-340
(2).
         b.   If the city indicated areas of concern, but did not indicate
specific mitigation measures that would allow it to issue a DNS, the city shall
make the threshold determination, issuing a DNS or DS as appropriate.
         c.   The applicant's proposed mitigation measures (clarifications,
changes or conditions) must be in writing and must be specific. For example,
proposals to "control noise" or "prevent stormwater runoff" are inadequate,
whereas proposals to "muffle machinery to X decibel" or construct two hundred
foot (200') stormwater retention pond at Y location are adequate.
         d.   Mitigation measures which justify issuance of a mitigated DNS may
be incorporated in the DNS by reference to agency staff reports, studies or
other documents.
      6.   The mitigated DNS issued under Washington administrative code 197-
11-340(2) requires a fifteen (15) day comment period and public notice.
      7.   Mitigation measures incorporated in the mitigated DNS shall be
deemed conditions of approval of the permit decision and may be enforced in the
same manner as any term or condition of the permit, or enforced in any manner
specifically prescribed by the city.
      8.   If the city's tentative decision on a permit or approval does not
include mitigation measures that were incorporated in a mitigated DNS for the
proposal, the city should evaluate the threshold determination to assure
consistency with Washington administrative code 197-11-340(3)(a) (withdrawal of
DNS).
      9.   The city's written response under subsection E2 of this section
shall not be construed as a determination of significance. In addition,
preliminary discussion of clarifications or changes to a proposal, as opposed
to a written request for early notice, shall not bind the city to consider the
clarifications or changes in its threshold determination. (Ord. 916, 8-3-2015)

      1.   Preparation of draft and final EISs (DEIS and FEIS) and draft and
final supplemental EISs (SEIS) is the responsibility of the city administrator.
Before the city issues an EIS, the responsible official shall be satisfied that
it complies with this chapter and Washington administrative code chapter 197-
11.
      2.   The DEIS and FEIS or draft and final SEIS shall be prepared by city
staff, the applicant, or by a consultant selected by the city or the applicant.
If the responsible official requires an EIS for a proposal and determines that
someone other than the city will prepare the EIS, the responsible official
shall notify the applicant of the city's procedure for EIS preparation,
including approval of the DEIS and FEIS prior to distribution.
      3.   The city may require an applicant to provide information the city
does not possess, including specific investigations. However, the applicant is
not required to supply information that is not required under this chapter or

   B.   Public Notice: Whenever the city issues a DNS under Washington
administrative code 197-11-340(2) or a DS under Washington administrative code
197-11-360(3), the city shall give public notice as follows:
      1.   If public notice is required for a nonexempt license, the notice
shall state whether a DS or DNS has been issued and when comments are due.
      2.   If public notice is required for the permit or approval, the city
shall give notice of the DNS or DS by:
         a.   Posting the property, for site specific proposals;
         b.   Publishing notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the
county, city or general area where the proposal is located.
      3.   Whenever the city issues a DS under Washington administrative code
197-11-360(3), the city shall state the scoping procedure for the proposal in
the DS as required in Washington administrative code 197-11-620, notice of the
availability of those documents shall be given by:
         a.   Indicating the availability of the DEIS in any public notice
required for a nonexempt license; and
         b.   Posting the property, for site specific proposals;
         c.   Publishing notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the
county, city or general area where the proposal is located.

nonexempt permit(s) or approval(s) required for the proposal.
      5.   The city may require an applicant to complete the public notice
requirements for the applicant's proposal at his or her expense.
      6.   Documents which are required to be sent to the department of ecology
under chapter 197-11 Washington administrative code will be published in the
SEPA register, which will also constitute a form of public notice. However,
publication in the SEPA register shall not, in itself, meet compliance with
this section.
   C.   Consulted Agency Responsibilities:
      1.   The city administrator shall be responsible for preparation of
written comments for the city in response to a consultation request prior to a
threshold determination, participation in scoping, and reviewing a DEIS.
      2.   The city administrator shall be responsible for the city's
compliance with Washington administrative code 197-11-550 whenever the city is
a consulted agency and is authorized to develop operating procedures that will
ensure that responses to consultation requests are prepared in a timely fashion
and include data from all appropriate departments of the city. (Ord. 916, 8-3-

probable significant adverse environmental impacts that are identified in an
FEIS or final SEIS prepared pursuant to this chapter; and
         b.   A finding is made that there are no reasonable mitigation
measures capable of being accomplished that are sufficient to mitigate the
identified impact; and
         c.   The denial is based on one or more policies identified in
subsection B4 of this section and identified in writing in the decision
document.
      4.   The city designates and adopts by reference the following policies

imprisonment shall not be suspended or deferred. If the court finds such risk
or overcrowding exists, it shall sentence the defendant to a minimum of forty
(40) hours of community service. If a minimum term of imprisonment is suspended

8-1-4: COMPLETE STREETS:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to promote pedestrian, bicycle,
and public transportation travel to reduce negative environmental impacts,
promote healthy living, advance the well- being of travelers, support the goal
of compact development, and meet the needs of the diverse populations that
comprise our community. It is intended to help achieve the goals and objectives
of the City of Long Beach (City) as a community in which all residents and
visitors, regardless of their age, ability, or financial resources, can safely
and efficiently use the public right-of-way to meet their transportation needs
regardless of their preferred mode of travel.
The City will plan for, design, construct, operate, and maintain an appropriate
and integrated transportation system that plans for the needs of all users in
new roadway construction, retrofit, or reconstruction projects. The system's
design will be consistent with sound engineering principles and supportive of
local neighborhoods, recognizing that transportation needs vary and must be
balanced in a flexible, safe, and cost-effective manner.
   B.   Complete Streets Definition: A "complete street" is a road that is
designed to provide safe access to all users, including bicyclists, motorists,
public transit vehicles and users, school buses, emergency responders,
wheelchair users, and pedestrians of all ages and abilities. The complete
streets concept focuses not just on individual roads but on changing the
decision-making process so that all users are routinely considered during the
planning, designing, building and operating of all roadways. Transportation
facilities that support the concept of complete streets include, but are not
limited to, pavement markings and signs; street and sidewalk lighting; sidewalk
and pedestrian safety improvements; Americans With Disabilities Act and title
VI compliance; transit accommodations; bicycle accommodations including
appropriate signage and markings, and as appropriate streetscapes that appeal
to and promote pedestrian use.
   C.   Projects: Those involved in the planning and design of projects within
the public right-of-way will consider all users and modes of travel from the
start of planning and design work. Transportation improvements shall be viewed
as opportunities to create safer, more accessible streets for all users. This
shall apply to new construction, reconstruction, and rehabilitation.
   D.   Exceptions: Exceptions to this policy may be determined by the City
Administrator under the circumstances listed below:
      1.   Street projects may exclude those elements of this policy that would
require the accommodation of street uses prohibited by law;
      2.   Ordinary and routine maintenance of the transportation network
designed to keep assets in serviceable condition that does not change the
roadway geometry or operations, such as mowing, snowplowing, sweeping, spot
repair, joint or crack sealing, or pothole filling do not require that elements
of this policy be applied beyond the scope of that maintenance activity;
      3.   Repairs made pursuant to pavement opening and restoration allowed by
approval of the City Administrator or City Engineer;
      4.   Ordinary maintenance paving projects should include evaluation of
the condition of existing facilities supporting alternate transportation modes
as well as modifying existing pavement markings and signage that supports such
alternative modes as appropriate;
      5.   Street reconstruction projects and maintenance paving projects which
involve widening pavement may exclude elements of this policy when the
accommodation of a specific use is expected to:
         a.   Require more space than is physically available; or
         b.   Be located where both current and future need is proven absent;
or
         c.   Incur cost that would be disproportionate to the current or
probable future need; or
         d.   Have adverse impacts on environmental resources such as streams,
wetlands, floodplains, steep slopes or other critical areas; or
         e.   Have significant adverse impacts on neighboring land uses or on
historic structures or sites above and beyond the impacts of currently existing
infrastructure, including impacts from right- of-way acquisition; or
         f.   Be unnecessary or inappropriate because it would be contrary to
public safety.
         g.   Street projects may exclude the development of sidewalks in areas
falling outside those identified as appropriate for sidewalks based on an
adopted sidewalk policy.
   E.   Intergovernmental Consideration: The City will foster partnerships and
cooperation with other transportation agencies including the Washington State
Department of Transportation and Pacific County to ensure the principles and
practices of complete streets are embedded within their planning, design,
construction, and maintenance activities. The City will specifically cooperate
to ensure the transportation network flows seamlessly between jurisdictions in
accordance with local and regional road, transit, bicycle, and pedestrian
plans.
   F.   Design Criteria: The City shall maintain design criteria, standards and
guidelines based upon recognized best practices in street design, construction
and operation as identified in section
11-5-1 of this Code. To the greatest extent possible, the City shall adopt
standards with emphasis on pedestrian and bicycle markings and wayfinding
signage (as permitted through this Code). Resources to be referenced in
developing these standards shall include, but not necessarily be limited to,
the latest editions of: American Association of State Highway Transportation
Officials (AASHTO) Policy On Geometric Design of Highways and Streets,
Washington State Department of Transportation Design Manual, and the Manual On
Uniform Traffic Control Devices.
   G.   Community Context: Implementation of this section shall consider the
goal of enhancing the context and character of the surrounding built and
natural environments.
   H.   Network: Appropriate attention should be given to projects which
enhance the overall transportation system and its connectivity for access to
parks or recreation areas, schools, shopping/commercial areas, public
transportation, employment centers, existing pedestrian or bicycle networks, or
regional bicycle pedestrian plans prepared by other associated groups such as
the Washington State Department of Transportation and Pacific County.
   I.   Performance Measures: The City Administrator or his/her designee shall
report to the City Council on an annual basis on the transportation projects
undertaken within the prior year and planned within the coming six-year period
and the extent to which each of these projects has met the objectives of this
policy.
   J.   Implementation Of Complete Streets Principles: The City will
incorporate complete streets principles into the City's comprehensive plan,
public works standards, Parks and Recreation and Open Space Plan, and other
plans, manuals, rules, regulations and programs as appropriate. Implementation
may also be done through developing transportation network plans on a regional
basis within the City and in conjunction with regional plans. These plans shall
specify the type and location of improvements and shall be implemented as
funding becomes available. Special emphasis shall be placed on those elements
of these plans that can be accomplished with little or no additional expense,
such as providing bike lanes where existing pavement is adequate or where road
shoulders are sufficient to allow for safe bicycle use. (Ord. 957, 9-4-2018)

8-2-14: CARE OF EXCAVATED MATERIAL:
   A.   Piling Adjacent To Trench: All material excavated from trenches and
piled adjacent to the trench or in any street shall be piled and maintained in
such a manner as not to endanger those working in the trench, pedestrians or
users of the streets, and so that as little inconvenience as possible is caused
to those using streets and adjoining property.
   B.   Use Of Storage Site: Where the confines of the area being excavated are
too narrow to permit the piling of excavated material beside the trench, such
as might be in the case of a narrow alley, the city administrator or his
designee shall have the authority to require that the permittee haul the
excavated material to a storage site and then rehaul it to the trench site at
the time of backfilling. It shall be the permittee's responsibility to secure
the necessary permission and make all necessary arrangements for all required
storage and disposal. (Ord. 751, 12-18-2000)
8-2-15: DAMAGE TO EXISTING IMPROVEMENTS:
All damage done to existing improvements during the progress of the excavation
work shall be repaired by the permittee. Materials and workmanship for such
repair shall conform to the requirements of any applicable code or ordinance.
If upon being ordered, the permittee fails to furnish the necessary labor and
materials for such repairs, the city administrator or his designee shall have
the authority to cause said necessary labor and materials to be furnished by
the city and the cost shall be charged against the permittee, and the permittee
shall also be liable on its bond therefor. (Ord. 751, 12-18-2000)
8-2-16: PROPERTY LINES AND EASEMENTS:
Property lines and limits of easements shall be indicated on the plan of
excavation submitted with the application for the excavation permit, and it

8-2-17: CLEANUP OF RUBBISH, DEBRIS:
As the excavation work progresses, all streets and private properties shall be
thoroughly cleaned of all rubbish, excess earth, rock and other debris
resulting from such work. All cleanup operations at the location of such
excavation shall be accomplished at the expense of the permittee and shall be
completed to the satisfaction of the city administrator or his designee. From
time to time as may be ordered by the city administrator or his designee and in
any event immediately after completion of said work, the permittee shall at its
own expense clean up and remove all refuse and unused materials of any kind
resulting from said work; and upon failure to do so within twenty four (24)
hours after having been notified to do so by the city administrator or his
designee, said work may be done by the city administrator or his designee and
at the cost thereof charged to the permittee, and the permittee shall also be
liable for the cost thereof under the surety bond provided hereunder. (Ord.
751, 12-18-2000)
8-2-18: PROTECTION OF WATERCOURSES:
   A.   The permittee shall provide for the flow of all watercourses, sewers or
drains intercepted during the excavation work and shall replace the same in as
good condition as the permittee found them or shall make such provisions for
them as the city administrator or his designee may direct.
   B.   The permittee shall not obstruct the gutter of any street but shall use
all proper measures to provide for the free passage of surface water.
   C.   The permittee shall make provisions to take care of all surplus water,
muck, silt, slicking or other runoff pumped from excavations or resulting from
sluicing or other operations and shall be responsible for any damage resulting
from its failure to so provide. (Ord. 751, 12-18-2000)
8-2-19: BREAKING THROUGH PAVEMENT:
Whenever it is necessary to break through existing pavement for excavation
purposes and where trenches are to be four feet (4') or over in depth, the
pavement in the base shall be removed to at least six inches (6") beyond the
outer limits of the subgrade that is to be disturbed in order to prevent
settlement, and a six inch (6") shoulder of undisturbed material shall be
provided in each side of the excavated trench. The face of the remaining
pavement shall be approximately vertical. A power driven concrete saw shall be
used so as to permit complete breakage of concrete pavement or base without
ragged edges. Asphalt paving shall be scored or otherwise cut in a straight
line. No pile driver may be used in breaking up the pavement. (Ord. 751, 12-18-
2000)
8-2-20: TUNNELS:
Tunnels under pavements shall not be permitted except by permission of the city
administrator or his designee. Where pipes or cables are placed under main
thoroughfares, concrete streets, state highways, first grade asphalt streets,
or wherever designated by the city administrator or his designee, such work
shall be done by jacking or boring casings under street surfaces and placing
said pipes or cables inside of the casing. (Ord. 751, 12-18-2000)
8-2-21: BACKFILLING; SURFACE RESTORATION:
   A.   Compacting:
      1.   Backfilling in any street opened or excavated pursuant to an
excavation permit issued hereunder shall be compacted to a degree equivalent to
that of the undisturbed ground in which the trench was dug. Compacting shall be
done by mechanical tappers or vibrators, by rolling in layers, or by water
settling, as required by the soil in question and sound engineering practices
generally recognized in the construction industry.
      2.   When water is taken from a hydrant, the permittee shall assign one
person to operate the hydrant and shall make certain that said person has been
instructed in the operation of the hydrant.
      3.   The city water department shall likewise be notified at both the
beginning and end of the job so that the condition of the fire hydrants can be
checked on both occasions. Any damage done to the hydrant during the excavation
shall be the responsibility of the permittee.
      4.   Water shall be paid for by the permittee on the terms agreed upon
with the city water department.
   B.   Water Settling:
      1.   When backfilling is to be done by water settling and before any
compacting of the trenches is attempted, the permittee shall cause the loose
material to be wetted by forcing a head of water of not less than thirty feet
(30') in height, down into the soft material so that the end of the pipe is not
more than three feet (3') above the bottom of the excavation. The permittee
shall allow the water to run until the material is saturated as indicated by
the water rising and running out on the surface of the ground around the pipe.
After each hole has been saturated, the jet pipe shall be moved along the
trench line a distance of approximately four (4) or five feet (5'), but in no
case more than eight feet (8'), and the process repeated for the entire length
of the backfill trench.
      2.   All work shall be done in such a manner as to obtain a relative
compaction throughout the entire depth of the backfill of not less than
existing adjacent to the excavation.
   C.   Dry Backfilling:
      1.   Backfilling up to the first eighteen inches (18") above the top of
the utility pipes or similar installations shall be done with thin layers. Each
layer is to be tamped by manual or mechanical means. Layers that are hand
tamped shall not exceed four inches (4") in thickness. Layers that are power
tamped shall not exceed six inches (6") in thickness. The same requirements
shall apply to the remainder of the backfilling if tamping is the method used
for backfilling. Backfilling of all pipes of over twenty four inches (24") in
diameter shall be carried up to the spring line of the pipe in three inch (3")
layers, with each layer moistened and thoroughly tamped with suitable
mechanical equipment. The backfill around all pipes twenty four inches (24") or
less in diameter shall be flooded or tamped as specified above to a depth of
eighteen inches (18") above the top of the pipe before any additional
backfilling is placed thereon.
      2.   Any deviation from the method set forth above shall have prior
written approval of the city administrator or his designee.
   D.   Backfill Material: Whenever any excavation for the laying of pipe is
made through rock, the pipe shall be laid six inches (6") above the rock bottom
of the trench and the space under, around and six inches (6") above the pipe
shall be backfilled with clean river sand, noncorrosive soil or one-fourth inch
(1/4") minus gravel. Broken pavement, large stones, and debris shall not be
used in the backfill.
   E.   Backfilling At Surface: Backfilling shall be completed by placing the
backfill material well up over the top of the trench. For dry backfilling, the
material shall be compacted with a roller of an approved type or with the rear
of a truck carrying at least five (5) tons until the surface is unyielding.
Care shall be taken that material being compacted has proper moisture content
for maximum compactibility. The surface shall then be graded as required.
   F.   Restoration Of Surface:
      1.   The permittee shall restore the surface of all streets, broken into
or damaged as a result of the excavation work, to its original condition in
accordance with the specifications of the city administrator or his designee.
The permittee may be required to place a temporary surface over openings made
in paved traffic lanes. Except when the pavement is to be replaced before the
opening of the cut to traffic, the fill above the bottom of the paving slab
shall be made with suitable material well tamped into place, and this fill
shall be topped with a minimum of at least one inch (1") of bituminous mixture
which is suitable to maintain the opening in good condition until permanent
restoration can be made. The crown of the temporary restoration shall not
exceed one inch (1") above the adjoining pavement. The permittee shall exercise
special care in making such temporary restorations and must maintain such
restorations in safe traveling condition until such time as permanent
restorations are made. The asphalt which is used shall be in accordance with
the specifications of the city administrator or his designee. If, in the
judgment of the city administrator or his designee, it is not expedient to
replace the pavement over any cut or excavation made in the street upon
completion of the work allowed under such permit by reason of the looseness of
the earth or weather conditions, the city administrator or his designee may
direct the permittee to lay a temporary pavement of wood or other suitable
material designated by him over such cut or excavation to remain until such
time as the repair of the original pavement may be properly made.
      2.   Permanent restoration of the street shall be made by the permittee
in strict accordance with the specifications prescribed by the city
administrator or his designee to restore the street to its original and proper
condition, or as near as may be.
      3.   Acceptance or approval of any excavation work by the city
administrator or his designee shall not prevent the city from asserting a claim
against the permittee and its surety under the surety bond required hereunder
for incomplete or defective work if discovered within twenty four (24) months
from the completion of the excavation work. The city administrator's or his
designee's presence during the performance of any excavation work shall not
relieve the permittee of its responsibilities hereunder.
   G.   City's Right To Restore Surface; Permittee Liable For Costs:

9-6-5: FOG CONTROL REQUIREMENTS - GENERAL:
All FSE’s and FM/P’s discharging wastewater to the city sewer system are
subject to the following requirements:
   A.   FOG Management Plan: All FSE’s and FM/P’s are required to submit a FOG
Management Plan for review and approval by the City. A FOG Management Plan
describes an FSE’s or FM/P’s operations and requires plans to control the
discharge of FOG from their facility into the City’s sewer system.
      1.   New Facilities: New FSE’s and FM/P’s shall submit their FOG
Management Plan either before submitting their Building Permit Application or
with their Building Permit Application.
      2.   Tenant Improvement (TI) Applicants: For a change in use, Tl’s shall
submit their FOG Management Plan with their TI Application. For a change in
owner, the Tl’s shall submit their FOG Management Plan within 24 months of the
date this Ordinance becomes effective.
      3.   Existing Facilities: Existing FSE’s and FM/P’s shall submit a FOG
Management Plan within 24 months of the date this Ordinance becomes effective.
   B.   FOG Management Plan Contents: The Waste Water Plant Operator will
provide printed forms for a Fog Management Plan indicating thereon the
information to be furnished by the User. The Waste Water Plant Operator shall
establish administrative guidelines and application forms necessary to
establish the following:
      1.   Type of Use
      2.   Contact Information for Users
      3.   Likely FOG impact
      4.   Proposed BMP’s and FOG Control Devices
   C.   Best Management Practices (BMP’s): An FSE or FM/P shall implement FOG
control requirements and BMP’s in their kitchen’s food production and
processing areas. Examples of BMPs include dry scraping of dishes and cooking-
ware and the installation of flat screens and/or baskets in the pre-rinse.
   D.   Food Grinders/Garbage Disposal Units: In-sink garbage disposal units
shall not be installed in any FSE or FM/P, as these can increase FOG and the
waste load in the City’s sewer system. The City discourages the continued use
of existing in-sink garbage disposal units, as these can increase FOG and the
waste load in the City’s sewer system. However, if used, garbage disposal units
must be connected to grease interceptors. Garbage disposal units shall not be
used for disposal of any materials (food scraps included) that can be disposed
of as solid waste. For purposes of this section, an in-sink garbage disposal
unit is any device designed to grind food and other waste material and
discharge such waste to the sewer system.
   E.   Grease interceptor requirements: All FSE’s and FM/P’s are required to
install, operate, and maintain an approved type and adequately sized grease
interceptor necessary to maintain compliance with the objectives of this
Ordinance, unless the City has determined that they are exempt by an approved
variance or conditional waiver. All grease interceptors must meet the
requirements of this Ordinance and the current edition of the Uniform Plumbing
Code (UPC).
   F.   Implementation: All new FSE’s and FM/P’s are subject to FOG Control
Requirements. Existing facilities proposing tenant improvements are subject to
FOG Control Requirements. All such facilities must submit a FOG Management Plan
that includes a grease interceptor which is sized in conformance with this
Ordinance, in order to obtain a building permit or tenant improvement permit.
All grease interceptors shall be readily accessible for cleaning and
inspection. All existing FSEs and FM/Ps, determined by the Waste Water Plant
Operator, to have a reasonable potential to discharge wastewater containing
more than 100mg/L FOG to the City’s sewer system shall be notified of the
obligation to install a grease interceptor. The required grease interceptor
shall be installed and operational within 36 months of the effective date of
this Ordinance.
   G.   Variance from the FOG Control Requirements
      1.   Variance from Grease Interceptor Requirements: An FSE or FM/P may
request that the Waste Water Plant Operator grant a variance from the grease
interceptor requirement to allow an alternative FOG control device in lieu of a
grease interceptor. The FSE or FM/P must demonstrate that the alternative
equals or exceeds the effectiveness of a grease interceptor or that it is
impossible or impracticable to install, operate or maintain a grease
interceptor and that the proposed alternative is sufficient to control FOG
discharge to less than 100 mg/L. In order to obtain a variance, an FSE or FM/
P shall demonstrate at least one of the following:
         a.   There is no adequate space for installation and/or maintenance of
a grease interceptor;
         b.   There is no adequate slope for gravity flow between kitchen
plumbing fixtures and the grease interceptor and/or between the grease
interceptor and the private sewer lines or the public sewer;
         c.   It is impossible or impracticable to install, operate and
maintain a grease interceptor;
         d.   The alternative FOG control device is equally or more effective
than a grease interceptor in controlling FOG discharge;
      And the FSE or FM/P shall demonstrate that:
         e.   After installation of the proposed alternative FOG control
device, the control device is effective in controlling FOG discharge through
downstream visual monitoring of the public sewer at the FSE’s or FM/P’s own
expense;
      The Waste Water Plant Operator’s determination will be based upon
evaluation that the FSE or FM/P meets the above conditions. The Waste Water
Plant Operator, at his/her discretion, may evaluate and require additional
conditions before granting a variance. Any variance issued pursuant to this
section may be revoked at any time at the discretion of the Waste Water Plant
Operator. Variances for consideration must be reviewed by a professional
engineer.
      2.   Conditional Waiver of Requirement to Install Grease Interceptor. The
Waste Water Plant Operator may grant a conditional waiver of the requirement to
install a grease interceptor to an FSE that the Waste Water Plant Operator
determines to have negligible FOG discharge and insignificant impact to the
public sewer system. Although the Waste Water Plant Operator may grant a waiver
from installation of a grease interceptor, the FSE may be required to provide
space and plumbing segregation for future installation of a grease interceptor.
The Waste Water Plant Operator’s determination to grant or revoke a conditional
waiver shall be based upon, but not limited to, evaluation of the following
conditions:
         a.   Quantity of FOG discharge as measured or indicated by the size of
the FSE based on water usage, menu, seating capacity, number of meals served,
amount of on-site consumption of prepared food, number of plumbing fixtures and
other conditions that may reasonably be shown to contribute to FOG discharges;
         b.   Adequacy of implementation of BMPs and compliance history;
         c.   Sewer size, grade, and condition based on visual and other
information, FOG deposition in the sewer by the FSE, and history of maintenance
and sewer overflows caused by FOG from the FSE;
         d.   Changes in operations that significantly affect FOG discharge;
and
         e.   Any other condition that the Waste Water Plant Operator deems
reasonably related to the generation of FOG discharges.
      3.   Application for Variance or Conditional Waiver of Requirement for
Grease Interceptor. An FSE or FM/P may submit to the City an application for a
conditional waiver or variance from the grease interceptor requirement. The FSE

cost of restoring the structure to its predamaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure either: a) before the improvement or repair is
started; or b) if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before
the damage occurred. Does not include either: 1) any project for improvement of
a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary,
or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living
conditions; or 2) any alteration of a structure listed on the national register
of historic places or a state inventory of historic places.

set forth in table 1-A of the 1997 Uniform Building Code as amended and the
building valuation data schedule as published in the most current "Building
Safety Journal" of the International Code Council and are on file for
inspection in the Building Department at the Long Beach City Hall. Values of
structures not listed in the schedule herein will be determined by a bid from a
licensed contractor. Permit fees for work other than new construction and
additions or not otherwise listed, including, but not limited to, alterations,
remodeling, mechanical permits and demolition, shall be established by
resolution of the City Council.
         a.   All valuations based on materials only without a labor cost
included will be doubled for the purpose of calculating permit fees.
         b.   For the purpose of calculating the building valuation, all decks
whether be covered or uncovered, will be valued at fifty percent (50%) of the
"U - utility/misc.", rounded up to the nearest one cent ($0.01). This is to
include all constructed walking or standing surfaces that result in a width of
four feet (4') and length of six feet (6'), that are not considered sidewalks,
or serving a garage as a driveway.

10-4-1: AUTHORIZATION, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:
   A.   Statutory Authorization: The legislature of the state of Washington has
delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations
designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizenry.
   B.   Findings Of Fact:
      1.   The flood hazard areas of Long Beach are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all which have the potential to adversely affect the public health, safety, and
general welfare.
      2.   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and
velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses
that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated, or otherwise protected from flood
damage also contribute to the flood loss.
   C.   Statement Of Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      1.   Protect human life and health;
      2.   Maximize benefit from expenditure of public money;
      3.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding;
      4.   Avoid or minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      5.   Avoid or minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure
located in areas of special flood hazard;
      6.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to avoid or minimize future
flood damage;
      7.   Ensure potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
      8.   Ensure those who occupy areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
   D.   Methods Of Reducing Flood Losses: In order to accomplish its purposes,
this chapter includes methods and provisions for:
      1.   Restricting or prohibiting uses that are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
      2.   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      3.   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
      4.   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and
      5.   Preventing or regulating construction of flood barriers that could
divert floodwaters from their natural course or may increase flood hazards in
other areas. (Ord. 847, 8-17-2009; amd. Ord. 1016, 6-5-2023)
10-4-2: INTERPRETATION:
In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:
   A.   Considered as minimum requirements;
   B.   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   C.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state
statutes. (Ord. 847, 8-17-2009; amd. Ord. 1016, 6-5-2023)
10-4-3: LANDS TO WHICH CHAPTER APPLIES:
This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the
jurisdiction of the city. (Ord. 847, 8-17-2009; amd. Ord. 1016, 6-5-2023)
10-4-4: BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD:
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the federal insurance
administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood
Insurance Study For Pacific County, Washington And Incorporated Cities" dated
May 18, 2015, and any revisions thereto, with an accompanying flood insurance
rate map (FIRM) dated May 18, 2015, and any revisions thereto, are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The flood
insurance study and the FIRM are on file at Long Beach City Hall, 115 Bolstad
West, Long Beach, Washington, and the FIRM can be viewed via the city's GIS
system found by following the GIS link at longbeachwa.gov. The best available
information for flood hazard area identification as outlined in subsection 10-
4-5B2 of this chapter shall be the basis for regulation until a new FIRM is
issued which incorporates the data utilized under subsection 10-4-5B2 of this
chapter. (Ord. 909, 4-20-2015; amd. Ord. 1016, 6-5-2023)
10-4-5: LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR:
   A.   Appointment: The city administrator is hereby appointed to administer
and implement this chapter by granting or denying development permit
applications in accordance with its provisions. The city administrator may
authorize a designee to implement this chapter or any portion thereof.

diminished.
   D.   Interpretation Of FIRM Boundaries: Make interpretations where needed,
as to exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard
(for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary
and actual field conditions). The person contesting the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in subsections
10-4-14A and B of this chapter. (Ord. 847, 8-17-2009; amd. Ord. 1016, 6-5-2023)
10-4-6: DEVELOPMENT PERMIT:
   A.   Permit Required: A development permit shall be obtained before
construction or development begins within any area of special flood hazard
established in section
10-4-4 of this chapter. The permit shall be for all structures including
"manufactured homes", as set forth in chapter 1 of this title, and for all
"development", including fill and other activities, also as set forth in the
definitions, section
10-1-1 of this title.
   B.   Application For Development Permit: Application for a development
permit shall be made on forms furnished by the city and shall include, and not
be limited to, the following: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the

Floodplain Administrator in order to review the application.
   D.   Changes To Special Flood Hazard Area: If a project will alter the BFE
or boundaries of the SFHA, then the project proponent shall provide the
community with engineering documentation and analysis regarding the proposed
change. If the change to the BFE or boundaries of the SFHA would normally
require a Letter of Map Change, then the project approval shall be conditioned
accordingly. (Ord. 847, 8-17-2009; amd. Ord. 1016, 6-5-2023)
10-4-7: GENERAL STANDARDS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION:
In all areas of special flood hazard, the following standards are required:
   A.   Anchoring:
      1.   All new construction and substantial improvements, including those
related to manufactured homes, shall be anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and
hydrostatic loads including the effects of buoyancy.
      2.   All manufactured homes must likewise be anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement, and shall be installed using methods
and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but
are not limited to, use of over the top or frame ties to ground anchors
(reference FEMA's "Manufactured Home Installation In Flood Hazard Areas"
guidebook for additional techniques).
   B.   Drainage: Adequate drainage paths are required around structures on
slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
   C.   Construction Materials And Methods:
      1.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
      2.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
      3.   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning
equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or otherwise
elevated or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within
the components during conditions of flooding.
   D.   Utilities:
      1.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
avoid or minimize infiltration of floodwaters into the systems;
      2.   Any proposed water well shall be located on high ground that is not
in the floodway 1;
      3.   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
avoid or minimize infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges
from the systems into floodwaters; and
      4.   On site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
of them or contamination from them during flooding.
   E.   Subdivision Proposals:
      1.   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
      2.   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage;
      3.   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood damage; and
      4.   Where base flood elevation data has not been provided or is not
available from another authoritative source, it shall be generated for
subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which contain at least
fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres (whichever is less).
   F.   Review Of Building Permits: Where elevation data is not available
either through the flood insurance study, FIRM, or from another authoritative
source (section
10-4-4 of this chapter), applications for building permits shall be reviewed to
assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The
test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data,
high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Failure
to elevate at least two feet (2') above the highest adjacent grade in these
zones may result in higher insurance rates.
   G.   Storage Of Materials And Equipment:
      1.   The storage or processing of materials that could be injurious to
human, animal, or plant life if released due to damage from flooding is
prohibited in special flood hazard areas. (Ord. 847, 8-17-2009; amd. Ord. 889,
4-13-2013; Ord. 1016, 6-5-2023)

subsection
10-4-5B3.
         d.   Any below grade crawl space must comply with subsections A2a and
A2f of this section.
         Applicants who are flood proofing nonresidential buildings shall be
notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot
below the flood proofed level (e.g. a building flood proofed to the base flood
level will be rated as one foot below). Flood proofing the building an
additional foot will reduce insurance premiums.
   C.   Manufactured Homes:
      1.   All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on
sites:
         a.   Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision,
         b.   In a new manufactured home park or subdivision,
         c.   In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision, or
         d.   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a
manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood;
   shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of
the manufactured home is elevated a minimum of one foot (1') above the base
flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately designed foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
      2.   Manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites
in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that are not subject to
the above manufactured home provisions shall be elevated so that either:
         a.   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated a minimum
of one foot (1') above the base flood elevation; or
         b.   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or
other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than
thirty six inches (36") in height above grade and are securely anchored to an
adequately designed foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and
lateral movement.
      3.   Any below grade crawl space must comply with subsections A2a and A2f
of this section.
   D.   Recreational Vehicles: Recreational vehicles placed on sites are
required to:
      1.   Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive
days; or
      2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or
jacking system, be attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities
and security devices, and have no permanently attached additions; or
      3.   Meet the requirements of subsection C of this section and the
elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes per subsection
10-4-7A2 of this chapter.
   E.   Enclosed Area Below the Lowest Floor: If buildings or manufactured
homes are constructed or substantially improved with fully enclosed areas below
the lowest floor, the areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles,
building access, or storage. (Ord. 847, 8-17-2009; amd. Ord. 909, 4-20-2015;
Ord. 1016, 6-5-2023)
10-4-9: REGULATORY FLOODWAY NOT DESIGNATED:
In areas where a regulatory floodway has not been designated, no new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill)
shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it
is demonstrated the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any
point within the community. (Ord. 847, 8-17-2009; amd. Ord. 1016, 6-5-2023)
10-4-10: AREAS DESIGNATED AS FLOODWAYS:
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section
10-4-4 of this chapter are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is
an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry
debris and potential projectiles, and which have erosion potential, the
following provisions apply:
   A.   Encroachments Prohibited: Encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, and other development are prohibited
unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance
with standard engineering practice that a proposed encroachment would not
result in any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge.
   B.   Construction Or Reconstruction Prohibited: Construction or
reconstruction of residential structures is prohibited within designated
floodways, except for: 1) repairs, reconstruction, or improvements to a
structure which do not increase the ground floor area; and 2) repairs,
reconstruction or improvements to a structure, the cost of which does not
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure either: a)
before the repair or reconstruction is started, or b) if the structure has been
damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred. Any project for
improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions or to structures identified as historic places
shall not be included in the fifty percent (50%).
   C.   Compliance With Certain Provisions: If subsection A of this section is
satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with
all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of sections
10-4-7 through
10-4-13 of this chapter. (Ord. 847, 8-17-2009; amd. Ord. 1016, 6-5-2023)
10-4-11: STANDARDS FOR SHALLOW FLOODING AREAS (AO ZONES):
Shallow flooding areas appear on FIRMs as AO zones with depth designations. The
base flood depths in these zones range from one to three feet (3') above ground
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, or where the path of flooding
is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
usually characterized as sheet flow. In these areas, the following provisions
apply:
   A.   Residential Structures And Manufactured Homes: New construction and
substantial improvements of residential structures and manufactured homes
within AO zones shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above
the highest adjacent grade to the structure a minimum of one foot (1') above
the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least 2 feet
above the highest adjacent grade to the structure if no depth number is
specified).
   B.   Nonresidential Structures: New construction and substantial
improvements of nonresidential structures within AO zones shall either:
      1.   Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade of the building site a minimum of one foot (1') or more
above the depth number specified on the FIRM (at least two feet (2') if no
depth number is specified); or
      2.   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be
completely floodproofed to or above the FIRM depth level so that any space
below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water and with structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. If this
method is used, compliance shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or architect as in subsection
10-4-8B3 of this chapter.
   C.   Drainage: Adequate drainage paths shall be placed around structures on
slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
   D.   Recreational Vehicles: Recreational vehicles placed on sites within AO
zones on the community's FIRM are required to:
      1.   Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive
days; and
      2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or
jacking system, be attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities
and security devices, and have no permanently attached additions; or
      3.   Meet the requirements of subsections A and C of this section and the
anchoring requirements for manufactured homes (subsection
10-4-7A2 of this chapter). (Ord. 847, 8-17-2009; amd. Ord. 1016, 6-5-2023)
10-4-12: COASTAL HIGH HAZARD AREAS:
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section
10-4-4 of this chapter are coastal high hazard areas, designated as zones V1-
30, VE and/or V. These areas have special flood hazards associated with high
velocity waters from surges and, therefore, in addition to meeting all
provisions in this chapter, the following provisions shall also apply:
   A.   Design And Method Of Construction:
      1.   All new construction and substantial improvements in zones V1-30 and
VE (V if base flood elevation data is available) on the community's FIRM shall
be elevated on pilings and columns so that:
         a.   The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the
lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated a minimum of one
foot (1') above the base flood level; and
         b.   The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is
anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement resulting from
wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Wind and
water loading values shall each have a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled
or exceeded in any given year (a 1 in 100 chance, based on the 100-year mean
recurrence interval as defined in chapter 1 of this title).
      2.   A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or
review the structural design, specifications and plans for construction, and
shall certify the design and methods of construction to be used are in
accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting provisions of
subsection A1 of this section.
   B.   Record Of Elevation: Obtain the elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the bottom of the lowest structural member of the lowest floor
(excluding pilings and columns) of each new and substantially improved
structure in zones V1-30, VE, and V on the community's FIRM, and ascertain
whether or not each structure contains a basement. The city administrator shall
maintain a record of all such information.
   C.   Location: All new construction within zones V1-30, VE, and V on the
community's FIRM shall be located landward of the reach of mean high tide.
   D.   Breakaway Walls:
      1.   All new construction and substantial improvements within zones V1-
30, VE, and V on the community's FIRM shall have the space below the lowest
floor either free of obstructions or constructed with non-supporting breakaway
walls, open wood lattice work, or insect screening intended to collapse under
wind and water loads without causing collapse, displacement, or other
structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting
foundation system. For the purposes of this section, a breakaway wall shall
have a design safe loading resistance of not less than ten (10) and no more
than twenty (20) pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which exceed a
design safe loading resistance of twenty (20) pounds per square foot (either by
design or when so required by local or state codes) may be permitted only if a
registered professional engineer or architect certifies the design as proposed
meets the following conditions:
         a.   Breakaway wall collapse shall result from water load less than
that which would occur during the base flood; and
         b.   The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation
system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural
damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all
building components (structural and nonstructural). Maximum wind and water
loading values to be used in this determination shall each have a one percent
(1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (a 1 in 100 chance,
based on the 100-year mean recurrence interval as defined in chapter 1 of this
title).
      2.   If breakaway walls are utilized, space enclosed or partially
enclosed by such walls shall be useable solely for parking of vehicles,
building access, or storage. Such space shall not be used for human habitation.
   E.   Fill Prohibited: Use of fill for structural support of buildings within
zones V1-30, VE, and V on the community's FIRM shall be prohibited.
   F.   Alteration Of Sand Dunes Prohibited: Manmade alteration of sand dunes
within zones V1-30, VE, and V on the community's FIRM which would increase
potential flood damage shall be prohibited.
   G.   Manufactured Homes: All manufactured homes to be placed or
substantially improved within zones V1-30, V, and VE on the community's FIRM on
sites located:
      1.   Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision;
      2.   In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;
      3.   In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision; or
      4.   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a
manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood;
shall meet standards of subsections A through F of this section. Manufactured
homes placed or substantially improved on other sites in an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision within zones V1-30, V, and VE on the FIRM
shall meet requirements of subsection
10-3-4 of this title.
   H.   Recreational Vehicles: RVs placed on sites within zones V1-30, V, and
VE on the community's FIRM are required to:
      1.   Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive
days; and
      2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or
jacking system, be attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities
and security devices, and have no permanently attached additions; or
      3.   Meet the requirements of subsection
10-4-7A2 of this chapter, and subsections A through F of this section. (Ord.
847, 8-17-2009; amd. Ord. 1016, 6-5-2023)
10-4-13: CONSTRUCTION OF NEW CRITICAL FACILITIES:
   A.   Location: Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the
extent feasible, located outside the limits of the special flood hazard area
(SFHA) (100-year floodplain).
   B.   Site: Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible
within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available.
   C.   Lowest Floor Elevation: Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA
shall have the lowest floor elevated a minimum three feet (3') above the base
flood level or to the height of the 500-year flood, whichever is higher. Access
to and from the critical facility should also be protected to the height
utilized above.
   D.   Floodproofing And Sealing: Floodproofing and sealing measures must be
taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into
floodwaters.
   E.   Access Routes: Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base
flood elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent
possible. (Ord. 847, 8-17-2009; amd. Ord. 1016, 6-5-2023)
10-4-14: APPEALS AND VARIANCES:
The hearing examiner shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances
from the requirements of this chapter.
   A.   Consideration Of Appeals And Variances: In passing upon such
applications, the hearing examiner shall consider all technical evaluations,
all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter;
and:
      1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to

and emergency vehicles;
      10.   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
      11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.
   B.   Appeals:
      1.   The hearing examiner shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made
by the local administrator in the enforcement or administration of this
chapter.
      2.   Those aggrieved by the decision of the local administrator may
appeal such decision to the hearing examiner as provided in section
11-2C-14 of this code.
   C.   Variances:
      1.   The hearing examiner shall have the authority to grant a variance
from provisions of this chapter when conditions as set forth in this section
have been found to exist; provided, that any variance granted shall be subject
to conditions that will assure that adjustment thereby authorized shall not
constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with limitations upon
other property in the vicinity and zone in which the subject property is
situated. Variances shall be considered according to the procedures set forth
in section
11-2D-1 of this code, except the required showings shall be as set forth in
subsection C6 of this section.
      2.   Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the
elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, provided items in subsection A of this section have been
fully considered. As the lot size increases, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
      3.   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in this section.
      4.   Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      5.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination a variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      6.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         a.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      7.   Upon consideration of the factors of this section and the purposes
of this chapter, the hearing examiner may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as the examiner deems necessary to further the purposes
of this chapter.
      8.   Variances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are
based on the general zoning law principle that: they pertain to a physical
piece of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the
structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances; and they
primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As
such, variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare.
      9.   Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited
circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry
floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage
potential, complies with all other variance criteria except subsection C2 of
this section, and otherwise complies with subsections
10-4-7A, C, and D of this chapter.
      10.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   D.   Procedure For Approval Of Variance:
      1.   Application: A request for a variance may be initiated by a property
owner or his/her authorized agent by filing an application with the city on
forms prescribed by the city. The application shall be accompanied by a site
plan, drawn to scale, showing the dimensions and arrangement of the proposed
development and its relationship to the surrounding property, a survey
including the property boundaries and topography, and a written narrative
describing the relief that is requested and a statement of how the applicant
believes the standards of this section are met. Each application shall be
accompanied by a receipt indicating payment of fees, as established by the city
council.
      2.   Notice Of Application: Notice of application shall be provided as
set forth in section
11-2C-9 of this code.
      3.   Public Hearing: Before a request for a variance is acted upon, it
shall be considered at a public hearing.
      4.   Notice Of Public Hearing: Notice of public hearing shall be provided
as set forth in subsection
11-2C-11D of this code.
      5.   Recess Of Hearing: The hearing examiner may recess a hearing
regarding a request for a variance in order to obtain additional information.
Upon recessing for this purpose, the hearing examiner shall announce the time
and date when the hearing will be resumed.
      6.   Final Action:
         a.   The hearing examiner shall cause written notification of his
action to be mailed to the applicant for a variance within ten (10) days after
the decision has been rendered.
         b.   The local administrator shall maintain the records of all actions
and report any variances to the federal insurance administration upon request.
         c.   The applicant or any other aggrieved party with standing in the
matter may appeal the decision of the hearing examiner to city council in
accordance with the provisions of section
11-2C-14 of this code. (Ord. 847, 8-17-2009; amd. Ord. 1016, 6-5-2023)
10-4-15: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and
another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 847, 8-
17-2009; amd. Ord. 1016, 6-5-2023)
10-4-16: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee
thereof, or the federal insurance administration, for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made hereunder. (Ord. 847, 8-17-2009; amd. Ord. 1016, 6-5-2023)
10-4-17: VIOLATIONS; INVESTIGATION:
All development within special flood hazard areas is subject to the terms of
this ordinance and other applicable regulations.
The city administrator or his authorized agent shall investigate any charge of
violation of this title brought to the city administrator's attention. Upon
verifying a violation of this title, the city administrator shall serve notice
to the property owner to comply with city building regulations. The city
administrator or his authorized agent shall inspect the premises after serving
notice of violation and, if the violation is still in effect, may take any
action authorized as described below. (Ord. 847, 8-17-2009; amd. Ord. 887a, 2-
4-2013; Ord. 1016, 6-5-2023)

No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this ordinance
and other applicable regulations. Violations of the provisions of this
ordinance by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including
violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with
conditions), shall constitute a fine. Any person who violates this ordinance or
fails to comply with any of its requirements shall thereof be fined not more
than $10,000 for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and
expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city
from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation. (Ord. 847, 8-17-2009; amd. Ord. 887a, 2-4-2013; Ord. 1016, 6-5-2023)
10-4-19: SEVERABILITY:
This chapter and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable.
Should any section of this chapter be declared by the courts to be

Code of Washington chapter 35A; the growth management act, Revised Code of
Washington chapter 36.70A, generally; and Revised Code of Washington 36.70A.070
specifically.
   B.   Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter:
      1.   To ensure adequate levels of service on transportation facilities
for existing land uses as well as new development;
      2.   To provide transportation facilities that achieve and maintain the
city's level of service standards as established in the city comprehensive
plan; and
      3.   To ensure that the city's level of service standards are achieved
concurrently with development as required by the growth management act. (Ord.
847, 8-17-2009)
10-5-2: FINDINGS OF CONCURRENCY:
   A.   Determination Of Necessity; Financial Commitments: Prior to approving
proposed subdivisions, dedications, short plats, short subdivisions, planned
residential developments, or binding site plans, the reviewing authority shall
make written findings that public facilities which will be needed as a result
of the new development, such as streets, roads and other public ways, will be
provided concurrent with development. For all other development applications
listed herein, the concurrency finding shall be made prior to the issuance of
the building permit. The concurrency requirement is satisfied if the
improvements are in place at the time the impacts of development occur, or if
the necessary financial commitments are in place. Such financial commitments
shall include, and are not limited to, impact fees anticipated to be generated
by the development to complete improvements required to meet specified
standards of service designed in the transportation study within six (6) years
of the time of building permit issuance. Any combination of the following shall
constitute "necessary financial commitments" for the purposes of this chapter:
      1.   The city has received voter approval of and/or has bonding
authority;
      2.   The city has received approval for federal, state or other funds;
      3.   The city has received a secured commitment from a fee payer ensuring
the payer will construct the needed improvement(s) or facility and the city has
found such improvement(s) or facility to be acceptable and consistent with its
capital facilities plan; and/or
      4.   The city has other assured funding, including, and not limited to,
impact fees that have been paid.
   B.   Compliance With Statutes; Time Of Making Findings:
      1.   Compliance with this concurrency requirement shall be sufficient to
satisfy the provisions of Revised Code of Washington 58.17.060 and 58.17.110,
and the act 1 .
      2.   The finding of concurrency shall be made at the time of preliminary
plans or planned residential development (PRD) approval or at the time of
binding site plan approval.
      3.   For all other development applications, the finding shall be made at
the time of building permit issuance.
   C.   Application Approval: The city shall not approve applications for
preliminary plats, PRDs or binding site plans unless the city is able to make a
finding of concurrency; provided, that, if the fee payer opts to dedicate land,
to provide improvements, and/or construction consistent with the requirements
of section
10-5-4 of this chapter governing credits, where appropriate, the city can make
a finding of concurrency.
   D.   Term Of Validity:
      1.   A finding of concurrency provided to the applicant at the time of
preliminary plat or PRD approval, or at the time of binding site plan approval,
shall be valid for a period of three (3) years from the date concurrency is
issued.
      2.   If, pursuant to law, an applicant requests an extension of the three
(3) year period between the date of preliminary and final plat or PRD approval,
the applicant shall be subject to a new concurrency determination prior to the
granting of a request for an extension.
   E.   Exemption; City Options:
      1.   If any party for any reason is able to exempt itself from the
operation of this chapter, the city reserves the right to review its land use
plan in conjunction with its capital facilities plan in order to ensure
concurrency.
      2.   In the event that the impact fees that might have been paid would
have been an integral part of the financing to ensure concurrency, the city
reserves the right to deny approval for the development on these grounds. (Ord.
847, 8-17-2009)

10-5-3: LEVEL OF SERVICE STANDARDS:
   A.   Comprehensive Plan Controls: The following level of service (LOS)
standards, established in the city comprehensive plan, are hereby adopted for
the purposes of this chapter. If a conflict arises between a LOS standard
identified in this chapter and a standard identified in the comprehensive plan,
the LOS standard in the comprehensive plan shall control.
The Southwest Washington regional transportation planning organization (RTPO)
adopted the following LOS standards based on the 1985 highway capacity manual
for the region:
C - Roads in rural areas
   D - Within the city limits
   B.   City And City Area Arterials And Collectors: LOS standards are applied
to the city's arterials and collectors as follows:

(Ord. 847, 8-17-2009)
10-5-4: CONCURRENCY TEST:
   A.   Except as provided for in subsection 10-5-5A of this chapter, the test
for concurrency shall be conducted as a part of the building permit
application.
   B.   The city may conduct an alternative concurrency test for the
applications identified in subsection 10-5-5B of this chapter and through the
process set forth in that subsection.
   C.   The test for concurrency shall be conducted in the order in which the
completed building permit application is received.
   D.   The concurrency test shall be performed only for the specific property
use(s), residential density(ies) and intensity(ies) of the use(s) described on
the building permit application. The applicant shall describe the proposed
development in a manner adequate for the city to determine the peak hour
traffic which is likely to be generated by the proposed development. The
applicant shall also provide to the city a legal description of the property.
Revisions to the proposed development that may create additional impacts on
transportation facilities shall be required to undergo an additional
concurrency test.
   E.   In conducting the concurrency test, the city shall use the trip
generation tables set forth in the latest edition of the "Institute Of
Transportation Engineers" (ITE), information report - trip generation. The
presumption is that rates used by the city are accurate unless proven
otherwise.
   F.   If the applicant pays the fees identified in section
10-5-7 of this chapter, the applicant may submit a calculation of alternative
trip generation rates for the proposed development. The city shall review the
alternate calculations and indicate in writing whether such calculations are
acceptable in lieu of standard ITE trip generation rates.
   G.   The city may adjust the trip generation forecast of the proposed
development in order to account for any transportation strategies proposed by
the applicant and acceptable to the city.
   H.   The city shall not make a finding of concurrency as a part of the
issuance of a building permit if the proposed development will result in
transportation facilities declining below adopted LOS standards. If the LOS of
the transportation facilities meets or exceeds the adopted LOS standards, the
concurrency test is passed, and the city shall make a finding of concurrency.
(Ord. 847, 8-17-2009)
10-5-5: EXEMPTIONS FROM CONCURRENCY TEST:
   A.   The following applications for a building permit shall be exempt from
the concurrency test. This exemption from the concurrency test does not exempt
the applicant from other applicable development code requirements:
      1.   Any proposed development that creates no additional impacts on any
transportation facility;
      2.   Any project that is a component of another proposed development and
that was included in a prior application for a finding of concurrency;
      3.   Any renewal of a previously issued but unexpired permit;
      4.   Any application for a residential building permit if the dwelling
unit is a part of a subdivision or short plat that submitted an application
after 1990 and that has undergone the analysis mandated by the state
subdivision act, Revised Code of Washington 58.17.060 or 58.17.110; and
   B.   The following applications for a building permit must be accompanied by
a traffic impact analysis study prepared by the applicant:
      1.   Development that generates fifty (50) or more vehicle trips in the
peak direction of the peak hour on the adjacent streets and intersections; or
      2.   Development that generates twenty five percent (25%) or more of peak
hour traffic through a signalized intersection or the critical movement at an
unsignalized intersection.
A traffic impact report prepared for preliminary development approval or to
supplement an environmental checklist may be substituted for the traffic impact
analysis. Such traffic impact report must conform with guidelines referred to
in this section, must be prepared no earlier than two (2) years before
submitted, and must include an analysis of a traffic generation level not less
than ninety percent (90%) of that to be generated by the proposed development.
(Ord. 847, 8-17-2009)
10-5-6: BUILDING PERMITS; FINDING OF CONCURRENCY:
   A.   The city shall make a finding of concurrency for each building permit
application that passes the concurrency test.
   B.   The finding of concurrency shall be valid for the same time period as
the underlying building permit, including any extensions thereof.
   C.   A finding of concurrency shall expire or be revoked if the underlying
building permit expires or is revoked by the city.
   D.   A finding of concurrency accompanying a building permit for a
particular parcel of property may be used by the heirs, executors, successors,
or assigns of the original applicant.
   E.   All building permits that require one or more transportation facilities
to be provided by the applicant shall be and are hereby conditioned upon an
appropriate financial commitment by the applicant which is binding upon
subsequent owners, heirs, executors, successors, or assigns, and upon the
completion of such transportation facilities in a timely manner, prior to the
issuance of the certificate of occupancy or prior to occupancy, unless stated
otherwise in writing by the city. (Ord. 847, 8-17-2009)
10-5-7: FEES:
If the applicant requests an alternative calculation for the concurrency test,
or if the city determines that an alternative calculation is required due to
the size, scale, or other unusual characteristics of the proposed development,
a fee for the alternative calculation shall be paid by the applicant prior to
the initiation of review. The fee for conducting the review of the alternative
calculation shall be two hundred dollars ($200.00), unless otherwise
established by the city administrator. (Ord. 847, 8-17-2009)
10-5-8: CONCURRENCY SYSTEM:
   A.   The city will provide, or arrange for others to provide, adequate
transportation facilities by constructing needed transportation facilities and
implementing transportation strategies within the six (6) year horizon line
that:
      1.   Eliminate LOS deficiencies for existing uses;
      2.   Achieve LOS standards for anticipated future development and
redevelopment resulting from previously issued building permits; and
      3.   Maintain existing facilities and repair or replace obsolete or worn
out facilities.
Improvements to transportation facilities and transportation strategies shall
be consistent with the city comprehensive plan.
   B.   The city shall allocate sufficient funds during the appropriate fiscal
year to meet the financial commitment for all transportation facilities
required to meet LOS standards, except the city may omit from its budget any
capital improvements for which a binding agreement has been executed with
another party. (Ord. 847, 8-17-2009)
10-5-9: MONITORING TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM:
The city shall, on an annual basis, review and update its capital facilities
plan and transportation element and shall identify those facilities necessary
to achieve transportation concurrency. At a minimum, this review will include
updates, as needed, to the city's traffic model, a comparison of actual and
forecast traffic volumes, and an examination of conformances with the adopted
level of service standards. In addition to annual reviews, emergency review of
the concurrency management system shall be conducted whenever traffic analysis
reveals that fifty percent (50%) of the projected six (6) year capacity of any
transportation facility or concurrency district has been assigned in any one
year. (Ord. 847, 8-17-2009)
10-5-10: INTERGOVERNMENTAL COORDINATION:
   A.   The city may enter into agreements with other local governments,
transit districts, and the state of Washington to coordinate imposition of LOS
standards, collection of impact fees, and implementation of transportation
strategies.
   B.   The city may apply LOS standards, fees, and other mitigation measures
to developments in the city that impact other local governments and the state
of Washington. Development permits issued by the city may include conditions
and mitigation measures to be imposed on behalf of and implemented by other
local governments and the state of Washington.
   C.   The city may receive impact fees or other mitigation payments based on
or as a result of development proposed in other jurisdictions that impact the
city. The city may agree to accept such payments or may coordinate with other
jurisdictions to implement the appropriate mitigation measures. (Ord. 847, 8-
17-2009)
10-5-11: APPEALS:
   A.   Any applicant or any other aggrieved party withstanding in the matter
may appeal the approval or the denial of a finding of concurrency pursuant to
the procedures and requirements of section
11-2C-14 of this code, and by paying the applicable appeals fee.
   B.   The appeal on a finding of nonconcurrency will not be conducted if the
applicant refuses to pay the transportation impact fees required by the city
unified development code. However, such appeal shall be conducted if the full
fees owing are paid under protest. (Ord. 847, 8-17-2009)

10-6-1: FINDINGS:
It is found that there exist in the City of Long Beach, dwellings and other
buildings, structures, and premises that are unfit for human habitation and
that are unfit for other uses due to dilapidation; disrepair; structural
defects; defects increasing the hazards of fire, accidents, or other
calamities; inadequate drainage; overcrowding; or other conditions contrary to
the health and welfare of the City's residents. It is the intent of this
chapter to incorporate the provisions of chapter 35.80 Revised Code of
Washington to clarify and strengthen the City's procedures for abating such
unsafe or unfit dwellings, buildings, structures, or premises. (Ord. 927, 3-7-
2016)
10-6-2: DESIGNATION OF AUTHORITY:
   A.   The Community Development Director, or his or her designee, shall have
the full scope of authority granted to the public officer under chapter 35.80
Revised Code of Washington and this chapter.
   B.   The hearing examiner is designated as the City's Appeals Commission and
shall have the full scope of authority granted to that commission under chapter
35.80 Revised Code of Washington. (Ord. 927, 3-7-2016)
10-6-3: DECLARING A BUILDING OR PREMISES UNFIT FOR HUMAN HABITATION OR OTHER
USE:
   A.   The Community Development Director or designee has the authority to
determine that a dwelling, building, structure, or premises or portions thereof
is unfit for human habitation or other use if the Community Development
Director finds that conditions exist that are potentially dangerous or
injurious to the health or safety of the occupants, the occupants of
neighboring dwellings or structures, or other residents of the City of Long
Beach.
   B.   A dwelling, building, structure, or premises or portions thereof is
potentially dangerous or injurious when one or more of the following conditions
exist:
      1.   It is vacant for an extended period, generally in excess of six (6)
months, and persistently or repeatedly becomes unprotected or unsecured;
      2.   It has conditions that pose a hazard or attractive nuisance, such
as, but not limited to, sinkholes; exposed underground vaults, pipes, or wires;
trenches; unstable slopes; or hazardous materials;
      3.   It is currently or frequently occupied by unauthorized persons for
illegal purposes;
      4.   The owner or occupant(s) of the structure has not provided minimum
safeguards to protect or warn occupants in the event of fire;
      5.   It contains unsafe equipment, as determined by the Community
Development Director or designee;
      6.   It has inadequate drainage, severe uncleanliness, overcrowding, or
inadequate ventilation, light, or sanitary facilities; or
      7.   It is so damaged, decayed, dilapidated, structurally unsafe, or of
such faulty construction or unstable foundation that it presents a danger of
structural collapse or a hazard of fire or accident. (Ord. 927, 3-7-2016)
10-6-4: PROCEDURE TO ABATE UNSAFE OR UNFIT STRUCTURES OR PREMISES:
   A.   The Community Development Director or designee shall have the power to
investigate property conditions in the City and to enter upon premises, with
consent of the occupant, for the purpose of making examinations when the
Community Development Director or designee has reasonable grounds for believing
a dwelling, building, structure, or premises are unfit for human habitation or
for other use; provided, that such entries shall be made in such manner as to
cause the least possible inconvenience to the persons in possession. In the
event that entry is denied or resisted, the Community Development Director or
designee has the power to seek an order from a court of competent jurisdiction
that authorizes entry, as provided in Revised Code of Washington 35.80.030(3).
   B.   Upon making a determination that a dwelling, building, structure, or
premises is unfit, the Community Development Director or designee shall, as
outlined in Revised Code of Washington 35.80.030(1)(c), serve the complaint and
set a hearing to be held before the Community Development Director at a
specified time and place, between ten (10) and thirty (30) days of service of
the complaint. A copy of the complaint shall also be filed with the Pacific
County auditor.
   C.   All persons having any interest in the subject property shall have the
right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by
representative and give testimony at the time and place fixed in the complaint.
At the hearing, the Community Development Director shall have the authority to
administer oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses, and receive evidence. The
rules of evidence shall not apply in hearings before the Community Development
Director.

other expenses incurred for inspecting, conducting hearing, or otherwise
determining the status of the property.
   D.   In accordance with Revised Code of Washington 35.80.030(1)(h), the cost
of abatement by the City shall be assessed against the real property upon which
such cost was incurred, which assessment the County Treasurer shall enter upon
the tax rolls against the property for the current year and to become a part of
the general taxes for that year to be collected at the same time and with
interest at such rates and in such manner as is provided in Revised Code of
Washington 84.56.020 for delinquent taxes, and when collected to be deposited

design, type, and quality as determined by the Long Beach building inspector,
it shall be demolished.
   D.   If the dangerous or unfit dwelling, building, structure, or premises is
or presents a fire hazard as determined by the Long Beach building inspector,

   A.   This section applies in the context of building permit applications 1 ,
short subdivision and subdivision applications 2 , and development agreements 3
.
   B.   An application described herein utilizing vested rights shall be
subject to all land use and development statutes, regulations, and ordinances
in effect on the vesting date.
   C.   Applications shall be considered vested on the date a written
determination of completeness is mailed (postmarked) or hand delivered to the
applicant or the applicant's designee. The community development director's
issuance of a written determination of completeness pursuant to section
11-2C-8 of this title, or the failure of the community development director to
provide such a written notice within twenty eight (28) days of the date it is
mailed or hand delivered, shall cause an application to be conclusively deemed
vested. The applicable date is known as the vesting date.
   D.   Supplemental information required after vesting of a complete
application shall not affect the validity of vesting for such application
unless the information is requested because incorrect information is submitted
by the applicant and the incorrect information would materially affect the
final decision on the application.
   E.   Modifications required by the community development director to a
pending application, other than those set forth in subsection D of this
section, shall not be deemed a new application and shall not affect vesting.
   F.   An applicant requested modification occurring either before or after
issuance of the permit shall eliminate vesting, when such modification would
result in a substantial change in a project's review requirements, as
determined by the community development director. Under such a condition, the
application will be deemed a new application. Examples of a substantial change
include modifications resulting in a different type of decision (e.g.,
administrative to hearing examiner), or a change requiring a new SEPA threshold
determination. Modifications that reduce the scope of a proposal or reduce
environmental impacts would not be considered a substantial change.
   G.   An application that is deemed complete is vested for the specific use,
density, and physical development that is identified in the application
submittal.
   H.   Building permits that may subsequently be required to construct or
complete a vested land use project shall be considered new applications under
the building code and shall be subject to the edition of the building code in
place at the time application is made.
   I.   Nothing herein shall restrict the community development director's
authority to impose conditions on project permits pursuant to the state
environmental policy act (SEPA), chapter 43.21C Revised Code Of Washington and
chapter 197-11 Washington administrative code.
   J.   Nothing herein shall be construed to restrict the community development
director's ability, to the extent otherwise permitted by law, to apply new
regulations to a project permit or project permit application upon a finding
that a change in conditions creates a serious threat to the public health and
safety.
   K.   If the application expires, a new application may be filed with the
city but will not be considered vested under the expired application and
instead shall be subject to the development regulations in effect on the date
of the new application. (Ord. 919, 8-3-2015)

      1.   To the extent practicable, all development shall conform to the
natural contours of the land and natural and preexisting human made
drainageways must remain undisturbed.
      2.   To the extent practicable, lot boundaries shall be made to coincide
with natural and preexisting human made drainageways within subdivisions to
avoid the creation of lots that can be built upon only by altering such
drainageways.
   B.   Proper Drainage Required:
      1.   All developments must be provided with a drainage system that is
adequate to prevent undue detention or retention of surface water on the
development site. Surface water will not be regarded as unduly detained or
retained if:
         a.   The detention or retention results from a technique, practice or
device deliberately installed as part of an approved sedimentation or
stormwater runoff control plan; or
         b.   The detention or retention is not substantially different in
location or degree than that experienced by the development site in its
predevelopment state, unless such detention or retention presents a danger to
health or safety.
      2.   No surface water may be channeled or directed into a sanitary sewer.
      3.   To the extent practicable, the drainage system of a development must
coordinate with and connect to drainage systems or drainageways on surrounding
properties or streets.
      4.   Construction specifications for drainage swales are contained in
"Development Guidelines And Public Works Standards".
   C.   Stormwater Management: All developments must be constructed and
maintained so that adjacent properties are not unreasonably burdened with
surface waters as a result of such developments.
   D.   Sedimentation And Erosion Control: No permit shall be issued nor final
plat of a subdivision approved for any development that would cause land
disturbing activity unless the community development director has certified to
the city that an erosion control plan has been submitted to and approved by the
city administrator.
   E.   Stormwater System Design:
      1.   Storm sewers constructed within the street will be sized by the
developer's engineer and will consider all potential runoff requirements within
the site and upstream of the site. The storm sewer will be designed for a 100-
year mean recurrence interval. Spacing of catch basins along the street must
conform to published engineering recommendations, which consider profile and
width of the street.
      2.   On site detention may be required for new development where
downstream deficiencies exist or are anticipated to exist in the next five (5)
years. Recommended design criteria for a commercial or residential storm
drainage detention facility is a 10-year mean recurrence interval.
      3.   Erosion control and water quality control facilities for a project
that disturb over five (5) acres must apply to the state department of ecology
for an NPDES permit. Erosion control practices (e.g., straw bales, wattles,
etc.) are required for all plats and all projects that have site plan review.
Erosion control practices may include straw bales, hydroseeding, etc.
      4.   Low impact development techniques that will control drainage and
reduce runoff to public stormwater facilities are encouraged.
   F.   Illegal Discharge Of Materials Into Stormwater System: The discharge of
any material other than clean stormwater into the stormwater system is
prohibited and is a public nuisance pursuant to title 5, chapter 2 of this

government meander line that would alter topography or the amount of impervious
cover; or
         c.   Any project where impervious cover exceeds forty percent (40%) of
a lot, including incremental additions or alterations.
      2.   Additional Information: Any drainage plan submitted shall be
supplemented with additional information at the request of the city.
      3.   Drainage Plan May Be Waived: Submission of a drainage plan may be
waived by the city or its designated representative when the applicant is able
to show proof that the runoff/drainage:
         a.   Will not seriously and adversely impact water quality conditions
of any affected receiving bodies of water; or
         b.   Will not alter drainage patterns, increase peak discharge, or
cause any other adverse effects in the drainage area.
      4.   Contents Of A Drainage Plan:
         a.   Background information shall be provided and proposed
improvements for handling future runoff shall be described in as much detail as
is required to make the drainage plan understandable and usable.
         b.   At a minimum, the following background information shall be
required:
            (1)   Depiction of the drainage area on a topographical map, with
acreage indicated;
            (2)   The peak discharge and amount of surface water currently
entering and leaving the subject property;
            (3)   The peak discharge and amount of runoff which will be
generated within the subject property if development as proposed is allowed to
proceed.
      5.   Computation Of Stormwater Runoff: The computation of stormwater
runoff from any property shall be determined by one of the following two (2)
methods:
         a.   Rational method, where Q = CIA.
 
Q = Peak runoff rate in cubic feet per second.
    Runoff coefficient which is the ratio of the maximum rate of runoff per
C = unit area to the average rate of rainfall over the duration of the design
    storm.
I = Average rainfall intensity for the duration of the design storm, expressed
    in inches per hour.
A = Drainage area in acres, including all of the tributary area above the point
    of interest.
 
         b.   Soil conservation service (SCS) curve number method, a
description of which is found in the "SCS National Engineering Handbook"
section 4, hydrology, August 1972.
      6.   Mandatory Requirements For All Drainage Plans And Improvements:
         a.   Surface water entering the subject property shall be received at
the naturally occurring location and surface water exiting the subject property
shall be discharged at the natural location with no diversion at any of these
points.
         b.   The peak discharge from the subject property may not be increased
due to the proposed development.
         c.   Detention facilities must be provided in order to handle all
surface water in excess of the peak discharge.
         d.   Where open channel construction is used to handle drainage within
the property, a minimum of fifteen feet (15') will be provided between any
structures and the top of the bank of the defined channel.
            (1)   In open channel work the water surface elevation shall be
indicated on the plan and profile drawings. The configuration of the finished
grades constituting the banks of the open channel shall also be shown on the
drawings.
            (2)   Proposed cross section of the channel will be shown with
stable side slopes with a maximum slope of two to one (2:1) unless paved.
            (3)   The water surface elevation of the design flow will be
indicated on the cross section.
         e.   Where a closed system is used to handle drainage within the
property, all structures will be a minimum of ten feet (10') from the closed
system.
         f.   Administrative variances from any or all of the foregoing
requirements may be permitted only after a determination by the city, employing
the following criteria:
            (1)   Capacity of downstream facilities;
            (2)   Acceptability of receiving bodies of water;
            (3)   Possibility of adverse effect of detention; and
            (4)   Capability of maintaining the system. (Ord. 890, 4-13-2013)

12-10-1: DESIGN REVIEW CONCEPT:
Pursuant to the goals set forth in the comprehensive plan, a system of design
review shall be established and implemented in accordance with the design
review guidelines hereafter set forth. The following quotation from Justice
Douglas in rendering the opinion of the court concerning the case of Berman v.
Parker, 348.U.S. 26 (1954), captures the spirit and intent of this chapter:
The concept of the public welfare is broad and inclusive. The value it
represents is spiritual as well as physical, aesthetic as well as monetary. It
is well within the power of the legislature to determine that a community
should be beautiful as well as healthy, spacious as well as clean, well
balanced as well as carefully controlled.
(Ord. 849, 8-17-2009)
12-10-2: SCOPE:
   A.   Activities Subject To Design Review: The city shall review all
development subject to design review. For purposes of this chapter,
"development" means any improvement to real property open to exterior view,
including, but not limited to, buildings, structures, fixtures, landscaping,
site screening, fencing, murals, signs, parking lots, lighting, pedestrian
facilities, street furniture, use of open areas (including parks and
recreational facilities), and mobile home and recreational vehicle parks,
whether all or any are publicly or privately sponsored. "Development" also
includes new construction, additions, and any or all exterior remodeling to
existing structures. "Development" does not include underground utilities,
improvements within rights of way, or alterations to buildings that are
exclusively interior. (Ord. 870, 4-4-2011)
   B.   Activities Exempt From Design Review: The following activities shall be
exempt from the requirements of design review:
      1.   Normal maintenance and repair shall be exempt from the requirements
of design review, where there is no change to the exterior appearance of the
structure.
      2.   The replacement of fifty percent (50%) or less of a nonconforming
siding material on any single facade shall be considered maintenance. The
replacement of more than fifty percent (50%) of the exterior siding material on
a single facade shall be considered an alteration and shall comply with the
requirements of this chapter including article A of this chapter.
      3.   Minor adjustments to dimensions such as railing height or stairs,
where necessary to comply with the building code, shall be considered
maintenance, provided the design of the replacement feature is otherwise
identical to the feature being repaired, and the change is no more than
necessary to correct the deficiency.
      4.   In zones R1, R1R, R2, R2R, R3, R3R, S1 and S2 one accessory building
with a gross floor area of one hundred twenty (120) square feet or less may be
placed on a lot without meeting the requirements of this chapter, including
article A of this chapter, provided the structure is placed in the rear of the
lot behind the principal building. Additional accessory buildings located in
these residential zones, regardless of size and location, shall be subject to
all requirements of this chapter. This exemption does not apply to accessory
structures located in zones OT, OTW, RC, AC, C1, C2, L1, S3, S3R, S3M, P, PR,
or S4. (Ord. 912, 8-3-2015)
12-10-3: DESIGN APPROVAL REQUIRED:
   A.   Design Review Required: Design review is required for all development
in the R1R, R2R, R3R, OT, OTW, RC, AC, C1, C2, S1, S2, S3, S3R, S3M, P, PR and
S4 zones. Design review is also required for all development other than
permitted and accessory uses in the R1, R2 and R3 zones. Design review is
required for conditional uses in the L1 zone. No building permit shall be
issued for any development, redevelopment or construction requiring design
review until design approval has been granted.
   B.   Compliance With Approved Design: Development shall be completed in
exact accordance with the design approved by the city. If, after such approval,
a developer wishes to make revisions to the approved plans, those amendments
shall be brought before the city for approval prior to construction. Minor
revisions may be approved by the city administrator, provided such changes are
consistent with the original approval, comply with all design guidelines, and
do not exceed ten percent (10%) of the square footage of the project, according
to the procedures set forth in section
12-10-5 of this chapter. All other revisions shall be considered pursuant to
the same procedure under which the original approval was granted.
   C.   Business Licenses And Certificates Of Occupancy: No business license or
certificate of occupancy shall be issued until construction is complete and in
conformance with the design approved by the city. Where occupancy is desired
before the completion of all required improvements, a temporary certificate of
occupancy may be issued, provided the requirements of section
10-2-12 of this code have been met.
   D.   Guidebook: The "City Of Long Beach Design Review Guidebook" provides
greater detail for design review applicants, and is incorporated herein by
reference. Where any conflict may exist between this title and the design

guidelines to assist in design. All applications shall be submitted to the city
administrator, who shall conduct an initial assessment for completeness and
code compliance before routing the application to the appropriate reviewing
authority.
   B.   Optional Preapplication: The applicant is encouraged to submit plans in
a preliminary draft or sketch form for staff review prior to final review. The
project can then be discussed with the developer and/or architect before
irrevocable decisions have been made and before expensive drawings have been
prepared. The preapplication review does not bind the city in any way, but
rather is offered as a convenience to the applicant. No fee shall be assessed
for any requested preapplication review.
   C.   Submittal Requirements:
      1.   All plans submitted shall be drawn to scale, on standard sized

alteration of a building over six thousand (6,000) square feet shall be
prepared and stamped by an architect licensed in the state of Washington.
   D.   Other Permit And Review Requirements: If any shoreline substantial
development (SSD) permits or state environmental policy act (SEPA)
environmental review is required for the proposed development, city officials
should caution the developer to secure these approvals prior to submitting a
design review application, to ensure that the project will be allowed as
designed. (Ord. 849, 8-17-2009; amd. Ord. 1036, 8-19-2024)

applicant. The reviewing authority may require additional information or
material from the applicant before taking final action.
   E.   Professional Assistance: The approving authority may, at its sole
discretion, determine that the nature of the proposed development requires
outside review by a design professional. The approving authority may retain the
services of a design professional if it determines that such assistance is
necessary to evaluate a design review application. The cost of such assistance
shall be borne by the applicant. No building permit shall be issued for any
development subject to design review until the city has been reimbursed for any
costs associated with outside review.

upon the filing of a timely request for extension by the applicant. No
extension shall be granted if any local zoning or design review regulations
have been amended in a manner that would have an impact upon the proposed
development. A request for extension shall be deemed to be timely filed if it
is received by the city before the expiration date of the final approval. (Ord.
849, 8-17-2009)
12-10-7: CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL; REQUIRED FINDINGS:
   A.   Minimum Criteria: City administrator shall review the design for
compliance with respect to lot coverage, setbacks, height, and permitted use.
These are minimum requirements that shall be met before any further review
takes place.
   B.   General Review Criteria:
      1.   The approving authority shall review the detailed architectural
design with respect to materials and surface textures, colors, fenestration
pattern, roof form and pitch, and expression of detailing.
      2.   The reviewing authority shall also review the site design to
determine how the proposed development fits into the existing environment,
judging applications with respect to scale and proportion, orientation of
buildings and other site features to streets and surrounding properties, and
the placement and types of landscaping.
   C.   Specific Review Criteria:
      1.   Siding: Natural wood siding such as board and batten, clapboard,
shiplap and wood shingles is encouraged, depending on the zone district in
which the property is located. Metal, stone, and brick siding may be allowed as
accent materials in zones where it is not prohibited. However, it is the intent
of this title to use metal and masonry as an accent in combination with other
siding materials and not to use either as the exclusive siding material, as
structures constructed exclusively with metal or masonry do not meet the intent
of the early seashore or contemporary seashore architectural theme required in
certain zones.
      2.   Roofing Materials: Composite roofing is permitted and encouraged.
Metal roofing is also allowed. Membrane roofs may be permitted in commercial
applications, provided it is screened from view from the front. Also permitted
in some zones are wood shingle and tile roofs.
      3.   Windows: Wood sash windows are preferred. Vinyl or clad windows are
acceptable with an exterior wooden trim. Operable wooden storm shutters are
also acceptable.
      4.   Doors: Wood or simulated wood doors are preferred.
      5.   Fences: Decorative wooden fences are preferred. Chain-link, split
rail wood fences and wood framed hog wire fences are not permitted in the R1R,
R2R, R3R, S1, S2, S3, S3R or S3M zones.
      6.   Fenestration Pattern: The arrangement of windows on a building
facade should be used to avoid the creation of large, blank wall spaces,
especially on street facades.
      7.   Roof Form And Pitch: This criteria involves the shape, form and
pitch of the roof, and the placement of dormers, eaves, and gables. A variety
of forms, within the prescribed limitations of the roof pitch requirements of
the zone in which the building is located, are encouraged.
      8.   Expression Of Detailing: The use of architectural detailing such as
gingerbread, trim work and ornate fixtures is encouraged when incorporated with
appropriate architectural styles.
      9.   Scale And Proportion: The size and shape of a structure or group of
structures should be consistent with the scale of surrounding properties.
      10.   Orientation: Residential buildings shall be oriented toward the
street. Nonresidential buildings shall be oriented toward the street, unless an
arcade or courtyard is used to address the public realm and present variety in
architectural styling.
      11.   Landscaping: The type, placement, and arrangement of landscape and
landscape features is an essential element in the integration of a project with
its surrounding area. Landscaping with plant materials suited to the coastal
setting is required where indicated, and shall be provided in all projects. The
use of rock, bark and other nonplant materials as mulch shall be limited.
      12.   Site Design: The integration of the proposed development with
abutting properties will be considered. The extent to which the massing of
structures is mitigated by landscaping or other techniques will also be
considered. Site designs that create vehicular turning movement conflicts are
prohibited. Site designs for nonresidential projects that share parking or
other amenities with neighboring properties are strongly encouraged.
      13.   Signs: Signs attached to a building shall be incorporated into the
building design. Freestanding signs shall be of a size, shape, and color that
complements the building design.
   D.   Clustering:
      1.   Mandatory Clustering: Depending upon site specific conditions, the
reviewing entity may require that dwelling units be clustered on a portion of a
site in order to protect natural resources, to accommodate trails identified in
the comprehensive plan, to preserve scenic vistas, or to create buffers between
uses.
      Where allowed by state law, and to achieve the goals stated above, the
reviewing entity may, but is not required to, allow up to a twenty percent
(20%) reduction in lot size and setback requirements for the zoning district,
in order to facilitate clustering of the permitted number of dwelling units on
the site. The required clustering shall not result in fewer lots than would
otherwise be permitted on the site, without written agreement by the applicant.
The required clustering shall not result in more lots or more dwelling units
than would otherwise be permitted on the site.
      2.   Optional Clustering: Applicants for residential projects may request
up to twenty percent (20%) reduction in lot sizes, dimensions, and building
setback requirements in order to cluster housing and retain land in order to
protect natural resources, to accommodate trails identified in the
comprehensive plan, to preserve scenic vistas, or to create buffers between
uses, or otherwise make land available for public or private open space.
      The reviewing entity may, but is not required to, grant such requests if
it determines the requested clustering is allowed under state law and the
development would achieve the goals described above for clustering and would
not have a significant adverse impact on surrounding land uses. The optional
clustering shall not result in more lots or more dwelling units than would
otherwise be permitted on the site.
   E.   Required Findings: The approving authority shall make the following
findings before approval of any proposed development:
      1.   Comprehensive Plan Compliance: That the proposal complies with the
comprehensive plan and other adopted city policies.
      2.   Zoning Regulations Compliance: That the proposal meets the
requirements of the zoning regulations.
      3.   Design Review Compliance: That the proposal as approved or
conditionally approved satisfies the criteria and purposes of this chapter,
including article A of this chapter.

(14) days from the rendering of the decision, the applicant or any other party
withstanding files an appeal. Appeals of any administrative or planning
commission decision shall be made to the hearing examiner and shall be an open
record hearing. Appeals of any hearing examiner decision shall be made to
Pacific County superior court. Appeals to the hearing examiner shall be
conducted pursuant to the procedures set forth in section 
12-3-4 of this title and section
11-2C-14 of this code. The filing of such an appeal within said time limit
shall stay the decision of the city until such time as the appeal has been
adjudicated or withdrawn. (Ord. 912, 8-3-2015)

create an early twentieth century seashore atmosphere, provide an attractive
compact retail core to stimulate foot traffic, and to promote tourism. Common
architectural details include false fronts, marquees, cedar shingles and ornate
seashore detailing. A diversity of building fronts is to be encouraged, and
simple replication is to be discouraged.
   B.   Design Requirements: The following design features are required:
      1.   Roofs: A roof pitch of five to twelve (5:12) or greater is required.
The approving authority may allow a more shallow pitch or a flat roof on
commercial or mixed use buildings where the pitch of the roof is concealed from
the primary street frontage by a false front that extends across at least fifty
percent (50%) of the width of the building's street frontage. Shallower roof
pitches on projecting features such as bays and porches may be permitted where
the form of the elements is complementary to the overall form and character of
the building. (Ord. 849, 8-17-2009)
      2.   Wood Siding: A minimum of eighty percent (80%) of the building's
total exterior siding exposure shall be cedar shingle, lap or clapboard siding
with an exposure not to exceed eight inches (8"), or cedar shake with a maximum
reveal of fourteen inches (14"). Board and batten siding may also be used. The
use of glass for window displays is encouraged, and shall be counted toward the
wood siding requirement. Cement board siding that is similar in appearance to
permitted siding materials shall be allowed. Other construction methods,
including sheet siding without bats, are prohibited. (Ord. 870, 4-4-2011)
      3.   Other Materials: If used, not more than twenty percent (20%) of the
building's total exterior siding exposure may be materials other than those
listed in subsection B2 of this section. Materials that may be used include
masonry (stone, brick or split faced block), sheet or corrugated metal, or
other styles of wood siding. Sheet siding shall not be used, except when
battens are applied. Materials should be used as accents to highlight the form
and architectural details of the building. Cement board siding that is similar
in appearance to permitted accent materials shall be allowed.
      4.   Finishes: Natural, painted or stained finishes are permitted. Muted
natural or neutral colors are required in shoreline areas.
      5.   Trim: Trim should be provided around all windows, doors and to
accent the architecture of the building. Trim should be painted in a
contrasting color, but may be left unfinished if the exterior siding material
is also unfinished.
      6.   Roof Ridge: One vertical change in elevation of a minimum of three
feet (3') shall occur in every fifty foot (50') run of roof. As an alternative,
one or more of the following may be applied:
         a.   The use of dormers may be proposed as an alternative to a three
foot (3') change in elevation. If dormers are used, there shall be not less
than two (2) dormers per fifty feet (50') of roof run, and each dormer must
span at least eighty percent (80%) of the roof face from ridge to eaves.
         b.   A cross gable may be used as an alternative to a three foot (3')
change in elevation. There shall be at least one cross gable for each fifty
feet (50') of roof run. The face of the cross gable must be in the same plane
as the building facade and the ridge of the cross gable shall be no more than
two feet (2') below the primary ridge.
         c.   The use of cupolas may be proposed as an alternative to a three
foot (3') change in elevation. If cupolas are used, there must be at least one
cupola per fifty feet (50') of roof run or fraction in excess of fifty feet
(50'). Cupolas shall be sized proportional to the building by being not less
than one foot (1') in height per ten feet (10') of roof run. The height of
cupolas shall also comply with the requirements of section
12-10-3 of this chapter.

tents shall be a bright solid or white in color. Replacement tents are subject
to administrative design review pursuant to subsection 12-10-5A6 of this
chapter, which should be conducted prior to their acquisition. (Ord. 849, 8-17-
2009; amd. Ord. 870, 4-4-2011; Ord. 899, 6-16-2014; Ord. 1036, 8-19-2024)
12-10A-5: DESIGN REVIEW IN OTHER ZONES:
Where design review is required in zones not otherwise enumerated in this
article, the design review criteria for the zone district most similar to the
zone district in which the project is located, or that criteria most suited for
the architectural form and character of the use, shall be used.
   A.   Public Uses: For governmental or municipal structures, uses or
facilities, public parking lots, and parks, recreation areas and facilities
located in zones other than P, PR and S4, the design criteria for the P, PR and
S4 zones, listed in section
12-10A-4 of this article may be used.

lieu of wood is permitted in all zones for all applications, unless
specifically excluded. The fiber cement material shall match the appearance,
including design, shape and dimensions, of the permitted wood product.
   B.   Alternate Materials: The approving authority may authorize the use of
alternate materials such as plastic composite, PVC or similar materials for
trim if all of these requirements are met:
      1.   The product has a woodlike treatment or finish, such as an embossed
wood grain or a shape that mimics a natural wood product.
      2.   The applicant provides appropriate documentation attesting to the
long term durability of the product.
      3.   The product is consistent in size and shape to the wood product it
proposes to replace.
   C.   Prohibited Materials: Where design review is required, vinyl siding,
aluminum siding, and similar materials shall not be used. Sheet siding shall
not be used except where battens are applied. Nothing in this chapter shall be
construed to limit the use of such materials in zones where design review is
not required. (Ord. 849, 8-17-2009)
12-10A-7: HISTORIC BUILDINGS:
Where substantiated by photographs, physical evidence or other historical
documentation, the reviewing authority may approve alterations and additions to
historic buildings that are not otherwise permitted by this chapter. A building
is typically considered historic if it is more than fifty (50) years of age, is
architecturally or aesthetically important, or has cultural significance. The
intent shall be to preserve the historic appearance of the building, or restore
it to its original historic appearance. The intent shall not be to permit
buildings that do not comply with design requirements and that have no
historic, cultural or aesthetic value to the city. There shall be a
demonstrated effort to preserve, restore or rehabilitate the entire building,
such that the project generally meets the "secretary of the interior's
standards for the treatment of historic properties", which may be used by the
reviewing authority as alternate design guidelines where appropriate. (Ord.

and welfare, to protect property values and minimize visual impacts while
furthering the development of enhanced telecommunication services in Long
Beach. These standards were designed to comply with the Telecommunications Act
of 1996. The provisions of this section are not intended to and shall not be
interpreted to prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting wireless
communication facilities (WCF). This section shall not be applied in such a
manner as to unreasonably discriminate between providers of functionally
equivalent wireless communication facilities.
   B.   Exemptions: The following uses and wireless communication facilities
(WCF) are exempt from the provisions of this section and shall be permitted in
all zones:
      1.   WCF operated or maintained by local, County, State or Federal
agencies for purposes of official government communications;
      2.   WCF located on Federal, State or tribal lands;
      3.   Temporary WCF during an emergency declared by the city;
      4.   Licensed amateur (ham) radio antennas;
      5.   Satellite dish antennas less than two meters (2 m) in diameter when
located in nonresidential zones, and satellite dish antennas less than one
meter (1 m) in diameter when located in residential zones, including direct to
home satellite services, when used as an accessory use of the property;
      6.   WCF that legally existed on or prior to the effective date of this
section, except that this exemption does not apply to modifications of such
facilities;
      7.   Routine maintenance or repair of a WCF and related equipment
(excluding structural work or changes in height or dimensions of antennas,
support structures or buildings); provided, that compliance with the standards
of this section are maintained;
      8.   Individual wireless broadband receivers for the purpose of providing
wireless access to the internet through a wireless internet service provider.
   C.   Wireless Communication Facility Permitted Locations: Wireless
communication facilities (WCF) shall be allowed in the L1 light industrial, C1
commercial, C2 commercial retail warehouse, OT old town, RC residential
commercial and P public zone districts, subject to issuance of a conditional
use permit pursuant to section
11-2D-2 of this code and the criteria and standards contained herein.
      1.   In considering applications for WCF, preference shall be given in
the following order:
         a.   Collocation of antennas on an existing structure in the L1 light
industrial zone district.
         b.   Attachment of antennas to a new or existing structure in the L1
light industrial zone district.
         c.   Attachment to existing or replacement light standards, electrical
transmission towers, water tanks or existing utility poles in the L1 light
industrial zone district.
         d.   Attachment of antennas to an existing building in the C1
commercial, C2 commercial retail warehouse, RC residential commercial or P
public zone district that do not exceed the building height requirement of the
district or are located within architectural features that meet the
requirements of section
12-11-3, "Projections From Buildings", of this chapter.
         e.   Installation of antennas in the OT old town zone district that
are concealed from view from abutting streets and adjacent properties by an
existing structure (such as a roof parapet) or within an architectural feature
(such as a cupola) and that do not exceed the building height requirement of
the zone district or are located within architectural features that meet the
requirements of section
12-11-3, "Projections From Buildings", of this chapter.
         f.   All other locations.
      2.   An applicant shall demonstrate that due to valid considerations,
including physical constraints or technological feasibility, the proposed
facility cannot be located in a preferred location. In the C1, C2, OT, RC and P
zone districts, the applicant must additionally demonstrate that the WCF is
necessary to fill an existing significant gap in the ability of remote users to
access the communication service (not merely a particular provider's service),
that there is no alternative site in the L1 zone district, and that the manner
in which it proposes to fill the gap complies in all other respects with this
section. The information submitted by the applicant shall include a map of the
area to be served by the facility, field strength test data (a drive test) of
existing coverage quality within the area to be served by the facility, its
relationship to other sites in the applicant's network (within and outside of
city limits), and an evaluation of existing available land, buildings and
structures within one-fourth (1/4) mile of the proposed site.
      3.   In no case shall a WCF be located on a property on which there is an
existing residential use.
   D.   Collocation: To minimize potential adverse visual impacts associated
with the proliferation of wireless communication facilities (WCF) and wireless
communication towers and support structures such as lattice towers and
monopoles, collocation of WCF antennas on existing or new support structures is
encouraged, as follows:
      1.   Collocation shall be accomplished in a manner consistent with the
provisions of this subsection.
      2.   This subsection applies to both new and existing WCF. The terms and
conditions for collocating latecomer providers on collocatable WCF facilities
shall be reasonable and based on current market rates for comparable
facilities. Imposition of unreasonable or higher than market rate terms and
conditions by the host provider shall be considered failure to cooperate in
good faith to accommodate collocation with competitors and shall be subject to
the provisions of subsection D6 of this section.
      3.   The city may deny an application to construct a new support
structure if the applicant has not shown by substantial evidence that it has
made an effort to mount the proposed antennas on an existing building or
support structure that would provide adequate service to the proposed coverage
area. The applicant shall use the following collocation protocol:
         a.   Prior to or with an application for approval of a WCF, the
applicant shall demonstrate that the following notice was mailed via certified
mail to all other WCF providers licensed to provide service within the city:
Pursuant to the requirements of City of Long Beach Municipal Code Section 12-
10-17(D), (name of wireless provider) is hereby providing you with notice of
our intent to submit an application with the City of Long Beach for
construction of a new freestanding personal wireless service facility that
would be located at                  (location). In general, we plan to
construct a                     (lattice tower, monopole, etc.) of
              feet in height for the purpose of providing                 
(cellular, PCS, ESMR, etc.) service in the                  frequency range.
Please inform us whether you have any existing or planned personal wireless
service facilities within one mile of the proposed facility that may be
available for possible co-location. If you do not have a facility available for
co-location, please indicate whether you would be interested in collocating on
our proposed facility. Please provide us with this information within ten (10)
business days after the date of this letter. Your cooperation is appreciated.
         b.   Copies of any responses to the collocation request letter shall
be provided to the city with the WCF application. If a response to a
collocation request letter is received by an applicant indicating an
opportunity for collocation, the applicant shall make a good faith effort to
analyze the feasibility of collocation. This analysis shall be submitted with
an application for any WCF support structure and shall include, at a minimum:
            (1)   A statement from a qualified engineer indicating whether the
necessary service can or cannot be provided by collocation at the possible
collocation site, and the basis for that determination; and
            (2)   Evidence that the lessor of the possible collocation site
either agrees or disagrees to collocation on his/her property; and
            (3)   Evidence that adequate space exists or does not exist at the
possible collocation site to accommodate needed equipment and meet the
applicable requirements of this code; and
            (4)   Evidence that adequate access does or does not exist at the
possible collocation site.
      4.   To reduce the number of future support structures needed in the
city, new support structures shall be designed to accommodate antennas for more
than one user, unless the applicant demonstrates why such design is not
feasible for economic, technical or physical reasons.
      5.   Unless collocation is not feasible, an applicant's site plan shall
reserve an area for at least one other provider's equipment near the base of
the applicant's wireless communication tower or support structure. An option
agreement to lease the area at the base of the facility for a second provider
shall not expire prior to the underlying lease.
      6.   Personal wireless service providers, their lessees and agents shall
cooperate in good faith to accommodate collocation with competitors, including
responding in a timely manner to a collocation letter required by subsection D3
of this section. If a dispute arises about the feasibility of collocating, the
director may require a third party technical study, pursuant to subsection H of
this section, to resolve the dispute. Costs associated with this study shall be
borne by the applicant. Failure to accommodate collocation may be grounds for
revocation of permit and removal of the WCF under public nuisance abatement
procedures.
   E.   Design Criteria:
      1.   Impact On Neighborhood: The location and design of wireless
communication facility (WCF) sites shall consider the visual and physical
impacts of the facility on the surrounding neighborhood.
      2.   Architectural Compatibility: WCF shall be architecturally compatible
with the surrounding buildings and land uses and screened or otherwise
integrated, through location and design, to blend in with the existing
characteristics of the site and its surroundings.
      3.   Collocation: As provided in subsection D4 of this section, new
support structures shall be designed to accommodate collocation, unless the
applicant demonstrates why such design is not feasible for economic, technical
or physical reasons.
      4.   Support Structures And Antennas: Support structures such as
monopoles and lattice towers, and antennas mounted on utility poles, shall only
be allowed in the L1 light industrial zone district. Panel and whip antennas
mounted on buildings shall be allowed in the OT, RC, P, C1, C2 and L1 zone
districts.
      5.   Setbacks: The setback requirements in this subsection are not
subject to a variance.
         a.   All support structures, such as lattice towers and monopoles, and
all aboveground equipment enclosures shall be set back at least ten feet (10')
from property lines. This setback shall be measured from the closest point of
the antenna, support structure or equipment enclosure to the property lines on
the lot on which it is located. Additionally, setbacks to adjacent properties
on which an existing residence is located shall be equal to at least the height
of the tower unless otherwise authorized by the hearings examiner.
         b.   Antennas installed on building rooftops shall be set back from
the edge of the roof at least one foot (1') for each foot of antenna height as
measured from the top of the roof (or parapet, if one exists) to the highest
point of the antenna.
         c.   Antennas installed on building facades shall be set back at least
ten feet (10') from all street facades.
      6.   Height: The height limits in this subsection are not subject to a
variance.
         a.   The height of the WCF shall be no more than that required to
function satisfactorily.
         b.   Antennas and support structures shall not exceed one hundred
twenty feet (120') in height in the L1 zone district.
         c.   Antennas located in the C1, C2, OT, RC and P zone districts shall
not exceed the maximum height permitted by the underlying zone district, except
when entirely enclosed within architectural features that meet the requirements
of section
12-11-3, "Projections From Buildings", of this chapter.
      7.   Screening:
         a.   All WCF shall be designed and located on a site to take maximum
advantage of existing trees, mature vegetation, structures and/or topography to
screen as much of the facility as possible from view, and so that the facility
blends into the background.
         b.   The visual impacts of support structures and ground mounted
equipment enclosures shall be mitigated through installation of a five foot
(5') wide landscape strip around the perimeter of the structure, equipment
enclosure and the outside of the security fence (if any). A decorative solid
wood fence, six feet (6') in height and not topped by barbed wire, may be
permitted in lieu of the landscape strip. The hearings examiner may waive or
modify this requirement for those sides of the facility that are not visible
from streets or adjacent property, or when equipment is located within a fully
enclosed building that meets the design requirements of the underlying zone.
         c.   Landscaping shall be properly maintained and kept in good
condition at all times, pursuant to section
12-13-11 of this title.
         d.   Equipment enclosures shall have a finish and appearance similar
to the exterior building walls.
         e.   In the OT zone district, WCF shall be concealed from public view
by architectural features or parapets.
      8.   Antennas: The requirements in this subsection are not subject to a
variance.
         a.   Antennas mounted on buildings shall be architecturally compatible
with the building and wall on which it is mounted, and shall be designed and
located so as to minimize any adverse aesthetic impact. Antennas shall be
allowed where concealed entirely within those structures listed in section
12-11-3, "Projections From Buildings", of this chapter. Panel antennas shall
not be mounted on a facade facing a street. A wall mounted antenna shall be as
flush to the wall as technically possible and shall not project above the wall
on which it is mounted. Antennas and any visible mounting brackets and cables
shall be constructed, painted, or fully screened to match as closely as
possible the color and texture of the building and wall on which it is mounted,
or otherwise blend into its background.
         b.   Antennas mounted on other structures shall be integrated into the
design of the structure to which they are attached. Antenna platforms are
prohibited. External projections from the structure shall be limited to the
smallest projection technically feasible.
      9.   Locating On Utility Poles: The requirements in this subsection are
not subject to a variance. WCF located on utility poles shall only be permitted
in the L1 light industrial zone district and shall conform to the following
design criteria:
         a.   The utility pole at the proposed location may be replaced with a
taller pole for the purpose of accommodating a WCF, except as prohibited in
subsections E9c and E9d of this section; and provided, that the new pole shall
not exceed a height that is a maximum of fifteen feet (15') taller than the
existing pole;
         b.   Panel antennas shall not project out from the surface of the
utility pole by more than twelve inches (12"), shall not exceed six feet (6')
in height, and shall be placed such that the top of the panel antenna does not
extend above the height of the utility pole;
         c.   A cylindrical antenna may be mounted as an extension on top of an
existing utility pole, but the existing pole shall not be replaced with a
taller pole for the purpose of accommodating the cylindrical antenna. A
cylindrical antenna mounted on top of a utility pole shall not exceed eighteen
inches (18") in diameter and eight feet (8') in height;
         d.   A whip antenna may be mounted as an extension on top of an
existing utility pole, but the existing pole shall not be replaced with a
taller pole for the purpose of accommodating the whip antenna. A whip antenna
mounted on top of a utility pole shall not exceed fifteen feet (15') in height;
         e.   All WCF, including, but not limited to, antennas, equipment,
cables and conduit that are mounted on utility poles, shall be painted to match
the pole;
         f.   The visual effect of the WCF on all other aspects of the
appearance of the utility pole shall be minimized to the greatest extent
possible;
         g.   The use of the utility pole for the siting of a WCF shall be
considered secondary to the primary function of the utility pole. If the
primary function of a utility pole serving as the host site for a WCF becomes
unnecessary and any regulation requires its removal, the utility pole shall not
be retained for the sole purpose of accommodating the WCF and the WCF and all
associated equipment shall be removed immediately;
         h.   In all cases where a utility pole is replaced for the purpose of
accommodating a WCF installation, the cables and other wiring necessary for the
WCF shall be routed inside the new pole. If routing inside the pole is not
allowed by the utility and that determination is confirmed in writing by the
utility, then all cable, wiring and conduit routed outside the pole shall be
painted to match the pole; and
         i.   There is no collocation requirement for WCF located on utility
poles and there shall be no more than one WCF located on any one utility pole.
WCF located on utility poles shall be located no closer than one thousand feet
(1,000') from any other WCF located on a utility pole.
      10.   Color: WCF shall have colors generally matching the surroundings or
background that minimizes their visibility. In the event that the FCC or FAA
requires special marking, the city may require the applicant to request dual
mode lighting as an alternative to the marking requirement.
      11.   Lights, Signals And Signs: No lights, signals, signs, banners or
similar devices shall be permitted on support structures or antennas, except
for those required by law.
      12.   Noise: WCF shall comply with applicable state and local noise
regulations.
         a.   All generators shall be enclosed.
         b.   Testing of equipment and maintenance activities shall occur on
weekdays between the hours of eight thirty o'clock (8:30) A.M. and four thirty
o'clock (4:30) P.M. This restriction shall not apply to emergency situations or
to an impending failure of the communication system.
      13.   Safety: The design of wireless communication towers shall include
"anticlimbing" features to reduce the potential for trespass and injury.
      14.   Federal Requirements: WCF providers and lessees shall assure that
its facility complies at all times with current federal standards. Failure to
maintain WCF in compliance with current federal standards and regulations shall
constitute a nuisance.
   F.   Facility Removal:
      1.   Prior to issuance of any building or construction permits for a
wireless communication facility (WCF), the property owner shall sign an
affidavit agreeing to remove the WCF at his or her expense pursuant to this
subsection. The form of the affidavit shall be approved by the city attorney.
      2.   In the event the use of any support structure or antenna will be
discontinued for a period of sixty (60) consecutive days, the owner or operator
shall so notify the city in writing, and the support structure or antenna shall
thereafter be deemed to be abandoned. Determination of the date of abandonment
shall be made by the city which shall have the right to request documentation
and affidavits from the support structure or antenna owner or operator
regarding the issue of support structure or antenna usage. Upon such
abandonment, the owner or operator of the support structure or antenna or the
owner of the property upon which such facility is located shall have an
additional sixty (60) days within which to:
         a.   Reactivate the use of the support structure or antenna or
transfer the support structure or antenna to another owner or operator who
makes actual use of the support structure or antenna; or
         b.   Dismantle and remove the support structure or antenna. If such
support structure or antenna is not removed within said sixty (60) days from
the date of abandonment, the city may remove such support structure or antenna
at the facility owner's and property owner's expense. If there are two (2) or
more users of a single support structure, then this provision shall not become
effective until all users cease using the support structure. At the earlier of
sixty (60) days from the date of abandonment without reactivation or upon
completion of dismantling and removal, city approval for the support structure
and/or antenna shall automatically expire.
   G.   Application Requirements:
      1.   All wireless communication facilities (WCF) shall obtain a
conditional use permit, pursuant to the requirements of section
11-2D-2 of this code. WCF located in the OT, RC, P, C1 and C2 zone districts
shall also be subject to design review, pursuant to chapter 10 of this title.
All applications to locate a WCF shall include the following information:
         a.   A scaled site plan clearly indicating the location, type and
height of the proposed support structure, antennas, on site land uses and
zoning, adjacent land uses and zoning, adjacent streets, proposed means of
access, and setbacks from property lines and residential zones.
         b.   Scaled elevation drawings of the proposed support structure and
equipment enclosure.
         c.   Photo simulations of the proposed facility from public rights of
way, public properties and affected residentially zoned properties.
         d.   Approximate distance between the proposed antennas and the
nearest residentially zoned property.
         e.   A landscape plan showing size, type, and location of specific
landscape, screening and fencing materials.
         f.   Manufacturer's information indicating compliance with adopted
noise standards.
         g.   The city may require submittal of propagation maps showing that
the proposed WCF is required for network coverage in order to satisfy the
requirements of the provider's grid system. The maps shall also demonstrate
that the requested height is the minimum height necessary for the support
structure and antennas, as applicable. The maps shall show the neighboring or
regional facilities with which the facilities in the city can communicate. The
city may require additional propagation maps showing coverage areas at lower
heights.
   H.   Third Party Review: In certain instances there may be a need for expert
review by a third party of the technical data submitted by the wireless
communication facility (WCF) applicant. The city may require such a technical
review, to be paid for by the WCF applicant. The selection of the third party
expert may be by mutual agreement between the applicant and the city, or at the
sole discretion of the city, such mutual agreement not to be unreasonably
withheld by either party. The third party expert shall have recognized training
and qualifications in the field of radio frequency engineering or structural
engineering, as appropriate. The expert review is intended to be a site
specific review of technical aspects of the wireless communication facilities,
facilities and other matters as described herein, and not a subjective review
of the site selection. In particular, but without limitation, the expert shall
be entitled to provide a recommendation on the height of the proposed
facilities relative to the applicant's coverage objectives and system design
parameters, or the structural requirements for accommodating collocation. Such
a review should address the accuracy and completeness of the technical data,
whether the analysis techniques and methodologies are legitimate, the validity
of the conclusions and any specific technical issues outlined by the city or
other interested parties. Based on the results of the third party review, the
city may require changes to the application for the WCF that comply with the
recommendations of the expert.
   I.   Other Wireless Communication Facilities: All of the provisions of this
section, which address wireless communication facilities and personal wireless
service facilities, shall also be deemed to cover other wireless communications
facilities (and, in particular, but without limitation, television and AM/FM
radio towers) to the maximum extent allowed by law.
   J.   Conflict: To the extent that any provisions of this section are
inconsistent or in conflict with any other provision of the zoning code,
comprehensive plan or any ordinance or regulation of the city, the provisions
of this section shall be deemed to control. (Ord. 849, 8-17-2009)
12-11-18: AFFORDABLE HOUSING:
   A.   Purpose: The intent of this section is to encourage the provision of
affordable housing for low, very low and extremely low income households in the
city of Long Beach by allowing a density bonus for projects that are located in
the R3 multi-family residential district and in the RC residential commercial
district.
   B.   Density: The maximum number of dwelling units permitted on a property
may be increased to the extent that all other zoning standards are met without
need for a variance, subject to issuance of a conditional use permit pursuant
to the requirements of section
11-2D-2 of this code and provided all units on the property are affordable for
low, very low and/or extremely low income households. The exact density
allowable will be determined by the hearing examiner pursuant to the
conditional use permit process.
   C.   Qualification:
      1.   The city shall maintain and update annually standards for qualified
households, based on the level of income and family size, describing the
"qualified household" eligible for the affordable housing. The city shall also
maintain and update annually a schedule of the maximum allowable housing costs
for affordable dwelling units, based on income and household size. The city may
choose to use qualification standards and/or cost schedules prepared by the
joint Pacific County housing authority.
      2.   The city shall verify that tenants of affordable dwelling units are
qualified households upon initial rental and annually thereafter. The city
shall verify purchasers of for sale affordable dwelling units are qualified
households prior to closing. It shall be the responsibility of the landlord
(for rent units) or purchaser (for sale units) to provide all necessary
documentation to the city regarding income and household size.
      3.   For properties operated by an agency, nonprofit or developer whose
primary purpose is providing affordable housing, which housing organization is
acceptable to the city and has similar qualification standards, processes and
affordability requirements, the city may defer qualification to that entity.
Upon mutual agreement by the city and joint Pacific County housing authority
(JPCHA), the city may pass responsibility for determination of qualification
and affordability to the JPCHA.
   D.   Deed Restriction: A deed restriction shall be placed on the property
prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy. The city shall review and
approve all covenants, conditions and restrictions that may be placed on the
property prior to execution, in order to ensure affordability standards are
maintained. The deed restriction shall run with the land. The period for which
it must remain affordable must be included in the deed restriction. For rent
affordable dwelling units shall remain affordable for a period not less than
twenty (20) years. For sale affordable dwelling units shall remain affordable
for a period not less than twenty (20) years.
   E.   Rental Affordable Dwelling Units:
      1.   Prior to initial renting of an affordable dwelling unit, the
landlord shall provide to the city of Long Beach community development
department documentation of the family size and gross income for verification
of qualification to occupy the affordable dwelling unit. The landlord shall
thereafter provide verification to the city annually that the tenants for all
units continue to meet the household size and income limits for occupancy of an
affordable dwelling unit. Tenants who no longer meet the requirements of a
qualified household may continue to occupy the affordable dwelling unit,
provided their income for their household size does not exceed one hundred
twenty percent (120%) of the area median income. If the tenant's income exceeds
that amount, the tenant shall be required to vacate the unit within sixty (60)
days. A lease or rental agreement shall be required for rental of affordable
dwelling units, and the lease or agreement shall include a clause stating the
terms under which a household that is no longer qualified may continue to
occupy the unit. Nothing in this section shall be construed to otherwise change
or limit the usual rights of tenant or landlord.
      2.   A schedule showing the rents charged for affordable dwelling units
shall be provided to the city on initial rental and annually thereafter. The
city shall verify that rents meet the standards for affordable housing and that
rent and utilities constitute no more than thirty percent (30%) of such gross
annual household income for a qualified household of the size that may occupy
the unit in question.
   F.   For Sale Affordable Dwelling Units: The developer must place a deed
restriction in the deed conveying the property to the qualified household a
restriction running with the land stipulating that, from the time of the first
conveyance, any subsequent conveyance shall have the following limitation:
      1.   Any monies received by the qualified household seller in excess of
the actual reduction of the principal of the mortgage and the down payment and
payments for home improvements for the first five (5) years after the purchase
by the qualified household shall revert to and belong to the city of Long
Beach, to be deposited in the affordable housing fund.
      2.   After the first five (5) years, twenty five percent (25%) of any
excess funds received shall belong to the qualified household seller. During
the subsequent fifteen (15) years, five percent (5%) of the excess funds
received for each full year of ownership shall belong to the qualified
household seller. The excess balance shall revert and belong to the city of
Long Beach, to be deposited in the affordable housing fund.
      3.   After twenty (20) years, all the sale proceeds shall belong to the
qualified household seller.
      4.   If the property is sold by the qualified household to another
qualified household at any time at the price then established for the qualified
household, all excess funds shall belong to the selling qualified household.
The buyer shall submit to the city documentation of household size and income
for verification of qualification.
      5.   If the household size or income of a previously qualified owner
occupied household changes in such a way that they are no longer qualified to
occupy an affordable dwelling unit, they shall not be required to vacate and/or
sell the affordable dwelling unit they own. All other requirements of this
section shall continue to apply.
      6.   If the owner of a for sale affordable dwelling unit should choose to
rent the dwelling unit rather than occupy it within twenty (20) years after the
first conveyance, it shall be rented to a qualified household, subject to
verification of qualification as set forth in subsection E of this section.
If the for sale units are built under the auspices of an agency, nonprofit or
developer whose primary purpose is providing affordable housing, which housing
organization is acceptable to the city and has similar qualification standards
and processes, the city may defer to those standards and accept the deed
restriction put in place by that entity.
   G.   Affordable Housing Fund: The city of Long Beach shall establish an
"affordable housing fund" to receive the funds described in subsection F of
this section, which funds will be used only to produce or rehabilitate
affordable housing. The city may choose to pass the funds to the joint Pacific
County housing authority, provided the projects for which the funds are used
serve the Long Beach area. (Ord. 906, 2-2-2015)

specifically provided for in the development standards of the zone district in
which the building is located.
   C.   Dimensions: The vision clearance triangle for said intersections shall
be as follows:
      1.   At intersections of public rights of way, the VCT shall be formed by
measuring twenty feet (20') along each property line from the intersection and
connecting the end points of such lines formed by such measurement to create a
triangle.
      2.   At intersections of driveways and alleys with public rights of way,
the VCT shall be formed by measuring ten feet (10') along the property line
from the intersection and ten feet (10') along the driveway or alley connecting
the end point of such lines formed by such measurement to create a triangle.

The purpose of this chapter, including article A, is to protect the safety and
orderly development of the community through the regulation of signs and sign
structures and further the implementation of the comprehensive plan. The
orderly development of the community requires striking a balance between the
needs of businesses to advertise and the desire to maintain an aesthetically
pleasing environment. The regulation of signs is an important element in

in accordance with the fee schedule adopted by resolution of the city council.
   C.   Permit Exemptions: The following shall not require a permit; these
exemptions shall not be construed as relieving the owner of a sign from the
responsibility of its erection, maintenance and its compliance with the
provisions of this chapter or any other law or ordinance regulating the same:
      1.   The changing of the advertising copy or message on a lawfully
erected sign designed for the use of replaceable copy.
      2.   Painting, repainting or cleaning of a lawfully erected sign
structure.
      3.   Temporary decorations customary for special holidays, such as
Christmas and Independence Day, erected entirely on private property.

12-14-9 of this chapter. (Ord. 849, 8-17-2009)
12-14-4: TRAFFIC VISIBILITY:
No sign or sign structure shall be erected at the intersection of any street in
such a manner as to obstruct free and clear vision, nor at any location where
by its position, shape, or color it may interfere with or obstruct the view of
or be confused with any authorized traffic sign, signal or device. All signs
must comply with vision clearance triangle requirements as found in section
12-13-10 of this title except as may be permitted by section

2.   Way finding signs are permitted in OT, RC, C1, P and PR zones only,
subject to city council approval.
   B.   Materials: Signs may be made of any material, other than chipboard;
provided, that the sign shall complement the property upon which the sign is
erected and shall be durable; wood and paint is preferred. For signs in zones
requiring design review, the standards for buildings in those zones shall be
used as a guide for sign design.
   C.   Double Faced Signs: Only one side of a double faced sign shall be
counted toward the sign area, provided only one side is visible from a single
vantage point, such as a freestanding and projecting sign.
   D.   Sign Height: The maximum height of a freestanding sign, including all
components of the support structure, cabinet and lighting, if any, shall be as
set forth in the following table:

   Note:
1.   All signs must comply with the traffic visibility requirements of section
12-14-4 of this chapter and section
12-13-10 of this title.
(Ord. 849, 8-17-2009)
12-14-6: MAINTENANCE, REPAIR OR REMOVAL:
   A.   Maintenance:
      1.   Every sign shall be kept in good condition and repair.
      2.   The building inspector shall determine whether or not a sign is in
good condition or repair. The administrative decision of the building inspector
may be appealed as provided in this title. In evaluating whether or not a sign
meets the objective in this subsection, the building inspector will evaluate
each sign on a case by case basis using some or all of the following criteria
to assist in making a determination; however, additional consideration may be
given to other factors at the sole discretion of the building inspector:
         a.   Is the sign intact to include the face, structure, and all other
attached components; or
         b.   Is the sign face damaged; or
         c.   Is the sign faded, illegible, peeling, or chipped; or
         d.   Is the illumination functional; or
         e.   Does the sign present a neat, clean and attractive appearance; or
         f.   Does the lack of maintenance or repair create a condition such
that the sign detracts from the aesthetics of neighboring properties.
   B.   Dangerous Condition; Sign Removal: In cases where there exists an
immediate danger to public safety, the building inspector shall have the
authority to immediately remove or cause to be removed any sign, at the expense
of the owner as provided in section
12-14-13 of this chapter.
   C.   Nonconforming Signs:
      1.   Structural repairs to nonconforming signs shall not be permitted.
      2.   Repainting and minor repairs to nonconforming signs shall be
permitted, provided the total cost of the repairs does not exceed fifty percent
(50%) of the estimated replacement cost of the sign with a conforming sign at
the time of the repair or two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00),
whichever is less.
   D.   Sign Alterations; Conformance, Permit: No sign shall be structurally
altered, enlarged or relocated except in conformity to the provisions herein,
nor until a proper permit, if required, has been secured.
   E.   Signs Subject To Design Review Standards: The changing copy, business
names, lettering, sign faces, colors, display and/or graphic material, or the
content of any conforming sign shall not be deemed a structural alteration but
shall be subject to the design review standards of chapter 10 of this title.
(Ord. 849, 8-17-2009)
12-14-7: COMPUTATION OF FRONTAGE:
If a premises contains walls facing more than one property line or encompasses
property frontage bounded by more than one street, the sign area(s) for each
building wall or property frontage will be computed separately for each
building wall or property line facing a different frontage, and each wall shall
only be counted once. Walls resulting from building recesses that are not
visible from the property line shall not be counted as additional frontage. The
sign area(s) thus calculated may then be applied to permitted signs placed on
each separate wall or property line frontage, as set forth in the sign matrix.
The total sign allocation is based only on frontage that faces a public way.
Placement of signs on sides without any allocated signage shall be counted
towards the total sign allocation. (Ord. 849, 8-17-2009)
12-14-8: PROHIBITED SIGNS:
The following are specifically prohibited and illegal:
   A.   Signs located in such a manner as to obstruct or otherwise interfere
with an official traffic sign, signal or device, or which obstruct or interfere
with a driver's view of approaching, merging or intersecting traffic.
   B.   Except as provided in sections
12-14A-10,
12-14A-14,
12-14A-15 and
12-14A-16 of this chapter, signs encroaching upon or overhanging any street or

12-15-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The purpose and intent of the city council in enacting this chapter is to
maintain and protect the health, safety and welfare of its citizens, and to
mitigate the adverse secondary impacts associated with sexually oriented or
adult entertainment businesses, through land use regulation of the location and
operations of such businesses. The land use regulations set forth herein are
intended to prevent health and safety problems and dangerous and unlawful
conduct in and around such uses and premises. (Ord. 849, 8-17-2009)
12-15-2: FINDINGS OF FACT:
Based on information presented before it, the city council makes the following
findings of fact:
   A.   Many cities, in Washington and in other sections of the United States,
have experienced negative secondary impacts from sexually oriented business
land uses.
   B.   Certain conduct occurring on premises offering adult entertainment
creates secondary impacts that are detrimental to the public health, safety and
general welfare of the citizens of the city, and therefore such conduct must be
regulated as provided herein.
   C.   Regulation of the sexually oriented businesses including the adult
entertainment industry is necessary because in the absence of such regulation
significant criminal activity has historically and regularly occurred. This
history of criminal activity has included prostitution, illegal employment of
minors, narcotics trafficking and use, alcoholic beverage law violations,
assault, theft, breaches of the peace, tax evasion, and the presence within the
industry of individuals with outstanding arrest warrants and past criminal
behavior that may be indicative of intended future conduct.
   D.   Sexually oriented businesses that are increasingly associated with
ongoing prostitution, illegal drug transactions, disruptive conduct and other
criminal activity. Such activities constitute a threat to the public peace,
health and safety. The hours of operation of such businesses have a significant
impact on the occurrence of criminal activity.
   E.   Due to the information presented regarding the connection of
prostitution with adult entertainment and other sexually oriented businesses,
there is concern over sexually transmitted diseases which is a legitimate
health concern of the city and thus requires regulation of adult entertainment
and other sexually oriented businesses in order to protect the health, safety
and well being of the public.
   F.   No evidence has been presented to show that the location of sexually
oriented business land uses within the city will improve the commercial
viability of the community, or will otherwise have a beneficial effect, and not
have a detrimental effect.
   G.   The city may rely on the experiences and studies of other cities and
organizations in assessing the need for regulation of sexually oriented
business land use operations and licensing or of regulation.
   H.   Regulation of sexually oriented business land uses is necessary to
prevent deterioration and/or degradation of the vitality of the community
before the problem exists, rather than in response to an existing problem.
   I.   The city comprehensive plan strongly supports that adjacent land uses
be compatible.
   J.   Sexually oriented business land uses are incompatible with certain land
uses such as religious facilities, parks, daycare facilities, libraries, youth
centers and schools (including nursery schools and preschools). Such
incompatibility has been documented in studies performed throughout the United
States.
   K.   Increased levels of criminal activities occur in the vicinity of adult
entertainment and other sexually oriented business land uses, and the patrons
of such businesses are frequently found to be the victims of such criminal
activities.
   L.   Adjacency of residential and many commercial uses to sexually oriented
business land uses reduces the value of residential and commercial property.
   M.   Sexually oriented business land uses are perceived to, and usually do,
negatively impact the character of established neighborhoods.
   N.   Utilizing one thousand feet (1,000') as the requisite spacing between
sexually oriented business land uses and places of worship, libraries, daycare
facilities and youth centers, and schools (preschools or nursery schools
through twelfth grade) and five hundred feet (500') as the requisite spacing
between sexually oriented business land uses and public parks, in existence or
proposed and vested by the effective date hereof, will provide adequate
separation and buffering while providing a reasonable amount of land within the
city to be available for sexually oriented business land uses. (Ord. 849, 8-17-
2009)

              The process of correcting the effects of adverse environmental impact(s) to critical
              areas. The following actions are mitigation, in order of preference, and this ordered
              preference is termed mitigation sequencing:
              •   Avoid the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action;
              •   Minimize the impact by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its
              implementation via the use of appropriate technology, or by taking affirmative steps
              such as project redesign, relocation, or timing;
MITIGATION:   •   Reduce or eliminate the original impact over time via preservation and
              maintenance operations during the life of the action;
              •   Rectify the impact via repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected
              environment to the historical conditions or the conditions existing at the time of
              project initiation;
              •   Compensate for the impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing substitute
              resources or environments; and/or
              Mitigation by reduction, rectification, or compensation must be monitored for success
              and remedial action taken when necessary (adaptive management).
              Mitigation used to replace project-induced critical area or buffer losses or impacts
              to a critical area, and includes but is not limited to, the following.
              •   Restoration - Measures taken to reestablish an altered or damaged natural feature
              or its buffer that have been damaged or lost by alteration, past management
              activities, or catastrophic events.
              •   Creation - Measures taken to establish a wetland at a site where it did not
MITIGATION,   formerly exist.
COMPENSATORY: •   Enhancement - Measures taken to improve condition of existing degraded wetlands
              so the functions they provide are of a higher quality.
              •   Preservation - Measures taken to ensure permanent protection of existing, high-
              quality wetlands.
              Generally, compensatory mitigation is spoken of in terms of ratios, whereby the
              amount of mitigation is a multiple of the amount of impact. For example a 2:
              1 compensatory mitigation ratio means that for every one (1) unit of impact, two (2)
              units of mitigation must be provided.
              Compensatory mitigation that is the same type as that of the impacted resource (e.g.,
MITIGATION,   for wetlands, the same Cowardian class or hydrogeomorphic type). For example, in-kind
IN-KIND:      mitigation requires Class II emergent wetland impacts to be compensated for with
              Class II emergent wetlands.
              Compensatory mitigation in which the wetland and its associated functions used to
MITIGATION,   compensate for the impacts are of a different (superior) class or type than those
OUT-OF-KIND:  impacted. In other words that substitutes (1) Category I, II, or III wetlands for

PRESERVATION: barrier island. This term also includes activities commonly associated with the term
              preservation (in a regulatory context).
              Under regulatory actions preservation does not result in a gain of wetland acres, but
              may result in a gain in functions over the long term, and is used only in exceptional
              circumstances.
PRIORITY      Habitat types or elements with unique or significant value to one or more species as
HABITAT:      classified by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife.

              Means a person with sufficient experience, education, and professional degrees and
              training pertaining to the critical area in question, and with experience in
              performing delineations, analyzing critical area functions and values, analyzing
              critical area impacts, and recommending critical area mitigation and restoration. For
QUALIFIED     wetlands, a qualified professional should be a professional wetland scientist with at
CRITICAL AREA least two years of full-time work experience as a wetlands professional, including
PROFESSIONAL: delineating wetlands using the state or federal manuals, preparing wetland reports,
              conducting function assessments, and developing and implementing mitigation plans.
              The Director shall require professionals to demonstrate the basis for qualifications
              and shall make final determination as to qualifications. Demonstration of
              qualifications may include, but shall not be limited to, professional certification.

WETLANDS:     including, but not limited to, irrigation and drainage ditches, grass-lined swales,
              canals, detention facilities, wastewater treatment facilities, farm ponds, and
              landscape amenities, or those wetlands created after July 1, 1990, that were
              unintentionally created as a result of the construction of a road, street, or
              highway; with the exception that wetlands shall include those artificial wetlands
              intentionally created from non-wetland areas to mitigate conversion of wetlands.
              Wetlands that meet one or more of the following criteria: 1) represent a unique or
WETLAND,      rare wetland type; 2) are more sensitive to disturbance than most wetlands; 3) are
CLASS I:      relatively undisturbed and contain ecological attributes that are impossible to
              replace within a human lifetime; or 4) provide a high level of functions.
WETLAND,      Wetlands are difficult, though not impossible, to replace, and which provide high
CLASS II:     levels of some functions.
WETLAND,      Wetlands that are: 1) wetlands with a moderate level of functions; or 2) interdunal
CLASS III:    wetlands between 0.1 and 1 acre in size.
WETLAND,      Wetlands with the lowest levels of functions that are often heavily disturbed.
CLASS IV:
WETLAND       Conversion of non-wetland (upland) area to Category I, II, III, or IV wetlands and
CREATION:     the associated alterations to soil, vegetation and/or hydrology required to establish
              and maintain the resultant wetland in a perpetually self sustaining state.
              Manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a wetland
              site to heighten, intensify, or to improve specific function(s) or to change the
              growth stage or composition of the vegetation present. Enhancement is undertaken for
WETLAND       specified purposes such as water quality improvement, floodwater retention, or
ENHANCEMENT:  wildlife habitat. Enhancement results in a change in some wetland functions and can
              lead to a decline in other wetland functions, but does not result in a gain of
              wetland acres. Activities typically consist of planting vegetation, controlling non-
              native or invasive species, modifying site elevations or the proportion of open water
              to influence hydroperiods, or some combination of these activities.
              Those ecological functions associated with wetlands that result in benefits (see
WETLAND       wetland values) to society, such as fish and wildlife habitat, natural water quality
FUNCTIONS:    improvement, flood storage, shoreline erosion protection, and opportunities for
              recreation and aesthetic appreciation.
              Wetlands that form in the “deflation plains” and “swales” that are geomorphic
WETLAND,      features in areas of coastal dunes. These dune forms are the result of the
INTERDUNAL:   interaction between sand, wind, water, and plants. The dune system immediately behind
              the ocean beach (i.e., the primary dune system) is very dynamic and can change from
              storm to storm. Interdunal wetlands may provide important habitat in this ecosystem.

              Manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a site with
              the goal of returning natural or historic functions to a former or degraded wetland.
              For the purpose of tracking net gains in wetland acres, restoration is divided into:
              •   Re-establishment. Manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological
              characteristics of a site with the goal of returning natural or historic functions to
              a former wetland. Re-establishment results in a gain in wetland acres (and
WETLAND       functions). Activities could include removing fill material, plugging ditches, or
RESTORATION:  breaking drain tiles.
              •   Rehabilitation. Manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological
              characteristics of a site with the goal of repairing natural or historic functions to
              a former wetland. Rehabilitation results in a gain of wetland function but does not
              result in a gain in wetlands acres. Activities could include breaching a dike to
              reconnect wetlands to a floodplain or return tidal influences to a wetland. (Ord.

13-3-1: APPROVAL REQUIRED:
No alteration of critical areas as defined or designated by this chapter shall
occur in the absence of express approval by the City of Long Beach. Any
alteration of any critical areas as defined or designated by this chapter shall
occur only through the issuance of a development permit. For any critical areas
alteration not requiring any other land development permit, such alteration
shall not proceed in the absence of approval of a critical area alteration
permit issued under this chapter. (Ord. 985, 10-5-2020)
13-3-2: REVIEW PROCEDURES:
Following are the procedure for critical areas review.
   A.   The Director shall first determine whether the proposed activity fits
within any of the exemptions to this chapter. Some of those exemptions apply
only if the activity complies with applicable best management practices or
includes restoration after the activity is completed. If the proposed activity
meets any of the listed exemptions, including best management practices and/or
restoration requirements, no critical areas checklist or other critical areas
review is required.
   B.   If the proposed activity is not exempt, an applicant seeking a
development permit or otherwise engaging in an activity covered under this
chapter shall complete a critical areas checklist on forms to be provided by
the City. City staff will then review the checklist, available maps and other
resource information, make a site visitation, and determine whether critical
areas or their buffers are affected by the proposed activity. The applicant is
responsible for providing accurate information sufficient to make this
determination. When sufficient information to evaluate a proposal is not
available, the Director shall notify the applicant that a critical areas study
and report are required. The Director may hire at the applicant’s expense an
independent qualified professional to verify that a critical areas report is
necessary.
   C.   If a critical areas report is required, the Director may retain
independent qualified consultants at the applicant’s expense to assist in
review of studies outside the range of staff expertise.
   D.   If the checklist, maps, other references, site visitation and other
information supplied by an applicant or person otherwise engaging in an
activity covered under this chapter, do not indicate the presence of any
critical areas associated with the proposed activity, the review required
pursuant to this chapter is complete.
   E.   If at any time prior to completion of the public input process for the
proposed activity, the Director receives evidence that critical areas may be
associated with the proposed activity, the Director shall reopen the critical
areas review process pursuant to this chapter and shall require the requisite
level of critical areas review and mitigation required by this chapter. Once
the public input process is completed and the record is closed, then the City’s
determination regarding critical areas pursuant to this chapter shall be final,
unless appealed as described in section
13-3-8 of this title and pursuant to Section
11-2C-14 of Title 11, Unified Development, of the Long Beach City Code.
   F.   If the checklist, maps, site visitation, or other references indicate
that critical areas are associated with the proposed activity, then a critical
areas report shall be completed.
   G.   If, as a result of the critical areas report recommendations, a person
believes that he or she is entitled to a variance from one or more of the
requirements of this chapter, then a person may request a variance as described
in this chapter.
   H.   If, as a result of the critical areas report recommendations, a person
believes requirements of this chapter, including any request for a variance,
leave the applicant with no economically reasonable use of his property, then a
person may apply for a reasonable use exception pursuant to this chapter. (Ord.
985, 10-5-2020)
13-3-3: BONDS OR PERFORMANCE SECURITY:
   A.   Prior to issuance of any permit or approval that authorizes site
disturbance under provisions of this chapter, the City shall require
performance security to:
      1.   Assure all work or actions required by this chapter are
satisfactorily completed in accordance with the approved plans, specifications,
permit or approval conditions, and applicable regulations,
      2.   Assure all work or actions not satisfactorily completed will be
corrected to comply with the approved plans, specifications, permit or approval
conditions, and applicable regulations.
      3.   Eliminate hazardous conditions, restore environmental damage or
degradation, and protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the public.
   B.   The City may require the applicant to post a performance bond or other
security for completion of any work required to comply with this code at the
time of construction. If the development proposal is subject to mitigation, the
applicant shall post a performance bond or other security to cover long term
monitoring, maintenance, and performance to ensure mitigation is fully
functional for the duration of the monitoring period.
   C.   The performance bond shall be in the amount of one hundred twenty-five
percent (125%) of the estimated cost of the completed action, or the estimated
cost of restoring the functions and values of the critical area at risk,
whichever is greater.
   D.   The bond shall be in the form of a surety bond, performance bond,
assignment of savings account, or an irrevocable letter of credit guaranteed by
an acceptable financial institution with terms and conditions acceptable to the
City.
   E.   Bonds or other security authorized for mitigation by this section shall
remain in effect until the City determines, in writing, that standards bonded
have been met. Bonds or other security for required mitigation projects shall
be held by the City for a minimum of five (5) years to ensure the mitigation
project has been fully implemented and demonstrated to function. The bond may
be held for longer periods upon written finding by the City that it is
necessary to hold the bond to ensure the mitigation project has meet all
elements of the approved mitigation plan.
   F.   Depletion, failure, or collection of bond funds shall not discharge the
obligation of an applicant or violator to complete required mitigation,
maintenance, monitoring, or restoration.
   G.   Any failure to satisfy critical area requirements established by law or
condition including, but not limited to, the failure to provide a monitoring
report within thirty (30) days after it is due or comply with other provisions
of an approved mitigation plan shall constitute a default, and the City may
demand payment of any financial guarantees or require other action authorized
by municipal code.
   H.   Any funds recovered pursuant to this section shall be used to complete
required mitigation. (Ord. 985, 10-5-2020)
13-3-4: NOTICE ON TITLE:

buffer may exist.
   B.   The notice on title shall not be required where proposed work on
existing structures or uses is valued at less than fifty percent (50%) of the
assessed value of the existing structure or use and does not increase the area
of impact to the critical area or its buffer.
   C.   The notice on title shall not be required for a development proposal by
a public agency or public or private utility:
      1.   Located within a recorded easement or right-of-way; or
      2.   Where the agency or utility has been adjudicated the right to an
easement or right-of-way. (Ord. 985, 10-5-2020)
13-3-5: INSPECTION AND RIGHT OF ENTRY:
The Director may inspect any development activity to enforce the provisions of
this chapter. The applicant consents to entry upon the site by the Director
during regular business hours for the purposes of making reasonable inspections
to verify information provided by the applicant and to verify that work is
being performed in accordance with the approved plans and permits and
requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 985, 10-5-2020)
13-3-6: ENFORCEMENT:
   A.   Provisions of the Long Beach City Code, Title 14, Penalties, shall
regulate enforcement of these Critical Areas Regulations.
   B.   Adherence to the provisions of this chapter and to the project
conditions of approval shall be required throughout construction of the
development; non-adherence to same shall constitute a violation. Should the
Director determine that a violation has occurred, a stop work order may be
issued.
   C.   When a stop work order has been issued, construction shall not continue
until such time as the violation has been corrected and measures have been
taken to assure the same or similar violation is not likely to reoccur.
   D.   In the event of a violation, the Director shall have the power to order
complete restoration of the critical area by the person responsible for the
violation. If such responsible person does not complete such restoration within
a reasonable time following the order, the Director shall have the authority to
restore the affected critical area to the prior condition wherever practicable,
and the person responsible for the original violation shall be indebted to the
City for the cost of restoration. The City may lien the property for the full
cost of restoration, pursuant to the process described in Title 14, Penalties.
(Ord. 985, 10-5-2020)

sewage disposal systems, water systems, drainage facilities, ponds, flood
control facilities, electric and communications facilities, public and private
roads and driveways, and improved areas accessory to a single family
residential use including, but not limited to, landscaping, yard maintenance,
and gardening is exempt. However, any person engaging in maintenance or repair
activities shall use reasonable methods with the least practicable impact to
critical areas. Any impacted critical area or its buffer shall be restored
after the completion of maintenance/repair activities to the maximum extent
practicable.
   D.   Modification, expansion, or replacement of any building in existence
prior to July 1, 1990 that does not expand the building footprint area by more
than fifteen percent (15%) or increase septic effluent according to Chapter
246-272 WAC is exempt, provided the following:
      1.   For existing buildings to be modified/expanded that are not located
in the critical area, no portion of the expansion or modification shall be
located closer to the critical area.
      2.   For existing buildings to be modified/expanded that are located in
the critical area or its buffer, no portion of the modification or expansion
shall extend further into the critical area and shall not result in an increase
in impact to the critical area.
      3.   For replacement of an existing building or manufactured home, the
replacement shall not increase the number of bedrooms or exacerbate
nonconformity with critical area setbacks or buffer standards identified in
this title.
      A person granted an exemption under this section for a building cannot
receive another exemption under this section for the same building unless ten
(10) years has elapsed from the date of the previous exemption.
   E.   Passive recreation such as hiking, fishing, wildlife viewing, and
scientific and educational endeavors that does not involve construction of
trails, or similar minimal impact, non-development activities is exempt.
   F.   Construction or modification of navigational aids and boundary markers
is exempt.
   G.   Site investigation or data collection necessary for land use
applications such as surveys, soil logs, percolation tests and other related
activities is exempt. However, critical area impacts shall be minimized and
disturbed areas shall be restored to the maximum extent practicable.
   H.   Existing on-going agricultural operations including related development
and activities that do not result in expansion into a critical area or its
buffer or do not result in an increase in impact to a critical area are exempt.

13-3-10: EXCEPTIONS:
Certain developments, activities, or associated uses not exempted from
provisions of this title as described in section
13-3-9, may nevertheless be excepted from its provisions under specific
conditions and circumstances identified in this section, provided they are
consistent with the provisions of other applicable local, state, and federal
laws and requirements. Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis and
depending on circumstances, by the Director of Community Development or by the
Hearing Examiner:
   A.   Exceptions Considered by the Director. An Applicant shall submit a
written request for exception that describes the proposed activity and
identifies the exception that applies. The Director shall review the exception
requested to verify that it complies with this title and shall approve or deny
the exception in writing. Exceptions may be requested of the Director for the
following:
      1.   Single family residential building permits for new structures.
Construction of a new residential structure where construction and associated
disturbance does not increase the footprint of any existing structure, and
which is not located within a designated Wetlands, Fish and Wildlife Habitat
Conservation, or Frequently Flooded critical area or its buffer.
      2.   Modification, expansion, or replacement of structures constructed
after July 1, 1990. Structural modifications/expansion or replacement of an
existing single-family residential structure where the footprint of the
structure does not increase; the modification/expansion or the replacement
structure is not located closer to the critical area than the existing
structure; the existing impervious surface within the critical area or buffer
is not expanded; and which is not located within a designated Wetlands, Fish
and Wildlife Habitat Conservation, or Frequently Flooded critical area or its
buffer.
      3.   Operation, maintenance or repair of dikes, levees, or drainage
systems, including routine vegetation management activities when performed in
accordance with approved best management practices, if the activity does not
increase risk to life, property, or the environment as a result of the proposed
operation, maintenance, or repair.
      4.   Activities within the improved right-of-way. Replacement,
modification, installation or construction of utility facilities, lines, pipes,
mains, and equipment or appurtenances - but not including substations - when
such facilities are located within the improved portion of the public right-of-
way or a city-approved private roadway, except those activities that alter a
wetland or watercourse, such as culverts or bridges, or result in the transport
of sediment or increased stormwater, subject to the following:
         a.   The activity shall result in the least practicable impact and
have no practical alternative with less impact on the critical area and/or its
buffer;
         b.   An additional, contiguous and undisturbed critical area buffer
shall be provided, equal in area to the disturbed critical area buffer; and
         c.   Retention and replanting of native vegetation shall occur
wherever possible along the right-of-way improvement and resulting disturbance.
      5.   Minor utility projects. Utility projects that result in minor or
short-term impacts (short-term meaning of less than 3 months’ duration) to
critical areas, as determined by the Director in accordance with the criteria
below, and that do not significantly impact the functions and values of a
critical area(s), such as the placement of a utility pole, street sign, anchor,
vault, or other small component of a utility facility; provided that such
projects are constructed with best management practices and additional
restoration measures are provided. Minor activities shall not result in the
transport of sediment or increased stormwater runoff. Such exceptions shall
meet the following criteria:
         a.   There is no practical alternative to the proposed activity with
less adverse impacts to critical areas, and all feasible attempts have been
made to first avoid impacts, minimize impacts, and lastly mitigate unavoidable
impacts;
         b.   The activity will not change or diminish the overall critical
area hydrology or flood storage capacity;
         c.   The project shall be designed and constructed to prevent spills
and leaks into critical areas;
         d.   The activity will not reduce the existing functions and values of
the affected critical areas;
         e.   To the maximum extent practicable, utility corridor access for
maintenance is at limited access points into the critical area buffer rather
than by a parallel access road; and
         f.   Unavoidable impacts will be mitigated pursuant to an approved
mitigation plan.
      6.   Non-emergency hazardous tree removal, provided the hazard is
documented by a certified arborist or professional forester.
      7.   Enhancement and restoration activities for the purpose of restoring
functions and values of critical area(s) that do not require construction
permits.
   B.   Exceptions Considered by the Hearing Examiner. An Applicant shall
submit a written request for exception that describes the proposed activity and
identifies the exception that applies. After holding a public hearing pursuant
to Section
11-2C-11 of Title 11, Unified Development, Long Beach City Code Exceptions may
be requested of the Hearing Examiner for the following:
      1.   Public Agency or Utility Exception. If the application of this title
would prohibit a development proposal by a public agency or public utility that
is essential to its ability to provide service, the agency or utility may apply
for an exception pursuant to this section.
      2.   Reasonable Use. If the application of this chapter would deny all
reasonable use of the property, the applicant may apply for an exception
pursuant to this section. The Hearing Examiner may approve the exception after
finding that:
         a.   This title would otherwise deny all reasonable use of the
property;
         b.   There is no other reasonable use consistent with the underlying
zoning of the property that has less adverse impact on the critical area and/or
associated buffer;
         c.   The proposed development does not pose an unreasonable threat to
the public health, safety or welfare on or off the property;
         d.   Any proposed alteration is the minimum necessary to allow for
reasonable use of the property;
         e.   The inability of the applicant to derive reasonable use of the
property is not the result of actions by the applicant after the effective date
of this chapter or its predecessor; and
         f.   The requested exception provides relief not otherwise available
from a variance approval.
      3.   Variance. Where unavoidable adverse impacts to wetlands, streams,
fish and wildlife habitat or critical aquifer recharge areas occur, a variance
shall be obtained to permit the impact. Variances shall be considered as set
forth in Section
11-2D-1 of Title 11, Unified Development, of the Long Beach City Code, except
that required findings shall be as set forth in this section. Variances will be
granted on the basis of a finding of consistency with all criteria listed
below. The Hearing Examiner shall not consider the fact the property may be
utilized more profitably.
         a.   The variance shall not constitute a grant of special privilege
inconsistent with the limitation on use of other properties similarly affected
by the code provision for which a variance is requested;
         b.   That such variance is necessary, because of special circumstances
and/or conditions relating to the size, shape, topography, environmentally
sensitive areas, location, or surroundings of the subject property, to provide
it with those relative rights and privileges permitted to other properties in
the vicinity and in the zone in which the subject property is located. The
phrase “relative rights and privileges” is to ensure that the property rights
and privileges for the subject property are considered primarily in relation to
current City land-use regulations;
         c.   That special conditions and/or circumstances identified in
paragraph b. (immediately above) of this section giving rise to the variance
application do not result from the actions of the applicant, property owner, or
recent prior owner(s) of the subject property;
         d.   That granting of the variance will not be materially detrimental
to the public welfare or injurious to the property, neighborhood, or
improvements in the vicinity and zone in which subject property is situated;
         e.   That reasons set forth in the application and the official record
justify the granting of the variance, and that the variance is the minimum
variance necessary to grant relief to the applicant;
         f.   That alternative development concepts in compliance with
applicable codes have been evaluated, and that undue hardship would result if
strict adherence to the applicable codes is required; and
         g.   That granting of the variance will not adversely affect
implementation of the comprehensive plan or policies adopted thereto and the
general purpose and intent of the zoning title or other applicable regulations.
   C.   The Hearing Examiner may approve the exception if the hearing examiner
finds that:
      1.   There is no other practical alternative to the proposed development
with less impact on the critical area(s), based on the demonstration by the
applicant of the following factors:
         a.   The applicant has considered all reasonably possible construction
techniques based on available technology that are feasible for the proposed
project and eliminated any that would result in unreasonable risk of impact to
the critical area; and
         b.   The applicant has considered all available sites and alignments
within the range of potential sites and alignments that meet the project
purpose and for which operating rights are available.
      2.   The proposal minimizes and mitigates unavoidable impacts to critical
areas and/or critical areas buffers.
   D.   Mitigation Required. Any authorized alteration to a wetland or stream
or its associated buffer, or alteration to a fish and wildlife habitat
conservation area, as allowed under an exception granted under this section,
shall be subject to conditions established by the City and shall require
mitigation under an approved mitigation plan pursuant to this Title. (Ord. 985,
10-5-2020; amd. Ord. 1036, 8-19-2024)
13-3-11: NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES:
   A.   Purpose. The purpose of this section establishes the terms and
conditions for continuing non-conforming uses, structures and lots located
within designated critical areas that are lawfully established prior to the
effective date of this title.
   B.   Establishment of Status. A legally established non-conforming lot, use,
or non-signage structure may be continued, transferred, or conveyed and/or used
as if conforming. The burden of establishing that any non-conforming lot, use
or non-signage structure lawfully existed as of the effective date of this
chapter shall, in all cases, rest with the owner and not with the City. A non-
conforming lot, use, or structure may be deemed legally non-conforming by
providing documentation from either a local agency permit or suitable aerial
photo or scaled map recognized as legitimate by the City.
   C.   Maintenance and Repair of Non-Conforming Structures. Normal maintenance
and incidental repair of legal non-conforming structures shall be permitted,
provided that it complies with all sections of this Title and other applicable
Titles of the Long Beach City Code.
   D.   Reconstruction. Reconstruction, restoration or repair (and remodeling)
of a legal non-conforming non-signage structure damaged by fire, flood,
earthquake, falling trees or limbs, or other disasters, shall be permitted,
subject to the provisions of Section
12-16-6, Title 12, Zoning, of the Long Beach City Code and of this title;
provided that such reconstruction shall not result in the expansion of the non-
conforming structure into or towards the critical area, or in a manner that
increases the potential impact to the critical area or risk of harm to public
safety. Legal non-conforming status will be lost if a building permit is not
secured within one year of the date damage is incurred.
   E.   Expansion of Non-Conforming Use or Structure. No legal non-conforming
use or structure may be expanded, enlarged, extended, or intensified in any way
(including extension of hours of operation) unless such modification is in full
compliance with this chapter or the terms and conditions of approved permits
pursuant to this chapter.
   F.   Discontinuance of Non-Conforming Use or Structure. All legal non-
conforming uses shall be encouraged to convert to a conforming use whenever
possible. Conformance shall be required when:
      1.   A change of use is proposed;
      2.   The use is terminated or discontinued for more than one (1) year, or
the structure(s) that houses the use is vacated for more than one (1) year;
      3.   The structure(s) or area in which the use is conducted is proposed
for relocation; or
      4.   In the circumstance of a sign structure, in accordance with Chapter
12-14-12 of the Long Beach City Code. (Ord. 985, 10-5-2020)
13-3-12: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   All proposed alterations of critical areas shall include mitigation
sufficient to maintain the functional values of the critical area or to prevent
risk from a critical area hazard and shall give adequate consideration to the
economically viable use of the property. Mitigation of one critical area impact
should not result in unmitigated impacts to another critical area. Mitigation
may include, but is not limited to: increasing or enhancing buffers, increasing
building setbacks, instituting limits on clearing and grading, implementing
best management practices for erosion control and maintenance of water quality,
or other conditions appropriate to avoid or mitigate identified adverse
impacts. Subject to the reasonable use exception provisions of this chapter,
any proposed critical area alteration that cannot adequately mitigate its
impacts to a critical area shall be denied.
   B.   Mitigation includes the following processes of correcting the effects
of adverse environmental impact(s) to critical areas, in order of preference:
      1.   Avoid the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts
of an action;
      2.   Minimize the impact by limiting the degree or magnitude of the
action and its implementation via the use of appropriate technology, or by
taking affirmative steps such as project redesign, relocation, or timing;
      3.   Reduce or eliminate the original impact over time via preservation
and maintenance operations during the life of the action;
      4.   Rectify the impact via repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the
affected environment to the historical conditions or the conditions existing at
the time of project initiation;
      5.   Compensate for the impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing
substitute resources or environments; and/or
   Mitigation by reduction, rectification, or compensation must be monitored
for success and remedial action taken when necessary (adaptive management).
   C.   Buffers:
      1.   Buffers in some cases have been determined to be necessary and
appropriate to protect critical areas and their functions or to prevent risk
from a critical area hazard. In those sections of this Title where specific
buffers are identified, those buffers are deemed “required” or “ standard”
buffers. If a project does not propose any alteration of those buffers or of
the associated critical area, then no additional mitigation will be required to
protect the critical area. The standard buffer widths presume the existence of
a relatively intact native vegetation community in the buffer zone adequate to
protect the critical area functions and values at the time of the proposed
activity. If the vegetation or protection area is inadequate, the City may
require an increase in the buffer width or additional native plantings within
the standard buffer width. Provisions to reduce or to average buffer widths in
order to obtain optimal habitat value are described under the development
standards for each critical area.
      2.   The Director will consider wetland or stream buffer averaging for a
proposal only when the buffer area width after averaging will not adversely
impact the critical area or buffer functions and values. At a minimum, any
proposed buffer averaging shall meet the following criteria:
         a.   The buffer area after averaging is no less than that which would
be contained within the standard buffer;
         b.   The buffer area shall be enhanced where the buffer is averaged;
         c.   The additional buffer is contiguous with the standard buffer; and
         d.   Encroachment does not occur into the buffer of an associated
wetland except as otherwise allowed.
      3.   The Director may require increased buffer sizes as necessary to
protect critical areas when either the critical area is particularly sensitive
to disturbance or the development poses unusual impacts. Examples of
circumstances that may require buffers beyond minimum requirements include, but
are not limited to:
         a.   Uses unclassified in the Zoning Code (Title 12 of the Long Beach
City Code);
         b.   The critical area is in a critical drainage basin or documented
salmonid spawning or rearing habitat;
         c.   The critical area is a critical fish or wildlife habitat for
spawning or rearing as determined by the Washington Department of Fish and
Wildlife;
         d.   The land adjacent to the critical area and its associated buffer,
and located within the development proposal, is classified as an erosion hazard
area; or
         e.   A trail or utility corridor in excess of ten percent (10%) of the
buffer width is proposed for inclusion in the buffer.
      4.   The Director may reduce up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the
critical area buffer requirement for high intensity land uses only, and only if
sufficient information is available showing the following in a critical area
study:
         a.   The applicant has demonstrated that mitigation sequencing efforts
have been appropriately utilized: avoid, minimize, rectify, reduce, and/or
compensate, with monitoring and adaptive management for the latter three types
of mitigation;
         b.   The proposed buffer reduction shall be accompanied by a
mitigation plan per this chapter that includes enhancement of the reduced
buffer area, except that mitigation for wetland buffer area reductions shall be
governed by the provisions of Section
13-4-4(B) of this title;
         c.   The reduction will not adversely affect water quality;
         d.   The reduction will not destroy, damage, or disrupt a significant
habitat area;
         e.   The reduction is necessary for reasonable development of the
subject property; and
         f.   Additional specific buffer reduction criteria for wetlands have
been satisfied as set forth in Section
13-4-4(B) of this title.
      5.   Where a functionally isolated buffer area (FIBA) exists, the minimum
buffer width may be reduced to the edge of the isolating road, structure, or
grade separation, if that portion of the buffer sought to be reduced:
         a.   Does not provide additional protection to the proposed
development or the critical area; and
         b.   Does not perform any biological, geological, or hydrological
buffer functions to undisturbed portions of the critical area or its buffer.
      6.   If a person seeks a variance to reduce buffers or to alter the
critical area or its required buffer, then the person shall demonstrate why the
proposed buffer and/or critical area modification, together with alternative
mitigation proposed in the critical areas report, is sufficient to adequately
protect the function(s) of the critical area. If necessary, variances shall
provide for long-term buffer protection.
      7.   Critical areas assessments and conditions of approval shall provide
for long-term buffer protection. In land division, critical areas and their
associated buffers may be placed in one or more separate tracts to be owned and
maintained by all lot owners in common, by a homeowners association, or some
other separate legal entity such as a land trust.
      8.   Periodic inspection of buffers may be required if necessary to
ensure long-term buffer protection.
   D.   Building Setback Line. Unless otherwise specified, a minimum of fifteen
(15) feet is required from the edge of any buffer or separate critical area
tract.
   E.   Land Segregation. Subdivisions, short subdivisions, boundary line
adjustments, and planned residential developments of land in critical areas and
associated buffers are subject to the following:
      1.   Land located wholly within a wetland or stream critical area or
associated buffer may not be subdivided.
      2.   Land located partially within a wetland or stream critical area or
associated buffer area may be subdivided or the boundary line adjusted provided
that an accessible and contiguous portion of each new or adjusted lot is
located outside the critical area and buffer, and is large enough to
accommodate the intended use.
      3.   Accessory roads and utilities serving a proposed subdivision may be
permitted within the wetland or stream critical area and/or associated buffer
only if the City determines that no other feasible alternative exists based on
the applicant securing an exception consistent with this title.
      4.   Critical Area Tracts. Critical areas tracts are legally created non-
building lots containing critical areas and their buffers that shall remain
undeveloped pursuant to the provisions of this title. Separate critical area
tracts are not intended for sale, lease or transfer; and shall be incorporated
in the area of the parent lot for purposes of subdivision and method of
allocation and minimum lot size. The following development proposals shall
identify such areas as separate tracts:
         a.   Subdivisions.
         b.   Short subdivisions.
         c.   Contract rezones.
         d.   Binding site improvement plans.
         e.   Master site plans.
         f.   Site plan/design review.
      Responsibility for maintaining critical area tracts shall accrue to a
homeowners association, adjacent parent lot owners, the permit applicant or
designee, or other appropriate entity as approved by the City.
      The following note shall appear on the face of all plats, binding site
improvement plans, master site plans, site plan/design review, or contract
rezones and shall be recorded on the title for all affected lots:
      NOTE: All lots adjoining separate tracts identified as Critical Area
Tracts are jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance and protection
of the tracts. Maintenance includes ensuring that no alteration occurs within
the separate tract and that vegetation remains undisturbed unless the express
written permission of the City of Long Beach has been received.
   F.   Marking and/or Fencing Critical Areas
      1.   Temporary Markers. In order to prevent unauthorized intrusion during
construction, the perimeter of a wetland, stream, fish and wildlife
conservation area, steep slope, as well as the associated buffer and the limit
of the area to be disturbed pursuant to an approved permit or authorization,
shall be marked on site in a manner approved by the City. Markers or fencing
shall be subject to inspection by the Director or his designee prior to
commencement of permitted activities. This temporary marking shall be
maintained throughout construction and shall not be removed until ordered by
the Director, or until permanent signs and/or fencing, if required, are in
place.
      2.   Permanent Markers. Following approved development or alteration, the
outer perimeter of the undisturbed critical area or buffer shall be permanently
identified. This identification shall be permanent wood or metal signs on
treated wood or metal posts. Signs shall be worded as follows:
      Critical Area Boundary
      This natural area is a valuable resource and its protection is in your
care. Alteration or disturbance is prohibited, as is removal of this sign. For
more information, call the City of Long Beach: 360/642-4421.
      The Director shall approve sign locations during review of the
development proposal. Along residential boundaries, the signs shall be at least
12" X 18" in size and spaced one per centerline of lot or every seventy five
feet (75') for lots whose boundaries exceed one-hundred-fifty feet (150'). At
road endings, crossings, and other areas where public access to the critical
area is allowed, the sign shall be the size of a regulatory traffic sign or
larger and spaced one every seventy-five feet (75').
      3.   Permanent Fencing. Where there is substantial evidence that
destructive intrusion into a critical area would occur with a specific
development proposal, the Director shall require permanent fencing of the
critical area. The Director shall also require such fencing when, subsequent to
approval of the development proposal, intrusions threaten conservation of
critical areas. The Director may use any appropriate and legal enforcement
actions including, but not limited, to fines, abatement, or permit denial to
ensure compliance. The fencing may provide limited access to the stream or
wetland for stock watering purposes, but shall minimize bank disturbance.
   G.   Critical Areas Studies/Reports
      1.   Timing of Studies. When an applicant submits an application for a
development proposal, it shall indicate whether any critical areas or buffers
are located on or could be adjacent to the subject site. The presence of
critical areas may require additional studies and time for review. However,
disclosure of critical areas early will reduce delays during the permit review
process. If the applicant states there are no known critical areas, further
studies may be required for verification.
      2.   Studies Required.
         a.   When sufficient information to evaluate a proposal is not
available, the Director shall notify the applicant that a critical areas study
and report is required. The Director may hire, at the applicant’s expense, an
independent qualified professional to verify that a critical areas report is
necessary.
         b.   If a critical areas report is required, the Director may retain
independent qualified consultants, at the applicant’s expense, to assist in
review of studies that are outside the range of staff expertise.
         c.   A critical areas report shall be written by a qualified
professional, as defined in this title. A critical areas report shall include
all information required pursuant to this section. Where mitigation is
required, a monitoring and maintenance program shall be required to evaluate
the effectiveness of mitigation measures.
         d.   Studies/reports generated as part of an expanded SEPA
environmental checklist or an environmental impact statement may qualify as a
critical areas report if the project is developed in enough detail to have
provided an evaluation of site-specific impacts and mitigation measures.
      3.   General Critical Areas Report Requirements.
         a.   A critical areas report shall have three components: a) a site
analysis, b) an impact analysis, and c) proposed mitigation measures. The
required level of detail in the report shall depend on the size of the project,
intensity of development, and potential impacts. The Director may waive the
requirement of any component of the critical areas report when adequate
information is otherwise available.
         b.   In addition to requirements presented in the specific section of
this title for each type of critical area, all studies shall contain the
following information unless it is already available in the permit application:

               (N)   Description of local, state, and federal regulations and
permit requirements.
   H.   General Mitigation Requirements. The following section provides general
mitigation requirements applicable to alteration of critical areas. Additional
mitigation requirements are found in this title under the specific section for
each type of critical area.
      1.   Restoration/rehabilitation is required when a critical area or its
buffer has been altered on the site in violation of City regulations prior to
development approval or during construction. At a minimum, all impacted areas
shall be restored to their previous condition pursuant to an approved
mitigation plan.
      2.   Restoration/rehabilitation is required when the critical area or it
buffer will be temporarily altered during the construction of an approved
development proposal. At a minimum, all impacted areas shall be restored to
their previous condition pursuant to an approved mitigation plan.
      3.   Compensation. The goal of compensation is no net loss of critical
area and/or buffer function on the development site. Compensation includes
replacement or enhancement of the critical area or its buffer depending on the
scope of the approved alteration and what is needed to maintain or improve the
critical area and/or buffer functions. Compensation for approved critical area
or buffer alterations shall meet the following minimum performance standards
and shall occur pursuant to an approved mitigation plan:
         a.   The buffer for a created, restored, or enhanced critical area as
compensation for approved alterations shall be the same as the buffer required
for the category of the created, restored, or enhanced critical area (i.e.,
compensation for buffer impacts, other than buffer averaging, shall occur at a
minimum ratio of 1:1). For purposes of restoration, creation, or enhancement,
buffers shall be fully vegetated with a relatively intact native plant
community.
         b.   All critical area impacts shall be compensated for through
restoration or creation of replacement areas that are in-kind and of a similar
or better critical area category, preferably either on-site or within the same
drainage basin. Mitigation shall be timed prior to or concurrent with the
approved alteration and shall have a high probability of success.
         c.   The Director may consider and approve off-site compensation where
the applicant demonstrates that greater biological and hydrological functions
and values will be achieved off-site compared to on-site. The compensation may
include restoration, creation, or enhancement of critical areas. Compensatory
mitigation ratios specified for each critical area shall be the minimum applied
to off-site compensation.
         d.   Increased Compensatory Mitigation Ratios. The Director may
increase mitigation ratios specified under the compensation section of this
title for each critical area, under any one of the following circumstances:
            (1)   Uncertainty exists as to the probable success of the proposed
restoration or creation due to an unproven methodology;
            (2)   A significant period will elapse between impact and
replication of wetland functions;
            (3)   Proposed mitigation will result in a lower category critical
area classification or reduced functions relative to the critical area being
impacted; or
            (4)   The impact was unauthorized.
         e.   Decreased Compensatory Mitigation Ratios. The Director may
decrease mitigation ratios specified under the compensation section of this
title for each critical area, except for the compensatory mitigation ratios in
Section
13-4-7(F)(4) of this title, when all the following criteria are met:
            (1)   A minimum mitigation ratio of 1:1 will be maintained;
            (2)   Documentation by a qualified specialist demonstrates the
proposed mitigation actions have a high rate of success;
            (3)   Documentation by a qualified specialist demonstrates the
proposed mitigation actions will provide functions and values that are
substantially greater than the critical area being impacted; and
            (4)   The proposed mitigation actions are conducted in advance of
the impact.
         f.   Critical Area Enhancement as Mitigation.
            (1)   Impacts to critical areas may be mitigated by enhancement of
existing substantially degraded critical areas only after a 1:1 minimum acreage
compensatory mitigation ratio has been satisfied. Applicants proposing to
enhance critical areas must produce a critical areas report that identifies how
enhancement will increase functions and values of degraded critical areas and
how this increase will adequately mitigate for loss of critical area function
at the impact site.
            (2)   At a minimum, enhancement acreage shall be double the acreage
required for creation and restoration specified under the compensation section
of this title for each critical area. The ratios shall be greater than the
minimum required acreage when the enhancement proposal would result in only
nominal or modest gain in the performance of critical area functions currently
provided in the critical area as determined by the Director.
         g.   Mitigation Timing. Mitigation shall be completed prior to or
immediately following disturbances, and prior to use or occupancy of the
activity or development, or when seasonally appropriate. Construction of
mitigation projects shall be timed to reduce impacts to existing fisheries,
wildlife, and water quality.
         h.   The buffer for a created, restored, or enhanced critical area as
compensation for approved alterations shall be the same as the buffer required
for the category of the created, restored, or enhanced critical area. For
purposes of restoration, creation, or enhancement, buffers shall be fully
vegetated and shall not include lawns, walkways, driveways and other mowed or
paved areas.
         i.   Best Available Science. Any approval of mitigation to compensate
for impacts to a critical area or its buffer shall be supported by the best
available science.
   I.   Mitigation Plans:
      1.   Mitigation or alterations to critical areas shall achieve equivalent
or greater biological functions, and where relevant shall include mitigation
for adverse impacts upstream and downstream of the development proposal site.
In order to minimize isolating effects of development on habitat areas,
mitigation sites for wetlands, streams, and fish and wildlife habitat
conservation critical areas shall be located to achieve contiguous habitat
corridors in accordance with a mitigation plan that is part of an approved
critical areas report. Mitigation of aquatic habitat shall be located within
the same aquatic ecosystem as the area disturbed. Mitigation shall address each
function affected by the alteration to achieve no net loss of function or
improvement of function on a per-function basis.
      2.   The scope and content of a mitigation plan shall be decided on a
case-by-case basis. During the review of required critical areas studies/
reports, the City shall determine which of the components listed in section c.,
immediately below, shall be required as part of the mitigation plan. Key
factors in this determination shall be the size and nature of the development
proposal, the size and nature of the impacted critical areas, and the degree of
cumulative impacts on the critical area from other development proposals.
Cumulative impacts shall be determined based on the combined effects of past
development, the current development proposal, and any reasonably foreseeable
development likely to impact the affected critical area.
      3.   At a minimum, the following components shall be included in a
complete mitigation plan:
         a.   Baseline Information. Provide existing conditions information for
both the impacted critical areas and the proposed mitigation site as described
in the sections of this title for each critical area.”
         b.   Environmental Goals and Objectives. Include a written report
identifying environmental goals and objectives of the compensation proposed,
including:
            (1)   A description of the anticipated impacts to the critical
areas, the mitigating actions proposed, and the purposes of the compensation
measures, including the site selection criteria, identification of compensation
goals, identification of resource functions, and dates for beginning and
completing site compensation construction activities. The goals and objectives
shall be related to the functions and values of the impacted critical area.
            (2)   A review of the best available science supporting the
proposed mitigation.
         c.   Performance Standards. The mitigation plan shall include
measurable criteria for evaluating whether or not goals and objectives of the
mitigation project have been successfully attained and whether or not
requirements of this chapter have been met. They may include water quality
standards, species richness and diversity targets, habitat diversity indices,
or other ecological, geological, or hydrological criteria.
         d.   Detailed Construction Plan. These are the written specifications
and descriptions of mitigation technique. This plan should include the proposed
construction sequencing, grading and excavation details, erosion and
sedimentation control features, a native planting plan, detailed site diagrams,
and any other drawings appropriate to show construction techniques or
anticipated final outcome.
         e.   Monitoring and/or Evaluation Program. The mitigation plan shall
include a program for monitoring construction of the compensation project, and
for assessing a completed project, as detailed in this section.
         f.   Contingency Plan. This section shall identify potential courses
of action and any corrective measures to be taken when monitoring or evaluation
indicates projected performance standards have not been met.
   J.   Monitoring:
      1.   The City shall require long-term monitoring of mitigation. Such
monitoring shall be an element of the required mitigation plan and shall
document and track impacts of development on the functions and values of
critical areas, and the success or failure of mitigation requirements.
Monitoring may include, but is not limited to:
         a.   Establishing vegetation transects or plots to track changes in
plant species composition over time.
         b.   Using aerial or other photography to evaluate vegetation
community response.
         c.   Sampling surface and/or ground waters to determine pollutant
loading.
         d.   Measuring base flow rates and stormwater runoff to model and
evaluate water quantity predictions.
         e.   Measuring sedimentation rates.
         f.   Sampling fish and wildlife populations to determine habitat
utilization, species abundance, and diversity.
         g.   Sampling water temperatures of wetlands and streams.
      2.   The property owner shall submit monitoring data and reports to the
City on an annual basis or other schedule as required by the Director and
specified in an approved mitigation plan. Monitoring shall continue for a
minimum period of five (5) years, or until mitigation performance standards
have been met. In the case of forested systems, monitoring may be expected to
be greater than 5 years, and may be for 10 years or longer.
   3.   Performance Bond. Prior to issuance of any permit or approval that
authorizes site disturbance under this title, the Director shall require
performance security as specified in this title.
   K.   Adaptive Management. When monitoring reveals a significant deviation
from predicted results or a failure of mitigation measures, the applicant shall
be responsible for appropriate corrective action. Contingency plans should
address reasonably foreseeable failure of mitigation measures. Contingency
measures developed as part of the original mitigation plan shall apply but may
be modified to address a specific deviation or failure. Contingency measures
shall be subject to monitoring requirements to the same extent as the original
mitigation measures.
   L.   Habitat Management Plans:
      1.   A Habitat Management Plan shall be required by the Director when
review of a development proposal determines the proposed activity will have an
adverse impact on a fish and wildlife habitat conservation critical area.
      2.   A Habitat Management Plan, prepared by a qualified biologist in
consultation with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, shall address
all of the following mitigation measures:
         a.   Reduction or limitation of development activities within critical
areas and buffers.
         b.   Use of low impact development techniques or clustering of
development on the subject property to locate structures in a manner that
preserves and minimizes adverse impacts to habitat.
         c.   Seasonal restrictions on construction activities.
         d.   Preservation and retention of habitat and vegetation on the
subject property in contiguous blocks or with connection to other habitats that
have a primary association with a listed species.
         e.   Establishment of expanded buffers around the critical area.
         f.   Limitation of access to the critical area and buffer.
         g.   Creation or restoration of habitat area for listed species. (Ord.

The purpose of this section is to establish standards and procedures protective
of wetlands, which serve a number of important beneficial functions, including
flood attenuation, stormwater retention, erosion protection, fish and wildlife
habitat, aquifer recharge, water quality protection, and recreation. (Ord. 985,
10-5-2020)
13-4-2: DESIGNATION:
Determination of wetland ratings will be based on the entire extent of
wetlands, unrelated to property lines or ownership patterns. For the purpose of
categorization, wetlands shall be designated according to the Washington State
Wetland Rating System for Western Washington (Washington State Department of
Ecology, 2014 Update, Publication No. 14-06-029, or as revised by Ecology):
Wetlands shall be designated as follows:
   A.   Category I - those wetlands that meet one or more of the following
criteria:
      1.   Wetlands that score 23 or more points (out of 27) in the most
current edition of the Washington State Wetland Ratings System for Western
Washington;
      2.   Relatively undisturbed estuarine wetlands larger than 1 acre;
      3.   Wetlands identified by scientists of the Washington Natural Heritage
Program/DNR as wetlands of high conservation value;
      4.   Natural bogs;
      5.   Mature and old growth forested wetlands larger than 1 acre;
      6.   Interdunal wetlands that score 8 or 9 habitat points and are larger
than 1 acre in size; or
      7.   Wetlands in coastal lagoons.
   B.   Category II - those wetlands that meet any one or more of the following
criteria:
      1.   Wetlands that score between 20 and 22 points in the most current
edition of the Washington State Wetland Ratings System for Western Washington;
      2.   Estuarine wetlands smaller than 1 acre, or disturbed estuarine
wetlands larger than 1 acre in size;
      3.   An interdunal wetland larger than 1 acre, or in a mosaic of
wetlands.
   C.   Category III -those wetlands that meet any one or more of the following
criteria:
      1.   Wetlands that score between 16 and 19 points in the most current
edition of the Washington State Wetland Ratings System for Western Washington;
or
      2.   Interdunal wetlands between 0.1 and 1 acre in size, or in a mosaic
of wetlands that is between 0.1 and 1 ac in size.
   D.   Category IV -those wetlands that score less than 16 points in the most
current edition of the Washington State Wetland Ratings System for Western
Washington. (Ord. 985, 10-5-2020)
13-4-3: IDENTIFICATION:
   A.   Required wetland buffer widths shall reflect the natural functions and
values of the wetland, the sensitivity of the area and resource, and the risks
associated with development. In addition, in those circumstances permitted by
these regulations, the type and intensity of human activity and site design
proposed to be conducted on or near the wetland shall be reflected in the
required buffer width. Standard buffer widths presume the existence of a
relatively intact native vegetation community in the buffer zone adequate to
protect wetland functions and values at the time of the proposed activity. If
vegetation is inadequate, the buffer width shall be increased or the buffer
planted with appropriate vegetation to maintain the standard width to meet
needed buffer functions.
   B.   Small Wetlands Exempt from Buffer Requirements.
      1.   Wetlands are exempt from buffer requirements if they are less than
1,000 square feet in area, and it has been shown by the applicant that they:
         a.   are not associated with a riparian corridor;
         b.   are not part of a wetland mosaic; and
         c.   do not contain habitat identified as essential for local
populations of priority species identified by Washington Department of Fish and
Wildlife.
      2.   The requirement to avoid impacts pursuant to mitigation sequencing,
may be dropped for Category 3 and 4 wetlands between 1,000 and 4,000 square
feet that meet all of the following criteria:
         a.   Wetland is not associated with a riparian corridor;
         b.   Wetland is not part of a wetland mosaic;
         c.   Wetland does not score 5 points or greater for habitat in the
2014 Western Washington Rating System; and
         d.   Wetland does not contain habitat identified as essential for
local populations of priority species identified by Washington Department of
Fish and Wildlife.
      3.   Impacts allowed under this provision to these wetlands will be fully
mitigated as required in mitigation Section
13-4-7.
   C.   The standard wetland buffer width shall apply for wetlands not found
exempt under Section
13-4-4(B), except in cases where, pursuant to the buffer width reduction
provisions in Section 13-3-12-(C)(4) of this title, the Director determines the
standard wetland buffer width may be reduced up to a maximum of twenty five
percent (25%) for high intensity land uses only, provided the applicant meets
all other provisions of this chapter and can demonstrate through a wetlands
report based on best available science that a smaller area is adequate to
protect wetland functions, and the proposal includes all applicable following
measures to minimize impacts:
      1.   Lights are directed away from the wetland;
      2.   Noise-generating activities are directed away from the wetland;
      3.   Infiltrate or treat, detain, and disperse runoff into the wetland
from impervious surfaces;
      4.   Route all new untreated runoff away from the wetland while ensuring
wetland is not dewatered;
      5.   Covenants limiting the use of pesticides within 150 feet of the
wetland;
      6.   Utilize integrated pest management
      7.   Utilize privacy fencing or landscaping to delineate buffer edge and
to discourage disturbance of wildlife by humans and pets;
      8.   Prevent flow from lawns from directly entering buffer;
      9.   Use low intensity development (LID)techniques;
      10.   Use privacy or native vegetative fencing to delineate buffer edge;
      11.   Protect wetland and its buffer with a conservation easement;
      12.   Use best management practices to control dust;
      13.   Maintain connections to offsite areas that are undisturbed;
      14.   Restore corridors or connections to offsite habitats by replanting;
      15.   Other measures further defined by DOE guidance documents.
   D.   Standard buffer widths shall be based upon wetland category, wetland
functions or special characteristics, and/or the intensity of proposed adjacent
land use and the level of wetland impact likely to result from that land use
intensity. Required standard wetland buffers shall be as shown below.

See also provisions of this code relating to increased and decreased buffer
widths and buffer averaging.
Land use intensity (i.e., low, moderate, high) shall be determined using the
table set forth below.

   D.   Any wetland created as compensation for approved wetland alteration
shall have the standard buffer required for the new classification of the
created wetland. Wetlands to be created shall be located such that the new
associated wetland buffer does not cross onto adjacent property, unless the
same property owner owns the adjacent property or has obtained written
permission from the adjacent property owner to do so.
   E.   Land-ward Residential Addition. For proposed development consisting of
an expansion of an existing single family residential structure within a
wetland buffer, for which the proposed expansion is on the land-ward side of
the structure furthest from the wetland, no mitigation shall be required for
such expansion, so long as the width of the expanded structure parallel to the
wetland boundary is not increased. (Ord. 985, 10-5-2020)
13-4-5: PERMITTED ALTERATIONS IN WETLANDS:
Activities and uses shall be prohibited from wetlands and wetland buffers,
except as provided in this section.
   A.   Permitted activities; requirements. The following activities may be
permitted in a wetland or wetland buffer only if the applicant can demonstrate
the activity will not degrade functions and values of the wetland and other
critical areas. The Director may require preparation of a critical areas report
to confirm compliance with requirements of this title. Mitigation shall be
required pursuant to provisions of this title.
      1.   Enhancement or preservation activities that improve the function of
the existing wetland.
      2.   Modifications to existing structures where no further wetland
alteration or increase in structure footprint will occur.
      3.   Trails. Public and private trails may be allowed within all wetland
buffers where it can be demonstrated in a critical areas report that the
wetland and wetland buffer functions and values will not be degraded by trail
construction or use. Trail planning, construction, and maintenance shall adhere
to all of the following criteria:
         a.   Trail alignment shall follow a path beyond a distance from the
wetland edge equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the buffer width, except as
needed to access viewing platforms or view points. Trails may be placed within
existing rights-of-way or on existing levees or railroad grades within these
limits;
         b.   Trails and associated viewing platforms shall be constructed of
pervious or permeable materials, unless necessary for conformance to the
Americans with Disabilities Act. The trail surface shall meet all other
requirements, including water quality standards set forth in the Washington
State Department of Ecology Stormwater Management Manual for Western
Washington, August 2001 or as revised;
         c.   Trail alignment shall avoid trees in excess of eight inches in
diameter at a height of four and a half feet (4.5') above the ground on the
upslope side of the tree;
         d.   Trail construction and maintenance shall follow the U.S. Forest
Service Trails Management Handbook (FSH 2309.18, June 1987) and Standard
Specifications for Construction of Trails (EM-7720-102, June 1984 or as
revised);
         Access trails to viewing platforms within the wetland may be provided.
Trail access and platforms shall be aligned and constructed to minimize
disturbance to valuable functions of the wetland or its buffer and still
provide enjoyment of the resource.;
         e.   Buffer widths shall be increased, where possible, equal to the
width of the trail corridor, including disturbed areas; and
         f.   Equestrian trails shall be located or measures provided to assure
that runoff from the trail does not directly discharge to the wetland.
      4.   Stormwater Management Facilities. Stormwater management facilities
are not allowed in Category I and II wetlands and their buffers. Any category
of wetland may receive clean runoff from sources such as roof drains and
footing drains when such runoff is demonstrated as beneficial to wetland
functions. Category III and IV wetland buffers may be used for detention/
retention areas where the applicant can demonstrate no practicable alternative
and that such use is beneficial to wetland functions. Enhanced treatment is
required prior to discharge to such wetlands, and a stormwater facility
maintenance plan shall be submitted.
      5.   Public Roads and Utilities. Footprint expansion of public roads and
utilities may occur to maintain locally established levels of service, and to
provide for and protect public safety when no lesser impacting option is
feasible and the width of the corridor is minimized to the maximum extent
practicable. Public and private utility corridors may be allowed within wetland
buffers for all categories of wetlands when no lesser impacting alternative
alignment is feasible, and wetland and wetland buffer functions and values will
not be degraded. Utilities, whenever practicable, shall be constructed in
existing, improved roads, drivable surface or shoulder, subject to compliance
with road maintenance BMP’s, or within an existing utility corridor. Otherwise,
corridor alignment, construction, restoration and maintenance shall adhere to
all of the following criteria:
         a.   Corridor alignment shall follow a path beyond a distance from the
wetland edge equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the buffer width, except
when crossing a Category IV wetland and its buffer;
         b.   Corridor construction and maintenance shall maintain and protect
the hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the wetland and the buffer;
         c.   Corridors shall be fully revegetated with appropriate native
vegetation upon completion of construction; and
         d.   Utilities requiring maintenance roads shall be prohibited in
wetland buffers unless the following criteria are met:
            (1)   There are no lesser impacting alternatives;
            (2)   Any required maintenance roads shall be no greater than
fifteen feet (15') wide.
            (3)   Roads shall closely approximate the location of the utility
to minimize disturbances; and
            (4)   The maintenance road shall be constructed of pervious
materials and designed to maintain and protect the hydrologic functions of the
wetland and its buffer. (Ord. 985, 10-5-2020)
13-4-6: CRITICAL AREAS REPORT/STUDY:
In addition to the general requirements for Critical Areas Reports provided
under Section
13-3-12(G) of this title, wetland critical areas reports shall include the
following:
   A.   On the site map:
      1.   The edge of the wetland (located within 300 feet of the project
site) as flagged and surveyed in the field according to the approved Corps of
Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual and the Regional Supplement to the Corps
of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual: Western Mountains, Valleys, and Coast
Region (Version 2.0) or as revised. as required by RCW 36.70A.157;
      2.   The location and extent of any proposed wetland area(s) to be
created through mitigation measures; and
      3.   The location and extent of any proposed wetland alteration or fill.
   B.   In the report:
      1.   Description of the wetland by classification per the Washington
State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington (Washington State Department
of Ecology, 2014 Update, Publication No. 14-06-029, or as revised by Ecology;
      2.   General condition of wetland;
      3.   Description of vegetation species and community types present in the
wetland and surrounding buffer;
      4.   Description of soil types within the wetland and the surrounding
buffer using the USDA Soil Conservation Service soil classification system;
      5.   Description of hydrologic regime and findings;
      6.   Description of any observed wildlife present in the wetland or
associated buffer. (Ord. 985, 10-5-2020)
13-4-7: WETLAND MITIGATION REQUIREMENTS:
No net loss of wetland functions and values shall occur as a result of any
project. If a wetland alteration is allowed, associated impacts shall be
mitigated. In addition to the general mitigation requirements described in
Section
13-3-12(H) of this title, the following specific wetland mitigation
requirements shall apply.
   A.   Mitigation shall achieve equivalent or greater biological wetland
functions. Mitigation plans shall be consistent with the state Department of
Ecology Wetland Mitigation in Washington State, Part 1: Agency Policies and
Guidance (Version 1, Publication #06-06-011a, March 2006) and Wetland
Mitigation in Washington State, Part 2: Developing Mitigation Plans (Version 1,
Publication #06-06-011b, March 2006, or as may be amended).
   B.   Preference of mitigation actions. Mitigation actions that require
compensation shall occur in the following order of preference:
      1.   Restoring wetlands on upland sites that were formerly wetlands.
      2.   Creating wetlands on disturbed upland sites such as those with
vegetation cover consisting primarily of non-native introduced species. This
should only be attempted when there is a consistent source of hydrology and it
can be shown that the surface and subsurface hydrologic regime is conducive for
the wetland community that is designed.
      3.   Enhancing significantly degraded wetlands in combination with
restoration or creation. Such enhancement should be part of a mitigation
package that includes replacing the impacted area while meeting applicable
ratio requirements.
      4.   Preservation of high quality wetlands that are under demonstrable
threat of destruction or substantive degradation. Such preservation should be
part of a mitigation package that includes replacing the impacted area while
meeting applicable ratio requirements.
   C.   Type and location of mitigation. Unless it is demonstrated that a
higher level of ecological function would result from an alternative approach,
compensatory mitigation for ecological functions shall be either in-kind and
on-site, or in-kind and within the same drainage sub-basin, and of similar or
better wetland category. Mitigation actions shall be conducted within the same
drainage sub-basin and on the site of the alteration except when all of the
following apply:
      1.   There are no reasonable on-site or in-subdrainage basin
opportunities, or on-site and in-subdrainage basin opportunities do not have a
high likelihood of success, after a determination of the natural capacity of
the site to mitigate for the impacts. Consideration should include: anticipated
compensatory wetland mitigation ratios, buffer conditions and proposed widths,
hydrogeomorphic classes of on-site wetlands when restored, proposed flood
storage capacity, and potential to mitigate riparian fish and wildlife habitat
impacts;
      2.   Off-site mitigation has a greater likelihood of providing equal or
improved wetland functions than the impacted wetland; and
      3.   Off-site locations shall be in the same sub-drainage unless credits
from a state certified wetland mitigation bank are used as mitigation and the
use of credits is consistent with the terms of the bank’s certification.
   D.   Mitigation ratios. The following ratios shall apply to wetland
restoration and creation mitigation. These ratios do not apply to the use of
credits from a state certified wetland mitigation bank. When credits from a
certified bank are used, compensatory mitigation ratios should be consistent
with the requirements of the bank’s certification. The first number specifies
the acreage of compensatory mitigation wetlands and the second specifies the
acreage of wetlands altered. All mitigation land must have equal or greater
wetland functions and values than the impacted land.

   E.   Wetland enhancement as mitigation. Impacts to wetland functions may be
mitigated by enhancement of existing significantly degraded wetlands, but must
be used in conjunction with restoration and/or creation; except that, due to
their dynamic nature, enhancement of interdunal wetlands is not an appropriate
ecological mitigation option. Applicants proposing to enhance wetlands must
prepare a critical areas report that identifies how enhancement will increase
functions of the degraded wetland and how this increase will adequately
mitigate for the loss of wetland area and function at the impact site. An
enhancement proposal must also show whether existing wetland functions will be
reduced by the enhancement actions.
   F.   Wetland preservation as mitigation. Impacts to wetland functions may be
mitigated by preservation of existing high quality, at-risk, off-site wetlands,
but should be done in combination with restoration, creation, or enhancement
mitigation measures. Applicants proposing to include wetland preservation in a
mitigation plan must prepare a critical areas report that identifies how
preservation will benefit the functions of the wetland to be preserved and how
this action (either solely or in part) will adequately mitigate for the loss of
wetland area and function at the impact site. A preservation proposal must also
meet the all of following criteria for consideration as an acceptable component
of a compensatory mitigation plan:
      1.   The preservation site is determined to be under demonstrable threat
of destruction or substantive degradation.
      2.   The site proposed for preservation is a high quality Category I or
II wetland within the same watershed or sub-basin.
      3.   The preservation site includes buffer areas adequate to protect the
habitat and its functions from encroachment and degradation.
      4.   Mitigation ratios for preservation sites shall be 10:1 if used in
combination with other compensation measures, or 20:1 if used alone.
   G.   Monitoring of mitigation. Monitoring of approved compensatory
mitigation actions shall be required as part of an approved mitigation plan as
set forth in Section
13-3-12(I), (J), and (K) of this title. (Ord. 985, 10-5-2020)
13-4-8: MAPS AND REFERENCES:

13-4-9: WETLAND MITIGATION BANKING:
   A.   Impacts that can be mitigated via bank. Loss of Category I, Category
II, Category III or Category IV wetland buffer, and loss of Category II,
Category III, or Category IV wetland may be mitigated via purchasing of rights
in an approved wetland mitigation bank. Impacts to Category I wetlands from
private development or public infrastructure projects may only be compensated
for by purchasing rights in an approved wetland mitigation bank. Development
proposals for which wetland mitigation banking is proposed as mitigation must
first demonstrate compliance with the preferred wetland mitigation sequence
described in Section
13-3-12(B) of this title.
   B.   Required characteristics of bank. Credits from a wetland mitigation
bank may be approved for use as compensation for impacts to wetlands when all
of the following criteria are met:
      1.   The bank is certified under Chapter 173-700 WAC, as may be amended;
      2.   The Director determines the wetland mitigation bank provides
appropriate compensation for authorized impacts; and
      3.   The proposed use of credits is consistent with the terms and
conditions of the bank’s certification.
   C.   Compensatory mitigation ratios for projects using bank credits shall be
consistent with compensatory mitigation ratios specified in the bank’s
certification.
   D.   Credits from a certified wetland mitigation bank may be used to
compensate for impacts located within the service area specified in the bank’s
certification. (Ord. 985, 10-5-2020)
13-4-10: WETLAND MONITORING PROGRAM AND ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT:
The City shall conduct a wetland monitoring program applicable to all wetlands
and wetland mosaics located within the City that are one thousand square feet
(1,000 SF) or greater in area to which the City or its designee can acquire
legal site access. The City shall pursue state and/or federal funding for the
monitoring program in coordination with applicable local, state and federal
agencies.
   A.   Purpose. The primary purpose of the wetland monitoring program is to
maintain a science-based understanding of the City’s wetland resources. This
information will serve as a source of best available science considered when
the City makes decisions regarding wetlands regulations and policies in
accordance with RCW 36.70A.172 and WAC 365-195-900 through WAC 365-195-925, and
when considering adaptive management options.
   B.   Program Elements. The City shall gather baseline data regarding the
presence, type, and condition of wetlands, and shall evaluate wetland condition
data over time. The City shall assess the values and functions of wetlands and
mosaics including and not limited to water quality, flood and storm water
storage, conveyance and attenuation, groundwater recharge and discharge, and
fish and wildlife habitat conditions; assess baseline wetland conditions;
assess changes to wetland and mosaic conditions over time; evaluate
effectiveness of City regulations; and enact adaptive management measures or
actions (such as revisions to City regulations and requirements) as the wetland
monitoring program may demonstrate are advisable. Basic elements of the wetland
monitoring program are as follows, subject to modification over time:
      1.   Collect Baseline Data:
         a.   Delineate and designate the category of identified wetlands and
mosaics and their buffer widths;
         b.   Survey and document baseline water quality conditions;
         c.   Survey and document baseline vegetation of wetlands and buffers;
         d.   Survey and document baseline wildlife presence and wetland use as
habitat;
         e.   Survey and document wetland and buffer functions; and
         f.   Survey and document baseline surface water flow, groundwater
recharge /discharge and flood attenuation conditions, as applicable.
      2.   Collect Periodic Data:
         a.   After baseline data are collected, the City shall monitor
identified wetlands and mosaics on a minimum five (5) year basis. This will
allow evaluation of wetland functions and values over time.
         b.   The City shall document data, results, and trends, and shall make
any recommendations for adaptive management in a wetlands evaluation report, to
be made publicly available, upon conclusion of each five (5) year wetland
evaluation period interval as identified in 2.a., above.
      3.   Assess Wetland Conditions; City Response:
         a.   Should data indicate the condition of a wetland or mosaic is
satisfactory and that adequate wetland functions and values consistent with the
identified wetland category are being maintained, no additional action is
required until the next monitoring and evaluation period.
         b.   Should data indicate the condition of a wetland or mosaic is
threatened, or that wetland condition is declining over time, the City shall
take the following steps:
            (1)   Compliance Assessment. The City will first determine whether
there is compliance with relevant critical areas regulations.
               (A)   If the City determines compliance with critical areas
regulations does not exist, the City shall undertake educational efforts to
gain compliance.
               (B)   If education fails to achieve compliance, the City shall
undertake regulatory code enforcement to gain compliance.
            (2)   Source Identification. If the City determines compliance with
critical areas regulations does exist, the City shall strive to identify the
source of the threat and take appropriate action to reverse or mitigate its
effects.
            (3)   Adaptive Management. If the City determines compliance with
critical areas regulations does exist, and there is no identifiable source of a
threat to a degraded wetland, the City shall assess its critical areas
regulations and practices, and shall modify them as necessary to achieve
desired wetland functions and values consistent with the applicable wetland
category. The City shall consider best available science when adaptively
modifying its regulations and practices. (Ord. 985, 10-5-2020)

13-5-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this section is to establish standards and procedures protective
of fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas (HCAs) and that will preserve
and protect those areas that have a primary association with anadromous fish,
threatened, endangered and sensitive species, as well as species of local
importance. (Ord. 985, 10-5-2020)
13-5-2: DESIGNATION:
   A.   For purposes of these regulations, fish and wildlife HCAs are those
habitat areas that meet any one or more of the following criteria:
      1.   Documented presence of species listed by the federal government or
the State of Washington as endangered, threatened, or sensitive.
      2.   Commercial and recreational shellfish areas.
      3.   Kelp and eelgrass beds.
      4.   Herring and smelt spawning areas.
      5.   Naturally occurring ponds under 20 acres with submerged aquatic beds
that provide fish or wildlife habitat.

      7.   Lakes, ponds, streams, and rivers planted with game fish by a
government or tribe.
      8.   Areas with which anadromous fish species have a primary association.
      9.   State Natural Area Preserves, Natural Resource Conservation Areas,
and other aquatic resource areas.
      10.   State Priority Habitats and Areas Associated with State Priority
Species as defined in WAC 365-190-080, as may be amended.
      11.   Areas of Rare Plant Species and High Quality Ecosystems as
identified by the Washington State Department of Natural resources through the
Natural Heritage Program in RCW 79.70, as may be amended.
   B.   All areas within the City meeting one or more of the above criteria,
regardless of any formal identification, are designated critical areas and are
subject to the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 985, 10-5-2020)
13-5-3: FISH AND WILDLIFE HABITAT CONSERVATION AREA WATER TYPE CLASSIFICATION:
Water types shall be classified according to WAC 222-16-030. Type S streams
include shorelines of the state and have flows averaging twenty (20) or more
cubic feet per second; Type F streams are those that are not Type S but still
provide fish habitat; and Type N streams do not have fish habitat and are
either perennial (Np) or seasonal (Ns). All streams and those areas where
surface waters flow sufficiently to produce a defined channel or bed as
indicated by hydraulically sorted sediments or the removal of vegetative litter
or loosely rooted vegetation by the action of moving water. Ns waters must be
physically connected by an above-ground channel system to Type S, F, or Np
waters. (Ord. 985, 10-5-2020)
13-5-4: BUFFERS:
   A.   Riparian Habitat. The following buffers are the minimum requirements
for streams. All buffers shall be measured from the ordinary high water mark
(OHWM).
      1.   Types S streams shall have a one-hundred-fifty-foot (150') buffer on
each side of the channel.
      2.   Types F streams greater than five feet (> 5') wide shall have a one-
hundred-fifty-foot (150') buffer on each side of the channel. Type F streams
less than five feet (< 5') wide shall have a 100 foot (100') buffer on each
side of the channel 1 .
      3.   Type Np streams shall have a fifty foot (50') buffer on each side of
the channel.
      4.   Type Ns streams, within a quarter mile of a stream with salmonids
shall have a twenty-five-foot (25') buffer on each side of the channel.
   B.   Wildlife and Other Habitat. Buffer widths and setbacks for the
protection of listed species outside of streams and stream buffers will be
determined on a site-specific basis through the approval of a Critical Areas
Report.
   C.   Marine Shorelines. Marine shoreline standard buffers will be determined
by the City of Long Beach Shoreline Master Program. (Ord. 985, 10-5-2020)

13-5-5: GENERAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
The requirements provided in this section supplement those identified in
Section 13-3-12 of this title. Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas
(HCAs) may be altered only if the proposed alteration of the habitat or the
mitigation proposed does not degrade functions and values of the habitat. All
new structures and land alterations shall be prohibited from habitat
conservation areas, except in accordance with this title. Additional standards
follow:
   A.   No development shall be allowed within a HCA area or any associated
buffer with which state or federally endangered, threatened, or sensitive
species have a primary association.
   B.   Whenever development is proposed adjacent to a fish and wildlife HCA
with which state or federally endangered, threatened, or sensitive species have
a primary association, such areas shall be protected through the application of
protection measures in accordance with a critical areas report prepared by a
qualified professional and approved by the Director.
   C.   The following activities may be permitted within fish and wildlife
HCAs, except as otherwise prohibited in this section, provided they comply with
all provisions of this chapter.
      1.   Road, trail, bridge, and utility construction may be permitted
across an HCA and/or its buffer, provided all of the following are satisfied:
         a.   It is demonstrated to the Director that there exist no
alternative routes that can be reasonably used to achieve the proposed
development;
         b.   The activity will have minimum adverse impacts to the fish and
wildlife HCA;
         c.   The activity will not significantly degrade surface or
groundwater;
         d.   The intrusion into fish and wildlife HCA and its buffers is fully
mitigated.
      2.   Limited park or recreational access to an HCA and/or its buffer may
be permitted, provided all of the following are satisfied:
         a.   The access is part of a public park, public open space, or a
recreational resort development that is dependent on the access for its
location and recreational function;
         b.   The access is limited to the minimum necessary to accomplish the
recreational function;
         c.   The access and the balance of the development is consistent with
other requirements of this chapter;
         d.   The applicant obtains written approval from the City for the
limited access and associated mitigation.
      3.   Low impact uses and activities (as defined in Section
13-4-5 of this title) that are consistent with the function of the buffer and
that do not detract from its integrity may be permitted within the buffer
depending on the sensitivity of the habitat involved, provided such activity
shall not result in a decrease of habitat function or value. Examples of uses
and activities that may be permitted on a case-by-case basis include removal of
noxious vegetation, pedestrian trails and viewing platforms.
      4.   Stormwater discharges shall be controlled and treated in accordance
with the Stormwater Management Manual for Western Washington, DOE Publication
No. 05-10-029 through 05-10-033, or as revised.
   D.   Habitat Study. Applicants of development proposals or alterations in or
adjacent to a fish and wildlife HCA shall prepare and submit to the City as
part of the required critical areas study, a habitat study that identifies
which, if any, listed species are using the fish and wildlife HCA. If one or
more listed species are using the fish and wildlife HCA, the following
additional requirements shall apply:
      1.   The applicant’s critical areas study shall include a habitat
management plan that identifies qualities essential to maintaining the feeding,
breeding, and nesting of listed species using the fish and wildlife HCA and
that identifies measures to minimize the proposal’s impact on these ecological
processes. The applicant shall be guided by the document Management
Recommendations for Washington’s Priority Habitats and Species, issued by the
Washington Department of Wildlife, May 1991, as may be amended, and by any
recovery and management plans prepared by the Washington Department of Wildlife
for the listed species pursuant to WAC 232-12-297(11).
      2.   Conditions shall be imposed as necessary, based on measures
identified in the habitat management plan.
   E.   City approval of land alteration adjacent to the HCA, buffer, or any
setback shall not occur prior to consultation with the state Department of Fish
and Wildlife and the appropriate federal agency, if applicable.
   F.   No plant, wildlife, or fish species not indigenous to the region shall
be introduced into a HCA unless authorized by a state or federal permit or
approval.
   G.   Alteration of natural watercourses shall be avoided, if feasible. If
unavoidable, all of the following provisions shall apply to the alteration:
      1.   Watercourse alteration projects shall not result in blockage of side
channels. Known fish barriers into side channels shall be removed as part of an
approved watercourse alteration project.
      2.   Removal of large woody debris and vegetation, including salvage
logging, shall be avoided or minimized unless it is demonstrated that such
materials pose an imminent safety hazard to the public, property or structures,
or when it is part of a larger restoration project. Any removal that is
unavoidable shall be mitigated by replanting with native vegetation and by
augmenting lost large woody debris it can be anchored in such a way to provide
fisheries, riparian or shoreline erosion benefits; and to avoid safety hazards
where recreational boating and swimming are expected.
      3.   The applicant shall maintain the altered or relocated portion of the
watercourse to ensure that the flood carrying capacity is not diminished.
Maintenance shall be bonded for a period of five (5) years and be in accordance
with an approved maintenance program.
   H.   The Director shall condition approval of activities allowed within a
fish and wildlife HCA or its buffer as necessary, pursuant to the approved
critical areas report and habitat management plan to minimize or mitigate any
potential adverse impacts. Depending on circumstances, and on a case-by-case
basis, conditions may include one or more of the following:
      1.   Establishment of buffer zones outside of the required stream and
wetland buffers as may be necessary to retain adequate natural habitat for
listed species;
      2.   Preservation of critically important vegetation and/or habitat
features (e.g. snags);
      3.   Limitation of access to the HCA, including fencing to deter
unauthorized access, but fencing shall not create a barrier to habitat
function;
      4.   Seasonal restrictions of construction activities;
      5.   Establishment of a duration and timetable for periodic review of
mitigation activities;
      6.   Requirement of a performance bond to ensure successful completion.
(Ord. 985, 10-5-2020)
13-5-6: SPECIAL PROVISIONS; ANADROMOUS FISH:
   A.   Activities, uses, and alterations proposed to be located in water
bodies used by anadromous fish or in areas that affect such water bodies shall
give special consideration to preservation and enhancement of anadromous fish
habitat. Such special consideration shall include, but not be limited to, the
following:
      1.   Activities shall be timed to occur only during the allowable work
window as designated by the state Department of Fish and Wildlife;
      2.   An alternative alignment or location for the activity is not
feasible;
      3.   The activity is designed to minimize degradation of functions or
values of fish habitat or other critical areas; and
      4.   Any impact to functions or values of the HCA shall be mitigated in
accordance with an approved critical areas report.
   B.   Structures that prevent migration of salmonids shall not be allowed in
those portions of water bodies currently or historically used by anadromous
fish. Fish bypass facilities shall be provided that allow upstream migration of
adult fish while preventing juveniles migrating downstream from being trapped
or harmed.
   C.   Fills, when authorized, shall minimize adverse impacts to anadromous
fish and their habitat, shall mitigate any unavoidable impacts, and shall only

Beach shall be classified using the following criteria:
   A.   Those areas of special flood hazards identified by the Federal
Insurance Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled “The
Flood Insurance Study for the City of Long Beach” dated February 1979, or as
subsequently revised, with an accompanying flood insurance rate map (FIRM) and
any revisions thereto. In case of conflict between FIRM flood hazard maps and a
comprehensive flood hazard management plan designation, the more restrictive
designation shall apply.
   B.   Those areas identified by the City of Long Beach based on review of
base flood elevation and floodway data available from federal, state, county or
other valid sources when base flood elevation data has not been provided. (Ord.
985, 10-5-2020)
13-6-3: PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
   A.   The following standards apply to development proposals and alterations
on sites within flood hazard areas:
      1.   Comprehensive Flood Hazard Management Plan. The City of Long Beach
Comprehensive Flood Hazard Management Plan (FHMP) was completed by the City in
1995. The FHMP sets forth recommendations for land development within the flood
areas in Long Beach and procedures for obtaining development permits or
approvals within flood areas.
      2.   Flood Damage Prevention. Chapter 2 (Flood Damage Prevention) of
Title 10 (Building Regulations) of the Long Beach City Code establishes
specific standards for construction of new structures or improvements to
existing structures located in areas subject to designated flood hazards.
      3.   Dune Alterations Prohibited. Shoreline dune systems and ridges
provide important natural protection from coastal flood hazards. Section
10-4-12(F) of the Long Beach City Code prohibits the alteration of sand dunes
within flood zones V1-30, VE and V on the City’s Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) that would increase potential flood damage.
   B.   Applicants proposing development within flood hazard areas must comply
with all requirements of the most recent edition of the FHMP. All development
within designated frequently flooded areas shall comply with requirements of
Title 10 (Building Regulations) the Long Beach City Code, as may be amended,
and/or the City of Long Beach Shoreline Master Program, as may be amended.

GEOLOGICALLY HAZARDOUS AREAS
SECTION:
13-8-1: Purpose
13-8-2: Designation
13-8-3: Identification Of Geologically Hazardous Areas
13-8-4: Prohibited Development And Activities
13-8-5: Performance Standards; Erosion Hazard Areas
13-8-6: Buffers; Erosion Hazard Areas
13-8-7: Design Standards; Erosion Hazard Areas
13-8-8: Design Standards; Seismic And Tsunami Hazard Areas
13-8-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this section is to establish standards and procedures intended
to minimize hazards to the public from development activities on or adjacent to
areas of geological hazard. (Ord. 985, 10-5-2020)
13-8-2: DESIGNATION:
Areas susceptible to one or more of the following types of hazards shall be
designated as geologically hazardous areas:
   A.   Erosion hazard, including shoreline erosion or retreat;
   B.   Seismic hazard; or
   C.   Tsunami hazard. (Ord. 985, 10-5-2020)
13-8-3: IDENTIFICATION OF GEOLOGICALLY HAZARDOUS AREAS:
   A.   Erosion, Seismic or Tsunami Hazard Areas.
      1.   Erosion Hazard Areas. Erosion hazard areas are at least those areas
identified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources
Conservation Service (NRCS) as having “severe” or “very severe” rill and inter-
rill erosion hazard. Erosion hazard areas are also those areas impacted by
shoreline erosion. Shoreline erosion hazard areas also include shorelines that,
while not currently eroding, may be subject to future shoreline retreat based
on best available science. Potential shoreline erosion hazard areas are those
areas identified by the State Department of Ecology’s Coastal Monitoring and
Analysis Program, based on shoreline and beach profile monitoring trends, that
are likely to erode within the next twenty years. Shoreline erosion hazard
areas are defined and designated on the City’s critical area maps based on
predicted erosion rates from 1995-2020. See Long Beach 2020 Shoreline Change
Prediction paper and accompanying maps (Kaminsky, et. al.) ,
      2.    Seismic Hazard Areas. Seismic hazard areas are subject to severe
risk of damage as a result of earthquake-induced ground shaking, slope failure,
settlement, soil liquefaction, lateral spreading, or surface failure. The
strength of ground shaking is primarily a function of the following:
         a.   The magnitude of an earthquake;
         b.   The distance from the source (epicenter) of an earthquake;
         c.   The type and thickness of geologic materials at the surface; and
         d.   The type of subsurface geological structure.
      3.   Tsunami Hazard Areas. Tsunami hazard areas are coastal shoreline
areas susceptible to flooding and inundation as the result of excessive wave
action resulting from seismic or other geologic events.
   B.   Mapping of Geologically Hazardous Areas. The approximate location and
extent of geologically hazardous areas are shown on the adopted critical area
maps. These maps and studies are to be used as a guide for the City of Long
Beach, project applicants, and/or property owners, and may be continuously
updated as new critical areas are identified. The adopted critical area maps
include:
      1.   U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) landslide hazard, seismic hazard, and
tsunami hazard maps;
      2.   Tsunami hazard map of the southern Washington coast-Modeled tsunami
inundation from a Cascadia subduction zone earthquake, by T.J. Walsh, C.G.
Caruthers, et. al. (2000);
      3.   Tsunamis on the Pacific Coast of Washington State and adjacent
areas-A selected annotated bibliography and directory, compiled by C.J. Manson
and Lee Walkling.
      4.   Washington Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) seismic hazard
maps of Western Washington, as they are available;
      5.   WDNR slope stability maps, as they are available;
      6.   Washington Department of Ecology (DOE), shoreline erosion studies
and maps from the Coastal Monitoring and Analysis Program, including predicted
shoreline erosion rates and trends for the City of Long Beach from the
Southwest Washington Coastal Erosion Study, as they are available;
      7.   Long Beach 2020 Shoreline Change Prediction, George Kaminsky, et.
al., Coastal Monitoring & Analysis Program, Washington State Department of
Ecology;
      8.   Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) flood insurance
maps; and
      9.   Local geologic hazard maps, as adopted.
   C.   This chapter does not imply that land outside mapped geologically
hazardous areas or uses permitted within such areas will be without risk. This
chapter shall not create any liability on the part of the City of Long Beach or
any officer or employee thereof for any damages that result from reliance on
this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 985,
10-5-2020)
13-8-4: PROHIBITED DEVELOPMENT AND ACTIVITIES:
The following development and activities are prohibited in geologically
hazardous critical areas:
   A.   On-site sewage disposal systems, including drain fields, shall be
prohibited within erosion hazard areas and associated buffers.
   B.   Pipelines containing hazardous substances (i.e. petroleum) are
prohibited in erosion hazard areas.
   C.   New or replacement compressed liquid gas tanks of a capacity of 25
gallons or more shall be prohibited in geologically hazardous areas unless
securely affixed to a slab or other adequate means of anchoring. (Ord. 985, 10-
5-2020)
13-8-5: PERFORMANCE STANDARDS; EROSION HAZARD AREAS:
   A.   All proposed projects shall be evaluated to determine whether they
would be located in an erosion hazard area, the project’s potential impact on
the erosion hazard area, and the potential impact of the hazard area on the
proposed project. The Director may require the preparation of a critical areas
report to determine the project’s ability to meet performance standards.
   B.   Alteration of erosion hazard areas or associated buffers may only occur
for activities that:
      1.   Will not increase the threat of shoreline erosion to adjacent
properties beyond pre-development conditions;
      2.   Will not adversely impact other critical areas;
      3.   Are designed hazards to the project are eliminated or mitigated to a
level equal to or less than pre-development conditions;
      4.   Will not allow new development or creation of new lots that would
cause predictable risk from shoreline retreat to people or improvements during
the life of the development;
      5.   Are not likely to require structural shoreline stabilization under
reasonably foreseeable conditions over the expected life of the development,
except where stabilization is necessary to protect allowed uses where no
alternative locations are available and no net loss of ecological functions
will result; and
      6.   Are certified as safe as designed and under anticipated conditions
by a qualified geotechnical engineer or geologist, licensed in the state of
Washington.
   C.   Vegetation shall be retained unless it can be shown that removal will
not increase geologic hazards, and a vegetation management plan is submitted
with the request.
   D.   Access roads, trails, and utilities may be permitted within the erosion
hazard area and associated buffers if the City determines that no other
feasible alternative exists, provided such facilities are designed and
constructed in a manner that, in shoreline areas, maintains minimum dune
heights and widths necessary to mitigate flooding to pre-development levels and
avoids the need for major repair or reconstruction beyond that which would be
required in non-hazard areas. If such facilities are granted, exceptions or
deviations from technical standards for width or other dimensions, and specific
construction standards to minimize impacts may be required.
   E.   Utility lines and pipes shall be permitted in erosion hazard areas only
when the applicant demonstrates that no other practicable alternative is
available. Stormwater conveyance shall be allowed only through a high-density
polyethylene pipe with fuse-welded joints, or similar product that is
functionally equal or superior.
   F.   Point discharges from surface water facilities and roof drains onto or
upstream from an erosion hazard area shall be prohibited except that conveyance
is allowed via continuous storm pipe downslope to a point where there are no
erosion hazard areas downstream from the discharge.
   G.   The division of land in erosion hazard areas and associated buffers is
subject to provisions established for all critical areas in Section
13-3-12 of this title as well as the provisions of this section.
   H.   Any dune alteration or grading done in a shoreline erosion hazard area
must maintain a minimum dune height and width sufficient to achieve a minimum
height of four feet above base flood elevation established in the City’s FIRM,
where applicable. (Ord. 985, 10-5-2020)
13-8-6: BUFFERS; EROSION HAZARD AREAS:
Activities on sites containing erosion hazards shall meet the following
requirements:
   A.   Buffers required. A buffer shall be established for all edges of
erosion hazard areas. The purpose of the buffer is to eliminate or minimize the
risk of property damage, death, or injury resulting from erosion caused in
whole or part by a development, based upon review of and concurrence with a
critical areas report prepared by a qualified professional.
   B.   Minimum buffers. The minimum buffer shall be the greater of: either 100
feet (100') landward from the landward edge of the erosion hazard area; or in
the case of shorelines, the controlling 1980 or 1968 shoreline setback line
that applies to the subject site, as indicated in the City’s adopted shoreline
master program. The shoreline erosion hazard area buffer is determined based on
predicted average shoreline erosion rates for adjacent or nearby shoreline
segments from the Washington Department of Ecology’s Coastal Monitoring and
Analysis Program.
   C.   Buffer reduction. Buffer reductions are not allowed for erosion hazard
areas, unless the Director finds sufficient evidence, based on best available
science, to support such a buffer reduction, consistent with the requirements
of this chapter.
   D.   Increased buffer. The buffer may be increased when the Director
determines a larger buffer is necessary to prevent risk of damage to proposed
and existing development.
   E.   Alterations. Alterations of an erosion hazard area and/or buffer may
only occur for activities for which a geotechnical analysis is submitted and
certifies that:
      1.   The development will not increase surface water discharge or
sedimentation to adjacent properties beyond the pre-development condition;
      2.   The development will not decrease slope stability on adjacent
properties; and
      3.   Such alteration will not adversely impact other critical areas.
(Ord. 985, 10-5-2020)
13-8-7: DESIGN STANDARDS; EROSION HAZARD AREAS:
Development within an erosion hazard area or buffer shall be designed to meet
standards described in this section unless it can be demonstrated that an
alternative design that deviates from one or more of these standards provides
greater long-term geological stability while meeting all other provisions of
this title. The City shall not approve designs that require regular periodic
maintenance to preserve long-term slope stability.
   A.   Structures and improvements shall be clustered to avoid geologically
hazardous areas and other critical areas.
   B.   Structures and improvements shall minimize alteration to natural
contours and foundations shall be tiered where possible to conform to existing
topography.
   C.   Structures and improvements shall be located to preserve the most
critical portion of the site and its natural landforms and vegetation.
   D.   The proposed development shall not result in greater risk or a need for
increased buffers on neighboring properties.
   E.   Development shall be designed to minimize impervious lot coverage.
   F.   Stormwater retention and detention systems, including percolation
systems utilizing buried pipe, may be used if a geotechnical assessment
indicates such a system shall not affect slope stability, and the system is
designed by a licensed civil engineer. The licensed civil engineer shall also
certify that the system is installed as designed.
   G.   Shoreline protection measures located within shoreline erosion hazard
areas shall use non-structural bio-engineering erosion control techniques as
identified by the Washington Department of Ecology and Department of Fish and
Wildlife guidance unless the applicant provides a geotechnical analysis
demonstrating that bioengineering approaches will not adequately protect the
property, provided that all of the following shall apply:
      1.   The shoreline protection measures shall not increase erosion on
adjacent properties and shall not eliminate or reduce sediment supply from any
upland sources.
      2.   The shoreline protection measures will not adversely affect adjacent
critical areas and/or mitigation will be provided to compensate for adverse
impacts where avoidance is not feasible.
      3.   The property contains a legally established permanent structure(s)
that is in danger from shoreline erosion caused by tidal action, waves or
longshore sediment transport processes. Structural shoreline protection
measures, such as bulkheads or seawalls, shall not be used to address natural
shoreline erosion when preservation of existing structures is not a concern.
      4.   Erosion is not being caused by upland conditions, such as removal of
vegetation or human alteration of existing drainage.
      5.   Placing or relocating the development further from the shoreline,
planting vegetation, or installing on-site drainage improvements, are not
feasible or are not sufficient. (Ord. 985, 10-5-2020)
13-8-8: DESIGN STANDARDS; SEISMIC AND TSUNAMI HAZARD AREAS:
All development within areas that meet the classification criteria for seismic
or tsunami hazard areas shall comply with the International Building Code
requirements for Seismic Risk Zone 3, as adopted by the City of Long Beach.

corrective action has not been timely completed after a notice of violation and
abatement has been issued, where a notice of violation and a notice of civil
penalty have been issued but the property or premises is still in violation, or
where summary abatement, as described in subsection C of this section, is
necessary.
   C.   Summary Abatement: Whenever any violation of a regulation causes an
emergency where the continued existence of a condition constitutes an immediate
or emergent threat to the public health, safety, or welfare or to the
environment, the city may summarily and without prior notice abate the
condition. Notice of such abatement, including the reason for it, shall be
given to the person responsible for the violation as soon as reasonably
possible after the abatement. (Ord. 887a, 2-4-2013)

lien shall attach to the real property if the owner was found not responsible
in the final order issued by the hearing examiner. A notice of the city's lien
specifying the expenses incurred in abating the nuisance and giving the legal
description of the premises sought to be charged shall be filed with the
Pacific County auditor within ninety (90) days from the date of the abatement.

as any other civil debt owing to the city, and the city may pursue collection
of the costs of any abatement proceedings under this chapter by any other

violation had an opportunity to appeal the notice of violation and abatement,
notice of violation, and/or notice of civil penalty pursuant to section

regarding the costs of abatement shall not provide another opportunity to
challenge the legality or validity of the underlying violation, required
corrective action(s), required schedule for abatement, or civil penalty.
   E.   Failure to request a hearing within fourteen (14) calendar days from
the date of the invoice shall be a waiver of the right to contest the validity
of the costs incurred in abatement of the violation.
   F.   If a hearing is requested, the hearing examiner will conduct the
hearing no more than thirty (30) calendar days after the public official issues
the notice of hearing, unless the hearing examiner or public official finds

   A.   Costs Included In Lien: The city shall have a lien for any monetary
penalty imposed, the cost of any abatement proceedings under this chapter, and
all other related costs, including attorney and expert witness fees, against
the real property on which the monetary penalty was imposed or any of the work
of abatement was performed. The lien shall be subordinate to all previously
existing special assessment liens imposed on the same property and shall be
superior to all other liens, except for state and county taxes, with which it
shall be on parity.
