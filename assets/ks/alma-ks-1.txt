in the adopting ordinance, the code supersedes all ordinances passed prior to

This code is arranged in chapters, articles, and sections in a manner similar

implication or presumption of intent or construction is to be drawn therefrom.
Any section of this code may be amended or repealed by ordinary ordinance by
reference to the code section number as follows:
"Section 1-105 of the Code of the City of Alma is hereby amended to read as
follows: (the new provisions shall then be set out in full)."
A new section not heretofore existing in the code may be added as follows:
"The Code of the City of Alma is hereby amended by adding a section (or article
or chapter) which reads as follows: (the new provision shall be set out in
full)."
All sections or articles or chapters to be repealed shall be repealed by
specific reference as follows:
"Section 1-105 (or article or chapter) of the Code of the City of Alma is
hereby repealed."
The user's attention is directed to the Governing Body Handbook, published by
the League of Kansas Municipalities, both as a source of general information

   (a)   Declaration of Policy - The proper operation of our government
requires that public officials and employees be independent, impartial and
responsible to the people; that governmental decisions and policy be made in
the proper channels and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its
government. In recognition of those goals, there is hereby established a Code
of Ethics for all officials and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid
or unpaid. The purpose of this code is to establish ethical standards by
setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best
interests of the city.
   (b)   Responsibilities of Public Office - Public officials and employees are
agents of public purpose and hold office for the benefit of the public. They
are bound to uphold the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution
of this State and to carry out impartially the laws of the nation, state, and
city and thus to foster respect for all government. They are bound to observe
in their official acts the highest standards of morality and to discharge
faithfully the duties of their office regardless of personal considerations,
recognizing that the long term public interest must be their primary concern.
Their conduct in both their official and private affairs should be above
reproach.
   (c)   Dedicated Service - All officials and employees of the city should be
responsive to the political objectives expressed by the electorate and the
programs developed to attain those objectives. Appointive officials and
employees should adhere to the rule of work and performance established as the
standard for their positions by the appropriate authority.

or ask others to do so, and they should work in full cooperation with other
public officials and employees unless prohibited from so doing by law or by
officially recognized confidentiality of their work.
   (d)   Fair and Equal Treatment -
      (1)   Interest in Appointments. Canvassing of members of the city
council, directly or indirectly, in order to obtain preferential consideration
in connection with any appointment to the municipal service shall disqualify
the candidate for appointment except with reference to positions filled by
appointment by the city council.
      (2)   Use of Public Property - No official or employee shall request or
permit the use of city-owned vehicles, equipment, materials or property for
personal convenience or profit, except when such services are available to the
public generally or are provided as city policy for the use of such official or
employee in the conduct of official business.
      (3)   Obligations to Citizens - No official or employee shall grant any
special consideration, treatment, or advantage to any citizen beyond that which
is available to every other citizen.
   (e)   Conflict of Interest - No elected or appointive city official or
employee, whether paid or unpaid, shall engage in any business or transaction
or shall have a financial or other personal interest, direct or indirect, which
is incompatible with the proper discharge of his or her duties in the public
interest or would tend to impair his or her independence of judgment or action
in the performance of his or her official duties. Personal as distinguished
from financial interest includes an interest arising from blood or marriage
relationships or close business or political association.
   Specific conflicts of interest are enumerated below for the guidance of
officials and employees:
      (1)   Incompatible Employment - No elected or appointive city official or
employee shall engage in or accept private employment or render services for

her independence of judgment or action in the performance of his or her
official duties.
      (2)   Disclosure of Confidential Information - No elected or appointive
city official or employee, shall, without proper legal authorization, disclose
confidential information concerning the property, government or affairs of the
city. Nor shall he or she use such information to advance the financial or
other private interest of himself, herself or others.
      (3)   Gifts and Favors. No elected or appointive city official or
employee shall accept any valuable gift, whether in the form of service, loan,
thing or promise, from any person, firm, or corporation which to his or her
knowledge is interested directly or indirectly in any manner whatsoever in
business dealings with the city; nor shall any such official or employee (a)
accept any gift, favor or thing of value that may tend to influence him or her
in the discharge of his or her duties or (b) grant in the discharge of his or
her duties any improper favor, service, or thing of value. The prohibition
against gifts or favors shall not apply to: (a) an occasional non-pecuniary
gift, of only nominal value or (b) an award publicly presented in recognition
of public service or (c) any gift which would have been offered or given to him
or her if not an official or employee.

property. (Code 2000)
2-115.   VICIOUS ANIMALS.
   (a)   Prohibited: It shall be unlawful for any person to keep, possess or
harbor a vicious animal within the city. Impoundment of animals whose owners
have been cited for violation of this section shall be at the discretion of the
animal control officer. If the animal presents a clear and present danger to
the public health or safety, it shall be the duty of the animal control officer
or his or her agent to impound such animal.
   (b)   Defined: For purposes of this chapter a vicious animal shall include:
      (1)   Any animal with a known propensity, tendency or disposition to
attack unprovoked, to cause injury or to otherwise endanger the safety of human
beings or domestic animals; or
      (2)   Any animal which attacks a human being or domestic animal without
provocation. Provided, however, that a dog which attacks a chicken or chickens
will not be considered a vicious animal.
      (3)   Any animal owned or harbored primarily or in part for the purpose
of fighting or any animal trained for fighting;
      (4)   Any animal which is urged by its owner or harborer to attack, or
whose owner or harborer threatens to provoke such animal to attack, any law
enforcement officer while such officer is engaged in the performance of
official duty.
   (c)   Complaint: Whenever a sworn complaint is filed in the municipal court
against the owner of an animal alleging that such animal is vicious and in
violation of this section, the municipal judge shall hold a hearing to
determine whether or not the animal is vicious within the meaning of this
section and thereby in violation of this section. The owner of the animal shall
be notified in writing of the time and place of the hearing at least one week
prior to the hearing. In making a determination, the municipal judge shall
consider the following:
      (1)   The seriousness of the attack or bite;
      (2)   Past history of attacks or bites;
      (3)   Likelihood of attacks or bites in the future;
      (4)   The condition and circumstances under which the animal is kept or
confined;
      (5)   Other factors which may reasonably relate to the determination of
whether or not the animal is vicious.
   The municipal judge shall order the impoundment, the muzzling in accordance
with subsection (d) and/or the confinement of the animal accused of being in
violation of this section in a manner and location that will insure that it is
no threat to persons or other animals pending the outcome of the hearing. If
such impoundment, muzzling or otherwise safe confinement is not possible or if
prior court orders to restrain such animal have gone unheeded, the municipal
judge may order the animal immediately destroyed.
   (d)   Vicious Dogs to be Muzzled: It shall be the duty of every owner,
keeper or harborer of any dog in the city, which dog is vicious or has been
known to bite, chase, or run after any person or animal in the streets, alleys,
or any public place in the city, to keep the same muzzled with a good and
sufficient wire or leather muzzle, securely fastened so as to wholly prevent
such dog from biting any animal or person until such time as a determination
has been made by the court as to whether the dog is vicious or not. Any person
owning, keeping or harboring any dog within the city limits contrary to this
section shall be guilty of a violation of this code.
   (e)   Immediate Destruction: Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to
prevent the animal control officer or any law enforcement officer from taking
whatever action is reasonably necessary to protect himself or herself or
members of the public from injury or danger, including immediate destruction of
any vicious animal without notice to the owner.
   (f)   Release of: If a complaint has been filed in the municipal court
against the owner of an impounded animal for a charge under this section, the
animal shall not be released except on the order of the municipal judge, who
may also direct the owner to pay all impounding fees in addition to any
penalties for violation of this chapter. The municipal judge may, upon making a
finding that an animal is vicious or that it represents a clear and present
danger to the citizens or to other animals in the community, order the animal
to be destroyed in a humane manner by the animal shelter. Surrender of an
animal by the owner thereof to the animal control officer does not relieve or
render the owner immune from the decision of the court, nor to the fees and
fines which may result from a violation of this section.
(Ord. 335, Ord. 469; Code 2015)
2-116.   RUNNING AT LARGE.

his or her control to be or to run at large within the city. Any animal or fowl
found at large shall be impounded as provided in section
2-117 or
2-207 (dogs). The foregoing shall not apply to dogs on a leash of not more than
eight feet in length and totally in personal control of its owner, harborer or
other person responsible for the behavior of the dog, but this provision does
not condone or authorize a person to allow a dog to go upon the private
property of another for any purpose without the consent of the owner or
occupant of the property. All dogs shall be securely confined indoors or in a
securely enclosed pen or kennel, except when leashed as above provided. Such
pen, kennel or structure must have secure sides and floor, and if the dog is
capable of climbing the sides, then the structure must also have a secure top.
All such structures must have adequate light and ventilation and be kept in a
clean and sanitary condition. Such pens or kennels constructed on residential
premises shall, where possible, be totally located in the back yard of the
premises. If the pen or kennel cannot be located in the back yard it shall only
be constructed at another location upon written approval of the governing body
of the city upon written application to the governing body showing the precise
intended locations and the specifications of building materials to be used and
dimensions. Such structures shall be subject to inspection by the animal
control officer, or any law enforcement officer, at any time. A dog shall not,
under any circumstance, be confined by only a rope, chain or other similar
device.
(Ord. 337, Sec. 1; Ord. 343, Sec. 1; Code 2000)
2-117.   IMPOUNDMENT; FEE; NOTICE; RECORD.
   (a)   The animal control officer or law enforcement officer shall impound
any animal or fowl found at large in the city or constituting a nuisance or

provided or contracted for by the city. The impounding officer shall make
diligent inquiry as to the owner of the animal and shall notify the owner
thereof of such impoundment as soon as reasonably possible.
   (b)   The city shall be entitled to receive from such owner an impoundment
fee of $10 plus the actual cost of feeding and maintaining the animal while
impounded. A boarding fee of $2 per day shall also be imposed.
   (c)   In case the identity of the owner of the impounded animal or fowl
cannot be ascertained, the animal control officer or police officer shall, upon
taking any such animal into custody and impounding the same, make a record
thereof, with a description of the animal and the date and place taken into
custody and the place of impounding, and shall thereupon immediately post a
public notice stating that the animal, describing the same with the date and
place of taking, has been taken up, and that unless the charges of impounding
the same, together with any license fees due and unpaid, are paid within three
business days from the date of the notice, that the animal will be disposed of
as provided in this code.
   (d)   The animal control officer shall each month submit a report to the
city council showing the number of animals impounded and disposed of, and the
fees collected pursuant to this article and shall pay those fees to the city

2-118.   REDEMPTION OF IMPOUNDED ANIMALS.
At any time before the sale or destruction of any animal impounded under the
provisions of this article, except for animals impounded under sections
2-115 (vicious) and
2-119 (rabid), the owner thereof may redeem the animal by paying the animal
control officer or any person in charge, the impounding fee and all costs
incurred as a result of such impoundment and signing an affidavit verifying to
be the owner or harborer of the animal. (Ord. 337, Sec. 3; Code 2000)

private or public property, any animal which has bitten or scratched a person
or other animal and impound the animal in the city pound, securely penned and
separated from other animals, or in a veterinary hospital or animal care
facility for a period of not more than 30 days during which time the local
health officer shall determine whether or not such animal is suffering from a
disease and, if not, the local health officer shall authorize the release of
the animal upon payment by the owner of the boarding fee therefore. The health
officer may authorize the keeping of any such animal on the owner's premises if
the owner produces a rabies vaccination certificate showing that the animal has
valid rabies vaccination protection. Impoundment costs shall be borne by the
owner. If in the opinion of the local health officer symptoms develop
justifying a microscopic examination, then the animal shall be killed and
examination made by the state board of health.
   (b)   In lieu of the provisions of subsection (a), the owner of any such
animal may, at his or her own expense, take such animal to any duly qualified
and licensed veterinarian in the city for observation. Such veterinarian shall
report his or her findings in writing to the local health officer. If in the
opinion of such veterinarian a microscopic examination is justified, then the
animal shall be turned over to the animal control officer or any law
enforcement officer to be killed and examination made by the state board of
health.
   (c)   Any animal desired for observation by the local health officer under
this section shall be delivered to the animal control officer or any law
enforcement officer upon demand and shall not be withheld, hidden or harbored.
Any person violating this provision shall be guilty of a violation of this
code. Upon refusal of any person to so deliver such animal, the municipal judge
shall cause a warrant to be issued for the arrest of such person, which warrant
shall also provide for the surrender of the animal and shall be lawful
authority for the apprehending and forcible taking of such animal. (Code 2000)
2-119A.   IMPOUNDMENT OF RABIES SUSPECTS.
Any law enforcement officer or local health officer may take up, upon private
or public property, any animal which has bitten or scratched a person or other
animal and impound the animal in a veterinary hospital or animal care facility
for a period of not more than 30 days during which time the local health
officer shall determine whether or not such animal is suffering from a disease
and, if not, the local health officer shall authorize the release of the animal
upon payment by the owner of the boarding fee therefore. The health officer may
authorize the keeping of any such animal on the owner's premises if the owner
produces a rabies vaccination certificate showing that the animal has valid
rabies vaccination protection. Impoundment costs shall be borne by the owner.
(Code 2000)
2-120.   ANIMALS BITTEN BY RABID ANIMALS.
Whenever a dog, cat or other animal is bitten by a rabid animal or an animal
later proved to have been rabid, it shall be the duty of the owner of the
animal that is bitten, to report that fact to the local health officer and/or
the police department. It shall also be the duty of the owner of the bitten
animal to either destroy or have his or her bitten animal destroyed unless:
   (a)   The animal which was bitten had been vaccinated against rabies at
least three weeks before being bitten and has a current vaccination; and
   (b)   If the bitten animal has a current vaccination, it shall be confined
for 90 days; and

animal, or in the event that the owner cannot be ascertained, and located, the
operator shall at once report the accident to the animal control officer or any
law enforcement officer.
(Code 2000)
2-122.   EMERGENCY; PROCLAMATION.
The mayor is hereby authorized whenever in his or her opinion the danger to the
public safety from rabid animals is made imminent to issue a proclamation
ordering all persons owning any animal in the city to confine the animal in a
good and sufficient enclosure from which the animal cannot escape, or fasten
such animal by means of a chain on the premises where the owner may reside, for
such time as may be specified in such proclamation. Any animal not confined
during such time may be disposed of wherever found by any police officer, or
the animal control officer of the city. The owner of such animal shall be
prosecuted for such violation thereof. (Code 2000)
2-123.   KENNEL LICENSES.
   (a)   No person or household shall own or harbor more than five dogs of six
months of age or older or more than one litter of pups, or more than five cats
of more than six months of age or more than one litter of kittens, or more than
a total of five dogs and cats more than six months of age in any combination,

officer certifying approval of the kennel and compliance with the applicable
laws of the city and the State of Kansas, and a certificate by the zoning code

kennel license is not violating zoning laws of the city. If the city clerk has
not received any protest against the kennel, the city clerk may issue a renewal
of an existing kennel license at the same location without any report from the
animal control officer and zoning code enforcement officer. If the animal
control officer or the zoning code enforcement officer finds that the holder of
any kennel license is violating any zoning law, or any other law of the State
of Kansas, or of the city, or is maintaining the facility in a manner
detrimental to the health, safety or peace of mind of any person residing in
the immediate vicinity, he or she shall report such fact to the city clerk, and
the license shall not be renewed except after a public hearing before the
governing body.
   (c)   The animal control officer, the zoning enforcement officer, or any law
enforcement officer shall have the right to inspect any premises licensed under
this section at any reasonable time and nothing shall prevent the entry onto
private property for the purpose of inspection. The application for a kennel
shall constitute consent to such entry and inspection.
   (d)   The governing body may suspend or revoke a kennel license if, pursuant
to a public hearing, it finds any of the following:
      (1)   The kennel is maintained in violation of any applicable law of the
State of Kansas, or of the city.
      (2)   The kennel is maintained so as to be a public nuisance.
      (3)   The kennel is maintained so as to be detrimental to the health,
safety or peace of mind of persons residing in the immediate vicinity.
   (e)   This section shall not apply to and will not be construed to require a
kennel license for a licensed veterinarian to operate an animal hospital.
