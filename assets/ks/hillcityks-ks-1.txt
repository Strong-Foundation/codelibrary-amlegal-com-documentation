known as the “Code of Procedure for Kansas Cities”, Edition of 2006, prepared
and published in book form by the League of Kansas Municipalities, Topeka,
Kansas, save and except such articles, sections, parts or portions as are
hereafter omitted, deleted, modified or changed. One copy of said Code of
Procedure for Kansas Cities shall be marked or stamped “Official Copy as

§ 1-212 CODE OF ETHICS.
   (a)   Declaration of policy. The proper operation of our government requires
that public officials and employees be independent, impartial and responsible
to the people; that governmental decisions and policy be made in the proper
channels; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its
government. In recognition of those goals, there is hereby established a Code
of Ethics for all officials and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid
or unpaid. The purpose of this Code is to establish ethical standards by
setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best
interests of the city.
   (b)   Responsibilities of public office. Public officials and employees are
agents of public purpose and hold office for the benefit of the public. They
are bound to uphold the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution
of this state and to carry out impartially the laws of the nation, state and
city and thus to foster respect for all government. They are bound to observe
in their official acts the highest standards of morality and to discharge

(1987 Code, § 2-114)
§ 2-115 VICIOUS ANIMALS.
   (a)   Prohibited. It shall be unlawful for any person to keep, possess or
harbor a vicious animal within the city. Impoundment of animals whose owners
have been cited for violation of this section shall be at the discretion of the
Animal Control Officer. If the animal presents a clear and present danger to
the public health or safety, it shall be the duty of the Animal Control Officer
or his or her agent to impound such animal.
   (b)   Defined. For purposes of this chapter a VICIOUS ANIMAL shall include:
      (1)   Any animal with a known propensity, tendency or disposition to
attack unprovoked, to cause injury or to otherwise endanger the safety of human
beings or domestic animals;
      (2)   Any animal that attacks a human being or domestic animal without
provocation;
      (3)   Any animal owned or harbored primarily or in part for the purpose
of fighting or any animal trained for fighting; or
      (4)   Any animal that is urged by its owner or harborer to attack, or
whose owner or harborer threatens to provoke such animal to attack, any law
enforcement officer while such officer is engaged in the performance of
official duty.
   (c)   Complaint.
      (1)   Whenever a sworn complaint is filed in the Municipal Court against
the owner of an animal alleging that such animal is vicious and in violation of
this section, the Municipal Judge shall hold a hearing to determine whether or
not the animal is vicious within the meaning of this section and thereby in
violation of this section. The owner of the animal shall be notified in writing
of the time and place of the hearing at least one week before the hearing.
      (2)   In making a determination, the Municipal Judge shall consider the
following:
         (A)   The seriousness of the attack or bite;
         (B)   Past history of attacks or bites;
         (C)   Likelihood of attacks or bites in the future;
         (D)   The condition and circumstances in which the animal is kept or
confined; and
         (E)   Other factors that may reasonably relate to the determination of
whether or not the animal is vicious.
      (3)   The Municipal Judge shall order the impoundment, the muzzling in
accordance with division (d) below, and/or the confinement of the animal
accused of being in violation of this section in a manner and location that
will ensure that it is no threat to persons or other animals pending the
outcome of the hearing. If such impoundment, muzzling or otherwise safe
confinement is not possible or if prior court orders to restrain such animal
have gone unheeded, the Municipal Judge may order the animal immediately
destroyed.
   (d)   Vicious dogs to be muzzled. It shall be the duty of every owner,
keeper or harborer of any dog in the city, which dog is vicious or has been
known to bite, chase or run after any person or animal in the streets, alleys
or any public place in the city, to keep the same muzzled with a good and
sufficient wire or leather muzzle, securely fastened so as to wholly prevent
such dog from biting any animal or person until such time as a determination
has been made by the court as to whether the dog is vicious or not. Any person
owning, keeping or harboring any dog within the city limits contrary to this
section shall be guilty of a violation of this code.
   (e)   Immediate destruction. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to
prevent the Animal Control Officer or any law enforcement officer from taking
whatever action is reasonably necessary to protect himself or herself or
members of the public from injury or danger, including immediate destruction of
any vicious animal without notice to the owner.
   (f)   Release of. If a complaint has been filed in the Municipal Court
against the owner of an impounded animal for a charge under this section, the
animal shall not be released except on the order of the Municipal Judge, who
may also direct the owner to pay all impounding fees in addition to any
penalties for violation of this chapter. The Municipal Judge may, upon making a
finding that an animal is vicious or that it represents a clear and present
danger to the citizens or to other animals in the community, order the animal
to be destroyed in a humane manner by the animal shelter. Surrender of an
animal by the owner thereof to the Animal Control Officer does not relieve or
render the owner immune from the decision of the Court, nor to the fees and
fines which may result from a violation of this section.
(1987 Code, § 2-115)
§ 2-116 RUNNING AT LARGE.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to willfully allow any animal or fowl

diligent inquiry as to the owner of the animal and shall notify the owner
thereof of such impoundment as soon as reasonably possible.
   (b)   The city shall be entitled to receive from such owner an impoundment
fee of $10 per day plus the actual cost of feeding and maintaining the animal
while impounded.
   (c)   In case the identity of the owner of the impounded animal or fowl
cannot be ascertained, the Animal Control Officer or police officer shall, upon
taking any such animal into custody and impounding the same, make a record
thereof, with a description of the animal and the date and place taken into
custody and the place of impounding, and shall thereupon immediately post a
public notice stating that the animal, describing the same with the date and
place of taking, has been taken up, and that unless the charges of impounding
the same, together with any license fees due and unpaid, are paid within three
business days from the date of the notice, that the animal will be disposed of
as provided in this code.
   (d)   The Animal Control Officer shall each month submit a report to the
Mayor and the City Council showing the number of animals impounded and disposed
of, and the fees collected pursuant to this article and shall pay those fees to
the City Clerk for credit to the General Operating Fund.

2-119 (rabid), the owner thereof may redeem the animal by paying the Animal
Control Officer or any person in charge, the impounding fee and all costs

private or public property, any animal that has bitten or scratched a person or
other animal and impound the animal in the city pound, securely penned and
separated from other animals, or in a veterinary hospital or animal care
facility for a period of not more than 30 days during which time the local
Health Officer shall determine whether or not such animal is suffering from a
disease and, if not, the local Health Officer shall authorize the release of
the animal upon payment by the owner of the boarding fee therefore. The Health
Officer may authorize the keeping of any such animal on the owner’s premises if
the owner produces a rabies vaccination certificate showing that the animal has
valid rabies vaccination protection. Impoundment costs shall be borne by the
owner. If in the opinion of the local Health Officer symptoms develop
justifying a microscopic examination, then the animal shall be killed and
examination made by the State Board of Health.
   (b)   In lieu of the provisions of division (a) above, the owner of any such
animal may, at his or her own expense, take such animal to any duly qualified
and licensed veterinarian in the city for observation. Such veterinarian shall
report his or her findings in writing to the local Health Officer. If in the
opinion of such veterinarian a microscopic examination is justified, then the
animal shall be turned over to the Animal Control Officer or any law
enforcement officer to be killed and examination made by the State Board of
Health.
   (c)   Any animal desired for observation by the local Health Officer under
this section shall be delivered to the Animal Control Officer or any law
enforcement officer upon demand and shall not be withheld, hidden or harbored.
Any person violating this section shall be guilty of a violation of this code.
Upon refusal of any person to so deliver such animal, the Municipal Judge shall
cause a warrant to be issued for the arrest of such person, which warrant shall
also provide for the surrender of the animal and shall be lawful authority for
the apprehending and forcible taking of such animal.
(1987 Code, § 2-118)
§ 2-120 ANIMALS BITTEN BY RABID ANIMALS.
   (a)   Whenever a dog, cat or other animal is bitten by a rabid animal or an
animal later proved to have been rabid, it shall be the duty of the owner of
the animal that is bitten, to report that fact to the local Health Officer and/
or the Police Department.
   (b)   It shall also be the duty of the owner of the bitten animal to either
destroy or have his or her bitten animal destroyed unless:
      (1)   The animal that was bitten had been vaccinated against rabies at
least three weeks before being bitten and has a current vaccination;
      (2)   If the bitten animal has a current vaccination, it shall be
confined for 90 days;
      (3)   The bitten animal shall be released from confinement only upon
written order from the local Health Officer, who declares the animal to be free

§ 2-121 VEHICULAR ACCIDENTS INVOLVING ANIMALS.

any law enforcement officer.
(1987 Code, § 2-120)
§ 2-122 EMERGENCY; PROCLAMATION.

the danger to the public safety from rabid animals is made imminent to issue a
proclamation ordering all persons owning any animal in the city to confine the
animal in a good and sufficient enclosure from which the animal cannot escape,
or fasten such animal by means of a chain on the premises where the owner may
reside, for such time as may be specified in such proclamation. Any animal not
confined during such time may be disposed of wherever found by any police
officer or the Animal Control Officer of the city. The owner of such animal

commercial business of breeding, buying, selling, trading, training or boarding
cats or dogs or both cats and dogs, without having obtained a kennel license
from the City Clerk.
   (b)   Kennel licenses must be renewed annually. No kennel license shall be
issued until an inspection certificate has been issued by the Animal Control
Officer certifying approval of the kennel and compliance with the applicable
laws of the city and the state, and a certificate by the Zoning Code
Enforcement Officer has been issued certifying that the applicant for the
kennel license is not violating zoning laws of the city. If the City Clerk has
not received any protest against the kennel, the City Clerk may issue a renewal
of an existing kennel license at the same location without any report from the
Animal Control Officer and Zoning Code Enforcement Officer. If the Animal
Control Officer or the Zoning Code Enforcement Officer finds that the holder of
any kennel license is violating any zoning law, or any other law of the state,
or of the city, or is maintaining the facility in a manner detrimental to the

to a public hearing, it finds any of the following:
      (1)   The kennel is maintained in violation of any applicable law of the
state or of the city;
      (2)   The kennel is maintained so as to be a public nuisance; or
      (3)   The kennel is maintained so as to be detrimental to the health,
safety or peace of mind of persons residing in the immediate vicinity.
   (e)   The annual kennel license fee shall be set by the governing body.
Payment of such license fee is in addition to, and not in lieu of, the dog
license fees otherwise required under this chapter.
   (f)   This section shall not apply to and will not be construed to require a
kennel license for a licensed veterinarian to operate an animal hospital.

   The City Council finds that junked, wrecked, dismantled, inoperative,
discarded vehicles or parts thereof, in and upon all property within the city

   (a)   The governing body of the city hereby creates a lien in favor of the

or other structure under all policies is in excess of 75% of the face value of
the policy(s) covering such building or other insured structure.

§ 8-703 SAME; ENCUMBRANCES.
   Prior to final settlement on any claim covered by §
8-702, the insurer or insurers shall contact the County Treasurer to determine

at between the named insured or insureds and the company or companies, and the
final settlement exceeds 75% of the face value of the policy covering any
building or other insured structure, and when all amounts due the holder of a
first real estate mortgage against the building or other structure, pursuant to
the terms of the policy and endorsements thereto, shall have been paid, the
insurance company or companies shall execute a draft payable to the City
Treasurer in an amount equal to the sum of 15% of the covered claim payment,
unless the Chief Building Inspector of the city has issued a certificate to the
insurance company or companies that the insured has removed the damaged
building or other structure, as well as all associated debris, or repaired,
rebuilt or otherwise made the premises safe and secure.

Treasurer.
   (e)   Upon notification to the City Treasurer by the Chief Building
Inspector that no proceedings shall be initiated under K.S.A. 12-1750 et seq.,
as amended, the City Treasurer shall return all such monies received, plus
accrued interest, to the insured or insureds as identified in the communication
from the insurance company or companies. Such return shall be accomplished

§ 15-313 NET METERING POLICY AND PROCEDURES FOR CUSTOMER-OWNED RENEWABLE ENERGY
RESOURCES.
   (a)   Introduction. The provisions of this net metering policy shall apply
only to customer generators with renewable energy resources approved by the
city.
   (b)   Net metering general provisions.
      (1)   The city shall offer net metering to its customers that wish to
generate electricity on the customer’s side of the meter using only renewable
resources for energy sources.
      (2)   Net metering is intended for customer generators with a rated
output of less than 25,000 watts (25 kW). Systems rated for more than 25 kW
will be handled under a different process and may involve the local control
area and regional transmission organizations.
      (3)   The city shall make net metering available to eligible customer
generators within its service area on a first-come, first-serve basis. The
maximum total rated capacity in kW of customer generation that will be allowed
on the city’s system shall be restricted to not more than 1% of the city’s peak
demand during the previous annualized period.
      (4)   Customer generators shall be equipped with properly approved city
metering equipment that can measure the flow of electricity in both directions
at the same rate, typically through use of a single bi-directional meter.
Necessary metering will be supplied and installed by the city and the cost
thereof will be billed to the customer generator.
      (5)   Whenever the amount of electricity delivered by an eligible
customer generator in a billing period exceeds the electricity supplied by the
city in such billing period, the city shall settle with the customer generator
for the excess kilowatt-hours (kWh) in accordance with the billing practices
described in this section.
      (6)   If a customer generator formally terminates net metering, the city
shall treat the end of the service period as if it were the end of the billing
period and, if applicable, settle with the customer generator according to the
appropriate billing practices.
      (7)   The city shall provide net metering at non-discriminatory rates
that are identical with respect to the applicable customer rate class, retail
rate components, and any monthly charges, to the rates that a customer would be
charged if not a customer generator.
      (8)   The city shall not charge a customer generator any fee or charge,
or require additional equipment or any other requirement, unless the fee,
charge, or other requirement is specifically authorized under the terms of the
interconnection agreement, this policy, or if the fee, charge or other
requirement would apply to other customers that are not customer generators.
Any insurance coverage that may be required is specifically exempted from this
(B)(8), however, and is subject to the terms of the Interconnection Standards
for Parallel Installation and Operation of Customer-Owned Electric Generating
Facilities.
      (9)   Nothing in this section shall abrogate any customer’s obligation to
comply with all applicable federal, state, or local laws, codes, or ordinances,
nor with the standard service regulations, and policies of the city.
   (c)   Interconnection standards. To qualify for net metering, customer
generators must comply with the city’s Interconnections Standards for Parallel
Installation and Operation of Customer-Owned Electric Generating Facilities.
   (d)   Request. The customer generator shall make a request for net metering
by completing the city’s application for net metering and the city’s
application for interconnection. The city may require additional details or
clarifications as needed to properly evaluate the application.
   (e)   Billing practices (monthly settlement).
      (1)   Positive net consumption. Whenever the amount of electricity
delivered by an eligible customer generator in a billing period is less than
the electricity delivered by the city during such billing period, billing for
the net energy supplied by the city will be made in accordance with the rate
schedule applicable to the customer’s assigned rate class and all applicable
riders.
      (2)   Negative net consumption. Whenever the amount of electricity
delivered by an eligible customer generator in a billing period is more than
the electricity supplied by the city in a billing period, the excess electric
energy shall be retained by the city as a contribution to fixed costs
associated with owning and maintaining the facilities required to provide
electric service.
      (3)   Customer generators remain responsible for all charges incurred
during each billing period including, but not limited to: customer charges,
facilities charges, demand charges, environmental charges, transmission
charges, any late payment charges, and any requirements for deposits or special
charges or fees that may be applied.
   (f)   Eligibility. Interconnection to the electric system shall be granted
only to new or existing customers, in good standing, under the city’s electric
service schedules. All agreements hereunder shall be between the customer
generator and the city and will not include third parties.
   (g)   System effects. The city will analyze the overall impact of the
proposed generating facility on the transmission and distribution system. Such
analyses will be based on good utility practice to determine thermal effects,
voltage ranges, power quality, system stability, and the like.
   (h)   System upgrades. As a result of the above analysis, the city will
provide the customer generator with a cost estimate and projected timeframe for
any system upgrades, to be paid for by the customer generator, that may be
necessary to accommodate the generating facility.
   (i)   Codes and permits.
      (1)   The customer generator shall be responsible for procuring all
building, operating and environmental permits that are required by any
governmental authority having jurisdiction for the type of generating facility
and for the necessary ancillary structures to be installed.
      (2)   The equipment shall meet the standards listed in the attached
document entitled “National Certification Codes and Standards.”
      (3)   The construction and facilities shall meet all local building and
electrical codes.
   (j)   Certificate of completion. Upon completion of the generating facility
and prior to normal operation, the customer generator shall provide a signed
copy of the attached document entitled “Certificate of Completion” as required
by the interconnection agreement.
   (k)   Normal operation. The customer generator may begin normal operation of
the generating facility upon completion of all documentation, inspection by,
and receipt of written approval from the city.
   (l)   Liability. The parties agree that the city is not responsible for
damages to the customer generator’s equipment, property, or person due to being
connected to the city’s power.
   (m)   Definitions. All capitalized terms and phrases throughout this set of
standards shall be defined as indicated in the “Glossary of Terms” attached to
Ord. 2023-02.

   (d)   (1)   No permit shall discharge or cause to be discharged the
following described substances, materials, waters or wastes if it appears
likely in the opinion of the City Administrator that such wastes can harm
either the sewers, sewage treatment process or equipment, have an adverse
effect on the receiving stream or can otherwise endanger life, limb, public
property or constitute a nuisance. In forming his or her opinion as to the
acceptability of these wastes, the City Administrator will give consideration
to such factors as the quantities of subject wastes in relation to flows and
velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, nature of
the sewage treatment process, capacity of the Sewage Treatment Plant, degree of
treatability of wastes in the Sewage Treatment Plant and other pertinent
factors.
      (2)   The substances prohibited are:

or concentrated plating solutions whether neutralized or not;
         (E)   Any waters or wastes containing iron, chromium, copper, zinc and
similar objectionable or toxic substances; or wastes exerting an excessive
chlorine requirement, to such degree that any such material received in the
composite sewage at the sewage treatment works exceeds the limits established
by the City Administrator for such materials;
         (F)   Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste- or odor-
producing substances, in such concentrations exceeding limits which may be
established by the City Administrator as necessary, after treatment of the
composite sewage, to meet the requirements of state, federal or other public
agencies of jurisdiction for such discharge to the receiving waters;
         (G)   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or
concentration as may exceed limits established by the City Administrator in
compliance with applicable state and federal regulations;
         (H)   Any waters or wastes having a pH in excess of 9.5;
         (I)   Materials which exert or cause:
            (i)   Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as,
but not limited to, Fullers earth, lime slurries and lime residues) or of
dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride or sodium
sulfate);
            (ii)   Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye
wastes and vegetable tanning solutions);
            (iii)   Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand or chlorine

constituting “slugs” as defined herein.
         (J)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the Sewage Treatment Plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters;
         (K)   Any waters or wastes having:
            (i)   A five-day BOD greater than 300 parts per million by weight;
            (ii)   Containing more than 350 parts per million by weight of
suspended solids; or
            (iii)   Having an average daily flow greater than 2% of the average
sewage flow of the city shall be subject to the review of the City
Administrator. Where necessary in the opinion of the City Administrator, the
owner shall provide, at his or her expense, such preliminary treatment as may
be necessary to reduce the biochemical oxygen demand to 300 parts per million
by weight, reduce the suspended solids to 350 parts per million by weight or
control the quantities and rates of discharge of such waters or wastes. Plans,
specifications and any other pertinent information relating to proposed
preliminary treatment facilities shall be submitted for the approval of the
City Administrator and no construction of such facilities shall be commenced
until said approvals are obtained in writing.
   (e)   If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess
the characteristics enumerated in §§
15-406 through
15-414, and which in the judgment of the City Administrator, may have a
deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment or receiving
waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life to constitute a public
nuisance, the City Administrator may:
      (1)   Reject the wastes;
      (2)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers;
      (3)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
      (4)   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating
the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges. If the City
Administrator permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the
design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the
review and approval of the City Administrator, and subject to the requirements
of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
   (f)   Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the City Administrator, they are necessary for the proper handling
of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable
wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall
not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors
shall be of a type and capacity approved by the City Administrator, and shall
be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
   (g)   Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided
for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory
and effective operation by the owner at his or her expense.
   (h)   When required by the City Administrator, the owner of any property
serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a
suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and
measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and
safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by
the City Administrator. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his or
her expense, and shall be maintained by him or her so as to be safe and
accessible at all times.
   (i)   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this article shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from
24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHs are determined from periodic
grab samples.)
   (j)   No statement contained in this article shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor, by the
industrial concern.
