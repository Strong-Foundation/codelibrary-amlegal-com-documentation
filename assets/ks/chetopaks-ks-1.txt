§ 1-212 CODE OF ETHICS.
   (a)   Declaration of policy. The proper operation of our government requires
that public officials and employees be independent, impartial and responsible
to the people; that governmental decisions and policy be made in the proper
channels; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its
government. In recognition of those goals, there is hereby established a Code
of Ethics for all officials and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid
or unpaid. The purpose of this Code is to establish ethical standards by
setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best
interests of the city.
   (b)   Responsibilities of public office. Public officials and employees are
agents of public purpose and hold office for the benefit of the public. They
are bound to uphold the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution
of this state and to carry out impartially the laws of the nation, state and
city and thus to foster respect for all government. They are bound to observe
in their official acts the highest standards of morality and to discharge
faithfully the duties of their office regardless of personal considerations,
recognizing that the long-term public interest must be their primary concern.
Their conduct in both their official and private affairs should be above
reproach.
   (c)   Dedicated service.
      (1)   All officials and employees of the city should be responsive to the
political objectives expressed by the electorate and the programs developed to
attain those objectives. Appointive officials and employees should adhere to
the rule of work and performance established as the standard for their
positions by the appropriate authority.
      (2)   Officials and employees should not exceed their authority or breach
the law or ask others to do so, and they should work in full cooperation with
other public officials and employees unless prohibited from so doing by law or
by officially recognized confidentiality of their work.
   (d)   Fair and equal treatment.
      (1)   Interest in appointments. Canvassing of members of the City
Council, directly or indirectly, in order to obtain preferential consideration
in connection with any appointment to the municipal service shall disqualify
the candidate for appointment except with reference to positions filled by
appointment by the City Council.
      (2)   Use of public property. No official or employee shall request or
permit the use of city-owned vehicles, equipment, materials or property for
personal convenience or profit, except when such services are available to the
public generally or are provided as city policy for the use of such official or
employee in the conduct of official business.
      (3)   Obligations to citizens. No official or employee shall grant any
special consideration, treatment or advantage to any citizen beyond that which
is available to every other citizen.
   (e)   Conflict of interest.
      (1)   Financial or personal interests. No elected or appointive city
official or employee, whether paid or unpaid, shall engage in any business or
transaction or shall have a financial or other personal interest, direct or
indirect, which is incompatible with the proper discharge of his or her duties
in the public interest or would tend to impair his or her independence of
judgment or action in the performance of his or her official duties. Personal,
as distinguished from financial interests, includes an interest arising from
blood or marriage relationships or close business or political association.
      (2)   Specific conflicts of interests. Specific conflicts of interest are
enumerated below for the guidance of officials and employees.
         (A)   Incompatible employment. No elected or appointive city official
or employee shall engage in or accept private employment or render services for
private interests when such employment or service is incompatible with the
proper discharge of his or her official duties or would tend to impair his or
her independence of judgment or action in the performance of his or her
official duties.
         (B)   Disclosure of confidential information. No elected or appointive
city official or employee shall, without proper legal authorization, disclose
confidential information concerning the property, government or affairs of the
city. Nor shall he or she use such information to advance the financial or
other private interest of himself, herself or others.
      (3)   Gifts and favors. No elected or appointive city official or
employee shall accept any valuable gift, whether in the form of service, loan,
thing or promise, from any person, firm or corporation which to his or her
knowledge is interested directly or indirectly in any manner whatsoever in
business dealings with the city; nor shall any such official or employee accept
any gift, favor or thing of value that may tend to influence him or her in the
discharge of his or her duties or grant in the discharge of his or her duties
any improper favor, service or thing of value. The prohibition against gifts or
favors shall not apply to an occasional non-pecuniary gift, of only nominal
value, an award publicly presented in recognition of public service, or any
gift which would have been offered or given to him or her if not an official or
employee.
      (4)   Representing private interest before city agencies or courts. No
elected or appointive city official or employee whose salary is paid in whole
or in part by the city shall appear in behalf of private interest before any
agency of the city. He or she shall not represent private interests in any
action or proceeding against the interest of the city in any litigation to
which the city is a party.

the animal upon payment by the owner of the boarding fee therefor. The Health
Officer may authorize the keeping of any such animal on the owner’s premises if
the owner produces a rabies vaccination certificate showing that the animal has

animal may, at his or her own expense, take such animal to any duly qualified

Building Inspector.
   (b)   Any licensee may, within 15 days, appeal in writing to the governing
body from any order of the Chief Building Official suspending his or her
license for its final decision thereon. The governing body may upon such
hearing terminate such suspension within not more than 30 days thereafter, or

building contractor shall not be eligible for a new license during a period of
six months thereafter. No fee shall be refunded in event of the suspension or

by reason of any permit or license granted herein.
§ 4-225 SEVERABILITY.
   If any section of the International Building Code or of this article shall
be held unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by any court of competent
jurisdiction, then such section shall be considered separate and apart from the
remaining sections, the section to be completely severable from the remaining
provisions which shall continue in full force and effect.
§ 4-226 DEMOLITION PERMIT REQUIRED; APPLICATION; APPROVAL.
   (a)   A demolition permit shall be required to demolish any building within
the city. No demolition permit shall be issued until a plan of the proposed
work is submitted to the Building Inspector.
   (b)   Demolition permits no longer require publication or Council approval
unless the Building Inspector has issues with the work being done. If the

indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such juvenile.
(Ord. 830, passed - -)
§ 11-305 ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES.
   (a)   If a police officer reasonably believes that a juvenile is in a public
place in violation of this article, the officer shall notify the juvenile that
he or she is in violation of this article and shall require the juvenile to
provide his or her name, address and telephone number and how to contact his or

shall, in the first instance of violation of this article, use his or her best
judgment in determining age.
   (b)   The police officer shall issue the juvenile a written warning that the
juvenile is in violation of this article and order the juvenile to go promptly
home. The Chief of Police shall send the parent of guardian of the juvenile
written notice of the violation pursuant to §
11-304.

experience and may provide that the police officer may deliver to a parent or
guardian thereof a juvenile under appropriate circumstances; for example, a
juvenile of tender age, near home, whose identity and address may readily be
ascertained or are known.
(Ord. 830, passed - -)
§ 11-306 PENALTIES.
   If, after, the warning notice pursuant to §
11-305 of a first violation by a juvenile, a parent violates §
11-304 (in connection with a second violation by the juvenile), this shall be
treated as a first offense by the parent. For the first offense by a parent,
the fine shall be $50 and, for each subsequent offense by a parent, the fine
shall be increased by an additional $50 (e.g., $100 for the second offense,
$150 for the third offense). The Judge of the Municipal Court, upon finding a
parent guilty, shall sentence the parent to pay this fine and the cost of
prosecution.
(Ord. 830, passed - -)
§ 11-307 SAME; CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY.
   (a)   Severability. Severability is intended throughout and within the
provisions of this article. If any provision, including any exception, part,
phrase or term, or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is
held invalid, the application to other persons or circumstances shall not be
affected thereby and the validity of this article in any and all other respects
shall not be affected thereby.
   (b)   Advisory opinions.
      (1)   The chief executive, after consultation with the City Attorney, is
hereby authorized to give advisory opinions in writing, which shall be binding
and shall be adhered to by the police, until this article is amended in such
respect, interpreting terms, phrases, parts or any provisions. Normally, such
advisory opinions shall be in response to good faith, signed letters addressed
to the chief executive or to a member of the City Council, questioning the
curfew as:
         (A)   Ambiguous;
         (B)   Having a potentially chilling effect on constitutional rights
specifically invoked; or
         (C)   Otherwise invalid, in all three categories with respect to
proposed conduct definitely described.
      (2)   This administrative remedy must be exhausted prior to presenting to
any court a question in any of the three categories. The City Council does not
intend a result through the enforcement of the curfew that is absurd,
impossible or execution or unreasonable. Council intends that the curfew be
held inapplicable in such cases, if any, where its application would be
unconstitutional under the Constitution of the state or the Constitution of the
United States of America.

obtained, as set forth in this article, the following provisions are required.
         (A)   The designated floodway shall be based on the standard that the
area chosen for the floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base
flood, without increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot at any
point.
         (B)   The community shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements and other developments within the
designated regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base
flood discharge.

§ 16-103 FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (a)   The members of the City Council, Appeal Board, as established by the
city, shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the
floodplain management requirements of this article.
   (b)   (1)   Where an application for a floodplain development permit is
denied by the Floodplain Administrator, the applicant may apply for such
floodplain development permit directly to the Appeal Board, as defined in
division (a) above.
      (2)   The Appeal Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged
that there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this
article.
   (c)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board or any
taxpayer may appeal such decision to the District Court of the county as
provided in K.S.A. 12-759 and 12-760.
   (d)   In passing upon such applications for variances, the Appeal Board
shall consider all technical data and evaluations, all relevant factors,
standards specified in other sections of this article and the following
criteria:
      (1)   Danger to life and property due to flood damage;
      (2)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (4)   Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
community;
      (5)   Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations, not subject to flood damage,
for the proposed use;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood waters, if applicable, expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems; streets; and bridges.
   (e)   (1)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood elevation, providing divisions (e)(2) through (e)(6) below
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre,
the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (2)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, repair,
rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places or local inventory of
historic places upon determination; provided, the proposed activity will not
preclude the structure’s continued historic designation and the variance is the
minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
      (3)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (5)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (A)   Showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (B)   Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (C)   Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances.
      (6)   A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the
signature of a community official that:
         (A)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base
flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
         (B)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all
variances actions as required by this article.
