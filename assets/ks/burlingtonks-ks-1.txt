setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best
interests of the city.

personal convenience or profit, except when such services are available to the
public generally or are provided as city policy for the use of such official or
employee in the conduct of official business.

official duties.

other private interest of himself, herself or others.

directly or indirectly in any manner whatsoever in business dealings with the

procedural requirements as to investment management practice.
   (b)   The objective of the investment policy and program of the city shall
be as follows.
      (1)   The safeguarding of all public monies shall be of the highest
priority. Public money shall not be invested or managed in any matter which
would jeopardize the safety of the principal.
      (2)   Consistent with the requirement of safety, the objective of the

§ 1-702 ACTIVE FUNDS; DESIGNATION OF DEPOSITORIES; ELIGIBLE DEPOSITORIES.

loan associations and savings banks. Only banks, savings and loan associations
and savings banks that have main or branch offices in the county shall be
designated as official depositories. No such bank, savings bank or savings and

that it can obtain satisfactory security for its deposits.
   (b)   The Clerk, Treasurer or other city officer or employee depositing
public funds shall deposit all such public funds coming into such person’s
possession in his, her or their name and official title as such officer. If the

officer thereof having custody of city funds shall deposit such funds with one
or more banks, savings and loan associations or savings banks which have main
or branch offices in the county if satisfactory security can be obtained
therefor and if not then elsewhere. In such event, the officer or employee
shall serve notice in writing on the governing body showing the names and
locations of such banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks where
such funds are deposited, and upon so doing, the officer or employee having
custody of such funds shall not be liable for the loss of any portion thereof

officer or employee.
   (c)   If eligible banks, savings and loan associations or savings banks
under divisions (a) or (b) above cannot or will not provide an acceptable bid,
which shall include services for the depositing of public funds under this
section, then banks, savings and loan associations or savings banks that have
main or branch offices in any immediately adjoining county may receive deposits
of the city’s active funds, if such banks, savings and loan associations or
savings banks have been designated as official depositories under division (a)
above and the city can obtain satisfactory security therefor.

§ 1-903 PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTIONS.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish the official
policy and procedures of the City Council (the governing body) for the granting
of property tax exemptions and tax incentives for real and personal property
used for economic development purposes, in accordance with the provisions of
Article 11, § 13 of the Constitution of the State of Kansas. These policies and
procedures shall also apply to property tax exemptions authorized by K.S.A. 12-
1740 et seq. in connection with industrial revenue bonds issued by the city.
The governing body has authority to grant property tax exemptions within the
city. The governing body is under no obligation to approve any requested
exemption and reserves the right to deviate from the policies and criteria
contained herein if circumstances exist to warrant such deviation.
   (b)   General objective. The securing of private economic growth and
development and the addition of new jobs within the community are important
current and long-term objectives of this city. The granting of property tax
exemptions and tax incentives is one of the tools available under state law to
help secure these public objectives. This section is intended to establish the
procedure and policy standards to govern the fair, effective and judicious use
of the power to grant such exemptions and tax incentives in this city.
   (c)   Legal authority.
      (1)   The governing bodies of Kansas counties and cities may exempt
certain property used for economic development purposes from taxes for a
maximum of ten years, in accordance with the provisions of Article 11, § 13 of
the Kansas Constitution, subject to such limitations or prohibitions as may be
enacted by the legislature that are uniformly applicable to all cities and
counties. This authority is discretionary with the governing body, and the
governing body may provide for tax exemptions-incentives in an amount and for
purposes more restrictive than that authorized by the Constitution or any such
legislation.
      (2)   Pursuant to its home rule powers, the governing body may:
         (A)   Require the owners of any property for which an exemption is
requested to provide certain information;
         (B)   Condition the granting of an exemption to an agreement providing
for the payment of in lieu charges or taxes under the provisions of K.S.A. 12-
147 and 12-148; and
         (C)   Require the payment of initial application and annual renewal
fees reasonably necessary to cover the costs of administration.
      (3)   The statutory authority for exempting certain property from ad
valorem taxation and requiring payments in lieu of such taxes is found in
K.S.A. 12-1740 et seq. Should the requirements of K.S.A. 12-1740 et seq. be
different or in conflict with the procedures established by this policy, the
requirements of the statute shall be followed. The Kansas Board of Tax Appeals
(BOTA) is the final authority on the granting of the tax exemption. The
governing body of the city cannot guarantee the tax exemption.
   (d)   General procedure. The following basic procedure shall govern the
issuance of tax exemptions-incentives within this city.
      (1)   The applicant business shall apply for a tax exemption-incentive by
filing a written application as provided in division (n) below.
      (2)   A preliminary review of the application will be completed by a
review committee consisting of designees from the county, city and school
district in which the property is or will be located for the purpose of
ascertaining that all necessary documentation and information is submitted, and
that the request complies with the parameters of this statement of policy and
procedure.
      (3)   A costs and benefits analysis (CBA) will be completed by the city
or county to determine what portion, if any, of the property to recommend for
exemption. The CBA will include the effect of the exemption on state revenues,
including the negative impact on the state imposed levy for school finance and
for the construction of state buildings.
      (4)   It shall then be determined whether the requested tax incentive:
         (A)   May be lawfully granted; and
         (B)   Should be granted with the amount thereof later determined, but
subject to an agreement of the business to make an in lieu of tax payment as
may be required by the governing body.
      (5)   The amount of the tax incentive, which will be an amount less than
the taxes otherwise payable if the property were not exempt, will then be
determined in accordance with this statement.
      (6)   Upon the failure of the business to fully and timely pay the in
lieu of tax payments, as may be required as a condition of the granting of an
exemption, or to provide reports or other information requested by the
governing body and reasonably necessary for the implementation of this policy,
the governing body may either deny, revoke or not renew the authorization of
such an exemption. All requests for a tax exemption-incentive for economic
development purposes shall be considered and acted upon in accordance with this
statement.
   (e)   Tax incentive defined. Various words and terms used in this statement
are defined in division (aa) below. The terms TAX INCENTIVE or TAX EXEMPTION-
INCENTIVE shall mean the difference between the amount of ad valorem property
taxes the affected business would pay if there were no city-granted exemption
and the amount required to be paid as in lieu of taxes or charges. For example,
if the taxes required with no exemption were $5,000, and the required in lieu
of tax payments were $3,000, the tax incentive would be $2,000.
   (f)   Jurisdiction. The governing body may grant tax exemptions-incentives
for any eligible property located within the city’s boundaries.
   (g)   Nominal tax determination. All tangible property of a business
receiving a tax exemption-incentive under this statement shall be annually
assessed by the County Appraiser in the same manner as if it were not exempt,
but the amount thereof shall not be placed on the assessment rolls. The amount
of the property taxes which would be payable shall also be determined annually
by the County Clerk and Treasurer, in the same manner as if the property were
not exempt, but such amount shall not be placed on the tax rolls. Separate
assessment and tax calculations shall be made for the land, for the
improvements thereon, and for any tangible personal property associated
therewith, of the exempt business. The appropriate county officers are
requested to provide the governing body with this information as early as
possible, but not later than November 15 of each year.
   (h)   Minimum payment in lieu of taxes. Any qualifying business receiving a
tax exemption-incentive pursuant to this policy statement shall be required
during any year in which taxes are abated 100% to make a minimum payment in
lieu of taxes which equals the amount of property tax which was payable for the
most recent year on the appraised valuation of the real estate, including
either land only, or buildings together with land, prior to the construction of
new buildings or added improvements to buildings on such property or prior to
acquisition of the property, by the qualifying business. The purpose of
requiring this minimum in lieu of tax payment is to ensure that the county,
city, school district and any other taxing jurisdictions affected by the
exemption will not receive less tax revenue from the exempted property than was
received prior to the exemption. For extraordinary reasons, such as when vacant
buildings are acquired for a new business, or when the market value of the
property has decreased, or with respect to projects which due to their unusual
nature or magnitude offer extraordinary benefits to the community, this
requirement may be waived in part or in whole by the governing body.
   (i)   Special assessments. Any tax exemption granted for real property under
this statement shall not affect the liability of such property for any special
assessments levied or to be levied against such property.
   (j)   Pirating. It shall be the policy of the governing body not to accept
applications for tax exemptions-incentives, or to grant such tax incentives,
which deliberately encourage and cause the pirating of business from another
Kansas community to this community, or from this community to another Kansas
community. It is the intent of the governing body to avoid participation in
“bidding wars” between cities or areas competing for the location of new
businesses or expansion of existing businesses, through attempts to offer the
largest tax incentive or other public inducement, which is detrimental to the
state’s economy and the public interest.
   (k)   Standards for determining benefits. The governing body will consider
granting tax exemptions-incentives only upon a clear and factual showing of
direct economic benefit to the governing body through advancement of its
economic development goals, including the creation of additional jobs and the
stimulation of additional private investment. The governing body, in
determining the amount and term of a tax exemption-incentive to be granted,
shall consider various factors including, but not limited to, the following:
      (1)   The appraised valuation of the property in relation to the economic
benefit to the governing body of increased employment;
      (2)   The gain in tax revenue which may result from the new or expanded
business, including the increase in the property tax base upon the expiration
of the exemption;
      (3)   The contribution that the new or expanded business will make
towards increased employment and earnings within the community;
      (4)   The number of new jobs created directly by the business in relation
to the amount of tax incentives granted;
      (5)   The kinds of jobs created in relation to the type of skills
available from the local labor market;
      (6)   The utilization by the business of labor skills and abilities of
unemployed persons in the community;
      (7)   The degree to which the business improves the diversification of
the economy of the governing body and its environs;
      (8)   The degree to which the ultimate market for the manufactured
products is outside the community, recognizing that outside markets bring in
“new money” to the local economy;
      (9)   The potential of the business for future expansion and additional
job creation;

      (2)   The governing body recognizes that a simple system of determining
the amount of tax incentives to be granted to reach these objectives may not
always be equitable if applied uniformly to different kinds of businesses. In
determining the actual amount of tax incentives granted, the governing body
shall consider the factors and criteria set forth in division (k) above.
      (3)   As a general rule, the amount of the tax incentive granted shall be

            (ii)   Tangible personal property (machinery and equipment).

by a new business or which is necessary to facilitate the expansion of an
existing business if, as a result of such expansion, new employment is created,
is eligible for exemption.
            (iii)   Buildings. All buildings or additions to existing buildings
used exclusively for an eligible business activity used by a new business or
which is necessary to facilitate the expansion of an existing business if, as a
result of such expansion, new employment is created, are eligible for

            (i)   For a new or existing qualifying business that makes an
initial investment or an additional investment of at least $100,000 in building

tax exemption-incentive unless the business submits a full and complete
application, and provides such additional information as may be requested. The
Coffey County Economic Development Department (CCEDD) is hereby authorized and
empowered to prepare a standard application form which, upon completion, will
provide adequate and sufficient information to determine whether a tax
incentive should be granted and the amount thereof. The accuracy of the
information provided in the application shall be verified by the applicant. Any
misstatement of or error in fact may render the application null and void and
may be cause for the repeal of any resolution adopted in reliance on said
information.
   (o)   Application and renewal fees. Any business requesting a tax exemption
pursuant to this section shall pay to the governing body an application fee of
$250, which shall be submitted at the same time the application form required
by division (n) above is submitted. In addition, any business which has been
granted a tax exemption shall pay an annual renewal fee in the amount of $100.
   (p)   Initial review procedure.
      (1)   On receipt of the completed application form, the review committee
consisting of designees from the city, county and school district in which the
property is or will be located shall determine:
         (a)   Whether the application is complete and sufficient for review;
and
         (b)   Whether the applicant business is eligible for an exemption
under the Kansas Constitution, this section and any other applicable laws.
      (2)   If the application is incomplete, the review committee shall
immediately notify the applicant, noting the need for such changes or additions
as deemed necessary. If questions arise as to whether the business is legally
eligible for an exemption, the matter shall be referred to legal counsel, who
shall consult with the applicant business. If the application is found
complete, and is for a purpose which appears to be authorized by law, the
review committee shall so notify the Administrative Review Committee.
   (q)   Administrative Review Committee. There is hereby created an
Administrative Review Committee, which shall be composed of the Mayor or his or
her designee of the city in which the property is or will be located, the
Superintendent or his or her designee of the school district (USD) in which the
property is or will be located, the City Attorney, the City Clerk and the
County Economic Development Department Director. The purpose of the
Administrative Review Committee shall be to receive and review requests and
applications for tax exemptions-incentives, to gather and review such
additional information as may be deemed necessary to conduct preliminary
negotiations with the applicant business, and to make such recommendations as
deemed advisable to the city. Administrative Review Committee records,
including applications for tax exemptions, may be withheld from public
disclosure under the Kansas Open Records Act as provided for under K.S.A. 45-
221(20) and 45-221(31) and other subsections of K.S.A. 45-221, but shall be
available for public inspection when otherwise required by law. The Committee
is authorized to issue administrative letters of intent with governing body
approval, but said letters shall not be binding on a governing body and shall
be superseded by any final action by the governing body or by letter of intent
issued by the governing body under division (r) below.
   (r)   Initial governing body action.
      (1)   Upon receiving the recommendations of the Administrative Review
Committee, the governing body shall first determine whether to reject the
requested exemption or to further consider the request.
      (2)   Upon a favorable vote for further consideration, the governing body
shall either:
         (A)   Issue a letter of intent as provided by division (t) below; or
         (B)   Schedule a public hearing thereon.
   (s)   Notice and hearing. No tax exemption-incentive shall be granted by the
city prior to a public hearing thereon. Notice of the public hearing shall be
published at least seven days prior to the hearing in the official county
newspaper, giving the time and place, and the hearing may be held at a regular
or special meeting of the governing body. The City Clerk shall thereupon notify
in writing the Board of County Commissioners, the Superintendent of the
appropriate school district, and the Clerk of the township and any other taxing
jurisdiction; excluding the state, which derives or could derive property taxes
from the affected business. Upon request, the City Clerk shall provide any such
public agency with a copy of the application. The applicant business shall be
invited, but not required, to attend the public hearing.
   (t)   Letters of intent. Upon receiving the recommendations of the
Administrative Review Committee, the governing body may issue a letter of
intent, setting forth in general terms its proposed plans for granting a tax
exemption-incentive and any conditions thereto, subject to the provisions of
divisions (h) and (m) above. Such letters of intent shall be issued only with
the approval of the governing body, and as an expression of good faith intent,
but shall not in any way bind the city to the granting of an exemption-
incentive. Such letters of intent shall expire six months after issuance, but
may be renewed. A public hearing shall not be required prior to the issuance of
letters of intent. No elected or appointed officer, employee or committee of
the city, and no chamber, governing body, development council, or other public
or private body or individual shall be authorized to speak for and commit the
governing body to the granting of a tax exemption-incentive. Such letters of
intent issued by the governing body shall supersede any letters issued by the
Administrative Review Committee.
   (u)   Annual renewal. The extent and term of any tax exemption-incentive
granted shall be subject to annual review and determination by the governing
body to ensure that the ownership and use of the property and any qualifying
criteria of the business for the tax exemption-incentive continue to exist. The
review shall be completed by not later than February 1 of each year. The
governing body may require an annual renewal application to be filed or other
information necessary to assure the continued qualification of the exempt
business. Physical additions, new construction or other improvements added
after approval of the original tax exemption will not be included in the annual
renewal and will require a separate application for tax exemption.
   (v)   Transfer of ownership or use. No exemption or tax incentives granted
by the governing body shall be transferred as a result of a change in the
majority ownership of the business. Any new owner shall file a new application
for a tax exemption-incentive. Further, the governing body shall be notified by
the business of any substantive change in the use of a tax exempt property.
   (w)   Distribution of revenue. The granting of tax exemptions-incentives by
the governing body is hereby declared to be a contract under the provisions of
K.S.A. 12-147. The in lieu of taxes payment which may be required of a business
granted a tax exemption under this section shall be paid to the County
Treasurer, with notice of the amount and date paid provided to the governing
body. The County Treasurer is directed to apportion the payment, under the
provisions of K.S.A. 12-148(3), to the general fund of all taxing subdivisions,
excluding the state, which levy taxes on property where the business is
situated. The apportionment shall be based on the relative amount of taxes
levied, for any and all purposes, by each of the applicable taxing
subdivisions.
   (x)   Exemption ordinance. The City Clerk shall provide a copy of the
ordinance, as published in the official county newspaper, granting an exemption
from taxation to the applicant for use in filing an initial request for tax
exemption as required by K.S.A. 79-213, and by K.S.A. 79-210 for subsequent
years.
   (y)   Exemption forms. A copy of the exemption applications required by

cessation of an exempt use of property, shall be filed with the City Clerk by
the property owner.
   (z)   Waiver of statement requirements. The governing body reserves the
right to grant or not to grant a tax exemption-incentive under circumstances
beyond the scope of this section, or to waive any procedural requirement.
However, no such action or waiver shall be taken or made except upon a finding

himself or herself and not by a licensed electrical contractor, and likewise
subject to the final approval of the Electric Inspector for work performed.
   (c)   Upon approval of the completed application and a determination that a
permit should be issued, the Electric Inspector or his or her assistant shall
issue a permit to the owner, electrician or electrical contractor authorizing
the electrical construction work covered by the application. The permit shall
describe the work that it authorizes.
   (d)   Any permit issued under this section shall be valid and subsisting for
a period of not more than six months from the date of issuance unless the
permittee shall have commenced, within the period so limited, the electrical
construction work authorized by such permit. ELECTRICAL CONSTRUCTION WORK
COMMENCED, for the purpose of this section, shall mean the beginning of
electrical construction work other than the preparation of plans or the letting
of an electrical contract.
§ 4-312 SAME; PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   Whenever an application for a electrical permit is made, the Electric
Superintendent or the Electric Inspector may, if he or she finds it necessary
to determine whether electrical construction work described in the application
will comply with the laws pertaining to such work, require that the applicant
file a written description or drawing of the proposed electrical construction
as may be prepared for the purpose. If such drawing or description is
insufficient for the purposes of determining whether a permit should be issued,
the Electric Inspector may require the applicant to file complete electrical
and engineering plans and specifications for such electrical construction, or
any part thereof, as may be necessary for the Electric Inspector to determine
compliance with this article. The filing of such plans and specifications and
the approval thereof in connection with an application for a permit shall not
in any way affect the authority of the city to deny or issue a permit, or to
inspect any electrical construction work for conformity with this article.
§ 4-313 SAME; FEES.
   The fee for an electrical permit shall be $15. The fee herein shall be paid

to be kept on the premises at all times from the commencement of the work to
the completion thereof.
§ 4-315 REQUEST FOR INSPECTION.

be the duty of the person doing such work to notify the Electric Inspector and
request that it be inspected; after which such work shall be inspected promptly
as hereinafter provided.
§ 4-316 INSPECTION; CONCEALMENT OF PRIOR WORK.
   (a)   When any electric equipment is to be hidden from view by the permanent
placement of parts of the building, the person, firm or corporation installing
the equipment shall notify the Electric Inspector and such equipment shall not
be concealed until it has been inspected, approved or authorized by the
Electric Inspector or until 24 hours, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and
holidays, shall have elapsed from the time of such notification. On large
installations, where the concealment of equipment proceeds continuously, the
person, firm or corporation installing the electrical equipment shall give the
Electric Inspector due notice and inspections shall be made periodically during
the progress of the work.
   (b)   The Electric Inspector shall have the authority to require building
contractors to open such work which, in any manner, conceals electrical wiring
that has been closed without his or her knowledge or permission, and in no case
shall the Inspector issue a certificate of approval until satisfied that the
work is in accordance with the provisions of this article. The Inspector shall
also have the right to refuse to issue a certificate of approval on any wiring
that is concealed in such manner that it cannot be fully determined that it has
been done in accordance with this article.
§ 4-317 UNSAFE AND DEFECTIVE INSTALLATIONS.
   When work which the enforcement officer is required to inspect, is found not
to comply with the requirements of this article, and to be unsafe and
defective, the enforcement officer shall notify the party doing such work, of
the defect, and order him or her to change, rearrange or remove the same, and
upon the person’s failure or refusal so to do within a reasonable time such
party shall be guilty of an offense, and every day which elapses after the
expiration of such reasonable time as fixed by the enforcement officer without
compliance with such order shall be considered a separate offense.
§ 4-318 INSPECTION FEE.
   An initial inspection fee, as set by the governing body, and an inspection
fee, as set by the governing body, for subsequent inspections required shall be
paid before any electrical installation will be approved or a certificate of
approval issued.
§ 4-319 CERTIFICATE OF APPROVAL.
   (a)   When the Electric Inspector finds an electrical construction or

construction work or making the installation, and authorize the use of the
installation and connection to the supply of electricity.
   (b)   If, upon inspection, the installation is not found to be fully in
conformity with the provisions of this article, the Electric Inspector shall

notified in writing and shall make the necessary repairs or changes required to
place the conductors or equipment in safe condition and have the work completed
within the period specified by the Electric Inspector.
§ 4-322 CONDEMNATION; APPEAL.
   (a)   If, in the judgment of the Electric Inspector, after an inspection,
any electrical conductors, appliances or equipment in any building are unsafe
or dangerous to persons or property, the Inspector shall have the power to
cause the wires or appliances to be disconnected from the source of electrical
energy supplying these conductors or equipment, and may, at his or her
discretion, seal the control switches for the same in an open or disconnected
position, whereupon he or she shall give notice to the owner, or his or her
agent, or by posting such notice at the site and shall also notify the
utilities serving the premises. Thereafter, it shall be unlawful for any person
to cause or permit electric current to be supplied to the electrical
conductors, appliances or equipment so sealed until they shall have been made
safe and the Inspector shall have issued a certificate of approval to that
effect.
   (b)   It shall be the duty of the Electric Inspector to cause all dead

shall at once proceed to determine the facts, and within ten days from
receiving the petition make a decision in accordance with their findings.
§ 4-323 INTERFERENCE BY UNAUTHORIZED PERSON.
   It shall be unlawful for any unauthorized person to, in any manner, change
or alter electrical conductors or equipment in or on any building. If, in the
course of the erection of a building or structure, electrical conductors or

of the structure, notice shall be immediately given the authorized person or
firm installing the electrical conductors or equipment, and the needed change
shall be made by such authorized person or firm.

taxes, shall certify the unpaid portion of the costs to the County Clerk and
who shall extend the same on the tax rolls of the county against such lot or

§ 8-301 FINDINGS OF GOVERNING BODY.
   The governing body finds that junked, wrecked, dismantled, inoperative or
abandoned vehicles affect the health, safety and general welfare of citizens of
the city because they:
   (a)   Serve as a breeding ground for flies, mosquitoes, rats and other
insects and rodents;
   (b)   Are a danger to persons, particularly children, because of broken
glass, sharp metal protrusions, insecure mounting on blocks, jacks or other
supports;
   (c)   Are a ready source of fire and explosion;
   (d)   Encourage pilfering and theft;
   (e)   Constitute a blighting influence upon the area in which they are
located; and
   (f)   Constitute a fire hazard because they frequently block access for fire
equipment to adjacent buildings and structures.

K.S.A. 40-3901 et seq., whereby no insurance company shall pay a claim of a
named insured for loss or damage to any building or other structure located
within the city, arising out of any fire, explosion or windstorm, where the
amount recoverable for the loss or damage to the building or other structure
under all policies is in excess of 75% of the face value of the policy covering
such building or other insured structure, unless there is compliance with the
procedures set out in this article.
(1997 Code, § 8-901) (Ord. 843, adopted 8-3-2016)
§ 8-602 LIEN CREATED.
   The governing body of the city hereby creates a lien in favor of the city on
the proceeds of any insurance policy based upon a covered claim payment made

caused by or arising out of any fire, explosion or windstorm, where the amount
recoverable for all the loss or damage to the building or other structure under
all policies is in excess of 75% of the face value of the policy(s) covering
such building or other insured structure. The lien arises upon any unpaid tax,
special ad valorem levy, or any other charge imposed upon real property by or
on behalf of the city which is an encumbrance on real property, whether or not
evidenced by written instrument, or such tax, levy, assessment, expense or
other charge that has remained undischarged for at least one year prior to the

payment, unless the Chief Building Inspector of the city has issued a
certificate to the insurance company or companies that the insured has removed
the damaged building or other structure, as well as all associated debris, or

reimburse the city for any expenses incurred by the city in proceeding under
K.S.A. 12-1756. Upon reimbursement from the insurance proceeds, the Chief
Building Inspector shall immediately effect the release of the lien resulting
therefrom. Should the expenses incurred by the city exceed the insurance
proceeds paid over to the City Treasurer under § 8-605(a), the Chief Building
Inspector shall publish a new lien as authorized by K.S.A. 12-1756, in an

practice or order such relief as may be appropriate.

further, that the chief executive officer first complies with the provisions of
the Fourth Amendment relating to unreasonable searches and seizures. The chief
executive officer may issue subpoenas to compel his or her access to or the
production of such materials, or the appearance of such persons, and may issue
interrogatories to a respondent, to the same extent and subject to the same
limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or interrogatories were issued or
served in aid of a civil action in the Unites States District Court of the
district in which the investigation is taking place. The chief executive
officer may administer oaths.
   (b)   Upon written application to the chief executive officer, a respondent
shall be entitled to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in
the name of the chief executive officer to the same extent and subject to the
same limitations as subpoenas issued by the chief executive officer himself or
herself. Subpoenas issued at the request of a respondent shall show on their
face the name and address of such respondent and shall state that they were
issued at his or her request.
   (c)   Witnesses summoned by subpoena of the chief executive officer shall be
entitled to the same witness and mileage fees as are witnesses in proceedings
in United States District Courts. Fees payable to a witness summoned by a
subpoena issued at the request of a respondent shall be paid by him or her.
   (d)   Within five days after service of a subpoena upon any person, such
person may petition the chief executive officer to revoke or modify the
subpoena. The chief executive officer shall grant the petition if he or she
finds that the subpoena requires appearance or attendance at an unreasonable
time or place, that it requires production of evidence which does not relate to
any matter under investigation, that it does not describe with sufficient
particularity the evidence to be produced, that compliance would be unduly
onerous, or for other good reason.
   (e)   In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the chief
executive officer or other person at whose request it was issued may petition
for its enforcement in the municipal or state court for the district in which
the person to whom the subpoena was addressed resides, was served or transacts
business.
   (f)   Any person who willfully fails or neglects to attend and testify or to
answer any lawful inquiry or to produce records, documents or other evidence,
if in his or her power to do so, in obedience to the subpoena or lawful order
of the chief executive officer shall be fined not more than $1,000 or
imprisoned not more then one year, or both. Any person who, with intent thereby
to mislead the chief executive officer, shall make or cause to be made any
false entry or statement or fact in any report, account, record or other
document submitted to the chief executive officer pursuant to his or her
subpoena or other order, or shall willfully neglect or fail to make or cause to
be made full, true and correct entries in such reports, accounts, records or
other documents, or shall willfully mutilate, alter or by any other means
falsify any documentary evidence, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or
imprisoned not more than one year, or both.

executive officer participates as a party or as amicus pursuant to this

jurisdiction. A civil action shall be commenced within 180 days after the
alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred; provided however, that the
court shall continue such civil case brought pursuant to this section or §
8-810(d) from time to time before bringing it to trial if the court believes
that the conciliation efforts of the chief executive officer are likely to
result in satisfactory settlement of the discriminatory housing practice
complained of in the complaint made to the chief executive officer and which
practice forms the basis for the action in court; and provided however, that
any sale, encumbrance or rental consummated prior to the issuance of any court
order issued under the authority of this article and involving a bona fide
purchaser, encumbrancer or tenant without actual notice of the existence of the
filing of a complaint or civil action under the provisions of this article
shall not be affected.
   (b)   The court may grant as relief, as it deems appropriate, any permanent
or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order or other order, and may
award to the plaintiff actual damages and not more than $1,000 punitive
damages, together with court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees in the case
of a prevailing plaintiff; provided, that the plaintiff in the opinion of the

§ 8-901 FINDINGS OF GOVERNING BODY.
   The governing body finds that smoking in the city owned buildings and
vehicles is hazardous to the health of city employees, elected officials,
visitors, prisoners and detainees because:

involuntary smoking is cause of disease including lung cancer in healthy
nonsmokers;

potential human carcinogen that poses greater public health risks than those of
virtually any pollutant regulated under federal laws;
   (c)   The Environmental Protection Agency report concluded that
environmental tobacco smoke should be designated a Group A carcinogen that
poses greater public health risks than those of virtually any pollutant
regulated under federal laws;
   (d)   It has been well documented that tobacco smoke hurts everyone, smokers
and nonsmokers alike;
   (e)   The right of all our employees to breathe safely is more important to
us than the right of some of them to smoke; and
   (f)   The city is dedicated to providing a healthy work environment for our
employees.
(1997 Code, § 8-801) (Ord. 570, adopted 9-21-1994)
§ 8-902 PROHIBITED; WORK ENVIRONMENT.
   To enable the city to provide a health work environment for its employees,

including, but not limited to:

   (b)   Hallways;
   (c)   Break rooms;
   (d)   Restrooms;
   (e)   Meeting rooms;
   (f)   Shops;
   (g)   Production facilities; and

(1997 Code, § 8-803) (Ord. 570, adopted 9-21-1994)
§ 8-904 PROHIBITIONS.
   This prohibition shall apply to, but not be limited to, all elected
officials, employees, visitors, prisoners and detainees alike.
(1997 Code, § 8-804) (Ord. 570, adopted 9-21-1994)
§ 8-905 VIOLATIONS.
   Employees who violate this policy shall be subject to prosecution under the
provisions of K.S.A. 21-4010 and amendments thereto. Any person found guilty of
smoking in violation of this statute shall be punishable according to the
penalty provisions of K.S.A. 21-4012 and will be subject to the same
disciplinary actions that accompany infractions of other city rules including
written warning, suspension and possible discharge.

responsibility of the Street Superintendent to inform said owner of the size
and type of culvert required and any drainage structures, such as connecting
boxes or area drains that will be required. Property owners will be responsible
for the cost of all improvements, including costs for the city to install the
culverts and any administration costs involved with the design of said
improvements. Property owners shall hire a licensed, bonded and insured
contractor to install all connection boxes and area drains. All such items will
need to be pre-approved by the Street Superintendent as to design and location
prior to installation. The property owner has the choice to either have the
city or the contractor install the culverts. The city will have an updated pay

shall relieve the property owner, persons or contractor of the penalty herein
imposed.

   The city reserves the right at any time to change the rates provided for in
this article or to reclassify the consumers on the basis of the purpose for
which water services of the city may be used. Whenever a different type of
service shall be required by any consumer and furnished by the Water Department
of the city, the Superintendent is authorized to measure such special or
different service through more than one meter to arrive at a proper charge. The
city may at its option bill such customer separately for the services measured
by such meter at the rate applicable to the type of service furnished through
such separate meter. In case of any conflict in or dispute over the proper rate
or class or rates to be applied to any consumer or service, the decision of the
Superintendent shall be final and conclusive. When the dispute shall be over
the correct amount of any bill rendered for services and no regulation of the
Department shall apply, the Superintendent is authorized to determine the
proper charge to be made from an estimate of the average demand for such
services during a prior period of services when no dispute existed.

user charge system. That portion of the total user charge which is designated
for operation and maintenance including replacement of the treatment works
shall be established by this division (a).
   (b)   The portion of the total user charge collected which is designated for
operation and maintenance including replacement purposes as established in this
division (b) shall be deposited in a separate non-lapsing fund known as the
Wastewater Operation Maintenance and Replacement Fund and will be kept in two
primary accounts as follows:
      (1)   An account designated for the specific purpose of defraying
operation and maintenance costs (excluding replacement) of the treatment works
known as the Wastewater Operation and Maintenance Account. All revenue received
in the Wastewater Operation, Maintenance and Replacement Fund established in
accordance with division (b) above shall be placed in the Wastewater Operation
and Maintenance Account, except as set out and in compliance with division (b)
(2) below; and
      (2)   An account designated for the specific purpose of ensuring
replacement needs over the useful life of the treatment system known as the
Wastewater Depreciation and Replacement Account. Transfers to this account
shall be made from the Wastewater Operation Maintenance and Replacement Fund in
the amount of $5,000 annually. The sum shall be accumulated in the Wastewater
Depreciation and Replacement Account. The account will serve the requirement of
providing a replacement account as directed by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency regulations.
   (c)   Fiscal year-end balances in the operation and maintenance account and
the replacement account shall be carried over to the same accounts in the
subsequent fiscal year, and shall be used for no other purposes than those
designated for these accounts. Monies which have been transferred from other
sources to meet temporary shortages in the Operation, Maintenance and
Replacement Fund shall be returned to their respective accounts upon
appropriate adjustment of the user charge rates for operation, maintenance and
replacement. The user charge rate(s) shall be adjusted such that the
transferred monies will be returned to their respective accounts within the
fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the monies were borrowed.
§ 15-439 BASIS FOR DETERMINATION.
   Monthly sewage rates will be charged and collected for the use of and
services rendered by the treatment works to all customers and users of such
plant and system, including all persons, the United States of America and any
of its agencies, the state, all subdivisions of such state and all
institutions, organizations and others whose premises are connected or may
hereafter be connected directly or indirectly with the city’s treatment works.
Rates shall be based on use of the treatment works as determined by a water
meter acceptable to the city.
§ 15-440 RESIDENTIAL USERS.
   For residential contributors, monthly sewer user charges will be computed a
follows:
   (a)   The total consumption of water shown on the three actually read
billings of water occurring in the months of December, January and February
commencing with the first water billing occurring in the months of December,
January and February shall be divided by three and to such gallonage the rates
below shall be applied. The amount so computed shall be the monthly sewer
charge for the ensuing 12 months’ billings;
   (b)   The minimum monthly charge shall not be prorated if service is
furnished for over 15 days, but if the time involved is 15 days or less, one-
half of the charge shall be made. For service furnished over 15 days, the full
monthly charge shall be made;
   (c)   When the monthly bill of any customer is in excess of the minimum
charge, the charge shall be computed to the nearest 100 gallons;
   (d)   Any customer connected to the city’s sanitary sewage treatment plant
and facilities without a water meter shall pay, until a water meter is
installed, the minimum wastewater (sewage) rate and charge hereinbefore
established;
   (e)   A new customer becoming chargeable for sewer services and occupying or
using real estate for which there shall not have been established a record for
the use of water for the full three months’ water billing, eligible of water
billing during the period provided in hereof, shall pay a monthly sewage rate
and charge based on the minimum base rate charge, computed as hereinbefore set
forth, until the monthly charges established as provided in division (a) above.
A new customer under such circumstances becoming chargeable by a bill dated
during or after the base period provided in hereof, but who does not have three
months of water consumption during the base period, shall pay wastewater
(sewage) charges based on the minimum base rate until such time as a new three
months’ base rate period is established. As used in this division (e), the term
NEW CUSTOMER shall mean a customer occupying or using real estate for which no
water consumption record shall have been theretofore established during the
base period then applicable. A change of occupancy or use of any real estate
shall be treated as a new customer as provided.
§ 15-441 INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL USERS.
   (a)   For industrial and commercial contributors, sewer user charges shall
be based on water used during the current month.
   (b)   (1)   If any commercial, institutional or industrial user supplied
with water shall so use the same that a substantial part thereof is not
discharged into the sanitary sewer system of the city then, in any such case,
the governing body shall have the right to modify the rates with respect to
such customer and in such cases may enter into contracts which shall provide
for equitable and fair rates and charges for sewer services. A substantial part
thereof as defined in the preceding sentence shall mean that a minimum of 10%
of the water usage from the city water system is not being discharged into the
sanitary sewer system of the city. In the event that any commercial,
institutional or industrial user desires to make application for relief under
this division (b) it shall make a request for testing and analysis in writing
with the City Clerk, and make a deposit of $1,000 to defray the expense
thereof.
      (2)   The city shall cause the staff of the city to determine the type of
testing which is necessary in order to make a determination as to whether a
substantial part of the city water is not being discharged into the sanitary
sewer system of the city. Any expenses incurred in connection with the purchase
of the sewer meter, or any other equipment, shall be the sole responsibility
and expense of the person or firm making application for relief hereunder.
      (3)   Any expenses incurred by the city in determining or making the test
shall be paid for from the money on deposit with the city. Any unused portion
of the deposit made hereunder shall be returned to the depositor. In the event
the expenses exceed the deposit, the applicant shall pay the city the expenses
thereof.
      (4)   If the testing conducted discloses that 10% of the city water is
not being discharged into the sanitary sewer system to the satisfaction of the
governing body of the city, it shall cause the computation of the sewer tax
imposed hereunder to be changed in accord with this division (b), times the
percentage of such computation, in accord with the testing which is conducted.
      (5)   Any user hereunder which is dumping water from an independent
source of supply back into the sanitary sewage system of the city shall have
added thereto the amount of the water from its independent source of supply to
be considered in the amount of sewer tax which the user is to pay.
      (6)   The city shall have the right at any time in the future after a
percentage has been determined hereunder to monitor or otherwise test the
amount of water being returned to the sewer system of the city, and shall be
responsible for any and all costs and expenses thereof. Any adjustments
necessary in establishing the amount of sewer usage fee shall be adjusted in
accord with the results of any future monitoring or testing.
   (c)   The user charge for that contributor may be based on a wastewater
meter(s), or separate water meter(s) installed and maintained at the
contributor’s expense, and/or process records verifying the user’s contribution
to the treatment works that are acceptable to the city.

by and between __________________________________________, hereinafter referred
to as “DEVELOPER” AND THE CITY OF BURLINGTON, KANSAS, hereinafter referred to

   WHEREAS, the City has approved the plat of
____________________________________ (Addition/Subdivision) (to/in) the City of
Burlington, Coffey County, Kansas, in accordance with the recommendations of
the Burlington City Planning Commission;
   NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto do hereby agree as follows:
Section I: Required Improvements: As a condition to final plat approval, the
developer of a proposed subdivision shall be responsible to install or, in
cooperation with governmental bodies and utility companies, cause to be
installed the following: all roadways, alleys, curbs, gutters and street
drainage; sidewalks, sanitary sewer systems; water supply systems; fire
hydrants; storm drainage system; electrical services (overhead or underground),
street lights and telephone service; landscaping of public areas;  street sign;
property survey monuments; relocation of existing facilities; minimizing soil
erosion and sedimentation. (Reference: City Subdivision Regulations Article 7-

new development for the installation of public improvements (rights of way or
easements, streets, curb, gutter, electrical services (overhead or
underground), street lights, storm sewer, and sanitary sewer mains and
laterals, etc.) upon submission of a valid petition of the property owners and
the required financial commitment. Said commitment is considered to be provided
whenever the City has been furnished with:
   A.   Fiscal sureties:
      1.   Upon final approval of plans and specifications for required
improvements by the Planning Commission, the developer shall enter into an
agreement with the applicable Governing Body in which the developer agrees to
install such required improvements. Such agreement shall be conditioned upon
the approval of the final plat by the Governing Body. (Reference: City
Subdivision Regulations Article 7-104A1)
      2.   Said commitment is considered to be provided whenever the City has
been furnished with: (a) funding (cash, cashiers check or escrow account) equal
to 15% of the estimated principal cost of the project; or (b) financial
guarantee (irrevocable letter of credit, corporate completion bond) equal to
15% of the estimated principal cost of the project.
   Project cost shall include engineering design, construction, inspection,
temporary note interest, fiscal, legal and administration. Cash funding will be
used to reduce the amount of project costs covered by special assessment bond
financing. The financial guarantee will be applied annually to satisfy the
principal and interest costs of bonded public improvements, should any
applicable special assessments not be paid when due.
      3.    The developer shall furnish a cashier's check, escrow account or
irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the Governing Body, 15% of the amount
of guarantees shall be returned by, or held as a deposit in escrow after, the
final completion of such deposit in escrow may be held by the Governing Body
for a period of 18 months after such improvements are completed for the purpose
of:
         a.   Guaranteeing and securing the correction of any defect in
material or workmanship furnished for such improvements, latent in character,
and not discernible at the time of final inspection or acceptance by the
Governing Body; and
         b.   Guarantee against any damage to such improvements by reason of
the settling of the ground, base, or foundation thereof. Such escrow agreement
shall provide that, as such defects have so developed, that the deposit may be
applied by the Governing Body for any amounts incurred correcting such defects;
and that the balance of such deposit, if any, held at the end of such 18-month
period shall be returned by the Governing Body to the depositor, or paid to the
order of the depositor without payment of interest by the Governing Body.
(Reference: City Subdivision Regulations Article 7-104A3a-b)
   B.   Petitions to the Governing Body may be submitted as a means of
guaranteeing to such Governing Body the authority to install improvements.

the Governing Body concurrently with the petition approval or as soon
thereafter as may be provided by law. The cost of the publication of said
resolution shall be borne by the developer.
      4.   The initiating resolution must be recorded with the County Register
of Deeds after it has been adopted by the Governing Body showing that the land
described in the resolution will be liable in the future for special
assessments for the improvements authorized. (Reference: City Subdivision
Regulations Article 7-104B1-4)
   C.   No public funds will be used for business or private use.
   D.   For streets and related drainage only in rural type subdivisions, pre-
construction of improvements may be used if approved by the applicable
Governing Body. The developer may request such Governing Body to hold the final
plat acceptance until such time as an inspection certified that the required
improvements have been properly constructed. Construction of streets and
related drainage as outlined in the subdivision regulations must commence
within three (3) years of acceptance of the final plat. (Reference: City
Subdivision Regulations Article 7-104C)
   E.    The developer shall, prior to the approval of the final plat, submit a
letter from the utility(ies) involved stating that satisfactory arrangements
have been made by the developer guaranteeing the installation of their
respective services. (Reference: City Subdivision Regulations Article 7-104D)

developer before the final plat is recorded with the County Register of Deeds

finding of necessity, require the developer to install or upgrade off-site
improvements located outside the perimeter of a subdivision if such need is
substantially created by a proposed subdivision. Such off-site improvements
should be within dedicated rights of way or easements and serve a public
purpose. The financing and guaranteeing of such improvements shall be
administered as if they were the same as on-site improvements under Section 7-

improvements as recommended by the Planning Commission, if the need is created
by a proposed subdivision: Drainage improvements; Pedestrian ways and
