reopen negotiations.

SPEED HUMP POLICY
§ 70.01 PURPOSE.
   Reducing excessive speeds on residential streets is an important objective
in ensuring the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, animals, and vehicles in
neighborhoods, and in creating a calmer and more livable environment. Methods
for discouraging speeding include enforcement, education, and engineering
efforts. While police enforcement remains the most effective means of dealing
with speeding, limited resources prevent officers from covering all of the
problem locations at all times. In response to this concern, Valencia County
has developed this policy which addresses engineering efforts, specifically the
use of speed humps, as a "traffic calming" technique for retrofit use in
existing neighborhoods. Many drivers ignore statutory and posted speed limits
and, if the design of the road will allow them to do so, will drive at speeds
exceeding those which suit the conditions prevailing in residential areas.
Various physical devices have been developed to discourage this behavior; one
of these devices is the speed hump.
(Ord. 2000-01, passed 5-1-2000)
§ 70.02 DEFINITION OF SPEED HUMPS.
   (A)   SPEED HUMPS are generally 3-inch high, flat topped or cylindrical
raised sections of pavement, typically 12 to 22 feet in length in the direction
of travel. The ends of a speed hump are tapered to be flush with the street at
the curb and gutter to allow water to drain. Speed humps are spaced roughly 250
to 750 feet apart, and have been proven to work by creating a vertical
displacement of the vehicles traversing them. It should be noted that speed
humps are not the typical speed "bump" frequently seen in parking lots.
   (B)   Installation of speed humps must strictly adhere to approved designs.
A typical flat-top profile speed hump design is shown in Figure 1. Flat-top
speed humps have been used successfully to diminish speeds on roads with high
volumes. A typical cylindrical or Watt's Profile speed hump design is shown in
Figure 2. Watt's Profile speed humps are generally limited for use on roadways
with volumes no greater than 3,000 vehicles per day (vpd). In addition, advance
warning signs must always be used in conjunction with speed humps; appropriate
signing for flat-top speed humps is shown in Figure 1, while the typical
signing for the Watt's Profile humps is shown Figure 2.

§ 70.03 ENGINEERING CRITERIA.
   (A)   Alternative traffic management strategies should always be pursued
before the decision is made to install speed humps.
   (B)   These strategies include:
      (1)   Reviewing, establishing, and/or revising and enforcing general laws
and ordinances pertaining to speed limits and other traffic control management
items;
      (2)   Educating residents and neighborhood groups so they can better
understand causes of traffic problems, potential solutions to these problems,
and the advantages and disadvantages of implementing different solutions; and
      (3)   Installing specific regulatory, warning, and guide message signs or
other traffic control devices.
   (C)   Speed humps are an effective and appropriate device for safely
reducing vehicle speeds on certain types of streets when all of these other
speed control alternatives have been investigated and determined to be
ineffective. In order for speed hump installations to be effective, they should
be located selectively in accordance with defined transportation engineering
criteria. Proper installation will also minimize driver frustration and
encourage safe driving practices.
   (D)   If a location fails to meet any of the criteria in §§
70.04 through
70.06, the placement of speed humps should not be recommended.
(Ord. 2000-01, passed 5-1-2000)
§ 70.04 OPERATIONAL CRITERIA.
   (A)   The functional classification of the roadway is a local or major local
street.
   (B)   Average weekly daily traffic (AWDT) volumes on the roadway segment are
less than 3,000 vpd.
   (C)   The posted speed limit of the roadway segment is 30 mph or less.
   (D)   The 85th percentile speed measured on the roadway segment exceeds the
posted speed limit by 10 mph or more. This criterion may be waived for dead-end
streets.
   (E)   The roadway segment is fronted by primarily (more than 50%)

§ 70.07 NEIGHBORHOOD SUPPORT.
   (A)   Property owners on the roadway segment must be in concurrence with the
placement of the speed hump(s) and will be allowed 1 vote of record.
Concurrence will be indicated by the signing of a petition to the Valencia
County designee. The formula for calculating the percentage required for
petition acceptance is: Percent of lot owners supporting the placement of speed
humps in the petition area = 75 — (.25(percent absentee lot owners in petition
area)). The petition will clearly state that those signing the petition would
accept all warning signs and restricted parking associated with the placement
of the speed hump(s).

§ 70.08 PRIORITIZATION AND IMPLEMENTATION.
   (A)   Valencia County will prioritize pending projects on a fiscal year
basis by assigning points to each project. Projects will be scheduled for
detailed design and implementation based on their point scores and the capital
improvement funds available for the fiscal year.
   (B)   Points will be assigned as follows:
      (1)   Speed. Two points will be assigned for every 1 mph that the 85th
percentile speed is above the speed limit for the roadway.
      (2)   Pedestrian activity and facilities. Ten points will be assigned if
the street has no sidewalks; 5 points will be assigned if the street has
sidewalks on only 1 side or has discontinuous sidewalks. In addition, 10 points
will be assigned for each pedestrian generator along the roadway section, for
instance, a school playground, or park, and 5 points will be assigned if the
street is designated as an on-road bike route.
      (3)   Street width. Five points will be assigned if the combination of
street width and parking characteristic results in areas of single lane,
alternating flow.
   (C)   The street yielding the highest numerical point score will be
considered to have the highest priority. The street with the earliest
application date will have the highest priority among streets with the same
point score.
   (D)   When a budgeted amount for speed humps has been approved, the county
will, starting at the top of the ranking list and proceeding in descending
order, determine which installations will be funded from the budgeted amount.
Representatives of the applicants for all approved speed hump installations
will be notified of which requests have been funded for the upcoming fiscal
year.
   (E)   As funding allows, preference shall be given to those roads qualifying
for speed humps for which other improvements are already planned to be
constructed.
(Ord. 2000-01, passed 5-1-2000)
§ 70.09 EXCEPTIONS.
   On roadways which are classified as collectors, an exception may be granted
to allow for speed humps if the traffic volume on the roadway is less than
3,000 vpd. The procedure for installation shall remain the same as outlined in
this policy. Each case will be reviewed individually and a determination will
be made based on consideration of adjacent land uses, function in the
transportation system and safety. In all cases, should speed humps be
installed, the speed humps will be removed when the roadway volume exceeds
3,000 vpd.
(Ord. 2000-01, passed 5-1-2000)
§ 70.10 INSTALLATION PROCEDURE.
   (A)   The initial request for the installation of speed humps must originate
from an owner of property on the candidate street. A request in writing from
the owner or his or her representative must be forwarded to Valencia County.
   (B)   A preliminary determination of eligibility based on available traffic
data will be made in a timely manner. Eligibility will be determined using the
preliminary evaluation form shown as Exhibit 1.
      (1)   If the roadway segment is determined not be eligible, the applicant
(s) will be notified in writing, with the reason(s) for rejection being given.
      (2)   If the street is determined to be eligible for consideration, a
meeting will be arranged between the applicant(s) and Valencia County staff to
define the petition area and the approximate speed hump location range. The
applicant(s) will then be instructed to submit a petition indicating that a
minimum percentage of the property owners in the petition area (per formula in
§
70.07) support the installation of speed humps as provided in the speed hump
policy. Only petition forms supplied by Valencia County or exact duplicates may
be used for this purpose.
   (C)   After verification of the petitions, the county will conduct the
necessary transportation engineering studies and solicit comments and
recommendations from other agencies. A determination of the street's
eligibility for speed hump installation will then be made in a timely manner,
based on all of the criteria of the speed hump policy as shown in the detailed
engineering evaluation form.
      (1)   If the roadway segment is determined not to be eligible, the
applicant(s) will be notified in writing with the reason(s) for rejection being
given.
      (2)   If the roadway segment is determined to be eligible, the segment
will be placed on a list of streets eligible for speed hump installation.
   (D)   (1)   Valencia County will annually prioritize pending projects on a
fiscal year basis by assigning points to each project. Projects will be
scheduled for detailed design and implementation based on their point scores
and the capital improvements funds available for the fiscal year.
      (2)   The street yielding the highest numerical point score will be
considered to have the highest priority. The street with the earliest
application date will have the highest priority among streets with the same
point score.
      (3)   When a budgeted amount for speed humps has been approved, the
county will, starting at the top of the ranking list and proceeding in
descending order, determine which installations will be funded from the
budgeted amount. Representatives of the applicants for all approved speed hump
installations will be notified of which requests have been funded for the
upcoming fiscal year.
   (E)   The process for speed hump removal or alteration by residents is the
same as the process for installation.
   (F)   Valencia County reserves the right to install, remove, or alter any
speed hump for the health, welfare, and safety of the public.
   (G)   Speed humps recommended as part of a system level analysis to address
traffic flow and control for a particular area of the county will not be
subject to the provisions of this policy.

this subchapter is noise resulting from the use of a retarder in a bona fide
emergency situation. Prior to the Board of County Commissioners designating, by
resolution, a certain road to be subject to the requirements of this
subchapter, it shall hold a public hearing on the question. The public hearing
shall be held upon the petition of at least 4 homeowners adjacent to the
particular roadway, or may be held upon the majority vote of the Board of

the provisions of this subchapter, the Board shall consider the impact upon
public safety in prohibiting the use of engine retarders, and shall consider
the nuisance impact of the use of engine retarders, in the particular area of
the roadway under consideration.

   (B)   The absence of a sign or signs, however, shall not be a defense to a
charge of violation of this subchapter.
   (C)   If, at any time, this subchapter conflicts with published State
Department of Transportation regulations or policy, the latter shall apply to
the extent it applies on state roads or highways.
(Ord. 2005-03, passed 6-17-2005)
§ 70.29 SEVERABILITY.

§ 94.011 PURPOSE; GOVERNING REGULATIONS.
   (A)   The purpose of this subchapter is to establish criteria for use in the
design of paved and unpaved road and street systems and related features to
promote consistently sound design of roads or streets having acceptable
performance characteristics.
   (B)   The following are some of the most important county regulatory
documents pertaining to road and street design. The list is not intended to be
exhaustive, and the user is cautioned that these regulations are subject to
change at any time.

(Ord. 2006-02, passed 3-17-2006)
§ 94.012 GENERAL PLANNING.
   (A)   Road and street location and arrangement; paved roads.
      (1)   Paved roads or streets are required for all properties that are
zoned Suburban Residential, on properties that are zoned Planned Development
and that do not have a duly approved PD District Master Plan with site specific
design criteria, on existed platted lot areas with lots sizes of less than 0.75
acres and on existing platted lot areas with lot widths of less than 140 feet.
      (2)   Roads or streets must conform in character, location, and
arrangement to adopted plans. Governing plans include, but are not limited to,
an approved area plan, county master plans, duly approved PD District Master
Plans with site specific design criteria, or adopted future road or street
line. The county shall be consulted for information regarding applicable plans
for areas under design consideration.
      (3)   Proposed road and street arrangements must provide for the
continuation of existing principal roads or streets or appropriate projections
thereof if not otherwise governed by an adopted plan.
      (4)   Alleys are not to be provided where other provisions can be made

§ 94.013 ENGINEERING DESIGN CRITERIA.
   The criteria presented herein are major controlling factors in the design of
roads or streets. It is expected that the designers will exercise careful
attention to detail in the application of these criteria todesign
circumstances. Suitable transitional elements must be provided between changes
in geometric configuration, pavement and curb character, and drainage carrying
aspects of the ultimate street design.
   (A)   General design criteria. Table 2 summarizes criteria considered
minimum in the county for various classifications of roads or street. Design
speeds given are intended to establish levels to which facilities are to be
designed; posted legal speeds are established only after appropriate
examination of the completed road or street by the county.
   (B)   Geometric criteria. In general, criteria for the horizontal and
geometric of road or street design given in Table 2 will be the minimum
acceptable values. Other factors must also be considered in a balanced design.
      (1)   Vertical alignment. Long, flat gradients are undesirable because of
poor drainage characteristics. The minimum desirable gradient consistent with
acceptable drainage is 0.5% with curbs and gutter and 0.25% with no curbs and
gutters and, as such, should be observed as a general design principle. Grades
in valley areas and other special circumstances may be flatter than 0.5% if
approved by the Public Works Director. Long, step gradients are also
undesirable since such are difficult for heavier vehicles to negotiate at
desirable traffic speeds. Vertical curve criteria stated in Table 2 are
intended to provide adequate safety consistent with applicable design speeds.
In the application of these criteria, the designer will be expected to apply
good judgment in combining vertical geometry with horizontal geometry.
      (2)   Extreme vertical undulation is not acceptable. Vertical changes in
grade occurring simultaneously with horizontal alignment changes must be
carefully considered to preserve the acceptable sight distance consistent with
the designspeed of the street. Engineering determination of safestopping sight
distance should be demonstrated in these cases. Adequate intersection sight
distances must be maintained in all designs.
      (3)   Balance design. Abrupt, inconsistent changes in either horizontal
or vertical alignment arenot acceptable. Minor roads or streets shall be
designed, however, in order to discourage excessive speeds of traffic. Major
roads or streets shall be designed to permit larger flows of traffic at design
speeds.
   (C)   Intersection design.
      (1)   Angle of intersection. Roads and streets must be designed to
intersect at right angles as nearly as practical consistent with topography and
sound design. The acute angles at intersection for all roads or streets shall
be 80 degrees minimum. Intersection designs must provide for adequate clear
sight distances.
      (2)   Spacing of intersections. Intersections of roads or streets along
arterial roads or streets are to be minimized. Following are limiting values to
be observed:
         (a)   Roads or streets intersecting arterials must generally be spaced
no closer than one-sixth mile on center.
         (b)   Intersection of roads or streets shall be continuous in
alignment if feasible. Offset alignment of intersecting roads or streets is
highly discouraged. Note: Driveways should be at most distance from
intersection.
         (c)   Intersections of roads or streets which are not on continuous
alignment through the road or street intersected are to be spaced as follows:
            1.   Intersections of non-continuous roads or streets must be
spaced at least 150 feet between centerlines of roads or streets on local roads
or streets.
            2.   At least 300 feet on collector roads or streets.
            3.   At least 400 feet on all arterial roads or streets.
         (d)   Variances from these criteria will require written approval of
the Public Works Director.
      (3)   Curb return radii. Minimum acceptable return radius for residential
is 25 feet. All radii are measured to the back of the curb section.
      (4)   Intersection grading. Street crown may be reduced through
intersections of major roads or streets of approximately equal classification
if desirable to promote comfort. Crown reduction should not generally exceed
one-half of standard crown unless special circumstances govern and the joint
concurrence of the County is obtained. Concrete valley gutters and fillets are
necessary to provide rapid drainage and eliminate pavement rutting (see
Standard Details — see Appendix A to Ord. No. 2006-02).
      (5)   Intersection sight distance. Intersection of local roads or streets
with major roads or streets classified as collector or above shall not be
located at or near horizontal curves without special evaluation of intersection
sight distance. The location of an intersection on the “inside” of a horizontal
curve is a situation that will typically result intersection visibility
problems. The location of any property lines, fences or other obstructions will
need to be evaluated to insure that the minimum sight distance is maintained.
      (6)   ADA compliant. Submittals shall be subject to regulations and
requirements of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act or the State as it
relates to providing for design and construction to provide for accessibility
of the handicapped.
   (D)   Curb and gutter and drainage criteria.
      (1)   Standard 6-inch high barrier-type curb and gutter with 1-inch
gutter depth as shown in Standard Details must be used as the exterior curb
section for all classes of roads or streets required to have curb and gutter.
Deviation from these standards will require written approval and concurrence by
the Public Works Director.
      (2)   If both traffic requirements and drainage requirements can be met
to satisfaction of thePublic Works Director, mountable curb types as shown in
Standard Details maybe used on local roads or streets.
      (3)   Concrete curbs and gutter shall be constructed of Class “A” 4,000-
psi Portland cement concrete. Expansion joints are to be installed every 24
feet and joint and construction joints installed every 8 feet at a minimum.
      (4)   For roads without curbs and gutter, all driveways shall be provided
with a 12-inch diameter culvert or larger if required by drainage flow
calculations for a 10-year, 24-hour event, at all driveways accessing a public
or county road. The culvert shall be placed to have positive downhill drainage
and shall be placed in the location graded to carry drainage, commonly known as
the swale.
   (E)   Pavement design criteria.
      (1)   Design of pavement structures of arterial roads or streets must be
based on acceptable design procedures. Current acceptable design procedures
include latest edition of AASHTO Interim Guide for Design of Pavement
Structures, NMSHD Bulletin 102 (See Standard Details), as amended.
      (2)   Design of pavement structures for collector, industrial, and
commercial area roads or streets and residential (local) roads or streets will
conform to Standard Details. Subgrade soils: Designing geotechnical engineer
shall submit report to county stating existing subgrade bearing values and
proposed structural pavement design.
      (3)   Structural design of private roads or streets shall conform to
division (E)(2) above.
   (F)   Drivepad design standards.
      (1)   Construction of drivepads must conform to the current Standard
Details.
      (2)   Drivepads shall cross the sidewalk on the sidewalk grade line
without depression of the sidewalks. However, if a drivepad gradient in excess
of 10% would be required to avoid depression of the sidewalk, the sidewalk
shall be transitioned to match the drivepad within 6 feet of edge of drivepad
and the drivepad gradient shall be maintained equal to or less than 10%.
      (3)   ADA compliant. Submittals shall be subject to regulations and
requirements of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act or the State as it
relates to providing for design and construction to provide for accessibility
of the handicapped.

§ 94.014 CONSTRUCTION CRITERIA.
   (A)   General. Any permits or easements required for the construction of the
required roads or streets, sidewalks, or appurtenances for the proposed
development shall be obtained by the developer.
   (B)   Materials.
      (1)   All construction shall conform to this subchapter and Standard
Details unless otherwise approved by the Public Works Director.
      (2)   All construction shall conform to the New Mexico Standard
Specifications for Public Works Construction (NMSSPWC) as amended and as
modified herein unless otherwise approved by the Public Works Director.
      (3)   In the case of conflict or discrepancy between these regulations,
Standard Details and NMSSPWC, these documents will govern in the following
order of priority:
         (a)   Subdivision Regulations;
         (b)   Standard Details;
         (c)   NMSSPWC.

§ 94.015 SIDEWALK DESIGN.
   (A)   Sidewalks. (See Standard Details -- See Appendix A to Ord. No. 2006-
02). Sidewalks must be provided for all subdivided properties resulting in over
25 lots within the county. The fundamental requirements governing sidewalk
design are established by these design standards. Sidewalk designs must provide
for the mobility, safety, and comfort of the pedestrian and provide for
adequate pedestrian access to abutting property. Pertinent sidewalk design
criteria are collected herein for the convenience of the designer.
      (1)   Sidewalk width shall be 4-feet 0-inch minimum. For roads or streets
in commercial or industrial zones, the county may require wider sidewalks based
on expected pedestrian traffic.
      (2)   Sidewalk location- horizontal.
         (a)   Along collector and local roads or streets, sidewalks must be
located within the right-of-way with the property side edge of the walk at the
property line.
         (b)   Variances from sidewalk standards will require the approval of
the county.
      (3)   Traverse slope. Sidewalks must be provided with a transverse slope
of 1/4 to 1/2 inch per foot, sloping toward the road or street.
      (4)   Sidewalk location – vertical. The sidewalk must be located
vertically such that the top surface of the sidewalk will be at or above the
top of curb at the lowest point on the sidewalk, and must be appropriate to the
overall street section design within the right-of-way.
      (5)   Sidewalk materials. Sidewalks are to be of Portland cement, Class
“A”, 4,000 psi, of minimum 4 inches thickness. Portland cement concrete
reinforcing, curing compound shall be as specified in the New Mexico Standard
Specifications for Public Works Construction. The county must approve designs
incorporating alternate materials. Expansion joints shall be a minimum of every
12 feet and construction joints every 4 feet. Sidewalk and curb and gutter
joints shall match each other.

ROAD CUT AND INFRASTRUCTURE
PLACEMENT
§ 94.025 SHORT TITLE.
   This subchapter may be referred to as the “Road Cut and Infrastructure
Placement Subchapter of the Road Ordinance.”
(Ord. 2006-02, passed 3-17-2006)
§ 94.026 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to establish and define responsibilities
and standards for the use of public property and rights of way, especially
regarding road use, excavations and restorations thereof.
(Ord. 2006-02, passed 3-17-2006)
§ 94.027 PERMIT.
   (A)   Permit application.
      (1)   Every person desiring to make a road cut, bore or utilize public
right of way is required to obtain a permit. In addition, a National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit may be required. The applicant must
be licensed and bonded, or the applicant must be a utility company or an agent
for the utility company. In extenuating circumstances where the applicant is a
private party or not licensed, bonded or a utility company the applicant shall
be required to comply with guidelines established by the Department. The person
shall make written application on forms provided and approved by the Public
Works Director prior to the performance of any road cut work or activity on
public property. County staff has 5 days to review and process submitted
applications, unless the applicant is notified that a longer time period will
be required.
      (2)   No person shall make any road cut on public property or utilize
public rights-of-way until the person or designated agent obtains an
appropriate permit from the county, except in an emergency. In the event of an
emergency, the person may proceed with such activity immediately but notify the
county by phone that such an emergency is being repaired and thereafter file an
application within 2 business days. The application must state the description
of the emergency and a summary of the repairs. The applicant must comply with
any reasonable repair directions set forth by the county.
      (3)   The applicant shall agree to the following;
         (a)   Complete all work required by this chapter, covered by the
permit;
         (b)   Complete any specific item required by the county in conjunction
with the permit within 5 days after written notice is given by the county to do
so. The Department is authorized to grant an extension if necessary. Evidence
shall be presented that insurance requirements have been met in accordance with
§
94.030, except for governmental agencies. Evidence shall be presented that any
“tie in” or “extension of utilities,” is authorized by the applicable utility
company, utility association or provider of services.
   (B)   Faxing permit applications; billing. 
      (1)   A utility company may file application for a road cut, right-of-way
use permit and all supporting information through use of the facsimile
transmission (fax) machine located in the Public Works Department, in
accordance with procedures established by the Public Works Director. An
approved permit maybe sent to the applicant in accordance with similar
procedures.
      (2)   The Public Works Director, in his or her discretion, may allow a
person to be billed for fees due and payable under the terms of this chapter on
a monthly basis, provided the person is not more than 60 days delinquent in
payments due under this chapter. No further permits will be issued if payments
are more than 60 days delinquent.
   (C)   Permit fees. The permit fees are set forth in §
94.033.
   (D)   Length of road cuts; use of right-of-way. By issuance of a road cut
permit, the county authorizes the cutting or excavation of a road or right-of-
way by approved methods as listed in the New Mexico Standard Specifications for
Public Works Construction (NMSSPWC) and only for the single road cut specified
on the permit. When the project involves the excavation of the road or right-
of-way in a manner that runs roughly parallel to the roadway, the permit shall
authorize up to 600 lineal feet of excavation. No open trenches will be allowed
when the job site is left unattended.
(Ord. 2006-02, passed 3-17-2006) Penalty, see §
94.999
§ 94.028 EXCAVATIONS; ROAD CUTS; BORING.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the primary purpose of this subchapter to achieve
maximum public use of public rights-of-way, consistent with the laws of New
Mexico and county policy or law to insure that utility relocations on or in
county rights-of-way are accomplished in accordance with New Mexico statutes,
state and local regulations and federal codes and regulations while providing
for maximum public safety, maintenance of the roadways, and minimizing future
conflicts between the county roadways, highway systems of the state and
utilities serving the general public in the county.
   (B)   Preferred means. In all circumstances, best efforts shall be made to
install utility facilities using existing overhead facilities or bore under the
roadway instead of excavating in an attempt to limit patches on the road
surface. Road cuts shall be the least desirable means of utility facility
installation.
   (C)   Clearance of vital structures. Work under these provisions must be
performed and conducted so as not to interfere with access to fire hydrants,
fire stations, fire escapes, bridges, traffic control devices, and all other
vital permanent structures or equipment.
   (D)   General utility design requirements. Except when a higher degree of
protection is required by industry or governmental codes, laws, or orders of
the public authority having jurisdiction over the utility, all utility facility
installations on, over, along or under the surface of the rights-of-way of
county roadways, including attachments to highway structures shall, as a
minimum, meet the following utility industry and governmental requirements:
      (1)   Electric power and communication facilities installations shall
conform to the current applicable National Electric Safety Code.
      (2)   Water, sewage and other effluent lines shall conform to the
requirements of the Public Works Association, the American Water Works
Association and county standards.
      (3)   Pressure pipelines shall conform to the current applicable sections
of the standard code of pressure piping of the National Standards Institute, 49
CFR sections 192, 193 and 195, and /or applicable industry codes.
      (4)   Liquid petroleum pipelines shall conform to the applicable
recommended practice of the American Petroleum Institute for pipeline crossings
under railroads and highways.
      (5)   Any pipeline carrying hazardous commodities shall conform to the
rules and regulations of the U.S. Department of Transportation governing the
transmission of such materials. Pipelines located in casings, galleries,
utility tunnels or highway structures shall be designed to withstand expected
internal pressures as well. Joints in carries pipelines operating under
pressure shall be of a mechanical or welded leak-proof construction. Ground
mounted utility facilities shall be of a design that minimizes, to the extent
practicable, the impact on the scenic quality of the specific highway segment
being traversed and/ or of a design approved by the Public Works Director. All
utility installations on, over, along or under roadway rights-of-way, and
attachments to roadway structures, shall be of durable materials, designed for
a relocation of existing facilities. Provisions shall be made for expansion of
the facilities, particularly those underground or attached to highway
structures. These provisions shall be planned so as to avoid interference with
highway traffic additional facilities that are installed in the future.
      (6)   The facility owner shall be responsible for compliance with
industry codes, the conditions and/or special provisions specified in the
permit, applicable statues and regulations of the state, and the U.S.
Department of Transportation Code of Federal Regulations.
      (7)   The utility company shall be responsible for the design,
construction, and maintenance of all facilities to be installed within the
county or public right-of-way. All elements of these facilities are subject to
review and approval by the Department, particularly the materials, location,
and method of installation. The utility is responsible for, and will provide
all measures as required to preserve the safe and free flow of traffic and the
structural integrity of the roadway, roadway structures, ease of roadway
maintenance and appearance of the roadway resulting from their installation.
Prior to any utility work within the county or public right-of-way, the
Department shall approve all submitted traffic control plans.
      (8)   All underground utilities shall be placed at a minimum of 32 inches
below adjacent grade surface.
   (E)   Maintenance of traffic and pedestrian flow. The permittee shall
maintain safe and adequate passage of vehicle and pedestrian traffic on all its
property on which the permittee is conducting its activities under its permit.
When a public facility has been closed or detoured because of the permittee’s
work, the Department shall be notified by the permittee prior to removal of
existing barricades and other traffic control devices.
   (F)   Permittee’s obligation to protect property. It is the permittee’s
responsibility to verify no known cultural properties exist in the permit area.
Should known cultural properties occur in a permit area, a permit shall not be
issued until the applicant submits notification from the state Historic
Preservation Division certifying that the properties have received sufficient
consideration. Should unknown cultural properties be encountered during work
conducted under a permit, work in the immediate vicinity of the cultural
property shall cease and the county shall be notified.
   (G)   Restoration and repair.
      (1)   The permittee shall take whatever measures necessary to protect the
road surface from damage by equipment used in the excavation process. Any
damage to the road surface such as tearing or scaring of the pavement caused by
the permittee’s equipment shall be repaired to county requirements by the
permittee. Traffic markings removed, as a part of the road cut shall be
replaced by the permittee with materials similar to those originally displaced,
in a place and in a manner satisfactory to the county.
      (2)   The permittee shall, at his or her own expense, support and protect
all utilities which may be in any way affected by the road cut or other
permitted work and will do everything necessary to support, sustain and protect
them under, over, along or across that work. Before commencing a road cut, the
permittee shall ascertain the location of all utilities by notifying the New
Mexico “One Call System” in or near the area of the proposed cut. The
confirmation number from the One Call System shall be listed on the permit
prior to issuance of the permit. In the event said utilities are damaged,
including damage to pipe coating or other encasement devices, the permittee
shall immediately notify the facility owner of the damage. The permittee shall
be liable for all costs associated with the damage and repair if the permittee
was negligent and the facilities were properly marked and located. The
permittee shall protect the road cut from surface water flows by appropriate
diversions or ponding devices. The permittee shall repair asphalt or other road
surfaces and other public facilities and public property to reasonable
construction and engineering standards in order to approximate the condition
that existed before the work.
   (H)   Protection of adjoining property. The permittee shall at all times and
at his or her own expense preserve and protect from injury all private property
adjoining the public property on which the road cut work is being performed by
taking suitable measures for that purpose. Where in the protection of such
property, it is necessary to enter upon private property for the purposes of
taking appropriate protection measures, the permittee, shall unless otherwise
provided by law, obtain appropriate permission from the owner of such private
property to enter thereupon. The permittee must at his or her own expense shore
up and protect all structures, facilities, walls, fences or other property that
may be affected or damaged during the progress of the road cut work and be
responsible for all damages on other property resulting from his or her failure
to properly protect and carry out such work.
   (I)   Care of excavated material. All materials excavated and piled adjacent
to the road cut or in any public place by the permittee must be piled and
maintained so as to not endanger the public and those working in the
excavation, and so as to cause as little inconvenience as possible to those
persons using the public property and adjoining property. All material
excavated must be laid completely along side of the cut and kept trimmed so as
to cause little inconvenience as is reasonably possible to vehicle and
pedestrian traffic. In order to expedite flow of traffic and to keep dirt and
dust from spreading or flying, the permittee shall use guards or other methods
and/or shall water the excavated material.
   (J)   Cleanup. Each permittee shall thoroughly clean up from the public
place of rubbish, excess earth, rock, asphalt, concrete, tree branches or limbs
and other debris resulting from road cut work. All cleanup operations at the
location of such road cuts are to be accomplished at the expense of the
permittee. During the progress of work or immediately after completion of such
work, the permittee shall clean up and remove all refuse, dirt and unused
materials of any kind resulting from the work. Upon failure to do so, the
county may cause to have such work done, and the permittee shall pay for such
reasonable cost.
   (K)   Protection of water course. The permittee shall maintain all gutters,
easement crossings and related drainage structures free-flowing and
unobstructed for the full depth and width of the water course, or provide
adequate substitutes for any such water course that are blocked by the road
cut. Required federal or state permits shall be acquired by the permittee.
(Ord. 2006-02, passed 3-17-2006) Penalty, see §
94.999
§ 94.029 RESTORATION OF ROAD CUTS.
   (A)   Compaction. Any person holding a road cut permit shall undertake to
restore each road cut, in accordance with the reasonable compaction and
restoration standards required by the county. This shall include both the
backfilling of the road cut and the restoration of the surface. All backfill
must be compacted to 95% density under the road surface, and 90% density
outside the road surface. Certified nuclear density test results must be
submitted to the Department within 5 working days of completion of the work.
Flow capacity and/or existing flow capacity shall be altered without the
written approval of the Public Works Director. For any person who does not
submit compaction test results to the county in a form and with results
acceptable to the county, such person shall not be issued any future permits
under this chapter until he or she complies with this chapter, and the county
may take such other actions as it deems necessary to assure compliance with
this section. The Public Works Director may waive the compaction tests for plow
trenching only, provided the utility company demonstrates a method and
operation of compaction acceptable to the Department.
   (B)   Resurfacing. In those instances when a permittee cannot resurface a
public place with concrete or asphalt because the air temperature or moisture
content is below the minimum standards contained in the compaction and
restoration standards or the weather conditions are such that the permittee is
unable to resurface the public place within a reasonable time after the
county’s acceptance of any density tests, the permittee shall immediately check
with the Department concerning how and when the public facility shall be
resurfaced. The county can require that the permittee cold patch the road cut
on a temporary basis. The permittee shall restore the surface of the cut in
accordance with reasonable compaction and restoration standards.
   (C)   Cost. The cost for restoration of the road surface shall be borne by
the permittee.
   (D)   County performance. If a permittee makes a road cut that is not
resurfaced by the permittee within a reasonable time, and the county has not
granted an extension of time, the county may, upon giving notice to the
permittee, resurface the road cut and bill the permittee for the reasonable
cost.
   (E)   Safety. It shall be the responsibility of the permittee restoring the
public property to keep the road cut or surface opening safe for pedestrians,
workers and vehicular traffic until the pavement surface or opening has been
restored.
   (F)   Extension of time. Any time periods may be extended by the county due
to weather conditions or other circumstances beyond the control of the
permittee, with written or oral permission of the Public Works Director or his
or her designee.
   (G)   State standards. The permittee shall comply at all times with the
appropriate construction standards set forth in state statutes or regulation or
by local law or regulation.
   (H)   Restoration. The permittee shall restore as practicably as possible,
the affected property to the condition it was immediately prior to excavation
or development. This includes but is not limited to depth of base course or
other materials used on road surfaces. All materials shall be inspected and
approved by the Department prior to use of any such materials. In the case of
trenching in the right- of-way that exceeds 600 lineal feet the county
recommends the responsible party document the condition of the surface by means
of videotaping the proposed work area. The Department can require the seeding
of disturbed areas to offset possible erosion that may result from the area
being disturbed during excavation.

94.999
§ 94.030 LIABILITY INSURANCE; SELF- INSURANCE; BONDING.
   (A)   Certificate of insurance. No person other than a utility company shall
make a road cut, enter a substructure opening, perform road cut work or utilize
county rights-of-way until filing with the county a certificate of insurance
establishing that such person is adequately insured according to New Mexico
Tort Claims Act, NMSA § 41-4-19, as amended against bodily injury or personal
injury to any person, and against liability for damages, other than the work
itself; because of injury to or destruction of tangible property, including
loss of use resulting there from. Each insurance certificate shall provide that
the county be given at least 30 calendar days’ notice of cancellation in
writing by the insurance company.
   (B)   Form and type. A utility company shall at all times maintain insurance
or may self insure against all risks and perils set forth above for the
reasonable limits of liability set by the NMSA § 41-4-19 as amended and the
county, in a form and type acceptable to the county which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld.
   (C)   Performance bonding. A performance bond in the amount of $15,000 shall
be kept on file at the Department along with the contractor’s license and
insurance documents.

   The County expressly reserves the right to change the grade, install,
relocate, or widen the public rights-of-way within the county and subject to
all regulatory approvals, the facility owner shall relocate, at its own
expense, its facilities and appurtenances in order to accommodate the paving,
installation, relocation, widening, or changing of the grade or location of any
such public right-of-way, including if necessary, relocating facilities to a
sufficient distance within the rights-of-way and to permit a reasonable work
area for machinery and individuals engaged in such work, or to protect the
health, safety, or welfare of the public.

cut shall be required to correct defective materials and workmanship performed
under each road cut permit for a period of 3 years from the date the work
performed under such permit is completed.
   (B)   No permit granted pursuant to this section shall in any way convey any
property interest to the permittee, beyond simple permission to use the
county’s rights-of-way in the manner specified in this chapter. The permit
shall not provide any guarantee or otherwise warrant the condition of the
county’s title to any particular easement or right-of-way, and shall not
obligate the county in any way with respect to preserving the permittee’s use
of public prescriptive easements over private land.

   (A)   When road cut work or use of the right-of- way is being performed, the
person making the road cut or using the right-of-way shall take appropriate
measures to maintain traffic conditions as near normal as practicable at all
times so as to cause little inconvenience as possible to the occupants of the
abutting properties and to the public. All applicants shall submit with the
permit application a TCP or traffic control plan for approval by the Public
Works Director or his or her designee along with the permit application. No
permits shall be issued without the submission of a traffic control plan unless
waived by the county. State DOT regulations shall be used as the applicable
regulations to follow.
   (B)   The county may require the permittee to notify various public
agencies, emergency services and the public of proposed work prior to issuance
of a permit or prior to commencement of the proposed work if the Department
decides it is necessary for public safety.
   (C)   Warning signs shall be placed by the permittee near each road cut or
substructure opening being entered so as to give adequate warning to vehicular
and pedestrian traffic both night and day, and cones or other approved devices
shall be placed to channel traffic. The traffic controls, including but not
limited to the number, type, size and location of the signs shall be done in
accordance with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) Part VI
and reasonable traffic standards as directed by the Public Works Director or
his or her designee.
   (D)   The county may require the permittee to place a visible sign at each
end of the construction area which is visible from a distance and sets forth
the name of the person making the road cut, or in the case of a utility company
the name of the company together with a business telephone number to handle

§ 94.050 GENERAL.
   The county is generally prohibited by the State Constitution under Article
IX, Section 14 in directly or indirectly lending or pledging its credit or
making any donation to or in aid of any person, association or public or
private corporation, commonly known as the “Anti-Donation Clause.”
(Ord. 2006-02, passed 3-17-2006)
§ 94.051 CRITERIA.
   Courtesy maintenance grading of private or non-county public roads, that is,
a road not accepted by the county for maintenance, may be allowed only under
the following guidelines:
   (A)   School bus routes. The county will, upon request, approval and
scheduling for school bus routes will assist the school districts in providing
a travelable road surface as state funds are received to assist in such work.
   (B)   Mail routes. The county will, upon request, approval and scheduling
for mail routes will assist the U.S. Postal Service in providing a travelable
road surface.
   (C)   Sick and indigent person’s road. In certain circumstances, depending
on the severity of a sick or indigent person and only upon request, may approve
and schedule a private or non-county public road for a courtesy grading, but
will not be required to provide material for road build-up.
   (D)   Notwithstanding the requirements in this section, the decision as to
whether or not a road receives a courtesy grading is solely at the discretion
of the county.
(Ord. 2006-02, passed 3-17-2006)
ACCEPTANCE FOR COUNTY
ROAD MAINTENANCE
§ 94.065 GENERAL.
   No road will be considered for county maintenance unless the right-of-way is
dedicated to the county. If maintenance is being requested on a road, which is
not dedicated, the initial step in acquiring periodic maintenance shall be the
dedication of the right-of-way to the county. The point of contact to
coordinate the dedication maintenance request is the Public Works Department,
P.O. 1119, 1209 Highway 314, Los Lunas, New Mexico 87031, phone 505.866.2475.
Information will be provided on procedures and requirements that must be
followed in the dedication process.
(Ord. 2006-02, passed 3-17-2006)
§ 94.066 PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Upon the receipt of an approved petition from all the resident(s) and
owner(s) of an existing private road for acceptance by the county, the Public
Works Director shall determine if the road meets the minimum standards for
county roads together with the needs, if applicable, of necessary construction
to bring the road up to standards with particular attention to the soil
content. The Public Works Director shall provide a cost estimate to bring the
road up to county specifications.
   (B)   Roads that are not within the boundaries of an approved subdivision
must have right-of-way transferred to the county through a warranty deed, or
other type of document acceptable to the County Attorney. In addition the
county will require proof of clear title, and may require title insurance to be
provided and paid for at the expense of the person(s) dedicating the right-of-
way or road to the county. Person(s) dedicating right-of-way must pay for and
furnish a legal survey and plat of proposed dedication prepared by a registered
land surveyor, meeting minimum standards for land surveying in New Mexico.
   (C)   The Director and the Code Enforcement Department together with the
Rural Addresser shall review the proposed road and provide a written analysis
of the impact of the road on adjoining county roads together with related
concerns of the departments. Such report shall reflect approval of affected
utility easement holders. The Fire Chief shall review the proposed road for
safety concerns involving ingress and egress and other related concerns in a
written analysis. The Director shall not submit the petition for dedication
until all county departments have submitted reports, including the Director’s
report, with all agency comment. The Director shall provide to the owner(s) of
the road the responses by the county departments to bring the road in
compliance with county regulations. Upon substantial completion by the owner(s)
of the conditions addressed by the various county departments or if the road
meets the specified health, safety and welfare requirements set forth in this
section, the Director shall submit the petition and agency comments to the
County Manager for presentation to the Board of County Commissioners (Board).
(Road and street design standards – see §§
94.010 through
94.015)
   (D)   The Board may, in its discretion in extraordinary circumstances, grant
a full or partial waiver in order to accept roads for maintenance that do not
otherwise meet the above road standards if the acceptance of the road is
essential to the protection of the public health, safety and welfare, with the
understanding that county maintenance of accepted roads will be undertaken with
available funding and pursuant to priorities for road maintenance county-wide.
   (E)   (1)   Considerations to be used in determining whether a full or
partial waiver is granted are:
         (a)   Number of occupied dwellings on the road;
         (b)   Whether the road is a collector or local access road;
         (c)   Whether the road is an established school bus route;
         (d)   Whether mail deliveries are made on the road;
         (e)   Accessibility to dwellings of emergency service, medical and
fire protection due to inclement weather;
         (f)   The adequacy of driving space and water runoff.
      (2)   All roads and streets created after the effective date of Ord. No.
2006-02 are specifically excluded and subject to the requirements of §
94.011.
(Ord. 2006-02, passed 3-17-2006)
§ 94.067 MAINTENANCE ACCEPTANCE.

accept the dedication, to not accept the dedication, or to accept the
dedication contingent upon roads being constructed in conformance with county
standards and specifications and this chapter.
(Ord. 2006-02, passed 3-17-2006)
§ 94.068 ROAD EXCLUSIONS.
   Roads within subdivisions, which are not dedicated to public use by
disclosure on the plat, will not be accepted by the county for maintenance. The
responsibility for maintenance of private roads is with the developer, owner or
the purchasers. Temporary, courtesy or emergency maintenance by the county does
not constitute an implied acceptance of maintenance by the county.

SPEED HUMP REQUIREMENTS FOR
LOCAL AND MAJOR LOCAL STREETS
§ 94.120 PURPOSE.
   Reducing excessive speeds on residential streets is an important objective
in ensuring the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, animals, and vehicles in
neighborhoods, and in creating calmer and more livable environment. Methods for
discouraging speeding include enforcement, education, and engineering efforts.
While police enforcement remains the most effective means of dealing with
speeding, limited resources prevent officers from covering the entire problem
locations at all times. In response to this concern, the county has developed
this policy which addresses engineering efforts, specifically the use of speed
humps, as a “traffic calming” technique for retrofit use in existing
neighborhoods. Many drivers ignore statutory and posted speed limits and, if
the design of the road will allow them to do so, will drive at speeds exceeding
those which suit the conditions prevailing in residential areas. Various
physical devices have been developed to discourage this behavior; one of these
devices is the speed hump.
(Ord. 2006-02, passed 3-17-2006)
§ 94.121 DEFINITION.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definition shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   SPEED HUMPS.
      (1)   SPEED HUMPS are generally 3-inch high, flat topped or cylindrical
raised sections of pavement, typically 12 to 22 feet in length in the direction
of travel. The ends of a SPEED HUMP are tapered to be flush with the street at
the curb and gutter to allow water to drain. SPEED HUMPS are spaced roughly 250
to 750 feet apart, and have been proven to work by creating a vertical
displacement of the vehicles traversing them. It should be noted that SPEED
HUMPS are not the typical speed “bump” frequently seen in parking lots.
      (2)   Installation of SPEED HUMPS must strictly adhere to approved
designs. Typical flat-top profile SPEEDS HUMP design are shown in Figure 1
attached to Ord. No. 2006-02. FLAT-TOP SPEED HUMPS have been used successfully
to diminish speeds on roads with high volumes. A typical cylindrical or WATT’S
PROFILE SPEED HUMP design is shown in Figure 2 attached to Ord. No. 2006-02.
WATT’S PROFILE SPEED HUMPS are generally limited for use on roadways with
volumes no greater than 3,000 vehicles per day (vpd). In addition, advance
warning signs must always be used conjunction with SPEED HUMPS; appropriate
signing for FLAT-TOP SPEED HUMPS is shown in Figure 1 attached to Ord. No.
2006-02. The typical signing for the WATT’S PROFILE HUMPS is shown in Figure 2
attached to Ord. No. 2006-02.
(Ord. 2006-02, passed 3-17-2006)
§ 94.122 ENGINEERING CRITERIA.
   (A)   Alternative traffic management strategies should always be pursued
before the decision is made to install speed humps. These strategies include:
      (1)   Reviewing, establishing, and/or revising and enforcing general laws
and ordinances pertaining to speed limits and other traffic control management
items.
      (2)   Educating residents and neighborhood groups so they can better
understand causes of traffic problems, potential solutions to these problems,
and the advantages and disadvantages of implementing different solutions.
      (3)   Installing specific regulatory, warning, and guide message signs or
other traffic control devices.
   (B)   Speed humps are an effective and appropriate device for safely
reducing vehicle speeds on certain types of streets when all of these other
speed control alternatives have been investigated and determined to be
ineffective. In order for speed hump installations to be effective, they should
be located selectively in accordance with defined transportation engineering
criteria. Proper installation will also minimize driver frustrations and
encourage safe driving practices.
   (C)   If a location fails to meet any of the following criteria, the
placement of speed humps should not be recommended.
   (D)   Operation criteria.
      (1)   The functional classification of the roadway is a local or major
local street.
      (2)   Average weekly daily traffic (AWDT) volumes on the roadway segment
are less than 3,000 vpd.
      (3)   The posted speed limit of the roadway segment is 30 miles per hour
(m.p.h.) or less.
      (4)   The 85th percentile speed measured on the roadway segment exceeds
the posted speed limit by 10 m.p.h. or more. This criterion may be waived from
dead-end streets.
      (5)   The roadway segment is fronted by primarily (more than 50%)
residential land uses.
   (E)   Geometric Criteria.
      (1)   The roadway has a vertical grade of 8% or less.
      (2)   The roadway segment is paved.
      (3)   The roadway segment has only 1 moving lane of traffic in each
direction.
      (4)   The section length is greater than or equal to 2 blocks or 12,000
feet.
      (5)   The width of the street is greater than 18 feet.
   (F)   General conditions. The following general conditions should also be
considered when locating speed humps:
      (1)   Motorists should have adequate sight distance to react to speed
humps.
      (2)   Speed humps should not be placed over manholes, gate valves,
utility vault accesses or other similar features.
      (3)   If a drainage inlet is near where a speed hump would be placed
according to the general spacing criteria, an attempt should be made to locate
the hump just downstream of the inlet.
      (4)   Speed humps should be placed to take advantage of existing street
lighting.
      (5)   Speed humps should not be placed in front of driveways.
      (6)   Speed humps should be placed at property lines, if possible, rather
than directly in front of a residence.
      (7)   Speed humps are placed perpendicular to the direction of travel.
      (8)   Speed humps should not be placed within an intersection.
      (9)   Speed humps should not be placed within a horizontal curve.
      (10)   When curbs are not present, alternate means should be provided to
discourage motorists from driving around the speed hump (Figure 3 attached to
Ord. No. 2006-02).
      (11)   Speed humps should follow the corresponding roadway cross-slope.
   (G)   Neighborhood support.
      (1)   (a)   Property owners on the roadway segment must be in concurrence
with the placement of the speed hump(s) and will be allowed 1 vote of record.
Concurrence will be indicated by the signing of a petition to the county
designee. The formula for calculating the percentage required for petition
acceptance is:
Percent of Lot Owners Supporting the Placement of Speed Humps in the Petition
Area = 75 – (.25 (Percent Absentee Lot Owners in Petition Area)).
         (b)   The petition will clearly state that those signing the petition
would accept all warning signs and restricted parking associated with the
placement of the speed hump(s).
      (2)   Prior notification and written comments must also be obtained from
local fire, rescue, and police departments, as well as from transit providers
and the transportation provider for the local public schools.
   (H)   Prioritization; implementation.
      (1)   The county will prioritize pending projects on a fiscal year basis
by assigning points to each project. Projects will be scheduled for detailed
design and implementation based on their point scores and the capital
improvement funds available tor the fiscal year. Points will be assigned as
follows:
         (a)   Speed. Two points will be assigned for every 1 m.p.h. that the
85th percentile speed is above the speed limit for the roadway.
         (b)   Pedestrian activity and facilities. Ten points will be assigned
if the street has no sidewalks; 5 points will be assigned if the street has
sidewalks on only 1 side or has discontinuous sidewalks. In addition, 10 points
will be assigned for each pedestrian generator along the roadway section, for
instance, a school playground, or park, and 5 points will be assigned if the
street is designated as an on-road bike route.
         (c)   Street width. Five points will be assigned if the combination of
street width and parking characteristic results in areas of single land,
alternating flow.
      (2)   The street yielding the highest numerical point score will be
considered to have the highest priority. The street with the earliest
application date will have the highest priority among streets with the same
point score.
      (3)   When a budgeted amount for speed humps has been approved, the
county will, starting at the top of the ranking list and proceeding in
descending order, determine which installations will be funded from the
budgeted amount. Representatives of the applicants for all approved speed hump
installations will be notified of which requests have been funded for the
upcoming fiscal year.
      (4)   As funding allows, preference shall be given to those roads
qualifying for speed humps for which other improvements are already planned to
be constructed.
   (I)   Exceptions. On roadways which are classified as collectors, an
exception may be granted to allow for speed humps if the traffic volume on the
roadway is less than 3,000 vpd. The procedure for installation shall remain the
same as outlined in this policy. Each case will be reviewed individually and a
determination will be made based on consideration of adjacent land uses,
function in the transportation system, and safety. In all cases, should speed
humps be installed, the speed humps will be removed when the roadway volume
exceeds 3,000 vpd.
(Ord. 2006-02, passed 3-17-2006)
§ 94.123 SPEED HUMP REQUEST AND INSTALLATION PROCEDURE.
   (A)   The initial request for the installation of speed humps must originate
from an owner of property on the candidate street. A request in writing from
the owner or his or her representative must be forwarded to the county.
   (B)   A preliminary determination of eligibility based on available traffic
data will be made in a timely manner. Eligibility will be determined using the
preliminary evaluation form shown as Exhibit 1 attached to Ord. No. 2006-02.
      (1)   If the roadway segment is determined not be eligible, the applicant
(s) will be notified in writing, with the reason(s) for rejection being given.
      (2)   If the street is determined to be eligible for consideration, a
meeting will be arranged between the applicant(s) and county staff to define
the petition area and the approximate speed hump location range. The applicant
(s) will then be instructed to submit a petition indicating that a minimum
percentage of the property owners in the petition area (per formula on page 5
of the petition form) support the installation of speed humps as provided in
the speed hump policy. Only petition forms supplied by the county or exact
duplicates may be used for this purpose.
   (C)   After verification of the petitions, the county will conduct the
necessary transportation engineering studies and solicit comments and
recommendations from other agencies. A determination of the street’s
eligibility for speed hump installation will then be made in a timely manner,
based on all of the criteria of the speed hump policy as shown in the detailed
engineering evaluation form.
   (D)   The county will annually prioritize pending projects on a fiscal year
basis by assigning points to each project. Projects will be scheduled for
detailed design and implementation based on their point scores and the capital
improvements funds available for the fiscal year.
      (1)   The street yielding the highest numerical point score will be
considered to have the highest priority. The street with the earliest
application date will have the highest priority among streets with the same
point score.
      (2)   When a budgeted amount for speed humps has been approved, the
county will, starting at the top of the ranking list and proceeding in
descending order, determine which installations will be funded from the
budgeted amount. Representatives of the applicants for all approved speed hump
installations will be notified of which requests have been funded for the
upcoming fiscal year.
   (E)   The process for speed hump removal or alteration by residents is the
same as the process for installation.
   (F)   The county reserves the right to install, remove, or alter any speed
hump for the health, welfare, and safety of the public.
   (G)   Speed humps recommended as part of a system level analysis to address
traffic flow and control for a particular area of the county will not be
subject to the provisions of this policy.

   (I)   Supporting data requirements terrain management plan development
standards.
      (1)   In instances of phased development the local district shall require
those portions of the terrain management plan for the entire proposed
development that it deems necessary to allow for the conducting of adequate
phase development reviews.
      (2)   A critical factor impacting terrain management, especially in those
cases where the developer is selling undeveloped lots is what is allowed to
happen after the sale. Normal sound development practices in these situations
include a set of restrictive covenants or homeowner association by-laws. These
documents set forth many do's and don'ts that will be allowed in the
subdivision. Since these can have a profound impact on the overall plan for
terrain management, the Valencia Soil and Water Conservation District shall
require that these be made available at the time of the initial review of any
subdivision packet received for review.
   (J)   Soils.
      (1)   Soils having severe limitations, or which are shown unsuitable, for
the intended purposes should not be used for the purpose unless the developer
has clearly shown in the terrain management plan how these limitations will be
overcome.
      (2)   Below are the major categories of land use to be used in reviewing
the terrain management plan of subdivision. Information about any of these
categories which are pertinent to the development proposal should be included
in the terrain management plan.
         (a)   Building site development.
         (b)   Construction materials.
         (c)   Local roads and streets.
         (d)   Underground utilities.
         (e)   Water control structures.
         (f)   Erosion control structures.
         (g)   Playgrounds.
         (h)   Paths and trails.
         (i)   Sewage disposal.
         (j)   Irrigation easements.
   (K)   Grading.
      (1)   Land grading, filling and clearing operations can cause many
problems when performed incorrectly, such as when leaving large areas open to
wind or water erosion.
      (2)   In addition to conforming to soil suitability, grading, filling and
clearing operations, including road development, shall be designed to fulfill
the following requirements and be included in the terrain management plan as
outlined below.
         (a)   Preserve, match or blend with the natural contours of the land.
The plan should adequately describe how grading operations will be performed to
blend slopes and fills into the natural contours of the land.
         (b)   The plan should indicate whether the subdivider intends to
retain or replace trees and other native vegetation, to stabilize hillsides and
cut/fill slopes, retain moisture, reduce erosion, reduce runoff, and preserve
the natural scenic beauty.
         (c)   Cuts and fills should prevent the deposit of sediment into
floodplains, drainage channels, watercourses, and water bodies.
      (3)   The following discharges attributable to grading are prohibited
whether the discharge is direct or indirect:
         (a)   Sediment and other organic or earthen materials discharged into
a water course, water body, drainage channel or floodplain; and
         (b)   Material placed in any position, which would make it susceptible
to erosion and deposition into a watercourse, water body, drainage channel or
floodplain.
      (4)   The plan for grading, land forming, and protective cover should
provide for the prevention of soil sedimentation.
      (5)   The plan should call for temporary or permanent structural measures
to prevent damaging runoff waters from originating on the slope itself, if
applicable.
      (6)   Planned structural measures should adequately provide for the
limitations of the site.
      (7)   Whenever the native ground cover is removed or disturbed, or
whenever fill material is placed on site, the plan should provide for the
exposed surface to be treated to the extent necessary to prevent dust from
blowing off the construction site.
      (8)   The work schedule for the grading and filling operations should
limit the time soil is exposed to the shortest possible period before cover is
established.
      (9)   Provisions should be made for disposal of vegetation during the
clearing operation. The plan should describe the disposition of earth removed
during grading operations.
      (10)   The maximum cut and fill slopes should be compatible with soil
stability or readability as shown on the soil survey and/or county regulations.
      (11)   The plan should include provisions to prevent runoff from flowing
over the face of the slope. If mechanical stabilization measures are planned
for slope containment:
         (a)   These structures should blend with the landscape.
         (b)   If structures do not blend in, landscape screening should be
planned.
         (c)   If a borrow area is shown, revegetation should be planned for
the disturbed area.
         (d)   If arroyos or other overflow areas are in the planning area,
plans should include rundowns to a safe outlet. Plans should include provisions
for water and erosion control in borrow ditches along streets and roads.
      (12)   A clear statement of whom will be responsible for maintenance of
all drainage and erosion control structures.
   (L)   Floodplain management.
      (1)   Flood line elevations are locations are of primary importance. It
is imperative that the 100-year flood line elevations and locations be shown on
the plat map. Damage from flooding is a function of flow depths and velocity.
In appraising the flood damage potential the magnitude and location of the
velocities should be considered. Erosion and sediment deposition are good
indicators of damage that has occurred in the past.
      (2)   Even the smallest of watersheds has a floodplain, but the intent of
the review is to note those drainage courses that will flood and impact the
proposed land use of the subdivision. Areas of potential flooding are
identified in the soil limitations of any USDA prepared soil survey. While
these are not usually accurate enough to identify the 100 year flood zone, they
will be useful indicators of areas needing careful study by the developer. The
use of FEMA flood hazard maps by themselves are also not considered adequate
for locating all possible 100 year floodplains within the development. These
maps commonly depict the larger drainage flood hazard areas, but do not
delineate the smaller areas, which need to be identified within a proposed
subdivision.
      (3)   The smaller drainage courses must not be overlooked. They must be
properly identified as potential floodplain hazards if these drainage courses
cross numerous lots where activities by the upstream lot owner may directly or
indirectly change or alter the flow pattern of these watercourses. The
developer may note the major watercourses having floodplains on the plat maps,
and additionally must also identify those smaller drainage channels and
watercourses which cross a number of lots and present a potential hazard if
altered by upstream activities. A perpetual easement for facilitating the
natural drainage patterns of smaller watercourses should be encouraged and may
be required where deemed necessary. This will allow floodwaters to move through
the natural as well as the manmade flood channels without being obstructed.
Care must be given to consider those water courses that do not have definite
and distinct banks but are floodplains due to an overland flow condition.
   (M)   Storm drainage plan.
      (1)   Subdivisions and developments shall be planned, constructed and
maintained to:
         (a)   Protect and preserve existing natural drainage channels except
where erosion and water control measures are found necessary and approved by
the local district;
         (b)   Provide temporary measures to prevent damaging runoff waters
from leaving the site until construction is completed and permanent control
measures are installed;
         (c)   Protect structures and other works from flood hazards using the
100-year frequency storm for calculating flood levels;
         (d)   Provide a system where in runoff water within the subdivision is
removed without causing harm or damage to the environment, property, or
persons, inside or outside the subdivision area;
         (e)   Assure that water drained from the subdivision does not contain
pollutants or sedimentary materials of any greater quantity than would occur in
the absence of the subdivision; and
         (f)   Assure that waters are drained from the subdivision in a manner
that they will not cause erosion outside the subdivision to any greater extent
than would occur in the absence of the subdivision.
      (2)   Road construction shall ensure proper drainage conditions. Roads
shall be designated to:
         (a)   Water ponding areas as a result of road construction should be
avoided unless plans are developed that will adequately address the conditions;
         (b)   Roads planned to be used in collecting or disposing of runoff
shall be designed to insure adequate control of the flows that will prevent
erosion and sedimentation;
         (c)   Road drain outlets into an existing drainage course or into a
controlled outlet shall be designed to outlet into controlled area and prevent
erosion on the drainage course and runoff area;
         (d)   Provide road culverts which are properly sized and located and
of adequate length; and
         (e)   Provide adequate protection for road culvert inlets and outlets.
      (3)   All storm drainage systems shall be constructed in accordance with
the standards of the Valencia Soil and Water Conservation District as deemed
necessary for the site conditions of that proposed subdivision. If the drainage
basin wherein the subdivision is located is only partially developed, the
Valencia SWCD shall require that the design and the construction of the
drainage system have sufficient flow capabilities to adequately serve the
entire drainage basin. This is based on the assumption the entire basin will be
developed.
      (4)   Development of an area is almost certain to cause an increase in
runoff and sediment. The possible adverse effects of the increase should be
analyzed. Special consideration should be given to the existing or planned
bridge, culvert, and road crossing sizes and the stability and capacity of the
existing or planned watercourses. All planned construction of roads and their
appurtenances shall be reviewed to ensure they do not adversely impact the
storm drainage flows. It is recognized that stable watercourses may start to
degrade when exposed to larger, more frequent or longer flows that may result
from development.
      (5)   Diversions, debris basins, retaining walls, terraces, berms and
vegetative means should be used as needed to reduce the sediment and runoff. It
is recognized that after an area is treated and sediment levels of storm runoff
are reduced, the water is once again more likely to be able to increase erosion
in areas that previously impacted due to its new found ability to erode and
transport sediment.
      (6)   Regarding and shaping of large natural channels usually increases
the channel velocity, which results in increased erosion unless measures are
taken to slow velocities and protect the banks.
      (7)   Excavated and filled slopes should be generally be 3 to 1 or
flatter.
   (N)   Erosion control.
      (1)   The plan should clearly indicate that installed measures will
prevent or control erosion.
      (2)   As a minimum the following items should be considered:
         (a)   Road grades should be designed flat enough to prevent erosion,
based on the soils involved;
         (b)   Borrow areas or drainage features should be designed to prevent
erosion or sediment deposition; and
         (c)   Culvert inlets and outlets should be properly protected from
erosion and sedimentation.
      (3)   Plans should indicate where critical area treatment or special
plantings will be needed. If so, the plans should be in keeping with the
landscaping and revegetation plan procedures.
      (4)   Plans should indicate where temporary soil stabilization will be
needed during development. If so, it should be adequately planned in accordance
with the Valencia SWCD/Natural Resources Conservation Service Field Office
Technical Guides.
      (5)   Soil stabilization measures should be planned to protect permanent
slopes where land forming activities have taken place.
   (O)   Landscaping and revegetation.
      (1)   Revegetation is an important part of any subdivision plan. A
definite time schedule for installing plant cover is necessary to prevent
erosion. The need for revegetation is an integral part of several other
sections involved in terrain management.
      (2)   The following items will be considered when reviewing the
vegetation portion of the subdivision plan:
         (a)   1.   Species scheduled for planting should be adapted to the
soils and the local climate;
            2.   Any species considered to be noxious, or a weed species that
could enhance the distribution of undesirable species will not be allowed;
         (b)   Planting dates shown in the plan should agree with the Valencia
SWCD and NRCS Field Office Technical Guides;
         (c)   Seeding rates shown in the plan should meet the minimum set
forth in the Valencia SWCD and NRCS Field Office Technical Guides;
         (d)   Seeding or planting methods should be compatible with the
methods in the Field Office Technical Guides;
         (e)   Mulching of seeded area should be included as part of the plan.
Mulching plans should be compatible with the Field Office Technical Guides and
the Critical Area Treatment for Urban Development publication; and
         (f)   Existing vegetation should be left undisturbed whenever
possible. The plan should ensure that remaining vegetation is not adversely
impacted during construction of the subdivision.

§ 151.158 REVIEW GUIDELINES FOR NEW MEXICO STATE ROADS.
   (A)   Generally.
      (1)   (a)   To comply with the New Mexico Subdivision Act, the New Mexico
State Highway and Transportation Department reviews each subdivision submitted,
following the recommended guidelines outlined in this document.
         (b)   There is 1 coordinating section and 5 reviewing sections within
the Department actually handle the subdivision package submitted for review.
      (2)   The coordinating section is the property management unit within the
Right-of-Way Bureau, which receives the subdivision package from the county and
then distributes the package to the review sections. The review sections are
appropriate district offices, traffic design, project development, drainage and
lands engineering.
      (3)   In general, the Highway Department is concerned with how the
subdivision is going to affect federal and state highways, specifically the
safety of the traveling public and the integrity of the road system within New
Mexico
   (B)   Part 1: Coordination of subdivision reviews.
      (1)   All subdivision packages should be sent certified mail to:
The New Mexico State Highway and Transportation Department
PO Box 1149
Santa Fe, NM 87504-1149
Attn: Right-of-Way Bureau
      (2)   In order to comply with the new 30 day response, 5 copies of each
subdivision package must be submitted for a timely response.
      (3)   Upon receipt of packages, each will be distributed to reviewing
sections. Comments will be returned to the property management unit of the
Right-of-Way Bureau for compilation. A letter with department comments will be
sent to the appropriate counties for action.
   (C)   Part 2: Recommended guidelines by review section traffic design
section.
      (1)   Traffic design will follow the department's regulations for
driveways and median openings on non-access controlled highways. (copy
attached)
      (2)   Any access to a state highway from subdivision needs to be able to
accommodate appropriate emergency vehicles. Traffic impact studies are required
for development that generates more than 125 vehicles per day. This means a
typical subdivision of 20 or more lots will need a traffic impact study if it
accesses directly to a state route. Typically a traffic impact study is
required if one has not been submitted and there is a question of need.
         (a)   In all instances, whether a traffic impact study is submitted or
not, we are concerned about the safety and efficiency of the access points on
to our state routes. The driveway regulations provide further details.
         (b)   Any subdivision development requests that affect access
controlled routes must be submitted to the Department's Access Control Review
Committee and the appropriate district.
   (D)   Appropriate district office.
      (1)   District review overlaps traffic designs review in that they follow
the regulations for driveways and median openings on non-access controlled
highways, but are more familiar with the area and have a better grasp of other
development in the area for more localized comments.
      (2)   District will look at traffic control plans for traffic safety and
comment if changes need to be made.
      (3)   District will review traffic impact analysis reports and comment.
   (E)   Project development.
      (1)   Project developments main review is concerned with the impact the
proposed subdivision will have on present planned road projects and projected
project development.
      (2)   Project development will advise of any know planned roadway
improvements in the immediate or adjacent areas of planned subdivisions to
assure that improvements are coordinated.
   (F)   Drainage.
      (1)   When the subdivision is abutting the highway, existing drainage
should be maintained. The drainage within the highway right of way shall not be
altered or impeded.
      (2)   When the subdivision is located upstream of the highway, no
additional run-off will be allowed to drain into the highway drainage
structures. Historical drainage shall be maintained.
      (3)   All drainage structures within the highway right-of-way shall be
sized for 50-year design drainage storm.
      (4)   Lands engineering reviews land use proposals affecting state
highway with respect to survey data, highway right-of-way limits, access
control and encroachments.

   (F)   Water availability assessment for all Type 1, Type 2 and Type 4
subdivisions and all Type 3 and Type 5 subdivisions containing 6 or more
parcels.
      (1)   If the subdivision is being served by an existing public utility,
the subdivider shall provide a water availability statement from the approved
utility.
      (2)   A water availability assessment shall be submitted by the
subdivider:
         (a)   As a condition of preliminary subdivision plat approval for all
Type 1, Type 2 and Type 4 subdivisions and Type 3 subdivisions containing 6 or
more parcels; and
         (b)   As a condition of final subdivision plat approval for Type 5
subdivisions containing 6 or more parcels.
      (3)   The requirements of the water availability assessment are dependent
on the source of water supply so that:
         (a)   For subdivisions where the surface water will be a new
groundwater diversion and community system permitted pursuant to NMSA §§ 72-12-
3 and 72-12-7, the subdivider shall demonstrate a 50 year supply, and shall
submit a geohydrologic report in;
         (b)   For subdivision where the source of supply will be a new surface
water diversion and community system permitted pursuant to NMSA §§ 72-5-1, 72-
5-23, and 72-5-24, the subdivider shall submit a hydrologic report;
         (c)   For subdivisions where the source of supply will be an existing
community or municipal water supply system permitted pursuant to NMSA §§ 72-5-
1, 72-5-23, 72-5-24, 72-12-1, or 72-12-3, the subdivider shall submit a water
utility plan in accordance with
§ 151.160(F)(7); and
         (d)   For subdivisions where the source of water will be individual
domestic wells, or shared wells permitted pursuant to NMSA § 72-12-1, the
subdivider shall demonstrate a 50 year supply and submit a geohydrologic
report.
       (4)   For new community wells and water systems, the subdivider shall
submit a water supply plan and geohydrologic report, which meets the following
requirements.
         (a)   Geohydrologic reports shall demonstrate that groundwater is
sufficient to meet the maximum annual water requirement of the subdivision is
physically available and be practically recovered to sustain the development
for a continuous period of 50 years. This analysis shall take into account the
production of existing wells and shall demonstrate that the subdivision wells,
as proposed or as designed, will be capable of producing the full annual demand
for at least 50 years.
         (b)   The subdivider shall drill sufficient exploratory wells within
the boundaries of the proposed subdivision to adequately characterize the
aquifer, unless the subdivider can demonstrate that existing wells in the area
are representative of general aquifer conditions within the subdivision. Where
existing are not adequate to demonstrate the availability of water should be
obtained from aquifer tests, performed on-site, which are adequate for
predicting long-term water availability or from retests conducted on nearby
wells. Alternate tests can be conducted on nearby off-site wells if the
subdivider can demonstrate that these wells are representative of general
aquifer conditions within the subdivision.
         (c)   The assessment shall include a calculated schedule of effects on
the proposed subdivision's production well(s), which may result from existing
demands and from the increase of groundwater withdrawals for the subdivision.
Analyses shall be performed to assess whether future water level declines will
be within the limits of allowable draw down in the subdivision production
wells. Predicted draw downs shall be calculated in a conservative manner (which
estimates maximum draw down). These calculations shall include estimates of
future water uses.
         (d)   The subdivider shall calculate the lowest practical pumping
water level in the proposed subdivision pumping wells by any of the following
methods as appropriate, provided there shall be no presumption made as to
additional available water below the bottom of the proposed production well and
further provided that the total available draw down shall be reduced by a
factor of 20% as a margin of well efficiency over time and peak production
requirements. By using the results of acceptable on-site aquifer pump tests,
the lowest allowable pumping level may be lowest water level reached during the
test.
      (5)   By setting the level at the top of the uppermost screened interval
in wells completed in fractured aquifers, the lowest practical pumping water
level may be above the top of the facture zone. In wells completed in alluvial
aquifers, the lowest practical pumping water level may be defined by a maximum
allowable draw down equal to 70% of the initial water column. The geological
report should present all hydrological information pertinent to the study area
including that available from post geohydrologic studies. All sources of
information used in the report should be identified including basic data
collected by the consultant who prepared the report. The report shall contain
maps and cross-sections showing geology, depth to the water bearing formation,
water level contours and estimated thickness of saturation in the aquifer.
Basic data for the immediate area of the subdivision must be current, with the
date of collection noted and the location identified on a map. The report on
the investigation should be in the form of a technical narrative; spreadsheets,
tables, graphs, maps and cross-sections shall be included.
      (6)   For new surface water diversions and community water systems using
surface water the subdivider shall submit a hydrologic report, which meets the
following requirements:
         (a)   The hydrologic report shall demonstrate that surface water is
sufficient to meet the maximum annual water requirement of the subdivision is
physically available.
         (b)   These analyses shall include the following.
            1.   Narrative and analytical demonstration that the surface water
will be physically available or the proposed use given short-term and long-term
fluctuations (based-flow analysis) due to climatic cycles or other factors such
as induced recharge due to groundwater diversions, analyses of relevant
historical runoff records, and projected water supply available for the
subdivision requirements. Applicable legal or water right constraints on water
availability shall be considered.
            2.   If the analysis of the historical runoff record indicates
possible shortages in the projected water supply available for the subdivision
requirements the subdivider shall provide for either storage or a supplemental
groundwater supply sufficient to meet the storage.
            3.   If supplemental groundwater supply is proposed the subdivider
shall prepare a geohydrologic assessment.
      (7)   For community water systems in which an existing company is
proposed as the source of water supply, the subdivider shall submit a water

discriminatory housing practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation
and persuasion. Nothing said or done in the course of such informal endeavors
may be made public, or used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding under this
chapter, without the written consent of the persons concerned. Any employee of
the Board of County Commissioners who shall make public any information in
violation of this provision shall be deemed guilty of a petty misdemeanor, and
upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $300 or imprisoned not
more than 90 days in jail.
   (B)   A complaint under division (A) shall be filed within 180 days after
the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred. Complaints shall be in
writing and shall state the facts upon which the allegations of a
discriminatory housing practice are based. Complaints may be reasonably and
fairly amended at any time. A respondent may file and answer to the complaint
against him and, with the leave of the Board of County Commissioners, which
shall be granted whenever it would be reasonable and fair to do so, may amend
his or her answer at any time. Both complaints and answers shall be verified.
   (C)   If within 30 days after a complaint is filed with the Board of County
Commissioners, he or she has been unable to obtain voluntary compliance with
this chapter, the aggrieved person may, within 30 days thereafter, file a
complaint with the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development. The Board of County Commissioners official will assist in this
filing.
   (D)   If the Board of County Commissioners has been unable to obtain
voluntary compliance within 30 days of the complaint, the aggrieved person may,
within 30 days thereafter, commence a civil action in any appropriate court,
against the respondent named in the complaint, to enforce the rights granted or
protected by this chapter, insofar as such rights relate to the subject of the
complaint. If it finds that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or
is about to occur, the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such
practice or order such affirmative action as may be appropriate.
   (E)   In any proceeding brought pursuant to this section, the burden of
proof shall be on the complaint.
   (F)   Whenever an action filed by an individual comes to trial, the Board of
County Commissioners shall immediately terminate all efforts to obtain
voluntary compliance.
(Ord. 2009-04, passed 12-21-2009)
§ 152.11 INVESTIGATIONS; SUBPOENAS; GIVING OF EVIDENCE.
   (A)   In conducting an investigation, the Board of County Commissioners
shall have access at all reasonable times to premises, records, documents,
individuals and other evidence or possible sources of evidence, and may
examine, record and copy such materials, and take and record the testimony or
statements of such persons, as are reasonably necessary for the furtherance or
the investigation; provided, however, that it first complies with the
provisions of the Fourth Amendment relating to unreasonable searches and
seizures. The Board of County Commissioners may issue subpoenas to compel its
access to, or the production of, such materials, or the appearance of such
persons, and may issue interrogatories to a respondent, to the same extent and
subject to the same limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or
interrogatories were issued or served in aid of a civil action in the United
States district court for the district in which the investigation is taking
place. The Board of County Commissioners may administer oaths.
   (B)   Upon written application to the Board of County Commissioners, a
respondent shall be entitled to the issuance of a reasonable number of
subpoenas by and in the name of the Board of County Commissioners, to the same
extent and subject to the same limitations as subpoenas issued by the Board of
County Commissioners. Subpoenas issued at the request of a respondent shall
show on their face the name and address of such respondent, and shall state
that they were issued at the respondent’s request.
   (C)   Witnesses summoned by subpoena of the Board of County Commissioners
shall be entitled to the same witness and mileage fees as are witnesses in
proceedings in United States district courts. Fees payable to a witness
summoned by a subpoena issued at the request of a respondent shall be paid by
the respondent.
   (D)   Within 5 days after service of a subpoena upon any person, such person
may petition the Board of County Commissioners to revoke or modify the
subpoena. The Board of County Commissioners shall grant the petition if it
finds that:
      (1)   The subpoena requires appearance or attendance at an unreasonable
time or place;
      (2)   The subpoena requires production of evidence that does not relate
to any matter under investigation;
      (3)   The subpoena does not describe with sufficient particularity the
evidence to be produced;
      (4)   Compliance would be unduly onerous; or
      (5)   For other good reason.
   (E)   In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the Board of
County Commissioners, or other person at whose request it was issued, may
petition for its enforcement in the municipal or state court for the district
in which the person to whom the subpoena was addressed resides, was served or
transacts business.
   (F)   Any person who willfully fails or neglects to attend and testify, or
to answer any lawful inquiry, or to produce records, documents or other
evidence, if in his or her power to do so, in obedience to the subpoena or
lawful order of the Board of County Commissioners, shall be fined not more than
$300, or imprisoned not more than 90 days, or both fined and imprisoned. Any
person who, with intent thereby to mislead the Board of County Commissioners,
shall make or cause to be made any false entry or statement of fact in any
report, account, record or other document submitted to the Board of County
Commissioners pursuant to a subpoena or other order, or shall willfully neglect
or fail to make or cause to be made full, true and correct entries in such
reports, accounts, records or other documents, or shall willfully mutilate,
alter or by any other means falsify any documentary evidence, shall be fined
not more than $300, or imprisoned not more than 90 days, or both fined and
imprisoned.
   (G)   The County Attorney shall conduct all litigation in which the Board of
County Commissioners participates as a party or as amicus pursuant to this
chapter.

   (A)   The rights granted by §§
152.03,
152.04,
152.05 and
152.06 may be enforced by civil actions in the appropriate United States
district, state or local court. A civil action shall be commenced within 180
days after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred; provided,
however, that the court shall continue such civil case brought pursuant to this
section or §
152.10(D) from time to time before bringing it to trial, if the court believes
that the conciliation efforts of the Board of County Commissioners are likely
to result in satisfactory settlement of the alleged discriminatory housing
practice complained of in the complaint made to the Board of County
Commissioners, and which practice forms the basis for the action to the
issuance of any court order issued under the authority of this chapter, and
involving a bona a fide purchaser, encumbrances or tenant, without actual
notice of the filing of a complaint or civil action under the provisions of
this chapter, shall not be affected.
   (B)   The court may grant as relief, as it deems appropriate, any permanent
or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order or other order, and may
award to the plaintiff actual damages and not more that $1,000 punitive
damages, together with court costs and reasonable attorney fees in the case of
a prevailing plaintiff; provided, that the plaintiff is, in the opinion of the
court, not financially able to assume the attorney's fees.

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS
§ 153.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   (A)   The Legislature of the State of New Mexico has in NMSA § 3-18-
7 delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations
designed to minimize flood losses.
   (B)   Therefore, the Board of County Commissioners of Valencia County does
ordain as follows.
(Ord. 87-1, passed 3-23-1987; Am. Ord. passed 5-20-1991; Am. Ord. 2010-02,
passed 8-18-2010)
§ 153.002 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of Valencia County are subject to periodic
inundation that results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains, which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(Ord. 87-1, passed 3-23-1987; Am. Ord. passed 5-20-1991; Am. Ord. 2010-02,
passed 8-18-2010)
§ 153.003 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas, by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges, located in
floodplains;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in a manner as to minimize future flood-blight
areas; and
   (G)   Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area.
(Ord. 87-1, passed 3-23-1987; Am. Ord. passed 5-20-1991; Am. Ord. 2010-02,
passed 8-18-2010)
§ 153.004 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following
methods:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or that cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities serving
these uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development that may
increase flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert flood waters, or that may increase flood hazards to other
lands.

DEFINITIONS
§ 153.015 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ALLUVIAL FAN FLOODING. Flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan
or similar landform that originates at the apex and is characterized by high-
velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport and deposition;
and unpredictable flow paths.
   APEX. A point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow
path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial
fan flooding can occur.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO, AH or VO zone on a community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), with a 1% chance or greater annual chance of
flooding to an average depth of 1 to 3 feet where a clearly defined channel
does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity
flow may be evident. This flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD. The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may
be designated as Zone A on the Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). After detailed
ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone
A usually is refined into Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30, VE or V.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation shown on the Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM) and found in the accompanying Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Zones
A, AE, AH, A1-30, V1-V30, or VE that indicates the water surface elevation
resulting from the flood that has a 1% chance of equaling or exceeding that
level in any given year, also called the base flood.
   BASEMENT. Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   CRITICAL FEATURE. An integral and readily identifiable part of a flood
protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire
system would be compromised.

building in Zones V1-30, VE or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal
structure member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means
of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the floor of
the water; and
         (b)   Adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity
of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood.
      (2)   In the case of Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X and D,
ELEVATED BUILDING also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid
foundation perimeter walls, with openings sufficient to facilitate the
unimpeded movement of flood waters.

purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.
   FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM.
   (1)   Those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized,
appropriated and expended, and that have been constructed specifically to
modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community
subject to a special flood hazard and the extent of the depths of associated
flooding.

      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. (For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act, being 16 U.S.C. §§ 3501
et seq. (Pub. L. No. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the
date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other
improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The ACTUAL START means
either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site,
such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations, or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the ACTUAL START
OF CONSTRUCTION means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other
structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage
tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.
      (1)   Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other improvement
of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of
the structure before start of construction of the improvement. This includes
structures that have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual
repair work performed.
      (2)   The term does not, however, include either:
         (a)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
that have been identified by the local code enforcement official and that are
the minimum necessary conditions; or
         (b)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this
chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A
variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise
prohibited by this chapter. For full requirements, see the National Flood
Insurance Program Regulations, 44 C.F.R. Part 60.6.
   VIOLATION.
      (1)   The failure of a structure or other development to be fully

§ 153.053 VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   The Appeal Board as established by the community shall hear and render
judgement on requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   The Appeal Board shall hear and render judgement on an appeal only
when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or
determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
   (C)   Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board
may appeal the decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
   (D)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions
involving an appeal, and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency upon request.
   (E)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   (F)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in size, contiguous to
and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing the relevant factors in §
153.003(B) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond 1/
2 acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
   (G)   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
chapter, the Appeal Board may attach conditions to the granting of variances as
it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter (§
153.003).
   (H)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (I)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures, upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic
structure, and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
   (J)   Prerequisites for granting variances:
      (1)   Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief;
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   Showing a good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (K)   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements, and for other development necessary for the conduct
of a functionally dependent use; provided that:
      (1)   The criteria outlined in divisions (A) through (I) above are met;
and
      (2)   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety.

PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 153.065 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required
for all new construction and substantial improvements:
   (A)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy;
   (B)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
   (C)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials resistant to flood damage;
   (D)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment
and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent
water from entering or accumulating within their components during conditions
of flooding;
   (E)   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into these systems;
   (F)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into these systems, and to
discharge from them into flood waters; and
   (G)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to
them, or contamination from them, during flooding.

§ 153.066 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has
been provided as set forth in §§
153.031,
153.051 or
153.067, the following provisions are required:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A registered professional
engineer, architect or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the
Floodplain Administrator that the standard of this division, as proposed in §
153.052, has been satisfied.
   (B)   Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial
improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above
the base flood level, or together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is
watertight, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. A registered
professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural
design, specifications and plans for the construction, and shall certify that
the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted
standards of practice as outlined in this division. A record of the
certification, which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) to which the structures are floodproofed, shall be maintained by the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (C)   Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement, and that
are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of flood waters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or architect, or meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:
      (1)   A minimum of 2 openings having a total net area of not less than 1
square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be
provided;
      (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than 1 foot above

§ 153.068 STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (AO/AH ZONES).
   Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in §
153.031 are areas designated as areas of shallow flooding. These areas have
special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of 1 to 3 feet where a
clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. This flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions
apply.
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the community's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified).
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures shall:
      (1)   Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the community's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified); or
      (2)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be
designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight, with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
   (C)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a
certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standards of this
section, as proposed in §
153.052, have been satisfied.
   (D)   Within Zones AH or AO, adequate drainage paths shall be required
around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from
proposed structures.

§ 153.069 FLOODWAYS.
   Located within areas of special flood hazard established in §
153.031 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall
apply.
   (A)   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development, within the adopted regulatory
floodway, unless it has been demonstrated, through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice, that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   (B)   If division (A) above has been satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of §§
153.065 et seq.
   (C)   Under the provisions of 44 C.F.R. Ch. 1, § 65.12, of the National
Flood Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the
adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood
elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM
and floodway revision through FEMA.

§ 154.057 CONDITIONAL USE CRITERIA AND REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   The purpose of a conditional use is to provide for those uses which
possess unique and special characteristics making impractical their inclusion
as outright permitted uses in the underlying zoning district.
      (2)   These uses shall not be incompatible with the type of uses
permitted in surrounding areas.
      (3)   Location and operation of designated conditional uses shall be
subject to review and authorized only by issuance of a conditional use permit.
   (B)   Review criteria. A conditional use may be authorized, subject to the
Type B application procedure set forth in
§ 154.076, upon adequate demonstration by the applicant that the proposed use
will be compatible with vicinity uses, and satisfies all relevant requirements
of this chapter and the following general criteria:
      (1)   The use is listed as a conditional use in the underlying zoning
district;
      (2)   The use is not inconsistent with those goals and policies of the
comprehensive plan which apply to the proposed use;
      (3)   The parcel is suitable for the proposed use considering its size,
shape, location, topography, existence of improvements and natural features;
      (4)   The proposed use will not substantially alter the character of the
surrounding area any more than the existing permissive uses in the zone or in a
manner which substantially limits, impairs or prevents the use of surrounding
properties for the permitted uses listed in the underlying zoning district;
      (5)   The proposed use is appropriate, considering the adequacy of public
facilities and services existing or planned for the area affected by the use;
and
      (6)   The use is or can be made compatible with existing uses and other
allowable uses in the area.
   (C)   Conditions of approval.
      (1)   In approving an application for a conditional use, the P&Z may
impose conditions to protect the area surrounding the proposed use and to
preserve the basic purpose and intent of the underlying zoning district.
      (2)   (a)   These conditions may be set forth in a formal affidavit
executed by the applicant and Valencia County.
         (b)   The affidavit shall be recorded in the deed and mortgage records
of Valencia County.
      (3)   These conditions may include, but are not limited to, the
following:
         (a)   Increasing the required parcel area or yard dimensions;
         (b)   Limiting the height, size or location of buildings and
structures;
         (c)   Controlling the location and number of vehicle access points;
         (d)   Increasing the road width;
         (e)   Increasing the number of required off-street parking or loading
spaces;
         (f)   Limiting the number, size, location or lighting of signs;
         (g)   Requiring fencing, screening or landscaping to protect adjacent

         (h)   Prescribing exterior finish for buildings or additions thereto;
or
         (I)   Prescribing a time limit within which to fulfill any established
conditions.
   (D)   Performance bond. The P&Z may require an applicant, upon approval of a
conditional use permit, to enter into a performance agreement with the county
and to furnish the county with an appropriate financial guarantee to ensure
that the required improvements are completed according to the plans approved by
the P&Z, and that standards established in granting the conditional use permit
are observed.
   (E)   General requirements. Any conditional use authorized pursuant to this
chapter shall be subject to the following additional requirements:
      (1)   (a)   A conditional use shall be subject to the standards of the
zoning district in which it is located except as these standards have been
modified in authorizing the conditional use.
         (b)   No modification of a zoning district standard shall have the
effect of changing the existing zoning district where the property sits.
      (2)   A conditional use may be enlarged or altered pursuant to the
following:
         (a)   Major alterations of a conditional use including changes,
alterations or deletion of any conditions imposed shall be processed as a new
conditional use permit application, in accordance with the Type B application
procedure set forth in
§ 154.076.;
         (b)   Minor alterations of a conditional use may be approved by the
Department if requested prior to issuance of building permits for the
conditional use. Minor alterations are those changes which may affect the
siting and dimensions of structural and other improvements relating to the
conditional use, and may include small changes in the use itself. Any change
which would affect the basic type, character, arrangement or intent of the
conditional use originally approved shall be considered a major alteration;
         (c)   Where the granting of a conditional use permit is contingent
upon an amendment to this chapter and an application for the amendment has been
recommended for approval by the P&Z, the P&Z may authorize the granting of a
conditional use permit contingent upon the necessary final action of the
Commission in respect to the required chapter amendment and further action by
the P&Z shall not be necessary; and
         (d)   A conditional use approval involving construction shall be null
and void 1 year from the date of final approval unless completion or
substantial construction has taken place. In any case where a conditional use
approval does not involve construction, the approval shall be null and void 1
year from the date of final approval unless the approval has been implemented.
The Department may extend the conditional use permit for an additional period
not to exceed 2 years upon receipt of a written request from the applicant
demonstrating good cause for the delay and provided that the request to extend
the permit is received by the Department prior to expiration of the original
conditional use approval.
   (F)   Compliance with conditions.
      (1)   Compliance with conditions imposed in granting a conditional use
permit and adherence to the approved plan shall be required. Any departure from
these conditions of approval and approved plans constitutes a violation of this
chapter.
      (2)   The Department may revoke any conditional use permit for failure to
comply with any prescribed condition of the conditional use permit approval or
for any other violation of this chapter.
   (G)   Revocation of a conditional use permit. The procedure for the
revocation of a conditional use permit shall be as follows:

condition imposed in granting a conditional use permit or other violations of
this chapter is found, the Department shall inform the applicant by registered
letter and first class mail of the violation and shall require compliance
within 60 days, or the Department will take action under division (2) below of
this section to revoke approval of the conditional use. The Department letter,
constituting notice of intent to revoke, may be appealed to the Commission
within 30 days of its mailing. The Commission shall consider the appeal in
accordance with
§ 154.062 and may affirm, reverse or modify the Department notice of intent to
revoke. The applicant must comply with the Commission's order on appeal of
notice of intent to revoke within 30 days of the issuance of the Commission's
decision. If the applicant does not comply with the Commission's order within
30 days, the Department shall take action under division (2) below of this
section to revoke approval of the conditional use. The Department may extend
the time for compliance if the applicant provides financial or other assurances
suitable to the Department that the conditions of approval will be satisfied
and maintained.
      (2)   If the violation is not corrected within the time required by
division (1) above, the Department shall notify the applicant by registered and
first class mail that the conditional use permit has been revoked, and that any

§ 154.058 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Purpose and scope.
      (1)   The purpose of a variance is to provide administrative relief when
a strict application of the zoning requirements of lot width, lot depth,
building height, setback, access or other dimensional requirements would impose
practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship.
      (2)   These difficulties or hardships may result from geographic,
topographic or other physical conditions on the site or in the immediate
vicinity.
   (B)   Review criteria. A variance may be authorized, subject to the Type B
application procedure set forth in
§ 154.076 and pursuant to divisions (C) and (D) below, and upon adequate
demonstration by the applicant that the proposed variance satisfies the
following criteria:
      (1)   Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to
the land, building or structure involved;
      (2)   The granting the proposed variance would be in the public interest
and would be in harmony with the purpose and scope set forth in division (A)
above, the intent and purpose of the underlying zoning district and the intent
and purpose of this chapter;
      (3)   The variance would result in minimal detriment to the immediate
vicinity;
      (4)   The variance requested is the minimum variance which would make
possible the reasonable use of the applicant's land, building or structure;
      (5)   The special conditions and circumstances on which the application
is based do not result from the negligent or knowing violation of this chapter
by the applicant; and
      (6)   Granting the variance would not violate any State Environmental
Regulations.
   (C)   Conditions of approval.
      (1)   In approving an application for a variance, the decision-making
body may impose conditions as it deems appropriate to ensure that the intent of
this section is carried out.
      (2)   These conditions shall be reasonably related to the variance
criteria set forth in division (B) above.
   (D)   General requirements. Any variance authorized pursuant to this chapter
shall be subject to the following additional requirements.
      (1)   An authorized variance is not personal to the applicant and shall
be deemed to run with the land.
      (2)   (a)   A variance shall be null and void 1 year from the date it is
granted unless completion or substantial construction has taken place.
         (b)   The Department may extend the variance for an additional period

demonstrating good cause for the delay and provided that the request for
extension is received by the Department prior to expiration of the original
variance approval.
      (3)   No variance shall be granted which allows the establishment or
expansion of a use otherwise prohibited or subject to conditional use
procedures.
      (4)   No variance shall be granted which shall have the effect of
rezoning the property.
      (5)   No variance shall be granted which allows the creation of a parcel
which is substandard to the minimum parcel size requirements of the particular
zoning district.
   (E)   Compliance with conditions.
      (1)   Compliance with conditions imposed in approval of a variance and
adherence to an approved site plan shall be required.
      (2)   Any departure from these conditions of approval and approved plans
constitutes a violation of this chapter.
      (3)   The Department may revoke approval of any variance for failure to
comply with any condition imposed in approval of the variance or for any other
violation of this chapter.
   (F)   Revocation of variance. The procedure for the revocation of approval
of a variance shall be as follows:
      (1)   If, upon review by the Department, a violation of any condition
imposed in approval of a variance is found, the Department shall inform the
applicant by registered letter and first class mail of the violation and shall
require compliance within 60 days, or the Department will take action under
division (2) below of this section to revoke approval of the variance. The
Department's letter, constituting notice of intent to revoke variance may be
appealed to the Commission within 30 days of its mailing. The Commission shall
consider the appeal in accordance with
§ 154.062 and may affirm, reverse, or modify the Department's notice of intent
to revoke variance. The applicant must comply with the Commission's order on
appeal of notice of intent to revoke variance within 30 days of the issuance of
the Commission's decision. If the applicant does not comply with the
Commission's order within 30 days, the Department shall take action under

division (1) above, the Department shall notify the applicant by registered and
first class mail that the variance has been revoked, and that any subsequent
action on the application will require a new application for a variance.
   (G)   Administrative adjustments. As a result of unique characteristics of
specific lands, uses or structures, and in the event that setbacks, building
heights, lot area or other dimensional chapter standards are determined to be
unreasonable or inappropriate by the Department, limited administrative
adjustment of these standards may be authorized at the time application for
building permit or land division is made providing the adjustment does not
exceed 15% of the required standard and the applicant can demonstrate
satisfaction of one of the following criteria:
      (1)   The adjustment is needed to permit a structural addition or new
construction no closer to a property line than the existing structure(s).
      (2)   That the adjustment would provide for setbacks no less restrictive
than those for structures on affected adjacent property(s).
      (3)   That the combined setbacks of structures on the parcel in question
and adjacent affected parcels meet the combined respective setback
requirements.
      (4)   That other special conditions or circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land or use structure involved, and which justify an
adjustment, while still satisfying the intent of the standard.

requirements of this section. The general purpose of this section is to
encourage the conversion of non-conforming uses to conforming uses.
      (2)   This section allows non-conforming uses and structures to be
continued, altered, restored or replaced subject to satisfaction of the review
criteria specified in division (C) below. Nothing contained in this chapter
shall require any change in the plans, construction or designated use of any

commenced prior to the date of adoption of this chapter or any amendments
thereto. No alteration of a non-conforming use shall be permitted except in
compliance with the provisions of this section.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this chapter, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      ALTERATION. A change in structure, an increase in the number of
structures, or a change of use. Where the term ALTERATION is applied to a
change of a structure, it is intended to be applied to any change, addition or
modification in the structure, except for cosmetic changes such as painting,
cleaning and the like. When the term ALTERATION is applied to a change of use,
it is intended to be applied to changes of use from 1 business, trade,
occupation or use to another, or from 1 division of trade or use to another.
      ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION. The placement of construction materials in a
permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation, or
demolition or removal of an existing structure has substantially begun
preparatory to rebuilding, the excavation or demolition or removal shall be
deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be carried on
diligently.

casualty or natural disaster, or be subject to the provisions of division (F)
below.
      (2)   In any other circumstance, the alteration, restoration or
replacement of a non-conforming use or structure pursuant to this section may
be authorized by the Department, subject to the Type A application procedure
set forth in
§ 154.075, and provided that the applicant demonstrates that the proposal
satisfies the following criteria:
         (a)   The alteration of use would result in a reduction in non-
conformity of the use, or would have no greater adverse impact on the
surrounding area than the existing non-conforming uses or than those uses
permitted by this chapter.
         (b)   The alterations of structures or physical improvements would
result in a reduction in non-conformity of the structures or improvements or
would have no greater adverse impact on the surrounding area than existing non-
conforming structures or physical improvements or than those permitted by this
chapter.
         (c)   A request to verify that a use or structure is legally non-
conforming pursuant to this section may be approved by the Department, subject
to the Type A application procedure set forth in
§ 154.075, and provided that the applicant submits evidence of the following:
            1   The nature and extent of the use for at least 10 years from the
adoption of this chapter prior to the date of application for verification of
non-conformity;
            2   The use or structure was in existence at least 10 years prior
to the date the application for verification of non-conformity is submitted;
and
            3   The use has continued uninterrupted, or the structure has been
occupied continuously, for at least 10 years prior to the date the application
for verification of non-conformity is submitted.
   (D)   Conditions of approval. In approving the alteration, restoration or
replacement of a non- conforming use, the decision-making body may impose
conditions as it deems appropriate to ensure that the intent of this section is
carried out. These conditions shall be reasonably related to the criteria set
forth in division (C) above.
   (E)   General requirements. Authorization of any alteration, restoration or
replacement of a non-conforming use or structure pursuant to this chapter shall
be subject to the following additional requirements:
      (1)   Any approval issued hereunder is not personal to the applicant and
shall be deemed to run with the land.
      (2)   Building permits issued in connection with any part of an approved
alteration, replacement or restoration of a non-conforming use shall be issued
only on the basis of the approved plan.
      (3)   Any proposed changes in connection with an approved plan shall be
processed as a new application subject to the provisions of this section and in
accordance with the applicable application procedure set forth in
§§ 154.075 et seq.
      (4)   Any alteration, replacement or restoration of a non-conforming use
approved hereunder shall be null and void 1 year from the date it is granted
unless completion or substantial construction has taken place. The Department
may extend the approval for an additional period not to exceed 1 year upon
receipt of the applicable fee and a written request from the applicant
demonstrating good cause for the delay and provided that the request to extend
approval is received by the Department prior to expiration of the original
approval.

conforming use.
      (1)   (a)   A change of ownership or occupancy of a non-conforming use
shall be permitted. If any non-conforming use is discontinued for a period of 6
months time, the non-conforming use shall not be resumed and any subsequent use
of the property and structure involved shall conform to the requirements of
this chapter.
         (b)   The change of any non-conforming use to a permitted use shall
constitute discontinuance of the non-conforming use.
      (2)   If the non-conforming use is primarily an agricultural, farm or
ranching use and the non-conforming use is discontinued for a period of 2
years, the non-conforming use shall not be resumed and any subsequent use of
the property and structure involved shall conform to the requirements of this
chapter.
      (3)   A stay ordered by a bankruptcy court of competent jurisdiction over
the property interest pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code,
as the same may be amended from time to time, shall operate to stop the time
under division (F)(1) and (2) above of this chapter if the time under this
section does not begin to accrue prior to the order of stay.
   (G)   Changes in certain non-conforming uses subject to conditional use
permit.
      (1)   Any non-conforming use or structure which is allowed as a
conditional use in the particular zoning district under the terms of this
chapter shall be allowed to continue; however, no alteration, restoration or
replacement of a use or structure shall be permitted unless the appropriate
conditional use permit is first obtained.
      (2)   Upon approval of a conditional use permit, the use shall no longer
be considered a non-conforming use, but shall be considered a conforming
conditional use subject to any and all conditions of approval. In the event
that a conditional use application is denied, the use shall revert to non-
conforming use status, and may be continued as it existed before the
application was made.
   (H)   Compliance with conditions.
      (1)   Compliance with conditions imposed in granting a permit for
alteration, restoration or replacement of a non-conforming use and adherence to
the approved site plan shall be required
      (2)   Any departure from these conditions of approval and approved plans

prepared promptly by the Commission and shall be included with the minutes of
the meeting of the Commission at which the decision was made.
      (5)   Changes to the applicable zoning maps shall be made and become
effective upon filing of record the changed map with the County Clerk.

availability of utilities and services likely to be needed by the anticipated
uses in the proposed district; and
      (3)   The proposed change enhances the county's protection of the public
health, safety and welfare of Valencia County.
   (D)   Review criteria for changes from or to lot sizes of AP zone. A quasi-

County, as well as to ensure that all public-use airports in Valencia County
can function in a safe, effective and efficient manner. Therefore, it is deemed
necessary to regulate uses of land within or near the traffic patterns of
airports through regulation of height of structures and objects of natural
growth, and through regulation of land uses within noise impacted areas and
runway protection zone areas.

waste disposal site include sites where manures and crop residues are returned
to the soil as fertilizer or soil conditioner.
   (C)   Establishment of encroachment zones.
      (1)   Three airport overlay zones are created for public use airports in
the geographical jurisdiction of Valencia County. The location of these overlay
zones relative to public use airports are established by this section and shall
apply to any public use airport(s) that may be established within Valencia
County after adoption of this section. All development plans and objects of
natural growth controllable by property owners within these zones shall comply
with these airport zoning regulations in addition to compliance with all
applicable underlying zoning district requirements as referenced in the
county's zoning and land development regulations. The 3 overlay zones are:
         (a)   Airport Height Notification Zone (Sub Zone A and Sub Zone B).
The Airport Height Notification Zone is hereby established as an overlay on the
adopted county zoning maps. This zone is established to regulate the height of
structures and natural vegetation for areas in proximity to all public use
airports located within Valencia County, New Mexico. The Airport Height
Notification Zones consists of 2 sub zones, defined as follows:
            1.   Sub Zone A: The area surrounding each public use airport
extending outward 20,000 feet from the ends and each side of all active
runways.
            2.   Sub Zone B: That area within the unincorporated area of the
county not within the Airport Height Notification Sub Zone A.
         (b)   Airport Runway Protection Zone. There is hereby created and
established, as an overlay zone on the adopted county zoning maps, an Airport
Runway Protection Zone for areas at each end of every active runway at all
public use airports within Valencia County. The Airport Runway Protection Zone
shall be configured consistent with its definition in division (B) of this
section. Within a Runway Protection Zone, certain uses shall be restricted or
prohibited to reduce incompatibilities between normal airport operations and
public health and safety.
         (c)   Airport Noise Impact Zone. There is hereby created and
established as an overlay zone on the adopted county zoning maps an Airport
Noise Impact Zone for areas surrounding all public use airports within Valencia
County. The Noise Zone is an area in which uses are restricted and special
construction standards are to be used to minimize the impact of airport
generated noise routinely produced by continuation of normal airport
operations. The AIRPORT NOISE IMPACT ZONE is defined as follows:
            1.   An area surrounding each public use airport extending outward
from the ends and each side of all active runways to a distance 1/2 the length
of the longest active runway centerline.
            2.   Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, should any
public use airport conduct an official 14 CFR Part 150 (1984) study, the
boundaries of that Airport's Noise Impact Zone shall be modified to comply with
the official noise study, subject to amendment of the official zoning map as
addressed in the county zoning regulations.
      (2)   Where a zone of influence overlays a portion of the property, only
that portion within the zone shall be affected by the zone regulations.
Furthermore, in relation to applying protection zone and noise impact zone
requirements, use regulations shall apply to the structure or facilities
constituting the use and shall not generally apply to accessory open space,
landscape and buffering, storm water management, or driveway and parking uses.
   (D)   Airport Height Notification Zone regulations. The Airport Height
Notification Zone regulations apply only to potential airport obstructions, as
defined herein. Any proposed development which is not determined by be a
potential airport obstruction is exempt from any Airport Height Notification
Zone permitting regulations contained herein.
      (1)   Potential airport obstruction definition. A proposed development
shall be determined to be a POTENTIAL AIRPORT OBSTRUCTION  if the proposed
development would result in any structure having a height or natural vegetation
having a potential, long-term height greater than an imaginary surface
extending outward from the ends and sides of a public use airport active runway
at a slope of 1 foot vertically from airport elevation for each 100 feet
horizontally, outward to 20,000 feet horizontally (200 feet vertically) for Sub
Zone A, or 200 feet above ground level (AGL) for Sub Zone B. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any proposed structure that would otherwise be a potential
airport obstruction is not considered a potential airport obstruction if it is
shielded by an existing structure, is an antenna structure of 20 feet or less
in height, or is otherwise exempt from notice pursuant to 14 CFR 77.15 (April
1, 1971). Further, notwithstanding the foregoing, any provision of this section
regulating or restricting or otherwise applying to the growth of natural
vegetationshall only apply within the Airport Runway Protection Zone, as
defined in this section.
      (2)   Notice. Applicants for any development proposal determined by the
county to result in a structure(s) that constitutes a potential airport
obstruction shall be issued a notice of potential airport obstruction during
the development proposal review process by the Code Enforcement Department.
Further, all potential airport obstructions shall be forwarded to the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) to the applicant to be reviewed for conformance
to the obstruction standards detailed in Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations,
Part 77, Subpart C (14 CFR Part 77) (1971), and as described in the Federal
Aviation Administration Advisory Circular AC 70/7460-2K (March 1, 2000).
      (3)   Permit required. No proposed development shall be approved for
construction and no building permit shall be issued for a proposal to construct
any structure which is determined by the county to be a potential airport
obstruction unless an airport construction permit has been granted. Further,
all potential airport obstructions shall be forwarded to the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) to be reviewed in conformance to the obstruction standards
detailed in Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 77, Subpart C (14 CFR
Part 77).
      (4)   Procedures for obtaining an airport construction permit. Applicants
shall submit to the Code Enforcement Department a complete airport construction
permit application form (as provided by the Code Enforcement Department) and a
copy of the notice of proposed construction form submitted to the FAA for the
project. Prior to permit requests being considered for approval, applicants
shall submit to the Code Enforcement Department the final determination issued
by the FAA based on its review of the applicant's notice of proposed
construction submitted in accordance with 14 CFR Part 77 (1971). The review
process shall follow the Type A application procedure set forth in §
154.075.
      (5)   Criteria for granting an airport construction permit.
         (a)   Where the FAA has reviewed the proposed development and
determined its construction would not exceed an obstruction standard of 14 CFR
Part 77 (1971), the Code Enforcement Department shall grant an airport
construction permit for the proposed development; provided that a condition is
attached to the permit approval to ensure that the approved structure(s) is
marked and lighted as soon as the obstruction height is exceeded and prior to
the issuance of a certificate of occupancy (CO), and in accordance with the
standards of Rules of the Federal Department of Transportation and the Federal
Aviation Administration Advisory Circular No. 70/7460-1 (April 15, 2000).
         (b)   Where the FAA has reviewed a proposed development and determined
that the proposed development exceeds the obstruction standards of 14 CFR Part
77, no airport construction permit may be approved, and a Valencia County
airport obstruction variance must be obtained by the applicant for the proposed
development to proceed.
      (6)   Airport obstruction variance. An airport obstruction variance may
be granted pursuant to the Type C review procedures set forth in §
154.077, and as provided below.
         (a)   The applicant shall submit an application on a form approved by
the Code Enforcement Department, and shall also submit:
            1.   A copy of the proposed construction form submitted to the FAA
including aerial photography of the site as required,
            2.   A final determination issued by the FAA based on its review of
the applicant's notice of proposed construction submitted in accordance with 14
CFR Part 77 (1971), and
            3.   A valid aeronautical evaluation (may consist of the evaluation
performed by the FAA).
         (b)   An airport obstruction variance may be granted if the Board of
County Commissioners determine that a literal enforcement of the regulations
would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and where the
relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest or aircraft safety
(i.e., the development can be accommodated in navigable airspace without
adverse impact on the county's public use airports or operations) but would do
substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of applicable state
statutes.
         (c)   A condition shall be attached to all airport obstruction
variance approvals to require that the approved structure(s) is marked and
lighted to indicate to aircraft pilots the presence of an obstruction in
accordance with the standards of FAA Advisory Circular Number 70/7460-1 (April
15, 2000). Where such marking or lighting is required, such requirement shall
be satisfied as soon as the obstruction height exceeded and prior to issuance
of a certificate of occupancy (CO) for the affected structure.
         (d)   No airport obstruction variance shall be approved unless the FAA
determines that the aeronautical evaluations submitted are valid and that
safety of flight operations will not be adversely affected.
         (e)   Further consideration shall be given to:
            1.   The nature of the terrain and the height of existing
structures,
            2.   Public and private interests and investments,
            3.   The character of flying operations and planned development of
airports,
            4.   FAA designated federal airways,
            5.   Whether construction of the proposed structure would cause an
increase in the minimum decent altitude or decision height at the affected
airport,
            6.   Technological advances,
            7.   The safety of persons on the ground and in the air,
            8.   Land use density,
            9.   The safe and efficient use of navigable airspace,
            10.   The cumulative effects on navigable airspace of all
structures or proposed structures identified in the applicable jurisdiction's
comprehensive plans, and all other known proposed structure in the area,
            11.   FAA determinations and results of aeronautical studies
conducted by or for the FAA,
            12.   Comments and recommendations from local airport authorities
and users, and
            13.   Other testimony and findings of aviation operations and
safety experts.
         (f)   Conflicting criteria for variances in existing or future
Valencia County zoning regulations shall not be applicable to airport
obstruction variance requests. Criteria in other Valencia County zoning
regulations that do not conflict, however, are applicable to review of airport
obstruction variance requests.
   (E)   Airport Runway Protection Zone regulations. The following types of
uses shall be prohibited within the Runway Protection Zone:
      (1)   Educational centers (including, but not limited to, all types of
primary and secondary schools, pre-schools, child care facilities),

large numbers of people may congregate (e.g., not a golf course),
      (5)   Commercial businesses that constitute a potential hazard
(including, but not limited to, gasoline service stations, restaurants,
chemical warehouses or storage facilities, etc.), and
      (6)   Any use not permitted in the underlying zone designation, or any
use which, in the judgment of the Code Enforcement Department, constitutes an
added hazard to people on the ground in case of an accident or incident
involving normal aircraft movement or operation.
   (F)   Air Noise Impact Zone. Provisions of this division shall apply to
construction, alteration, moving, repair and use of any building or structure
for the uses specified below and located within the Airport Noise Impact Zones.
The following uses located within an Airport Noise Impact Zone, unless
prohibited by any other zoning district regulations, shall comply with the
applicable criteria described below:
      (1)   Developers of child care facilities, transient lodgings,
educational centers, and residential uses shall verify to the county in writing
that the proposed buildings are designed to achieve an outdoor to indoor noise
level reduction (NLR) of at least 25 decibels. Normal residential construction
can be expected to provide an NLR of 20 to 25 decibels.
      (2)   Developers of hospitals, homes for the aged, places of worship,
auditoriums and concert halls shall verify to the county in writing that the
proposed buildings are designed to achieve an outdoor to indoor noise level
reduction (NLR) of at least 25 decibels.

is designed for an NLR of 25 decibels as stated in this division (F), a
developer may execute and record an aviation easement as provided below.
      (5)   An AVIATION EASEMENT  is a legal document that grants to the owner
or operator of a nearby airport a right to continue to operate the airport in a
manner similar to current operations, despite potential nuisance effects upon
uses that are being established in close proximity to the airport. Applicants
choosing to provide an aviation easement shall execute the easement to the
appropriate airport authority. The easement shall be in a form acceptable to
the county attorney's office and shall be executed in a recordable form prior
to the release of a development site plan, prior to or via recording of a final
plat, or prior to issuance of a building permit, as applicable.
      (6)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, no land is required to meet the
requirements of this division (F) if the self-generated noise from that use and
/or the ambient noise from other nonaircraft and nonairport uses is equal to or
greater than the noise from aircraft and airport sources.
   (G)   Special requirements applicable throughout the unincorporated area of
the county.
      (1)   Purpose. Notwithstanding any other provision of this overlay
district, no use may be made of land or water within the unincorporated areas

February 16, 2006), and be consistent with state statutes, as may be applied
and enforced by state or federal law.
   (H)   Nonconforming Uses. The regulations prescribed herein shall not be
construed to require removal, lowering, or other change to or alteration of any
structure or natural vegetation not currently conforming to the regulations as
of the effective date of this section, or to otherwise interfere with
continuance of any nonconforming use. However, no pre-existing, nonconforming
structure, natural vegetation, or use shall be replaced, rebuilt, altered, or
allowed to grow higher, or to be replanted, so as to constitute an increase in
the degree of nonconformity with regard to these regulations. Nothing contained
herein shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended
use of any structure, where the construction or alteration began prior to the
effective date of this section and is completed within 1 year thereafter. Any
existing, non-conforming use that is terminated after the date of this section
is enacted shall conform to this section unless the existing, non-conforming
use is re-established within 1 year after it is terminated. Nothing in this
section shall permit any existing, non-conforming use to be re-established to a

that compatibility and allow both to proceed.
      (2)   Natural Resource Overlay Zone continues during life of production.
Where a NROZ has been created and from a subterranean source the applicant or
project owner of the NROZ has drilled a productive well or wells on the NROZ,
the NROZ shall not terminate or be terminated during the life of production
from the well or wells. The NROZ shall continue in existence so long as
production from the NROZ continues. Further, the temporary cessation of
production from an NROZ shall not cause the termination of the NROZ so long as
the applicant or project owner is, in good faith, seeking to reestablish
production.
      (3)   Ownership.
         (a)   The land proposed for the NROZ may be owned by multiple owners
if all parties with interests in such land execute the NROZ site plan
application. A NROZ shall not be approved unless the applicant(s) has/have
acquired actual ownership or executed a longterm lease (10 years or more) for
all the property composing the proposed NROZ. However, where the natural
resources to be developed are subterranean, as in the case of oil, natural gas,
hydrogen, or geothermal resources, the applicant must show surface ownership,
or control by lease, of the proposed initial surface drill site or sites and
ownership or lease of at least 50% of the minerals within the proposed NROZ
area together with a plan to acquire the right to drill and produce the natural
resource or resources from the spacing unit or units associated with the
initial proposed drill site or sites within the NROZ by utilization of the
State's Pooling statute, NMSA 1978, §70-2-17 and/or related regulations and/or
the further lease or purchase of minerals. Where the natural resource to be
developed is a subterranean resource, a lease need not be 10 years, but it must
contain a lease provision continuing the lease during the life of production
produced from the lease.
         (b)   For purposes of this section, project owner or owners, or any
assignee of the project owner or owners for all or any portion of the Natural

maintained by the applicant in a manner as to eliminate, as far as practical,
noise or dust that adversely affects persons living in the vicinity, or crops
or livestock being raised in the vicinity.
         (b)   Approval of road routes shall be based on the following
criteria:
            1.   The applicant presents evidence demonstrating roads, bridges
and culverts on the routes to and from the proposed facility are able to
support the projected loadings;
            2.   Management techniques used to protect against noise, odor,
dust, litter, and dangerous or hazardous conditions on the proposed routes are
mitigated to the maximum extent available;
            3.   Acceptable load limits placed on local roads are not, or will

            4.   Based upon weight bearing capacities of any access roads on
any of the proposed routes, the county determines that improvements to the
roads designated as routes must be made by the applicant before the proposed
use of the route begins.
      (9)   Site operation and safety.
         (a)   All excavation, processing and stockpiling of mineral resources
shall take place under conditions which will provide for the reclamation of the
site for future uses and will protect the safety of the public.

      (10)   Conflicts/repeal.
         (a)   Ordinance 2022-03 is expressly repealed. If there is a conflict
between the requirements or provisions of this section and those of any other
part of the Interim Comprehensive Zoning Chapter of Valencia County, the
requirements or provisions of this section shall govern and supersede any of
those of any other part of
Chapter 154.
         (b)   If there is a conflict between the state law and/or regulations
regarding subterranean resources (including but not limited to oil and gas) and
the Interim Comprehensive Zoning Chapter of Valencia County (
Chapter 154), then such state law and/or regulations shall govern and supersede
any such requirement or provision of
Chapter 154.
      (11)   Spacing and proration units. Pursuant to the New Mexico Oil and
Gas Act (Chapter 70, Article 2 NMSA 1978) and its regulations the size of
spacing units have been determined for vertical and horizontal oil and gas
wells. A portion of such spacing unit may lie outside of the boundary of the
NROZ but any drilling and/or completion of such well must occur only within the
boundary of the NROZ.
      (12)   Infill and water disposal wells. If the natural resource being
developed is subterranean and state law and/or regulations authorize the
drilling of water disposal wells or field infill wells necessary to develop the
subterranean natural resource, this provision shall accommodate that drilling.
   (G)   Reclamation. As an express condition of the grant of the NROZ, the
applicant agrees to the following:
      (1)   If the applicant ceases operation of the Natural Resources Project
or begins, but does not complete, construction of the project, the applicant
shall restore and/or reclaim the site according to the reclamation plan. A
temporary shutdown of the Natural Resources Project for up to 1 year, shut-in
well(s), a temporary abandonment of any well(s) or a temporary cessation of
production will not initiate this provision.
      (2)   At the time of issuance of application for the construction of the
Natural Resources Project, the owner shall provide financial security in the
form and amount acceptable to Valencia County to secure the expenses of
dismantling and removing structures and to reclaim the parcel, and enter into a
performance agreement with the county for any improvements required pursuant to
the project. A project owner is required to notify Valencia County immediately
upon cessation or abandonment of the operation. The owner shall have 12 months
in which to dismantle and remove the structures and equipment from the
property. A project owner may apply for a 90 day extension of the
decommissioning time, provided such application is made at least 60 days before
the end of the construction in decommissioning of the plant. However, where the
natural resource which was produced was a subterranean resource the drilling
for which and the extraction of which is governed by state law and/ or
regulations, the state law and/or regulations shall govern financial security
or assurance and site reclamation requirements and the plugging of wells and
shall supersede these provisions regarding reclamation. If that state law and/
or regulations required the owner to provide to the state a plugging bond
covering the plugging of the well or wells and remediation of the drill site or
drill sites, the bonding provided by the owner to the state shall substitute
for the financial security required in this division.
      (3)   Any parcel or site used for a Natural Resources Project shall be
reclaimed in accordance with the site operation and reclamation plan on file
with and approved by the county.
      (4)   The approved reclamation plan shall be implemented in accordance
with the schedule contained therein showing the planned order and sequence of
the reclamation.
      (5)   The approved reclamation plan shall require all excavations to be
backfilled, contoured or terraced or put to a use shown on the reclamation plan
which is compatible with the final depth and slopes within the excavation site.
      (6)   The approved reclamation plan shall require topsoil be saved and
stored in a manner as to prevent erosion, and that the topsoil shall be
replaced to at least the depth of the original overburden, or to a depth
adequate to achieve the approved reclamation use.
      (7)   The approved reclamation plan may, in the county's discretion,
provide for reclamation of portions of the site prior to total exhaustion of
the resource found on the site.
