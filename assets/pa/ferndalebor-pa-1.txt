or provision shall itself be repealed, such repeal shall not be construed to
revive such former Code Section, ordinance, clause or provision, unless it
shall be expressly so provided.
   3.   Saving Clause. The provisions of this Code, so far as they are the same
as those ordinances and regulations in force immediately prior to the adoption
of this Code, are intended as a continuation of such ordinances, resolutions
and regulations and not as a new enactment. The provisions of this Code shall
not affect any suit or prosecution pending or to be instituted to enforce any
of the prior ordinances or regulations. Except as specifically stated in this
Code or in the ordinance adopting this consolidation, codification and revision
of the ordinances and regulations, it is the intention of the Borough Council
that no ordinance or regulation of the Borough be amended, revised or repealed
by implication.
   4.   Resolutions. The provisions of this Code of Ordinances may contain
resolutions, that is, actions of the Borough Council (in written form and
designated "resolution”) which did not require prior public notice in
accordance with the provisions of the Borough Code, 8 Pa.C.S.A. § 101 et seq.,
at the time of their passage by the Borough Council. Such "resolutions” are
included herein for ease of reference and the Borough Council does not intend
by their inclusion herein to require prior public notice before amending,
revising or repealing such resolution or resolutions as may have been included
herein in the future. It is the intention of the Borough Council that such
actions of the Borough Council that may be included in this Code and
specifically cited and designated as a resolution shall not become an ordinance
(requiring prior public notice before amendment, revision or repeal) by the
simple fact of inclusion in this Code.
(Ord. 489, 10/13/2014)
§ 1-107.   Normal Numbering.
   1.   Chapters. Chapters are numbered sequentially in Arabic throughout this
Code.
   2.   Parts. Parts are numbered sequentially in Arabic throughout this Code.
   3.   Whenever other divisions are necessary, Chapters shall be divided into
Subchapters, Parts into Subparts and designated with the Chapter or Part number
followed by a capital letter. For instance, Chapter 1 may be divided into
Subchapters 1A and 1B.
   4.   Sections. Sections are numbered sequentially throughout a Chapter and a
Part such that the first number or numbers is the Chapter number, followed by a
hyphen, followed by the Part number, followed by the Section number within the
Part. For example, "§ 1-101" designates Chapter 1, Part 1, Section 1.
Similarly, “§ 27-305" designates Chapter 27, Part 3, Section 5.
   5.   Internal Divisions of Sections. Whenever internal divisions are
necessary, Sections shall be divided into Subsections, Subsections into
Paragraphs, Paragraphs into Subparagraphs, Subparagraphs into Clauses, and
Clauses into Subclauses, and Subclauses into Items, designated as follows:
   1.   Subsection.
   A.   Paragraph.
   (1)   Subparagraph.
   (a)   Clause.
   1)   Subclause.
   a)   Item.

§ 1-108.   Special Numbering Problems.
   1.   Addition of New Units Between Existing Units. If it becomes necessary
to introduce a new Chapter, Part or Section between existing Chapters, Parts or
Sections, the new Chapter, Part or Section shall be designated by the addition
of a capital letter suffix to the preceding Chapter, Part or Section number.
Thus, a Chapter introduced between Chapters 5 and 6 would be Chapter 5A and
Sections in that Chapter would be numbered, for instance, “§ 5A-101.” If it
becomes necessary to introduce a Part between existing Parts 5 and 6 the new
Part would be Part 5A and Sections in that Part would be numbered, for
instance, “§ 5-5A01.” A new Section introduced between existing Sections 5 and
6 would be “§ 5-105A.” When a number of new Parts or Sections have been
introduced the Chapter or Part shall be renumbered.
   2.   If it becomes necessary to introduce a Subsection between Subsections,
for instance, Subsections .5 and .6, the new Subsection would be numbered
Subsection .5-A.
   3.   If it becomes necessary to introduce a unit smaller than a Subsection
between existing units, the entire Subsection shall be revised and renumbered.
   4.   Vacated Numbers. Whenever a number is vacated by a revocation or
repeal, the remaining elements in the overall unit shall retain their old
numbers until the overall unit is completely revised. Prior to revision, the
vacated number may be marked: “[Reserved].”
(Ord. 489, 10/13/2014)
§ 1-109.   Amending Code.
   1.   All ordinances passed subsequent to the adoption of this Code which
amend, repeal or in any way affect this Code shall be numbered in accordance
with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion herein. In the
case of repealed Chapters, Parts, Sections, Paragraphs, Clauses or other part
or provision hereof, by subsequent ordinance, such repealed portions may be
excluded from this Code by omission from reprinted pages affected thereby. The
subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed, or omitted in the case of
repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such
time as this Code and subsequent ordinances omitted are readopted as a new Code
by the Borough Council.
   2.   Amendment to any provision of this Code shall be made by specific
reference to the Chapter, Part, Section and/or Subsection number of this Code
in the following language:
   A.   Amendment or Revision. "Chapter        , Part        , Section        ,
Subsection        , is hereby amended (revised) to read as follows . . . .” The
amended or revised provisions may then be set out in full as desired.
   B.   Addition. "Chapter        , Part        , Section        , Subsection
       , is hereby amended by the addition of the following . . . .” The new
provision shall then be set out in full as desired.
   C.   Repeal. "Chapter        , Part       , Section        , Subsection
       , is hereby repealed in its entirety.”
   3.   It is the intention of the Borough Council that the numbering scheme of
this Code be adhered to in enacting future ordinances. In the event that any
ordinance or other enactment be adopted which does not conform to the numbering
system of this Code, it is the intention of the Borough Council that such
enactment be renumbered in the process of supplementing, revising or updating
this Code to conform to the numbering scheme of this Code. The Borough Council
hereby acknowledges and confirms that the numbering scheme herein is for ease
of reference and that the renumbering of any enactment when added to this Code
shall not in any manner affect the validity of said enactment.
(Ord. 489, 10/13/2014)
§ 1-110.   Altering Code.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to change or amend by addition or
deletion any part or portion of this Code, or to insert or delete pages or
portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner
whatsoever, except by ordinance or resolution or other official act of the
Borough Council.
(Ord. 489, 10/13/2014)
§ 1-111.   Penalties.
   1.   Penalty Where No Penalty Provided. Whenever in this Code or in any
ordinance of the Borough any act is prohibited or is declared to be unlawful,
or whenever in this Code or other ordinance the doing of any act is declared to

ordinances adopting building, housing, property maintenance, health, fire or
public safety codes; and for ordinances regulating water services, water
pollution, air pollution and noise, the following penalty shall be provided:
   (1)   Any person, firm or corporation who shall violate any provision of
this Part, upon conviction thereof in an action brought before a magisterial
district judge in the manner provided for the enforcement of summary offenses
under the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, shall be sentenced to pay a
fine of not more than $1,000 plus costs and, in default of payment of said fine
and costs, to a term of imprisonment not to exceed 90 days. Each day that a
violation of this Part continues or each Section of this Part which shall be
found to have been violated shall constitute a separate offense.
   B.   Other Violations. All other penalties, except for penalties in Chapter
15, “Motor Vehicles and Traffic” (based on the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 101
et seq.), penalties and ordinances adopted under the authority of the
Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq., earned income tax

permitted the violation of the provisions of this Part, upon being found liable
therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the Township, shall pay
a judgment of not more than $600 plus all court costs and reasonable attorney
fees. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or payable until the
date of the determination of a violation by a magisterial district judge. If
the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the Township may
enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each
day that a violation continues or each Section of this Part which shall be
found to have been violated shall constitute a separate violation.
   2.   The imposition of a penalty under the provisions of this Code shall not
prevent the revocation of any permit or license or the taking of other punitive
or remedial action where called for or permitted under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the United States of America. In addition, the
Borough may institute injunctive, mandamus or any other appropriate action or
proceeding at law or in equity for the enforcement of this Code. Any court of
competent jurisdiction shall have the right to issue restraining orders,
temporary or permanent injunctions, mandamus, or other appropriate forms of

doing business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall pay a claim of a named
insured for fire damage to a structure located within the Borough where the
amount recoverable for the fire loss to the structure under all policies
exceeds $7,500, unless the insurer is furnished by the Borough Treasurer with a
certificate pursuant to 508(b) of the Insurance Company Law of 1921, as amended
by Act 98 of 1992 and Act 93 of 1994 (collectively, the "Act") and unless there

P.S. § 638.
   2.   Where there are delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties or user
charges against the property ("municipal claims"), or there are expenses which
the Borough has incurred as a cost for the removal, repair or securing of a
building or other structure on the property (collectively "municipal
expenses"), the Council President or such official’s designee of the Borough
shall immediately render a bill for such work, if he has not already done so.
Upon written request of the named insured specifying the tax description of the
property, the name and address of the insurer and the date of receipt by the
insurer of a loss report of the claim, the Treasurer shall furnish a
certificate within 14 working days after the request, to the insurer, a
certificate (or at his discretion an oral notice confirmed in writing) either:
   A.   Stating that there are no unpaid municipal claims or municipal expenses
against the property.
   B.   Specifying the nature and amount of such claims or expenses,
accompanied by a bill for such amounts.
   C.   Taxes, assessments, penalties and user charges shall be deemed
delinquent for this purpose if a lien could have been filed for such claims
under applicable law. Upon receipt of a certificate and bill pursuant to
subsection .1 of this Section, the insurer shall transfer to the Treasurer an
amount from the insurance proceeds sufficient to pay such sums prior to making
payment to the named insured, subject to the provisions of subsection .3
hereof.
   3.   When all municipal claims and municipal expenses have been paid
pursuant to subsection .2 of this Section, or where the Treasurer has issued a
certificate described in subsection .2.A indicating that there are no municipal
claims or municipal expenses against the property, the insurer shall pay the
claim of the named insured; provided, however, that if the loss agreed upon by
the named insured and the insurer equals or exceeds 60 percent of the aggregate
limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or structure,
the following procedures must be followed:
   A.   The insurer shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the
Treasurer, in the aggregate, $2,000 for each $15,000 of such claim or fraction
thereof.
   B.   If at the time a loss report is submitted by the insured, such insured
has submitted to the insurer, with a copy to the Borough, a contractor's signed
estimate of the cost of removing, repairing or securing the building or other
structure in an amount less than the amount calculated under the foregoing
transfer formula, the insurer shall transfer to the Treasurer from the
insurance proceeds the amount specified in the estimate. If there is more than
one insurer, the transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all
insurers insuring the building or other structure.
   C.   Upon receipt of the above described portion of the insurance proceeds,
the Treasurer shall do the following:
   (1)   Place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used solely as security
against the total municipal expenses anticipated by the Borough to be required
in removing, repairing or securing the building or structure as required by
this Part. Such costs shall include, without limitation, any engineering, legal
or administrative costs incurred by the Borough in connection with such
removal, repair or securing or any proceedings related thereto; and,

notice the proceeds have been received by the Borough and that the proce dures
under this subsection shall be followed.
   (3)   After the transfer, the named insured may submit to the Borough a
contractor's signed estimate of the cost of removing, repairing or securing the
building or other structure, in which event the Treasurer shall, if such
estimate is deemed by the Treasurer to be reasonable, return to the insured the
amount of the funds transferred to the Borough in excess of that required to
pay the municipal expenses; provided, the Borough has not commenced to remove,
repair or secure the building or other structure, in which case the Borough
will complete the work.
   (4)   Pay to the Council President or such official’s designee, for
reimburse ment to the Borough general fund, the amount of the municipal
expenses paid by the Borough.
   (5)   Pay the remaining balance in the fund (without interest) to the named
insured upon receipt of a certificate issued by the Council President or such
official’s designee that the repair, removal or securing of the building or
other structure has been completed in accordance with all applicable codes and
regulations of the Borough.
   (6)   Nothing in this Section shall be construed to limit the ability of the
Borough to recover any deficiency in the amount of municipal claims or
municipal expenses recovered pursuant to this Part, or to insurance proceeds,
by an action at law or in equity to enforce the codes of the Borough or to
enter into an agreement with the named insured with regard to such other dispo
sition of the proceeds as the Borough may deem responsible.

official an insured under a policy of insurance or to create an obligation to

   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage of
the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978, 32 P.S. § 679.101 et seq.,
delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain
management regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general
welfare of its citizenry. Therefore; the Council of the Borough of Ferndale
does hereby order as follows.
(Ord. 481, 5/14/2012, Art. I)
Part 2
General Provisions
§ 8-201.   Intent.
   The intent of this Chapter is to:
   A.   Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
   B.   Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in
order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
   C.   Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and natural
drainage.
   D.   Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units, and its residents, by preventing excessive development in areas subject
to flooding.
   E.   Comply with Federal and State floodplain management requirements.

or structures.
(Ord. 481, 5/14/2012, § 2.02)

   This Chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in

more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of
this Chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.

restricted by debris. This Chapter does not imply that areas outside any
identified floodplain areas, or that land uses permitted within such areas,
will be free from flooding or flood damages.

§ 8-401.   Identification.
   The identified floodplain area shall be:
   A.   Any area of Borough of Ferndale classified as special flood hazard
areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood
Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated, June 19, 2012, and issued by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof,
including all digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study.
   B.   Any community identified flood hazard areas.
   The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and
amendments, are hereby adopted by Borough of Ferndale and declared to be a part
of this Chapter.
(Ord. 481, 5/14/2012, § 4.01)
§ 8-402.   Description and Special Requirements of Identified Floodplain Areas.
   The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific
areas:
   A.   The Floodway Area/District identified as Floodway in the FIS which
represents the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must
be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively
increasing the water surface elevation by more than 1 foot at any point. This
term shall also include floodway areas which have been identified in other
available studies or sources of information for those special floodplain areas
where no floodway has been identified in the FIS.
   (1)   Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall not be
permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   (2)   No new construction or development shall be allowed, unless a permit
is obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection Regional Office.
   B.   The AE Area/District without floodway shall be those areas identified
as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which
base flood elevations have been provided in the FIS but no floodway has been
delineated.
   (1)   No permit shall be granted for any construction, development, use, or
activity within any AE Area/District without floodway unless it is demon
strated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development would not,
together with all other existing and anticipated development, increase the BFE
more than 1 foot at any point.
   C.   The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no 1 percent annual
chance flood elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and
floodway information from other Federal, State, or other acceptable source
shall be used when available. Where other acceptable information is not
available, the elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point
on the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site.
   In lieu of the above, the Borough may require the applicant to determine the
elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others
of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods
used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies,
analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow
a thorough technical review by the Borough.
   D.   Community identified flood hazard areas shall be those areas where
Borough of Ferndale has identified local flood hazard or ponding areas, as
delineated and adopted on a “Local Flood Hazard Map” using best available
topographic data and locally derived information such as flood of record,
historic high water marks, soils or approximate study methodologies.
   E.   The Shallow Flooding Area/ District shall be those areas identified as
Zones AO and AH on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject to
inundation by 1-percent-annual-chance shallow flooding where average depths are
between 1 and 3 feet. In zones AO and AH, drainage paths shall be established
to guide floodwaters around and away from structures on slopes.
(Ord. 481, 5/14/2012, § 4.02)
§ 8-403.   Changes in Identification of Area.
   The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Council
where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person documents
the need for such revision. However, prior to any such change, approval must be
obtained from the FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later
than 6 months after the date such information becomes available, a community
shall notify the FEMA of the changes by submitting technical or scientific
data.
(Ord. 481, 5/14/2012, § 4.03)
§ 8-404.   Boundary Disputes.
   Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Borough of Ferndale Planning
Commission and any party aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal
to the Zoning Hearing Board. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
(Ord. 481, 5/14/2012, § 4.04)
§ 8-405.   Jurisdictional Boundary Changes.
   Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other corporate
boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community shall review
flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary changes. The
community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in areas subject to
annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or exceed those in 44 CFR §
60.3.

improve ments to such existing parks, when such development is located in all,
or a designated portion of a floodplain.
   Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA)–an area in the floodplain subject to a one
percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on the
FIRM as Zone A, AO, Al-A30, AE, A99, or, AH.
   Start of construction–includes substantial improvement and other proposed
new development and means the date the permit was issued, provided the actual
start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days from the date of the permit
and shall be completed within 12 months after the date of issuance of the
permit unless a time extension is granted, in writing, by the Floodplain
Administrator. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufacture home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first,
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   Structure–a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage
tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
   Subdivision–the division or redivision of a lot, tract, or parcel of land by
any means into two or more lots, tracts, parcels or other divisions of land
including changes in existing lot lines for the purpose, whether immediate or
future, of lease, partition by the court for distribution to heirs, or
devisees, transfer of ownership or building or lot development: Provided,
however, that the subdivision by lease of land for agricultural purposes into
parcels of more than ten acres, not involving any new street or easement of
access or any residential dwelling, shall be exempted.
   Substantial damage–damage from any cause sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50 percent or more of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
   Substantial improvement–any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction”
of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred
“substantial damage” or “repetitive loss” regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a
structure to correct existing violations of State or local health, sanitary, or
safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living
conditions.
   Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would
constitute a substantial improvement as defined in this Chapter, must comply
with all ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific ordinance
requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of
Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic places must be obtained from
the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any
exemption from ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
   Uniform Construction Code (UCC)–the statewide building code adopted by the
Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1999 applicable to new construction in all
municipalities whether administered by the municipality, a third party or the
Department of Labor and Industry. Applicable to residential and commercial
buildings, the Code adopted the International Residential Code (IRC) and the
International Building Code (IBC), by reference, as the construction standard
applicable with the State floodplain construction. For coordination purposes,
references to the above are made specifically to various sections of the IRC
and the IBC.
   Violation–the failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s flood plain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR § 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)
(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until
such time as that documentation is provided.

§ 13-101.   General Provisions.
   1.   Title. This Part shall be known and may be cited as the “Ferndale Cable
Communications Regulatory Ordinance.”
   2.   Effective Date. This Part shall take effect and be in force from and
after passage. All prior ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict with the
provisions of this Part are hereby repealed.
   3.   Purpose.
   A.   The Borough of Ferndale (the “Municipality”) finds that the further
development of cable communications may result in great benefits for the people
of the Municipality. Because of the complex and rapidly changing technology
associated with cable communications, the Municipality further finds that the
public convenience, safety and general welfare can best be served by
establishing certain regulatory procedures and powers that are vested in the
Municipality or such persons or agencies as the Municipality shall designate.
Any franchise issued pursuant to this Part shall be deemed to include this
finding as an integral part thereof.
   B.   Further, it is recognized that cable systems have the capacity to
provide not only entertainment and information services to the Municipality’s
residents, but can provide a variety of broadband, interactive communications
services to institutions and individuals. Many of these services involve
municipal agencies and other public institutions.
   C.   For these purposes, the following goals, among others, underlie the
regulations contained herein:
   (1)   Cable services should be provided to the maximum number of municipal
residents.
   (2)   Cable systems should be capable of accommodating both the present and
reasonably foreseeable future cable-related needs of the Municipality.
   (3)   A cable system should be improved and upgraded expeditiously during
the term of a franchise so that new facilities necessary for the operation of
the system may be integrated to the maximum extent possible with existing
facilities, subject to public demand and economic and technical feasibility.
   (4)   Cable systems authorized by this Part shall be responsive to the needs
and interests of the local community, and shall provide the widest possible
diversity of information sources and service to the public.

   1.   Grant.
   A.   The Municipality may grant one or more franchises, and each such

provide the cable services regulated by the provisions of this Part and the

granted by the Municipality. No person may be granted a franchise without
having entered into a franchise agreement with the Municipality pursuant to
this Part.
   2.   Franchise Characteristics. A franchise authorizes use of public rights-
of-way for installing cables, wires, lines, optical fibers, underground
conduit, and other devices necessary and appurtenant to the operation of a
cable system within a franchise area, but does not expressly or implicitly
authorize a franchisee to provide service to, or install a cable system on,
private property without owner consent (except for use of compatible easements
pursuant to § 621 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 541(a)(2)), or to use publicly
or privately owned conduits without a separate agreement with the owners.
   3.   Acceptance of Franchise.

applicable Federal, State, and local laws. A franchisee shall at all times be
subject to all lawful exercise of the police power of the Municipality
including all rights the Municipality may have under 47 U.S.C. § 552. Nothing
in a franchise agreement shall be deemed to waive the requirements of the
various codes and ordinances of the Municipality regarding permits, fees to be
paid, or manner of construction.
   B.   No course of dealing between a franchisee and the Municipality, or any
delay on the part of the Municipality in exercising any rights hereunder, or
any acquiescence by the Municipality in the actions of a franchisee which are
in contravention of such rights, except to the extent such rights are preempted
by Federal or State law, or are expressly waived by the Municipality, or are
expressly provided for in a franchise agreement, shall operate as a waiver of
any such rights of the Municipality.
   C.   The Municipality shall have the maximum authority to regulate cable
systems, franchisees, and franchises as may now or hereafter be lawfully
permissible; except where rights are expressly waived by a franchise agreement,
or preempted by Federal or State laws, rules or regulations, they are reserved,

operating or constructing a cable system and who does not hold a valid
franchise from the Municipality shall be subject to all provisions of this Part
including, but not limited to, its provisions regarding construction and
technical standards and franchise fees. In its discretion, the Municipality at
any time may require such person to apply for a franchise within 30 days of
receipt of a written notice by the Municipality that a franchise agreement is
required; require such person to remove its property and restore the area to a
condition satisfactory to the Municipality within a reasonable time period, as
the Municipality shall determine; remove the property itself and restore the
area to a satisfactory condition and charge the person the costs therefor; and/
or take any other action it is entitled to take under applicable law, including
filing for and seeking damages under trespass. In no event shall a franchise be
created unless it is issued by action of the Municipality and subject to a
written franchise agreement.
   7.   Acts at Franchisee’s Expense. Subject to applicable Federal or State
law, any act that a Franchisee is required to perform under this Part, a
franchise agreement, or applicable law shall be performed at the franchisee’s
expense, unless expressly provided to the contrary in this Part, the franchise
agreement, or applicable law.

or affect, in any way or to any extent, the Municipality’s rights of eminent
domain to the extent to which they may apply to any public utility or cable
system.
(Ord. 453, 8/12/1996, § 3)
§ 13-104.   Applications for Grant, Renewal or Modification of Franchises.
   1.   Written Application.
   A.   A written application shall be filed with the Municipality for grant of
an initial franchise or modification of a franchise agreement, in accordance
with applicable law.
   B.   To be acceptable for filing, a signed original of the application shall
be submitted together with 12 copies. The application must be accompanied by
any required application filing fee as set forth in subsection .6, conform to
any applicable request for proposals, and contain all required information. All
applications shall include the names and addresses of persons authorized to act
on behalf of the applicant with respect to the application.
   C.   All applications accepted for filing shall be made available by the
Municipality for public inspection.
   2.   Application for Grant of an Initial Franchise.
   A.   A person may apply for an initial franchise by submitting a request for
issuance of a request for proposals (“RFP”) by the Municipality. Upon receipt
of a request for an RFP, the Municipality shall, if necessary, commence a
proceeding to identify the future cable-related needs and interests of the
community and, upon completion of that proceeding, shall promptly issue an RFP,
which shall be mailed to the person requesting its issuance and made available
to any other interested party.
   B.   The applicant shall respond to the RFP by filing an application within
the time directed by the Municipality, providing the information and material
set forth in subsection .4. The procedures, instructions, and requirements set
forth in the RFP shall be followed by each applicant. The Municipality or its
designee may seek additional information from any applicant and establish
deadlines for the submission of such information.
   C.   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections .2.A and .2.B, a person
may apply for an initial franchise by submitting an unsolicited application
containing the information required in subsection .4 and requesting an
evaluation of that application pursuant to subsection .2.D. Prior to evaluating
that application, the Municipality may conduct such investigations as are
necessary to determine whether the application satisfies the standards set
forth in subsection .2.D and may seek additional applications.
   D.   In evaluating an application for a franchise, the Municipality shall
consider, among other things, the following factors:
   (1)   The extent to which the applicant has substantially complied with the
applicable law and the material terms of any existing cable franchise for any
municipality.
   (2)   Whether the quality of the applicant’s service under any existing
franchise in any municipality, including signal quality, response to customer
complaints, billing practices, and the like, has been reasonable in light of
the needs and interests of the communities served.
   (3)   Whether the applicant has the financial, technical, and legal
qualifications to provide cable service.
   (4)   Whether the application satisfies any minimum requirements established
by the Municipality and is otherwise reasonable to meet the future cable-
related needs and interests of the community, taking into account the cost of
meeting such needs and interests.
   (5)   Whether, to the extent not considered under subsection .2.D(4), the
applicant will provide adequate public, educational, and governmental access
channel capacity, facilities, or financial support.
   (6)   Whether issuance of a franchise is warranted in the public interest
considering the immediate and future effect on the public rights-of-way and
private property that would be used by the cable system, including the extent
to which installation or maintenance as planned would require replacement of
property or involve disruption of property, public services, or use of the
public rights-of-way; the effect of granting a franchise on the ability of
cable systems to meet the cable-related needs and interests of the community;
and the comparative superiority or inferiority of competing applications.
   (7)   What effects a grant of the application may have on competition in the
delivery of cable service in the Municipality.
   E.   If the Municipality finds that it is in the public interest to issue a
franchise considering the factors set forth above, and subject to the
applicant’s entry into an appropriate franchise agreement, it shall issue a
franchise. If the Municipality denies a franchise, it will issue a written
decision explaining why the franchise was denied. Prior to deciding whether or
not to issue a franchise, the Municipality may hold one or more public hearings
or implement other procedures under which comments from the public on an
application may be received. The Municipality also may grant or deny a request
for a franchise based on its review of an application without further
proceedings and may reject any application that is incomplete or fails to
respond to an RFP. This Part is not intended and shall not be interpreted to
grant any applicant or existing franchisee standing to challenge the issuance
of a franchise to another.
   3.   Application for Grant of a Renewal Franchise.
   A.   The renewal of any franchise to provide cable service shall be
conducted in a manner consistent with § 626 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546.
   B.   Subject to applicable law, the Municipality may delegate to the COG the
authority to carry out any or all renewal procedures.
   4.   Contents of Applications for an Initial Franchise. An RFP for the grant
of an initial franchise shall require, and any such application submitted shall
contain, at a minimum, the following information:
   A.   Name and address of the applicant and identification of the ownership
and control of the applicant, including the names and addresses of the 10
largest holders of an ownership interest in the applicant and affiliates of the
applicant, and all persons with 5 percent or more ownership interest in the
applicant and its affiliates; the persons who control the applicant and its
affiliates; all officers and directors of the applicant and its affiliates; and
any other business affiliation and cable system ownership interest of each
named person.
   B.   A demonstration of the applicant’s technical ability to construct and/
or operate the proposed cable system, including identification of key
personnel.
   C.   A demonstration of the applicant’s legal qualifications to construct
and/or operate the proposed cable system including, but not limited to, a
demonstration that the applicant meets the following criteria:
   (1)   The applicant must not have submitted an application for an initial or
renewal franchise to the Municipality, which was denied on the ground that the
applicant failed to propose a cable system meeting the future cable-related
needs and interests of the community, or as to which any challenges to such
franchising decision were finally resolved adversely to the applicant, within 3
years preceding the submission of the application.
   (2)   The applicant must not have had any cable television franchise validly
revoked by any franchising authority within 3 years preceding the submission of
the application.
   (3)   The applicant must have the necessary authority under Pennsylvania law
to operate a cable system.

hold the franchise and operate a cable system. An applicant must have, or show
that it is qualified to obtain, any necessary Federal franchises or waivers
required to operate the system proposed.
   (5)   The applicant shall not be issued a franchise if, at any time during
the 10 years preceding the submission of the application, the applicant was
convicted of any act or omission of such character that the applicant cannot be
relied upon to deal truthfully with the Municipality and the subscribers of the
cable system, or to substantially comply with its lawful obligations under
applicable law, including obligations under consumer protection laws and laws
prohibiting anticompetitive acts, fraud, racketeering, or other similar
conduct.
   (6)   The applicant shall not be issued a franchise if it filed materially
misleading information in its application or intentionally withheld information
that the applicant lawfully is required to provide.
   (7)   The applicant shall not be issued a franchise if an elected official
of the Municipality holds a controlling interest in the applicant or an
affiliate of the applicant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Municipality
shall provide an opportunity to an applicant to show that it would be
inappropriate to deny it a franchise by virtue of the particular circumstances
surrounding the matter and the steps taken by the applicant to cure all harms
flowing therefrom and prevent their recurrence, the lack of involvement of the
applicant’s principals, or the remoteness of the matter from the operation of
cable systems.
   D.   A statement prepared by a certified public accountant regarding the
applicant’s financial ability to complete the construction and operation of the
cable system proposed.
   E.   A description of the applicant’s prior experience in cable system

proposed cable system, including a description of the proposed franchise area’s
boundaries.

construction schedule; a description, where appropriate, of how services will
be converted from existing facilities to new facilities; and information on the
availability of space in conduits including, where appropriate, an estimate of
the cost of any necessary rearrangement of existing facilities.
   I.   The proposed rate structure, including projected charges for each
service, installation, converters, and all other proposed equipment or
services.
   J.   A demonstration of how the applicant will reasonably meet the future

how the applicant will meet the needs described in any recent community needs
assessment conducted by or for the Municipality, and how the applicant will
provide adequate public, educational, and governmental access channel capacity,
facilities, or financial support to meet the community’s needs and interests.
   K.   Pro forma financial projections for the proposed franchise term,
including a statement of projected income, and a schedule of planned capital

served by an existing cable franchisee, the identification of the area where

tion.

held in connection with the evaluation of its application and shall be given an
opportunity to be heard. In addition, prior to the issuance of a franchise, the
Municipality shall provide for the holding of a public hearing within the

every applicant and its application shall be examined and the public and all
interested parties afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard. Reasonable
notice to the public shall include causing notice of the time and place of such
hearing to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the proposed
franchise area once a week for 2 consecutive weeks. The first publication shall
be not less than 14 days before the day of the hearing.
(Ord. 453, 8/12/1996, § 4; as amended by Ord. 489, 10/13/2014)
§ 13-105.   Design and Construction.
   1.   System Construction Schedule. Franchise agreements shall specify the
construction schedule that will apply to any required construction, upgrade, or
rebuild of a cable system.
   2.   Construction Procedures.
   A.   A franchisee shall construct, operate and maintain a cable system
subject to the supervision of the Municipality or its designees, and in strict
compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations
affecting the system.
   B.   A system, and all parts thereof, shall be subject to the right of
periodic inspection by the Municipality.
   C.   No construction, reconstruction or relocation of a system or any part
thereof within the public rights-of-way shall be commenced until written
permits, where applicable, have been obtained from the proper Municipality
officials. Such permits shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and shall
be issued in accordance with applicable ordinances and codes of the
Municipality that apply to users of the Municipality’s public rights-of-way. In
any permit so issued, such officials may impose such nondiscriminatory
conditions and regulations as a condition of the granting of the permit as are
necessary for the purpose of protecting any structures in the public rights-of-
way and for the proper restoration of such public rights-of-way and structures,
and for the protection of the public and the continuity of pedestrian and
vehicular traffic.
   3.   Use of Public Property.
   A.   Should the grades or lines of the public rights-of-way that a
franchisee is authorized by franchise to use and occupy be changed at any time
during the term of a franchise, the franchisee shall, if necessary, relocate or
change its system so as to conform with the new grades or lines.
   B.   Any alteration to the water mains, sewerage or drainage system or to
any Municipality, State or other public structures in the public rights-of-way
that are required on account of the presence of a franchisee’s system in the
public rights-of- way shall be made at the sole cost and expense of the
franchisee. During any work of constructing, operating or maintaining of a
system, a franchisee shall also protect any and all existing structures
belonging to the Municipality and any other person. All work performed by the
franchisee shall be done in the manner prescribed by the Municipality or other
officials having jurisdiction therein.
   4.   Interference with Public Projects. Nothing in this Part or any
franchise agreement shall be in preference or hindrance to the right of the
Municipality and any board, authority, commission or public service corporation
to perform or carry on any public works or public improvements of any
description, and should a franchisee’s system in any way interfere with the
construction, maintenance or repair of such public works or public
improvements, a franchisee shall protect or relocate its system, or part
thereof, as reasonably directed by any Municipality official, board, authority,
commission or public service corporation.
(Ord. 453, 8/12/1996, § 5)
§ 13-106.   Consumer Protection.
   1.   General Provisions.
   A.   In addition to the provisions contained herein, a franchisee must
comply with the customer service obligations established by the FCC, as may be
amended from time to time, and which are set forth in current form in “Exhibit
13-1-B” and are incorporated herein by reference. In addition, a franchisee
shall at all times satisfy any additional or stricter requirements established
by a franchise agreement or other applicable law or regulation.
   B.   Nothing in this Part may be construed to prevent or prohibit the
Municipality from waiving, for good cause, requirements established in this
Section.
   2.   Installations, Connections, and Other Franchisee Services.
   A.   Standard Installations. Except as Federal rate regulations may
otherwise require, the franchisee shall not assess a subscriber any cost other
than a standard installation charge for service drops of 150 feet or less, for
a single outlet, unless the franchisee demonstrates to the Municipality’s
satisfaction that extraordinary circumstances justify a higher charge.
   B.   Nonstandard Installations. Except as applicable law may otherwise
require, where a drop exceeds 150 feet in length, a franchisee may charge a
subscriber for franchisee’s actual costs associated with installing the longer
drop, provided that drop length shall be the shorter of (1) the actual length
of the installed drop or (2) the shortest distance to the point where the
franchisee would be required to extend its distribution system. The
subscriber’s preference as to the point of entry into the residence shall be
observed whenever feasible. Runs in building interiors shall be as unobtrusive
as possible. The franchisee shall use due care in the process of installation
and shall repair any damage to the subscriber’s property caused by said
installation. Such restoration shall be undertaken within no more than 30 days
after the damage is incurred and shall be completed as soon as possible
thereafter.
   C.   Location of Drops. Except as Federal rate regulations may otherwise
require, in any area where a franchisee would be entitled to install a drop
above- ground, the franchisee will provide the homeowner the option, where
feasible, to have the drop installed underground if requested, but may charge
the homeowner the difference between the actual cost of the aboveground
installation and the actual cost of the underground installation.
   D.   Time for Extension. Except as a franchise agreement may otherwise
require, where a franchisee is required under this subsection to provide
service to a person, it must provide such service (1) within 30 days of the
person’s request if such person resides no further than 150 feet from the
franchisee’s distribution system; or (2) within 60 days if the person resides
more than 150 feet from the franchisee’s distribution system, provided the
person agrees to reimburse the franchisee for the cost of installing such
service in accordance with paragraph .B above; but the distribution system need
not be extended for ¼ mile or more to provide service.
   E.   Deposits. A franchisee may require a reasonable, nondiscriminatory
deposit on equipment provided to subscribers, in addition to any allowable
monthly rental fees. Any subscriber deposit required by franchisee shall bear
interest in accordance with applicable law or at the going rate, which shall be
not less than the prime rate of the bank being used by the Municipality for the
conduct of ordinary business. All deposits, with interest, shall be returned to
the subscriber within 6 months or when the equipment is returned at time of
disconnection of reception of service (whichever is sooner).
   F.   Antennas and Antenna Switches. A franchisee shall not, as a condition
to providing cable service, require any subscriber or potential subscriber to
remove any existing antenna structures for the receipt of over-the-air
television signals.
   G.   Delinquent Accounts. A franchisee shall use its best efforts to collect
on delinquent subscriber accounts before terminating service. In all cases, the
franchisee shall provide the customer with at least 10 days written notice
prior to disconnection.
   3.   Telephone and Office Availability.
   A.   Each franchisee shall maintain an office at a convenient location in
the Municipality, or in the general geographical area which includes the
Municipality, that shall be open during normal business hours to allow
subscribers to request service, pay bills, and conduct other business.
   B.   Each franchisee will maintain at least one local, toll-free or collect
call telephone access line which will be available to subscribers 24 hours a
day, 7 days a week. Trained representatives of a franchisee shall be available
to respond to subscriber telephone inquiries during normal business hours.
   C.   A franchisee must hire sufficient staff so that it can adequately
respond to customer inquiries, complaints, and requests for service in its
office, over the phone, and at the subscriber’s residence.
   4.   Scheduling and Completing Service. In addition to the customer service
standards contained in “Exhibit 13-1-B,” all franchisees shall meet the
following service standards, under normal operating conditions, at least 95
percent of the time, as measured on a quarterly basis:
   A.   Prompt Service. Repairs for service interruptions and other system
repairs not requiring work within a subscriber’s premises must be begun within
24 hours after the subscriber reports the problem to the franchisee or its
representative or the interruption or need for repairs otherwise becomes known
to the franchisee. All such work must be completed within 3 days from the date
of the initial request, except installation requests, or in the shortest time
possible where, for reasons beyond the franchisee’s control, the work could not
be completed within 3 days even with the exercise of all due diligence; the
failure of a franchisee to hire sufficient staff or to properly train its staff
shall not justify a franchisee’s failure to comply with this provision. Except
as Federal law permits, no charge shall be made to the subscriber for this
service or for the cost of repairs to franchisee’s equipment or facilities,
except where it can be shown that the equipment or facility was damaged by a
subscriber.
   B.   Emergency Maintenance. A franchisee shall keep an emergency system
maintenance and repair staff, capable of responding to and repairing system
malfunctions or interruptions, on a 24-hour basis, and shall respond to service
interruptions 24 hours a day, 7 days a week under normal operating conditions.
   C.   Other Inquiries. Under normal operating conditions, requests for
service, repair, and maintenance not involving service interruptions must be
acknowledged by a trained customer service representative within 24 hours, or
prior to the end of the next business day, whichever is earlier. A franchisee
shall respond to all other inquiries (including billing inquiries) within 5
business days of the inquiry or complaint.
   D.   Mobility-Limited Subscribers. With regard to mobility-limited
subscribers, upon a subscriber request, each franchisee shall arrange for
pickup and/or replacement of converters or other franchisee equipment at the
subscriber’s address or by a satisfactory equivalent (such as the provision of
a postage-prepaid mailer).
   5.   Interruptions of Service. A franchisee may intentionally interrupt
service on the cable system only for good cause and for the shortest time
possible and, except in emergency situations or as necessary to fix a service
problem, only after a minimum of 48 hours prior notice to subscribers and the
Municipality of the anticipated service interruption; provided, however, that
planned maintenance that does not require more than 2 hours interruption of
service and that occurs between the hours of 12 midnight and 6 a.m. shall not
require such notice to subscribers, but shall require notice to the
Municipality no less than 24 hours prior to such an anticipated service
interruption.
   6.   Notice to Subscribers.
   A.   In addition to the notification requirements contained within the
customer service standards in “Exhibit 13-1-B,” a franchisee shall also provide
the following materials to each subscriber at the time cable service is
installed, at least annually thereafter, and at any time upon request. Copies
of all such subscriber materials shall also be provided to the Municipality,
upon request.
   (1)   A schedule of rates and charges.
   (2)   A written description of the franchisee’s delinquent subscriber
disconnect and reconnect procedures, and any other of its policies applicable
to its subscribers.
   B.   All promotional materials, announcements, and advertising of
residential cable service to subscribers and the general public, where price
information is listed in any manner, shall clearly and accurately disclose
price terms. In the case of pay- per-view or pay-per-event programming, all
promotional materials must clearly and accurately disclose price terms and in
the case of telephone orders, a franchisee shall take appropriate steps to
ensure that price terms are clearly and accurately disclosed to potential
subscribers before the order is accepted.
   C.   Each franchisee shall maintain a public file containing all notices
provided to subscribers under these customer service standards. Copies of all
promotional or special offers made to subscribers shall be filed promptly with
the Municipality, upon request.
   7.   Billing.
   A.   A franchisee’s first billing statement after a new installation or
service change shall be prorated as appropriate and shall reflect any security
deposit.
   B.   A franchisee’s billing statement must show a specific payment due date
not earlier than the midpoint of the period for which the service being billed
is rendered (e.g., the fifteenth day of a 30-day billing cycle). Any balance
not received by 7 days after the end of the period for which the service being
billed is rendered may be assessed a late fee not exceeding $5, or such other
amount as the Municipality and the franchisee may agree, consistent with State
and local law. The late fee shall appear on the following month’s billing
statement.
   C.   A franchisee must notify the subscriber that he or she can remit
payment in person at the franchisee’s business office and inform the subscriber
of the address of that office.
   D.   Subscribers shall not be charged a late fee or otherwise be penalized
for any failure by a franchisee, including failure to timely or correctly bill
the subscriber, or failure to properly credit the subscriber for a payment
timely made.
   E.   The account of any subscriber shall be credited a prorated share of the
monthly charge for the service upon the subscriber’s prompt request, or where
the franchisee can reasonably identify the affected subscribers, if said
subscriber is without service or if service is substantially impaired for any
reason for a period exceeding 4 hours during any 24-hour period, except where
it can be shown that a subscriber seeks a refund for an outage or impairment
which that subscriber caused, or in the case of a planned outage occurring
between the hours of 12 midnight and 6 a.m.
   F.   Except by reason of emergency, loss of programming signal, permanent
changes in programming or in the channel lineup on the system, or for other
legitimate and business reasons as permitted or required by applicable law or
programming contract, the franchisee shall not deliberately interrupt the
normal programming offered on the system to subscribers without prior
notification. Applicable Federal or State law or regulation shall govern
whether subscribers are entitled to any refund or credit for such
interruptions.
   8.   Disconnection/Downgrades.
   A.   A subscriber may terminate service at any time.
   B.   Upon request, a franchisee shall promptly disconnect or downgrade any
subscriber. No period of notice prior to voluntary termination or downgrade of
service may be required of subscribers by any franchisee. No charge may be
imposed for any voluntary disconnection or downgrade, except to the extent that
Federal law specifically provides that the franchisee must be permitted so to
charge a subscriber. So long as the subscriber returns any equipment necessary
to receive a service within 5 business days of the disconnection, no charge may
be imposed by any franchisee for any cable service delivered 24 hours prior to
the return of such equipment. However, if a subscriber does not return, or
permit the franchisee to retrieve, such equipment within 5 business days after
disconnection, a franchisee may charge a subscriber for any cable service
delivered until the equipment is returned.
   C.   Any security deposit and/or other funds due the subscriber shall be
refunded on disconnected accounts after any customer premises equipment
provided by the franchisee has been recovered by the franchisee. The refund
must be made within 30 days or by the end of the next billing cycle, whichever
is earlier, from the date disconnection was requested (or, if later, the date
on which any customer premises equipment provided by the franchisee is
returned).
   D.   If a subscriber fails to pay a monthly subscriber fee or other fee or
charge, a franchisee may disconnect the subscriber’s service; however, such
disconnection shall not be effected until after 45 days from the beginning of
the period for which the service being billed is rendered, plus at least 10
days advance written notice to the subscriber in question of intent to
disconnect, given after the 45 days have elapsed. If the subscriber pays all
amounts due, including late charges, before the date scheduled for
disconnection, the franchisee shall not disconnect service. After
disconnection, upon payment by the subscriber in full of all proper fees or
charges, including the payment of the reconnection charge, if any, the
franchisee shall promptly reinstate service.
   E.   A franchisee may immediately disconnect a subscriber if the subscriber
is damaging or destroying the franchisee’s cable system or equipment and may
pursue criminal or civil action against said subscriber as appropriate. After
disconnection, the franchisee shall restore service if the subscriber provides
adequate assurance, including monetary or legal assurances, that it has ceased
the practices that led to disconnection, and paid all proper fees and charges,
including any reconnect fees and amounts owed the franchisee for damage to its
cable system or equipment.
   F.   A franchisee may also disconnect a subscriber that causes signal
leakage in excess of Federal limits. Disconnection may be effected after 5 days
written notice to the subscriber, if the subscriber fails to take steps to
correct the problem. In addition, a franchisee may disconnect a subscriber
without notice where signal leakage is detected originating from the
subscriber’s premises in excess of Federal limits, provided that the franchisee
shall immediately notify the subscriber of the problem and, once the problem is
corrected, reconnect the subscriber without charge.
   G.   A franchisee shall reconnect service to customers wishing restoration
of service, provided such a customer shall first satisfy any previous
obligations owed.
   9.   Parental Control Option. A franchisee shall make available to any
subscribers upon request, the option of blocking the video or audio portion of
any channel or channels of programming entering the subscriber’s home. The
control option described herein shall be made available to all subscribers
requesting it when any cable service is provided, or reasonably soon
thereafter.
   10.   Enforcement.
   A.   A franchisee shall file annually with the Municipality, in the
franchisee’s annual report, a statement describing the extent of compliance
with the customer service standards contained in “Exhibit 13-1-B” herein. If a
franchisee is in noncompliance with any element of such standards during any
calendar quarter, it shall include in its annual report a description of such
noncompliance, the reason for the noncompliance and a remedial plan.
   B.   Subject to Federal law, and after appropriate notice and a reasonable
period allowed for cure, a franchisee may be subject to penalties, forfeitures
and any other remedies or sanctions available under Federal, State or local law
including, without limitation, this Part and a franchisee’s franchise agreement
with the Municipality, if it repeatedly fails to comply with the standards
herein.
   11.   Exclusive Contracts and Anticompetitive Acts Prohibited. Except as
authorized by Federal or State law, no franchisee shall enter into an exclusive
contract for the provision of cable service with any person (including, but not
limited to, a building owner), or demand the exclusive right to serve a person
or location as a condition of providing or continuing service.
(Ord. 453, 8/12/1996, § 6)
§ 13-107.   Rate Regulation.
   The Municipality reserves the right to regulate the rates and charges for
cable service to the maximum extent permitted by Federal law or regulation.
Regardless of whether the Municipality regulates rates for cable services, a
franchisee may not change its rates and charges unless it has first given a
minimum 30 calendar days prior written notice of such change to the
Municipality and to all subscribers.
(Ord. 453, 8/12/1996, § 7)
§ 13-108.   Franchise Fee.
   1.   Finding. The Municipality finds that public rights-of-way of the
Municipality and State to be used by a franchisee for the operation of a cable
system are valuable public property acquired and maintained by the State and
Municipality at great expense to the taxpayers. The Municipality further finds
that the grant of a franchise to use public rights-of-way is a valuable
property right.
   2.   Not a Tax or in Lieu of Any Other Tax or Fee.
   A.   Subject to Federal law or regulation, payment of a franchise fee shall
not be considered in the nature of a tax or in lieu of other taxes or fees
imposed by the Municipality.
   B.   The franchise fee shall be in addition to all other taxes and payments
that a franchisee may be required to pay under its franchise agreement, any
Federal, State, or local law, including any applicable amusement taxes, except
to the extent that such fees, taxes, or assessments must be treated as a
franchise fee under 47 U.S.C. § 522.
   3.   No Accord or Satisfaction. No acceptance of any payment by the
Municipality shall be construed as a release or an accord and satisfaction of
any claim the Municipality may have for further or additional sums payable as a
franchise fee under a franchise agreement or for the performance of any other
obligation of a franchisee.
(Ord. 453, 8/12/1996, § 8)
§ 13-109.   Performance Guarantees and Remedies.
   1.   Penalties.
   A.   For violation of provisions of this Part or a franchise agreement
granted pursuant to this Part, the Municipality may impose penalties
(chargeable to a franchisee’s security fund, to the extent available), as
follows:
   (1)   For failure to submit any required plans indicating expected dates of
installation of various parts of the System: $400/day for each violation for
each day the violation continues.
   (2)   For failure to commence operations in accordance with the require
ments of the Franchise Agreement: $1,000/day for each violation for each day
the violation continues.
   (3)   For failure to complete construction of any System or upgrade in
accordance with the Franchise Agreement: $200/day for each day the violation
continues.
   (4)    For transferring the Franchise without approval: $1,000/day for each
violation for each day the violation continues.
   (5)   For failure to comply with requirements for public, educational, and
governmental use of the System: $100/day for each violation for each day the
violation continues.
   (6)   For repeated failure to supply information, reports, or filings
lawfully required under the Franchise Agreement or applicable law or by the
Munici pality: $50/day for each violation for each day the violation continues.
   (7)   For repeated violation of customer service standards: $100 per
violation.
   (8)   For failure, unless such failure is beyond the Franchisee’s control,
of the system to perform in the event of a public emergency or vital
information situation: $250 per occurrence.
   (9)   For failure to render payment for reimbursement of any Franchise
expenses, or failure to pay Franchise fees or liquidated damages: $100 per day.
   (10)   For failure to file, obtain or maintain any required Security Fund in
a timely fashion: $50 per day.
   (11)   For failure to restore damaged property: $50 per day, in addition to
the cost of the restoration as required elsewhere herein or in a Franchise
Agreement.
   (12)   For any other violations: $100/day for each violation for each day
the violation continues.
   B.   To the extent that penalties are applied to a franchisee under this
subsection, a franchisee shall not be subject to liquidated damages payable to
the Municipality for the same violation.
   C.   The Municipality may reduce or waive any of the above-listed penalties
for good cause shown.
   D.   Before the remedies specified herein may be applied, the Municipality
shall first notify the franchisee in writing of the violation, and the
franchisee shall have 30 days, or such additional time as the Municipality
shall specify, to cure the violation without penalty.
   E.   Pending litigation or any appeal to any regulatory body or court having
jurisdiction over a franchisee shall not excuse the franchisee from the
performance of its obligations under this Part or its franchise agreement
unless a stay is obtained from a forum of competent jurisdiction.
   2.   Remedies Cumulative. All remedies under this Part and the franchise
agreement are cumulative unless otherwise expressly stated. The exercise of one
remedy shall not foreclose use of another, nor shall the exercise of a remedy
or the payment of liquidated damages or penalties relieve a franchisee of its
obligations to comply with its franchise. Remedies may be used singly or in
combination; in addition, the Municipality may exercise any rights it has at
law or equity.
   3.   Relation to Insurance and Indemnity Requirements. Recovery by the
Municipality of any amounts under insurance, a performance bond, or letter of
credit, or otherwise does not limit a franchisee’s duty to indemnify the
Municipality in any way; nor shall such recovery relieve a franchisee of its
obligations under a franchise, or in any respect prevent the Municipality from
exercising any other right or remedy it may have.
(Ord. 453, 8/12/1996, § 9)
§ 13-110.   Transfers.
   1.   Municipality’s Approval Required.
   A.   A franchise shall be a privilege that is in the public trust and
personal to the original franchisee. A franchisee’s obligations under this
franchise involve personal services whose performance involves personal credit,
trust, and confidence in the franchisee, and transfer without the prior written
approval of the Municipal ity shall be considered to impair the Municipality’s
assurance of due performance.
   B.   No transfer (including, but not limited to, transfer by forced or
voluntary sale, merger, consolidation, receivership, or any other means) shall
occur without prior written notice to and approval of the Municipality, and
only then upon such reasonable terms and conditions as relate to the legal,
financial and technical qualifications of the transferee, as the Municipality
deems necessary and proper, as provided for in a franchise agreement and
subject to Federal law or regulation. The granting of approval for a transfer
in one instance shall not render unneces sary approval of any subsequent
transfer.
   2.   Approval Does Not Constitute Waiver. Approval by the Municipality of a
transfer of a franchise does not constitute a waiver or release of any of the
rights of the Municipality under this Part or a franchise agreement, whether
arising before or after the date of the transfer.
(Ord. 453, 8/12/1996, § 10)
§ 13-111.   Rights of Individuals Protected.
   1.   Discriminatory Practices Prohibited.
   A.   A franchisee shall not deny service, deny access, or otherwise
discriminate against subscribers, programmers, or residents of the Municipality
on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, or age.
   B.   A franchisee shall not discriminate among persons or take any
retaliatory action against a person because of that person’s exercise of any
right it may have under Federal, State, or local law, nor may the franchisee
require a person to waive such rights as a condition of taking service.
   C.   A franchisee shall not deny access or levy different rates and charges
on any group of potential residential cable subscribers because of the income
of the residents of the local area in which such group resides.
   D.   Subject to applicable law and except to the extent the Municipality may
waive such a requirement, a franchisee is prohibited from discriminating in its
rates or charges or from granting undue preferences to any subscriber,
potential subscriber, or group of subscribers or potential subscribers;
provided, however, that a franchisee may offer temporary, bona fide promotional
discounts in order to attract or maintain subscribers, so long as such
discounts are offered on a nondiscriminatory basis to similar classes of
subscribers throughout the Municipal ity; and a franchisee may offer discounts
for the elderly, the handicapped, non-for- profit persons or organizations, or
the economically disadvantaged, and such other discounts as it is expressly
entitled to provide under Federal law, if such discounts are applied in a
uniform and consistent manner. A franchisee shall comply at all times with all
applicable Federal, State, and Municipality laws, and all executive and
administrative orders relating to nondiscrimination.
   E.   Information Accessibility. Each document required to be maintained,
filed or submitted under the provisions of this cable ordinance or a franchise
agreement, or by Federal or State law or regulation, except those designated as
confidential by a franchisee, pursuant to applicable law, is a public document,
available for public inspection and copying at the requester’s expense, at the
office of the Municipality or a franchisee.
   2.   Protection of Subscriber Privacy. A franchisee shall at all times
protect the privacy of subscribers, consistent with § 631 of the Cable Act, 47
U.S.C. § 551, and other applicable Federal, State, and local laws.
(Ord. 453, 8/12/1996, § 11)
§ 13-112.   Theft of Service.
   Subject to applicable law, it shall be unlawful for any person to make any
unauthorized connection, whether physically, electrically, acoustically,
inductively or otherwise, with any part of a franchisee’s system within the
Municipality for the purpose of enabling anyone to receive any services of the
system or gain profit thereby without authority of or payment to the
franchisee. Any such unlawful and unauthorized connection shall be punishable
as a misdemeanor of the first degree upon arrest by municipal law enforcement
agencies and conviction in municipal court.
(Ord. 453, 8/12/1996, § 12)
§ 13-113.   Miscellaneous Provisions.
   1.   Compliance with Laws. Each franchisee shall comply with all Federal and
Pennsylvania laws, as well as Municipal ordinances, resolutions, rules and
regulations, heretofore or hereafter adopted or established during the entire
term of its franchise.
   2.   Captions. The captions to Sections throughout this Part are intended
solely to facilitate reading and reference to the Sections and provisions of
this Part. Such captions shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Part.
   3.   No Recourse Against the Municipality. Without limiting such immunities
as the Municipality or other persons may have under applicable law, a
franchisee shall have no recourse whatsoever against the Municipality or its
officials, boards, commissions, agents or employees for any loss, costs,
expense or damage arising out of any provision or requirement of this Part or
because of the enforcement of this Part or the Municipal ity’s exercise of its
authority pursuant to this Part, a franchise agreement, or other applicable
law, unless the same shall be caused by criminal acts or by willful or gross
negligence. Nothing contained herein, however, shall preclude, restrict or
limit any right the franchisee may have to bring an action against the
Municipality seeking injunctive and/or equitable relief.
   4.   Rights and Remedies.
   A.   The rights and remedies reserved to the Municipality by this Part are
cumulative and shall be in addition to and not in derogation on of any other
rights and remedies which the Municipality may have with respect to the subject
matter of this Part.
   B.   The Municipality hereby reserves to itself the right to intervene in
any suit, action or proceeding involving any provision of this Part or a
franchise agreement.
   C.   Specific mention of the materiality of any of the provisions herein is
not intended to be exclusive of any others for the purpose of determining
whether any failure of compliance hereunder is material and substantial.
   D.   No franchisee shall be relieved of its obligation to comply with any of
the provisions of this Part or a franchise agreement by reason of any failure
of the Municipality to enforce prompt compliance. Nor shall any inaction by the
Municipality be deemed to waive a provision voiding any provision of this Part.
   5.   Amendments to this Part. In order to fulfill the public interest goals
of this Part, to provide additional communications service to the Municipality
through the use of cable systems and thereby to ensure the benefits which will
result from such service, the Municipality specifically reserves the right
lawfully to amend this Part to effectuate the public interest in the operation
of a cable system; provided, however, that any such amendment which has the
effect of directly or indirectly changing the provisions of any existing
franchise agreement shall not be enforceable by the Municipality, excluding
general police powers, unless or until such changes have been effected by a
subsequent amendment to such franchise agreement.

   7.   Connections to System; Use of Antennae.
   A.   Subscribers shall have the right to attach devices to a franchisee’s
cable system to allow them to convey signals or services for which they have
paid to VCRs, televisions, other receivers, and other terminal equipment, so
long as such devices do not interfere with the operation of the cable system,
or the reception of any cable subscriber, nor serve to circumvent the security
procedures established by the franchisee, nor for any purpose to obtain
services illegally. Subscribers also shall have the right to use their own
remote control devices and converters, and other similar equipment, where
applicable and compatible, and a franchisee shall provide information to
consumers which will allow them to adjust such devices so that they may be used
with the franchisee’s system.
   B.   A franchisee shall not, as a condition of providing service, require a
subscriber or potential subscriber to remove any existing antenna or disconnect
an antenna, or prohibit or discourage a subscriber from installing an antenna

applicable codes and technically able to shield the cable system from any
interference.
   8.   Calculation of Time. Unless otherwise indicated, when the performance
or doing of any act, duty, matter, or payment is required under this Part or
any franchise agreement, and a period of time or duration for the fulfillment
of doing thereof is prescribed and is fixed herein, the time shall be computed
so as to exclude the first and include the last day of the prescribed or fixed
period of duration time.
   9.   Force Majeure. A franchisee granted a franchise under the provisions of
this Part shall not be deemed in default of this Part where performance of the
provisions and obligations herein are rendered impossible by causes,
circumstances or other reasons beyond the control of the franchisee, and the
franchise shall not be revoked nor the franchisee penalized for such
noncompliance; provided, the franchisee takes immediate and diligent steps to
restore its compliance as soon as possible under the circumstances of its
franchise without unduly endangering the health, safety, and integrity of the
franchisee’s employees or property, the public, the public rights-of-way or
public or private property.
   10.   Severability. If any term, condition, or provision of this Part shall,
to any extent, be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder hereof
shall be valid in all other respects and continue to be effective. In the event
of a subsequent change in applicable law so that the provision which had been
held invalid is no longer invalid, said provision shall thereupon return to
full force and effect without further action by the Municipality and shall
thereafter be binding on the franchisee and the Municipal ity. Nothing in this
Part shall require a franchisee to violate any applicable law, rule or
regulation.
   11.   Ordinance Supersedes All Previous Ordinances. This Part hereby

parking in these locations. The enforcement of this subparagraph requires that
a sign indicating the violation and amount of fine be posted at each applicable
location. For purposes of this section, the term "disability" shall mean a
hearing impairment or total or partial blindness.

charges are not set by the municipality, a maximum of $25 per day may be
charged for storage.

designated highways and local authorities on any highway within their
boundaries may by erection of official traffic-control devices prohibit, limit

would constitute a safety hazard or where the stopping, standing or parking of
vehicles would unduly interfere with the free movement of traffic.

      D.   The number of equivalent dwelling units applicable to commercial
establishments and industrial establishments shall be computed on the basis of
the average daily number of full and part-time employees (including the owner
(s) or employer(s) for the calendar quarter preceding the date the user charge
is due. The owners of such facilities shall be responsible for advising the

system and, from time to time, upon request of the Borough. The number of
equivalent dwelling units applicable to educational and institutional
establishments shall be computed on the highest monthly average daily
attendance of occupants, pupils, faculty, administrators and staff during the
12 months preceding the date the user charge is due. The owners of such
facilities shall be responsible for advising the Borough in writing of the
number of pupils, faculty, administrators and staff in attendance as an average
daily figure, from time to time, upon request of the Borough.
   3.   A.   The owner of any improved property discharging wastewater into the
sewer system shall furnish to the Borough, including by way of the application
for permit described in the connection ordinance, all information deemed
essential or appropriate by the Borough for the determination of all applicable
user charges and surcharges. The costs of obtaining such information shall be
borne by such owner of the improved property.
      B.   In the event of the failure of the owner to provide adequate
information, the Borough shall estimate the applicable user charge and
surcharges based upon available information, until such time as adequate
information is received. There shall be no rebate of past payments if the
owner's refusal to provide such information results in overpayment.
   4.   Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to prohibit this Borough from
entering into separate or special agreements with owners of improved property
or other persons with respect to the user charge or surcharge to be imposed in
those cases where, due to special or unusual circumstances, the user charge set
forth herein shall be deemed by this Borough, in its sole discretion, to be
inequitable, or where it is in the best interests of this Borough to do so.
   5.   User charges and surcharges, as applicable, shall be payable on a
monthly basis, on the first day of each month, and shall cover a billing period
consisting of the immediately preceding month. Owners of improved property that
shall be first connected to the sewer system during any monthly period shall
pay a user charge for service for the balance of the monthly period, plus any
applicable surcharges.
   6.   Payments of user charges and any applicable surcharges shall be due and
payable upon the applicable billing date, at a place designated by the Borough,
in the appropriate amount, computed in accordance with this Part, which shall
constitute the net bill. If any user charge or any applicable surcharge is not
paid within 30 calendar days after the applicable billing date, an additional
sum of 10 percent shall be added to such net bill, which net bill, plus such
additional sum, shall constitute the gross bill. Payment made or mailed and
postmarked on or before the last day of such 30 calendar day period shall
constitute payment within such period. If the end of such 30 calendar day
period shall fall on a legal holiday or on a Sunday, then payment made on or
mailed and postmarked on the next succeeding business day which is not a legal
holiday shall constitute payment within such period. Any and all payments
received on account of delinquent accounts shall be applied first to the oldest
outstanding gross bill, including any accumulated late fee.
   7.   It shall be the responsibility of each owner of an improved property to
provide the Borough with, and thereafter keep the Borough continuously advised
of, the correct mailing address of such owner. Failure of any owner to receive
a bill for charges due and payable shall not be considered an excuse for
nonpayment, nor shall such failure result in an extension of the period of time
during which the net bill shall be payable.
   8.   A.   No officer or employee of the Borough is authorized to reduce,
vary or exempt charges imposed herein or other provisions of this Part without
official action by the Council of this Borough.
      B   Every owner of improved property shall remain liable for the payment
of user charges and surcharges until the later of:
         (1)   The receipt by the Borough of written notice by such owner that
the property has been sold, containing the correct name and mailing address of
the new owner.
         (2)    The date on which title to the improved property is transferred
to a new owner. Failure to provide notice renders an owner continuously liable
for any charges that may accrue until such time as the Borough has been
properly notified of any change in ownership as described above.

         (3)   These are end-of-lateral concentrations in the wastewater stream
that exists after all industrial waste and sanitary sewage streams connected to
the sewer system have mixed completely. The concentrations represent state-of-
the-art for local limits that will assure protection of the wastewater
treatment process. The end-of-lateral concentrations are generally lower than
categorical pretreatment standards which apply to concentrations measured at
the end of the manufacturing process.
         (4)   Where categorical pretreatment standards are available, § 403.6
of the General Pretreatment Regulations provides a formula for calculation of
an alternate value for the specific pollutant concentration limit based on
combined waste strength. This formula will be applied to the wastewater stream,
including sanitary sewage flows and other applicable flows, to calculate an
end-of-lateral concentration. The calculated concentration and the
concentration based on local limits will be compared and the lower of the two
limits will be applied in the permit for the nonresidential discharge.
         (5)   All wastewater entering the sewer system shall be pretreated to
typical domestic levels for compatible pollutants unless otherwise stated in
writing by this Borough by way of the issuance of a permit. Typical domestic
levels for compatible pollutants shall be:

any case where they are more stringent than federal requirements and
limitations, or those in this Part.
         (7)   No significant user shall ever increase the use of process water
or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute
for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in
the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standard, or with any other pollutant-
specific limitation developed by this Borough, or State or Federal agencies.
         (8)   Each significant user shall provide protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this Part.
Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be
provided and maintained at the significant user's own cost and expense.
Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this
protection shall be submitted to this Borough and shall be approved in writing
by this Borough before construction of the facility. All existing significant
user's shall complete such a plan prior to being issued a permit. No
significant user who commences contribution to the sewer system after the
effective date of this Part shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the
system until his accidental discharge procedures have been approved by this
Borough. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not
relieve the significant user from the responsibility to modify his facility, as
necessary, to meet the requirements of this Part. In the case of an accidental
discharge, it is the responsibility of the significant user to immediately
telephone and notify this Borough of the incident. The notification shall
include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and
corrective actions.
         (9)   Within 5 days following an accidental discharge, the significant
user shall submit to this Borough a detailed written report describing the
cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken to mitigate any expense,
loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to
the sewer system or aquatic life or any other damage to person or property.
Such report shall not relieve the user or significant user of any fines, civil
penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this Part or other
applicable law.
         (10)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the significant user's
bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the
event of excessive and/or dangerous discharge, whether accidental or otherwise.
Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such an
excessive and/or dangerous discharge to occur are properly advised of the
emergency notification procedures.
   3.   Under no circumstances shall any person discharge or cause to be
discharged into the sewer system any of the substances listed in subsection
.2.O, above, without first securing written permission to do so from the
Borough.
   4.   Upon the promulgation of the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards
for a particular industrial subcategory, the Federal standard, if more
stringent than limitations imposed under this Part for sources in that
subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this
Part. This Borough shall notify all affected user's of the applicable reporting
requirements under 40 CFR § 403.12.
   5.   No user shall ever increase the use of process water or, in anyway,
attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the Federal
Categorical Pretreatment Standards, or in any other pollutant-specific
limitation developed by the Borough or the Commonwealth.
   6.   A.   Whenever a person is authorized by this Borough and the
appropriate governmental agencies to discharge any polluted water, sanitary
sewage or industrial waste containing any of the substances or possessing any
of the characteristics referred to in subsection .2, such discharge shall be
subject to the continuing approval, inspection and review of this Borough. If,
in the opinion of this Borough, such discharges are causing or will cause
damage to the sewer system or the treatment plant, or are causing or will cause
this Borough to be in violation of any agreement or order, this Borough shall
order the person causing such discharge to cease doing so forthwith, or to take
other appropriate action, including exercising the remedies provided herein, to
eliminate the harmful discharge.
      B.   This Borough reserves the right to recoup the costs for any work,
including, but not limited to, costs of material, labor and supervision,
necessary to remove and repair any deposit, obstruction or damage caused to the
sewer system or the treatment plant as a result of the discharge or drainage
from any improved property.
   7.   Nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting any special
agreement or arrangement between the Borough and the owner of an improved
property or other person allowing wastewater of unusual strength or character
to be admitted into the sewer system and specially treated, subject to any
payments or user charges, surcharges and other charges as may be acceptable to
this Borough.
   8.   A.   Where necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of this Borough,
the owner of an improved property shall provide, at the sole expense of the
owner, suitable pretreatment facilities acceptable to this Borough.
      B.   Plans, specifications and any other pertinent information relating
to proposed facilities for preliminary treatment and handling of industrial
wastes shall be submitted for approval of this Borough. No construction of any
such facility shall commence until approval has been obtained, in writing, from
this Borough, and until approval has been obtained from any and all regulatory
bodies having jurisdiction.
      C.   Such facilities for preliminary treatment and handling of industrial
wastes shall be continuously maintained, at the sole expense of the owner, in
good operating condition satisfactory to this Borough. This Borough shall have
access to such facilities at reasonable times for purposes of inspection and
sampling.

authorized representative of the significant user and certified by a qualified
professional engineer registered in the Commonwealth.
      B.   Periodic Compliance Reports.
         (1)   Every significant user subject to a pretreatment standard after
the compliance date of such pretreatment standard; or, in the case of a new
source, after commencement of the discharge to the sewer system, shall submit
to the Borough during the months of June and December, unless required more
frequently in the pretreatment standards or by the Borough, a report indicating
the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by
such pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of
all daily flow which, during the reporting period, exceeded the average daily
flow allowed in the permit. At the discretion of the Borough in consideration
of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holiday, budget cycles, etc.,
the Borough may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to
be submitted.
         (2)   The Borough may impose mass limitations on significant user's
which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations are
appropriate. In such cases, the report required by subparagraph (1) of this
Section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment
standards in the effluent of the significant user. These reports shall contain
the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and
the nature and concentration or production and mass where requested by the
Borough of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable
pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the
applicable pretreatment standard. All analysis shall be performed in accordance
with procedures established by the Administrator pursuant to § 304(g) of the

are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is
created or discharged shall allow the Borough, through its representative(s),
ready access during all working hours to all parts of the premises for the
purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, or in the
performance of any of his duties. The Borough, the DEP and the EPA shall have
the right to set up on a user's or significant user's property such devices as
are necessary to conduct sampling inspection, compliance monitoring and/or
metering operations. Where a user or significant user has security measures in
force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into his
premises, the user or significant user shall make necessary arrangements with
its security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification,
personnel from the Borough, the DEP and the EPA will be permitted to enter
without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities.
   11.   A.   User's and significant user's shall provide necessary wastewater
treatment as required to comply with this Part and shall achieve compliance
with all Federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations
as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any equipment or
facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the Borough
shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed
plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be
submitted to the Borough for review, and shall be acceptable to the Borough
before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating
procedures will in no way relieve a user from the responsibility of modifying
his facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the Borough
under the provisions of this Part. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment
facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be accepted by the
Borough prior to the user's or significant user's initiation of the changes.
      B.   Annually, the Borough may publish in a newspaper of general
circulation in the Borough a list of the user's and significant user's who
failed to comply with pretreatment requirements or standards at least once
during the previous 12 months. The notification also shall summarize any
enforcement actions taken by the Borough against these user's and significant
user's during the same 12 months.

be made available to officials of the Borough, DEP, EPA or approval authority
upon request.
   12.   A.   Information and data on a user or significant user obtained from
reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits, monitoring programs and
inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agencies
without restriction unless the user or significant user specifically requests
and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Borough that the release
of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user or significant
user.
      B.   When requested by the person furnishing a report, those portions of
a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be
made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available, upon
written request, to governmental agencies for uses related to this Part, the
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination system (NPDES) permit, State disposal
permit and/or the pretreatment programs provided. Any such portions of a report
shall also be available for use by the State or any State agency in judicial
review or enforcement proceeding involving the person furnishing the report.
Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as
confidential information.
   13.   Whenever the Borough finds that any user or significant user has
violated, or is violating this Part, his user permit or significant user
permit, or any prohibition or limitation of requirements contained herein, the
Borough may serve upon such person a written notice stating the nature of the
violation. Within 30 days of the date of the notice, a plan for the
satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the Borough by the user
or significant user.
   14.   A.   The Borough may suspend a user permit or a significant user
permit whenever such suspension is necessary in the opinion of the Borough in
order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents, or may present,
an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or
to the environment, or which may cause interference to the sewer system or the
treatment plant, or which may cause the Borough to violate any condition of its
NPDES permit or applicable sewage treatment agreements.
      B.   Any person notified of a suspension of this permit shall immediately
stop or eliminate the discharge. In the event of a failure of the person to
comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Borough shall take steps as
deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the sewer system or
endangerment to any individuals. The Borough shall reinstate the permit upon
proof of the elimination of the non-complying discharge by user or significant
user, payment of any damages, fines, penalties or costs associated with the
discharge, and the submission of a detailed written statement describing the
causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence.
   15.   Any user or significant user is subject to revocation of a permit
granted hereunder for violation of applicable State and Federal regulations, or
by reason of the commission of any of the following acts:
      A.   Failure to report factually on discharge wastewater constituents and
characteristics.

§ 26-101.   Definitions.
   The Greater Johnstown Water Authority–the utility in charge of supplying
potable water to consumers within the City of Johnstown is invested with the
authority and responsibility for the implementation of an effective cross-
connection control program and for the enforcement of the provisions of this
Part.
   Approved–accepted as meeting an applicable specification stated or cited in
this Part or as suitable for the proposed use.
   Auxiliary water supply–any water supply on or available to the premises
other than the generally recognized public potable water supply. These
auxiliary waters may include water from another purveyor’s public potable water
supply or any natural source such as well, spring, river, stream, harbor, etc.,
or “used waters” or “industrial fluids.” They may be polluted or contaminated
or they may be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over
which the water purveyor does not have sanitary control.
   Backflow–the flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances into the
distribution pipes of a potable water supply from any source or sources other
than its intended source. Back-siphonage is one type of backflow.
   Backflow preventer–a device or means to prevent backflow.
   A.   Air-gap primary prevention–the unobstructed vertical distance through
the free atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet
supplying water to a tank, plumbing fixture or other device and the flood level
rim of the receptacle. An approved air-gap shall be at least double the
diameter of the supply pipe, measured vertically above the top rim of the
vessel, in no case less than 1 inch. When an air-gap is used to prevent
contamination of the public potable water system, and an approved reduced
pressure device shall be installed in the by-pass.
   B.   Reduced pressure principal primary prevention–the term “approved
reduced pressure principal backflow prevention device” means a device approved
by a recognized and Authority approved testing agency for backflow prevention
devices. It shall incorporate two or more check valves and an automatically
operating differential relief valve located between the two checks, two tightly
closing shutoff valves, and equipped with necessary appurtenances for testing.
The device shall operate to maintain the pressure in the zone between the two
check valves less than the pressure on the public water supply side of the
device. At cessation of normal flow, the pressure between check valves shall be
less than the supply pressure. In case of leakage of either check valve, the
differential relief valve shall operate to maintain this reduced pressure by
discharging to the atmosphere. When the inlet pressure is 2 pounds per square
inch or less, the relief valve shall open to the atmosphere, thereby providing
an air-gap in the device. To be approved, these devices must be readily
accessible for maintenance and testing and installed in a location where no
part of the valve will be submerged.
   C.   Double check valve assembly secondary prevention–an assembly of at
least two independently-acting approved check valves including tightly closing
shut-off valves on each side of the check valve assembly and suitable leak
detector drains plus connections available for testing the water tightness of
each valve. The entire assembly shall meet the specifications and approval of a
recognized and Authority approved testing agency for backflow prevention
devices. To be approved these devices must be readily accessible for
maintenance and testing.
   Contamination–(see “pollution”) an impairment of the quality of the water by
sewage or industrial fluids, waste or any other substance, to a degree which
creates an actual hazard to the public health such as, but not limited to,
poisoning or through the spread of disease.
   Cross-connection–any physical connection or arrangement of piping or
fixtures between two otherwise separate piping systems, one of which contains
potable water and other nonpotable water or industrial fluids of questionable
safety, through which, or because of which, backflow may occur. A water service
connection between a public potable water distribution system and a customer’s
water distribution system which cross-connected to a contaminated fixture,
industrial fluid system or with a potentially contaminated supply or auxiliary
water system, constitutes one type of cross- connection. Other types of cross-
connections include connectors such as swing connections, removable sections
four-way plug valves, spools, dummy sections of pipe, swivel or changeover
devices, sliding multiport tube, etc.
   Cross-connections–controlled–a connection between a potable water system and
a nonpotable water system with an approved built-in backflow preventer that
will continuously afford protection commensurate with the degree of hazard.
   Cross-connection control by containment–the installation of an approved
backflow prevention device immediately after the meter on any customer’s
premises where an actual or potential cross-connection exists on a customer’s
water system.
   Hazard, degree of–the term is derived from an evaluation of the potential
risk to public health and the adverse effect upon potable water system.
   A.   Hazard; health–any condition, device or practice in the water supply
system and its operation which could create, or in the judgment of the
“Official Head” may create a danger to the health and well-being of the water
consumer. An example of a health hazard is a structural defect, including
cross-connections, in a water supply system.
   B.   Hazard; plumbing–a plumbing-type cross-connection in a consumer’s
potable water system that has not been properly protected by a vacuum breaker,
air-gap separation or other device. Unprotected plumbing-type cross-connections
are considered to be a health hazard.
   C.   Hazard; pollutional–an actual or potential threat to the physical
properties of the water system or the potability of the public or the
consumer’s potable water system, but which would constitute a nuisance or be
aesthetically objectionable or could cause damage to the system or its
appurtenances, but would not be dangerous to health.
   D.   Hazard; system–an actual or potential threat of severe damage to the
physical properties of the public potable water system or the consumer’s
potable water system or of a pollution or contamination which would have a
protracted effect on the quality of the potable water in the system.
   Industrial fluids system–any system containing a fluid or solution which may
be chemically, biologically or otherwise contaminated or polluted in a form or
concentra tion such as would constitute a health, system, pollutional or
plumbing hazard, if introduced into a public potable water supply. This may
include, but not be limited to, polluted or contaminated water; all types of
process waters and “used water” originating from the public potable water
system which may have deteriorated in sanitary quality; chemicals in fluid
form; plating acids and alkalies; circulated cooling waters that are connected
to an open cooling tower and/or cooling waters that are chemically or
biologically treated or stabilized with toxic substances; contaminated natural
waters such as from wells, springs, streams, rivers, bays, harbors, seas,
irrigation canals or systems, etc.; oils, gases, glycerine, paraffins, caustic
and acid solutions and other liquid and gaseous fluids used in industrial or
other processes or for firefighting purposes.
   Pollution–(see “contamination”) the presence of any foreign substance
(organic, inorganic, radiological or biological) in water which tends to
degrade its quality so as to constitute a hazard or impair the usefulness or
quality of the water to a degree which does not create an actual hazard to the
public health, but does adversely and unreasonably affect such waters for
domestic use.
   Public water system–a system for the provision to the public of piped water
for human consumption, if such system has at least 15 service connections or
regularly services at least 25 individuals.
   Water; potable–any water which, according to recognized standards, is safe
for human consumption.
   Water; nonpotable–water which is not safe for human consumption or which is
of questionable potability.
   Water; service connections–the terminal end of a service connection from the
potable water system; i.e., where the water purveyor loses jurisdiction and
sanitary control over the water at its point of delivery to the consumer’s
water system. There should be no unprotected takeoffs from the service line
ahead of any meter or backflow prevention device located at the point of
delivery to the consumer’s water system. Service connection shall also include
water service connection from a fire hydrant and all other temporary or
emergency water service connection from the public potable water system.
   Water; used–any water supplied by a water purveyor from a public potable
water system to a consumer’s water system after it has passed through the point
of deliver and is no longer under the sanitary control of the water purveyor.
   Water system–
   A.   The water system shall be considered as made up of two parts: the
utility system and the customer system.
   B.   Utility system shall consist of the source facilities and the
distribution system and shall include all those facilities of the water system
under the complete control of the utility, up to the point where the customer’s
system begins.
   C.   The source shall include all components of the facilities utilized in
the production, treatment, storage and delivery of water to the distribution
system.
   D.   The distribution system shall include the network of conduits used for
the delivery of water from the source to the customer’s system.
   E.   The customer system shall include those parts of the facilities beyond
the termination of the utility distribution system which are utilized in
conveying utility-delivered domestic water to points of use.
(Ord. 418, 7/10/1989, § 1)
§ 26-102.   Regulations.
   1.   No water service connection to any premises shall be approved by the
water purveyor unless the water supply is protected as required by State laws
and regulations and this Part. Service of water to any premises shall be
discontinued by the water purveyor if a backflow prevention device required by
this Part is not installed, tested and maintained, or if it found that a
backflow preventive device has been removed, by- passed, or if an unprotected
cross-connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until
such conditions or defects are corrected.
   2.   The customer system should be open for inspection at all reasonable
times to authorized representatives of the water purveyor to determine whether
cross- connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including
violations of these regulations, exist. The municipality shall be notified
prior to any such inspections and as soon as any problems occur. When such a
condition becomes known, the water purveyor shall deny or immediately
discontinue service to the premises by providing for a physical break in the
service line until the customer has corrected the condition in conformance with
State, County and City statutes relating to plumbing and water supplies and the
regulations adopted pursuant thereto.
   3.   An approved backflow prevention device shall be installed on each
service line to a customer’s water system at or near the property line or
immediately after the meter inside the building being served, but in all cases,
before the first branch line leading off the service line wherever the
following conditions exist:
   A.   In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply which is not
or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and which is not
acceptable as an additional source by the water purveyor, the public water
system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing a
backflow prevention device in the service line.
   B.   In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other
objectionable substance is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or
potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall be
protected against backflow from the premises by installing backflow prevention
device in the service line. This shall include the handling of process waters
and waters originating from the utility system which have been subject to
deterioration in quality.
   C.   In the case of premises having (1) internal cross-connections that
cannot be permanently corrected and controlled, or (2) intricate plumbing and
piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not
readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or
impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross-connections exist, the
public water system shall have primary maximum protection against backflow from
the premises by installing a backflow prevention device in the service line.
   4.   The type of protection device required under subsection .3, .3.A, .3.B
and .3.C, shall depend on the degree of hazard which exists as follows:
   A.   In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply as
stated in subsection .3.A, and it is not subject to any of the following rules,
the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or
an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device.
   B.   In the case of any premises where there is water or substance that
would be objectionable, but not hazardous to health, if introduced into the
public water system, the public system shall be protected by an approved
double-check valve assembly.
   C.   In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to
health which is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential
hazard to the public water system, this system shall be protected by an
approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow
prevention device. Examples of premises where these conditions will exist
include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical
manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries and plating works.
   D.   In the case of any premise where there are “uncontrolled” cross-connec
tions, either actual or potential, the public water system must be protected by
an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle
backflow prevention device at the service connection.
   E.   In the case of any premises where, because of security requirements or
other prohibitions or restrictions it is impossible or impractical to make a
complete in-plant cross-connection survey, the public water system shall be
protected against backflow from the premises by installing a backflow
prevention device in the service line. In this case, maximum protection will be
required; that is, an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced
pressure principle backflow prevention device shall be installed in (the)
(each) service to the premises.
   5.   Any backflow prevention required herein shall be of a model approved by
the water purveyor. The term “approved backflow preventer” shall mean a device
that has been manufactured in full conformance with standards established by
the American Water Works Association entitled: AWWA C506-69, “Standards for
Reduced Pressure Principle and Double Check Valve Backflow Prevention Devices.”
Said AWWA standards have been adopted by the Official Head. Final approval,
however, of the “Reduced Pressure Principle Backflow Preventer” and the “Double
Check Valve Assembly” issued by an approved testing laboratory certifying full
compliance with the said AWWA standards.
   6.   It shall be the duty of the customer-user at any premises where
backflow prevention devices are installed to have thorough inspections and
operational tests made at least once a year, or more often in those instances
where inspections indicate a need. These inspections and tests shall be at the
expense of the water use, be performed by the device manufacturer’s
representative, by the water purveyor’s personnel or by a person approved by
the head of the water purveyor or his authorized representative as a competent
device tester. The customer-user shall notify the water purveyor in advance
when the test is to be undertaken so that he or his representative may witness
the test if it is so desired. These devices shall be repaired, overhauled or
replaced at the expense of the customer-user whenever they are found to be
defective. Records of such tests, repairs and overhaul shall be kept and made
available to the water purveyor and Borough. Copies of all test results shall
be submitted to the water purveyor and Borough.
   7.   All presently installed backflow prevention devices which do not meet
the requirements of this Section, but were approved devices for the purposes
described herein at the time of installation and which have been properly
maintained, shall, except for the inspection and maintenance requirements under
subsection .6, be excluded from the requirements of these rules so long as the
water purveyor is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the utility
system. Whenever the existing device is moved from the present location or
requires more than minimum maintenance or when the water purveyor finds that
the maintenance of the device constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be
replaced by a backflow prevention device meeting the requirements of this
Section.
   8.   No consumer shall alter, by-pass or render inoperative any backflow
device approved and installed under these regulations.
(Ord. 418, 7/10/1989, § 2)
§ 26-103.   Financial Responsibility for Improvements.
   It shall be the responsibility of the consumer to install and maintain
devices mandated pursuant to §
26-102 above at his own cost and expense.
(Ord. 418, 7/10/1989, § 3)
§ 26-104.   Enforcement and Penalties.
   1.   Notification of Violation. The water purveyor shall notify, in writing,
the owner, or authorized agent of the owner of the premises in which there is
found to be a violation of the provisions of this Part. Failure of the owner to
remove or correct the violation within the time provided will constitute cause
for the water purveyor to discontinue water service to said premises.
   2.   Penalties for Violation. Any person, firm, association or corporation
who violates any provision of this Part upon conviction thereof in an action
brought before a magisterial district judge in the manner provided for the
enforcement of summary offenses under the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal
Procedure, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $1,000 plus costs
and, in default of payment of said fine and costs, to a term of imprisonment
not to exceed 90 days. Each day that a violation of this Part continues or each
Section of this Part which shall be found to have been violated shall
constitute a separate offense. [Ord. 489]

(Ord. 430, 9/9/1991, § 1; as amended by Ord. 489, 10/13/2014)
§ 26-202.   Purpose.
   This local water rationing plan is intended to establish measures for
essential conservation of water resources, and to provide for equitable
distribution of limited water supplies, in order to balance demand and limited
available supplies and to assure that sufficient water is available to preserve
public health and safety within the emergency service area.
(Ord. 430, 9/9/1991, § 2)
§ 26-203.   Scope.
   This local water rationing plan shall apply to all water uses within the
service area of the Borough of Ferndale (emergency service area).
(Ord. 430, 9/9/1991, § 3)
§ 26-204.   Objective of the Plan.
   1.   It is imperative that water customers within the emergency service area
achieve an immediate and further reduction in the water use in order to extend
existing water supplies and, at the same time, assure that sufficient water is
available to preserve the public health and sanitation, and provide fire
protection service.
   2.   The objective of this local water rationing plan is to effect an
immediate 25 percent reduction in water usage. Should drought conditions
continue, further reductions in usage may be required. If it is necessary to
implement further reductions, this Part will be modified as noted in §
26-216. It is the purveyor’s responsibility to continually monitor on-hand
quantities to determine if amendments are required.
   3.   The plan provides for equitable reductions in water usage on the part
of each water customer. The success of this Part depends on the cooperation of
all water customers in the emergency service area.
(Ord. 430, 9/9/1991, § 4)
§ 26-205.   Measures to Implement the Water Rationing Plan.
   Each municipality and water supply purveyor within the emergency service
area will develop and adopt such implementing and enforcement measures as are
necessary and appropriate to assure compliance with requirements of this local
water rationing plan.
(Ord. 430, 9/9/1991, § 5)
§ 26-206.   Prohibited Nonessential Water Uses 1 .
   1.   The following water uses are declared nonessential and are prohibited
within the emergency service area:
   A.   The watering of lawns.
   B.   The watering of outdoor gardens, landscaped areas, trees, shrubs, and
other outdoor plants, except by means of a bucket, pail, or hand-held hose
equipped with an automatic shut-off nozzle between the hours of 5 p.m. and 9
a.m.
   C.   The watering of golf course fairways.
   D.   The noncommercial washing of automobiles and trucks.
   E.   The washing of streets, driveways, and sidewalks.
   F.   The serving of water in restaurants, clubs or eating places unless
specifically requested by the individual.
   G.   Ornamental water use including, but not limited to, fountains,
artificial waterfalls, and reflecting pools.
   H.   The use of water for flushing sewers or hydrants by municipalities or
any public or private individual or entity except as deemed necessary and
approved in the interest of public health or safety by the municipal health
officials.
   I.   The use of fire hydrants by fire companies for testing fire apparatus
and for fire department drills except as deemed necessary in the interest of
public safety and specifically approved by the municipal governing body.
   J.   The use of fire hydrants by municipal road departments, contractors and
all others, except as necessary for firefighting or protection purposes.
   K.   The use of water to fill and top off swimming pools.
   2.   Exemptions or Variance from Nonessential Uses of Water Restrictions.
   A.   If compliance with the prohibition of nonessential use of water would
result in extraordinary hardship upon a water user, the water user may apply
for an exemption or variance. For purposes of this Section, extraordinary
hardship means a permanent damage to property or other personal or economic
loss which is substantially more severe than the sacrifices borne by other
water users subject to the prohibition of nonessential use of water.
   B.   A water user that believes it suffers an extraordinary hardship and
desires to be wholly or partially exempt from the prohibition of nonessential
use of water shall submit a written request with full documentation supporting
the need for the requested relief to Ferndale Borough (name of municipality,
public water supply agency or water purveyor responsible for adopting and
implementing this Part). The application shall contain information specifying:
   (1)   The nature of the hardship claimed and reason for the requested
exemption or variance.
   (2)   The efforts taken by the applicant to conserve water and extent to
which water use may be reduced by the applicant without extraordinary hardship.
   (3)   Ferndale Borough shall advise the applicant of its decision in writing
regarding the application. An exemption or variance will be granted only to the
extent necessary to relieve extraordinary hardship.
   (4)   Any person aggrieved by a decision relating to such an exemption or
variance rendered by a water supply purveyor may file an appeal with the
Commonwealth Drought Coordinator who shall render a final decision pursuant to
4 Pa.Code, Chapter 119.
(Ord. 430, 9/9/1991, § 6)
 
Notes
     Note: The prohibited water uses in this Section are examples only and are
1 deliberately more restrictive than the nonessential uses which are prohibited
  in 4 Pa.Code, Chapter 119.
§ 26-207.   General Requirement for Water Use Reductions.
   Every water customer shall achieve the water use reductions set forth in
this local water rationing plan. In order to achieve the overall objectives of
the plan, the water use restrictions and limitations set forth in §§
26-208–26-210 shall apply.
(Ord. 430, 9/9/1991, § 7)
§ 26-208.   Water Use Restrictions for Residential Users.
   1.   Note: Choose paragraphs .A, .B, or .C below, as appropriate.
   A.   Metered Residential Water Customers and Allotments.
   (1)   The number of permanent residents in each dwelling unit (household)
will determine the amount of water that each household will be allowed.
   (2)   Each dwelling unit (household) shall be allotted 40 gallons per day
for each resident of the household. Households with only one permanent resident
will have a daily allotment of 55 gallons.
   (3)   Residential water customers are required to provide water purveyor
personnel with reasonable access to read meters as necessary to implement this
rationing plan. Where access is not readily available, the purveyor shall make
all reasonable efforts to contact customers in order to arrange for access to
read meters. In the event a water customer does not allow water purveyor
personnel entry to read the meter, after the purveyor has made reasonable
efforts to arrange for such access, the dwelling unit (household) allotment
will be reduced to 55 gallons per day.
   B.   Nonmetered Residential Water Customers and Allotments.
   (1)   In order to effectively implement and monitor the residential water
conservation effort, a water allotment shall be established for the entire
water system based on 40 gallons per day per capita served or 75 percent of the
water used by the entire system during the same quarter of the preceding year,
whichever is greater.
   (2)   The purveyor will establish a communication system with the customers
through public media to inform customers of the requirements of the Governor’s
proclamation and this local water rationing plan; possible conservation
measures that customers may employ; the system allotment; and a daily report of
whether the usage was within the allotment.
   C.   Metered and Nonmetered Residential Customers of the Same Water Supply
System. Where a water supply system serves both metered and nonmetered
residential customers, the allotments and procedures provided under both
paragraphs .A and .B shall be applied, as appropriate.
   D.   Variances and Exceptions.
   (1)   Where the residential water allotment provided under this Section
would create extraordinary hardship, as in the case of special health-related
requirements, the water customer may apply to the water supply purveyor for an
exemption or variance from these requirements. If the purveyor finds that the
allotment provided in this Section would impose extraordinary hardship, the
purveyor may establish a revised allotment for the particular customer. For
these purposes, an “extraordinary hardship” means a permanent damage to
property or economic loss which is substantially more severe than the
sacrifices borne by other water users subject to this water rationing plan.
   (2)   Any person aggrieved by a decision relating to such an exemption or
variance rendered by a water supply purveyor may file an appeal with the
Commonwealth Drought Coordinator who shall render a final decision pursuant to
4 Pa.Code, Chapter 120.
(Ord. 430, 9/9/1991, § 8)
§ 26-209.   Water Use Restrictions for Nonresidential Water Customers.
   1.   Nonresidential water customers include commercial, industrial,
institutional, and public users including, but not limited to, educational
facilities, hotels, motels, and restaurants. The term does not include
hospitals or health care facilities.
   2.   Nonresidential water customers shall reduce their water usage by a
minimum of 25 percent of use levels for the same quarter of the preceding year.
   3.   It is the primary responsibility of each nonresidential water customer
to meet its mandated water use reduction goal in whatever manner possible.
   4.   The water supply purveyor will establish a water allotment for each
nonresidential water customer, based upon a required 25 percent reduction of
water usage from the rate of water used by the customer in the same quarter of
the preceding year or the last recorded use level if no meter readings record
the rate of the customer’s use in the same quarter of the preceding year.
   5.   Each nonresidential water user shall provide access to water supply
purveyor personnel for purposes of meter reading and monitoring of compliance
with this Part. The water purveyor shall make all reasonable efforts to contact
customers to arrange for access.
   6.   A.   If the mandated 25 percent reduction in water usage cannot be
obtained without imposing extraordinary hardship threatening health and safety,
the nonresidential customer may apply to the water purveyor who provides the
customers’ service for a variance. For these purposes, “extraordinary hardship”
means a permanent damage to property or economic loss which is substantially
more severe than the sacrifices borne by other water users subject to this
water rationing plan. If the purveyor finds that the 25 percent reduction would
cause extraordinary hardship or threaten health or safety, the purveyor may
grant a variance and establish a revised water use reduction requirement for
the particular customer.
   B.   Any person aggrieved by a decision relating to such a variance rendered
by a water supply purveyor may appeal the decision to the Commonwealth Drought
Coordinator who shall render a final decision pursuant to 4 Pa.Code, Chapter
120.
(Ord. 430, 9/9/1991, § 9)
§ 26-210.   Enforcement of Water Rationing Plan.
   1.   The water supply purveyor will have lead responsibility for monitoring
of compliance with this water rationing plan.
   2.   Each water purveyor is authorized to alter meter reading schedules to
assure adequate monitoring of compliance with this Part.
   3.   The purveyor shall institute procedures to closely monitor supplies and
current usage to determine if reductions are being attained consistent with the
target figures established in the plan. A purveyor shall establish a mechanism
to advise the water users of the effects of rationing.
   4.   Proper law enforcement authorities and private citizens have additional
enforcement responsibilities and rights as specified in §
26-213 of this local water rationing plan.
(Ord. 430, 9/9/1991, § 10)
§ 26-211.   Service Interruptions.
   1.   Local water rationing plans shall include provisions for implementation
of temporary service interruptions if this action is necessary to achieve water
use reductions to prevent a public water supply system from depleting its on
hand water supply to the point that vital service demands including, but not
limited to, public health and safety, firefighting, and use of health care
facilities cannot be met.
   2.   The following provision shall govern the implementation of temporary
service interruptions:
   A.   In order to effectuate compliance with this Part, the water supply
purveyor is hereby authorized and required to plan and implement temporary
service interruptions to all or part of its water supply system, as the water
supply purveyor may deem appropriate, when any and/or all of the following
conditions are determined by each water supply purveyor to exist, as to its
water supply system:
   (1)   A 25 percent reduction in systemwide water usage has not been
achieved.
   (2)   The 25 percent reduction in systemwide water usage has been achieved,
but has failed to have a significant impact in extending limited water
supplies.
   (3)   Temporary service interruptions are necessary in order to further
extend limited and/or dwindling water supplies.
   B.   In the event that the water supply purveyor determines that temporary
service interruptions are necessary, the water supply purveyor shall notify its
customers through the public media (newspapers, radio, telephone, and
television) serving the customers of the water supply purveyor in its service
territory, at least one day prior to the temporary service interruptions, that
a planned, temporary service interruption is to be imposed.
   In addition, the water supply purveyor shall notify the Commonwealth Drought
Coordinator, the local coordinator of emergency management, local public health
authorities, the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency, the regional office
of the Department of Environmental Protection, and the Pennsylvania Public
Utility Commission, Bureau of Safety and Compliance, if the water supply
purveyor is subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission. [Ord. 489]
   Such notice shall:
   A.   State the day or days when the planned, temporary service interruptions
will occur.
   B.   State the time(s) when such planned, temporary service interruptions
will commence, and the time(s) such interruptions will cease.
   C.   State whether the planned, temporary service interruptions are to be
imposed on the entire system, or a part thereof, and, if only part(s) of the
system will experience planned, temporary service interruptions, identify the
geographical boundaries within which the planned, temporary service
interruptions will occur.
   D.   Advise all customers within the areas affected by planned, temporary
service interruptions how to treat any water received from the system, for
human consumption, during the period(s) of planned, temporary service
interruptions and for such additional time as may be necessary until full
pressure is restored to the system.
   C.   If the water supply purveyor imposes planned, temporary service
interruptions as authorized and required by this Part, it must provide for the
continued delivery of water to health care facilities within the area(s)
affected by such interruptions, by means of any adequate, alternative delivery
measures that may be necessary.
   D.   If the water supply purveyor implements planned, temporary service
interruptions, it must make provision, by any means possible, for the continued
delivery of such water, as may be necessary, for the proper operation of sewage
collection, treatment and disposal systems and facilities.
(Ord. 430, 9/9/1991, § 11; as amended by Ord. 489, 10/13/2014)
§ 26-212.   Excess Use Charges.
   Any residential or nonresidential water customer who exceeds the allotments
established pursuant to this Water Rationing Plan will be subject to the
following excess-use charge provisions:
   A.   Water supply purveyors in the emergency service area are directed to
collect an “excess-use charge” based on the amount by which a customer’s use
exceeds the water allotments established pursuant to the local water rationing
plan, computed in accordance with the following schedule:
 
Excess Usage Per Month                 Charge for Excess
First 2,000 gallons or portion thereof 5 times the actual rate charged for
                                       water
Each 1,000 gallons or portion thereof  10 times the actual rate charged for
thereaf ter                            water
 
      B.   Any monies collected by water supply purveyors through excess use
charges shall not be accounted for as income to the purveyor, but shall be
placed by the purveyor in a reserve account. The disposition of funds placed in
the reserve account shall be governed as follows:
   (1)   Funds collected by a public utility or a municipal corporation
rendering services beyond its corporate limits shall be disposed of as directed
by orders and procedures adopted by the Public Utility Commission.
   B.   Funds collected by a municipal authority or a municipal corporation or
other purveyor rendering services within its corporate limits shall be used to
offset drought-related costs or expenses as directed by the Pennsylvania
Emergency Management Council.
   C.   In addition to the excess use charge, noncompliance with the water
rationing plan will result in the following:
   (1)   For the first excess use, a warning of possible discontinuation shall
be issued to the customer by the water supply purveyor.
   (2)   For the second or subsequent excess use, the water supplier may
interrupt or shut off service to the customer for a period not to exceed 48
hours, or, if the customer provides access, the water supplier may install a
flow restriction in the customer’s service line for the duration of the
emergency. The cost incurred by the water purveyor to interrupt or shut off and
reinstate service, or to install and remove a flow restriction, shall be
assessed to the water customer by the water purveyor.
   (3)   Penalties as provided for in §
26-214 of this Part.
   D.   Any water customer aggrieved by a decision or action by a water
purveyor imposing an excess use charge or other remedy for noncompliance with
the requirements of this Part may proceed in accordance with the following
provisions:
   (1)   Each water purveyor shall adopt procedures which provide an
opportunity for the customer or aggrieved party to rebut the finding of a
violation, or evidence of circumstances beyond the customer’s control which
resulted in the violation. Each water purveyor shall keep a record of evidence
presented regarding disputed violations, and shall provide the customer or

or after the effective date of this Chapter, shall undergo a decrease in number
of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, number of employees or
other unit of measurement specified hereinafter for required off-street parking
or loading facilities, and together, when said decrease would result in a
requirement for fewer total off-street parking or loading spaces through
application of the provisions of this Chapter thereto, off-street parking and

least equal or exceed the off-street parking or loading requirements resulting
from application of the provisions of this Chapter to the entire building or
structure as modified.
   C.   When a building or structure undergoes any increase in number of
dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, or other unit of
measurement specified hereinafter for required off-street parking or loading
facilities, and further, when said increase would result in a requirement for
additional total off- street parking or loading spaces through application of
the provisions of this Chapter, parking and loading facilities shall be
increased so that the facilities will at least equal or exceed the off-street
parking or loading requirements resulting from application of the provisions of
this Chapter to the entire building or structure as modified.

abutting sidewalks in such a way or quantity that pedestrians using the
sidewalk would be detrimentally affected or inconvenienced. The Borough
Engineer shall approve all such facilities.
   10.   Walls or Planting Strip. Whenever a parking lot abuts onto a public

Part 13
Nonconforming Uses and Buildings
§ 27-1301.   Continuance.
   The lawful use of a building existing at the time of the effective date of
this Chapter may be continued, although such use does not conform to the
provisions hereof. If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use
of a building may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or a more
restricted classification. Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a
more restricted use or to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be
changed to a less restricted one. Whenever the use of a building becomes
nonconforming through a change in this Chapter or district boundaries, such use
may be continued and if no structural alterations are made, it may be changed
to another nonconforming use of the same or of a more restricted
classification.
(Ord. 385, 12/6/1982, § 1301)
§ 27-1302.   Discontinuance of Use.
   Whenever a nonconforming use of a building, structure or land, or part
thereof, has been discontinued for a period of 12 consecutive months, or for a
continuous period of 18 months if the building or land was originally designed
and constructed for a nonresidential use, such discontinuance shall constitute
an abandonment of such use. Where no enclosed building is involved,
discontinuance of a nonconforming use for a period of 6 months shall constitute
abandonment of such use, and any new use must be in conformity with the
regulations of the district. However, if the Zoning Hearing Board determines
the resumption of the discontinued use to be in harmony with the general intent
of this Chapter, it may grant a special exception permitting the resumption of
the discontinued use.
(Ord. 385, 12/6/1982, § 1302)
§ 27-1303.   Alterations.
   No existing building or premises devoted to a use not permitted in the
district in which such building or premises is located, except when required to
do so by law, or permitted by special exception, shall be enlarged, extended,
reconstructed, or structurally altered, unless such use is changed to a use
permitted in the district in which such building or premises is located.
(Ord. 385, 12/6/1982, § 1303)
§ 27-1304.   Provision for Reconstruction.
   Any building or structure containing a nonconforming use which is damaged by
fire, flood, wind, or other act of God or man to the extent of 75 percent or
more of its fair sales value immediately prior to damage shall not be repaired
or reconstructed, except in conformity with the provisions of this Chapter. In
the event that the Zoning Officer’s estimate of the extent of damage or fair
sales value is not acceptable to the applicant for the building permit to
repair or reconstruct such building or structure, the applicant may appeal to
the Zoning Hearing Board.
(Ord. 385, 12/6/1982, § 1304)
§ 27-1305.   Construction in Progress.
   No building or structure designed or intended to be utilized for a
nonconforming use shall be constructed or allowed unless construction is
already underway at the time of enactment or subsequent amendment of this
Chapter and is being diligently pursued so that such building or structure will
be completed within 18 months from the date of the enactment or subsequent
amendment of this Chapter. All outstanding building permits for construction
which do not meet these requirements are hereby rendered null and void.
(Ord. 385, 12/6/1982, § 1305)
§ 27-1306.   Historical Landmarks.
   The provisions of this Part shall not apply to any building or structure
which is designated by the Zoning Hearing Board to be a “historical landmark.”
(Ord. 385, 12/6/1982, § 1306)
§ 27-1307.   Extensions and Enlargements.
   The Zoning Hearing Board may grant special exceptions permitting the
reasonable extension of a nonconforming use or the reasonable enlargement or
addition to a nonconforming building or structure; provided, it would be in
conformity with the standards hereinafter set forth for granting special
exceptions.

completed.
   G.   Swimming pools and garages must also be inspected twice.
   3.   After completion of a building or structure for which a building permit
has been issued and inspection has determined that all requirements of all
codes and ordinances of the Borough have been met, a certificate of occupancy
whenever required shall be issued by the Zoning Officer, stating that the land
or building and proposed use thereof complies with the provisions of this
Chapter.
   4.   No nonconforming use shall be maintained, renewed, or changed without a

for at the same time as the application for a building permit. Said certificate
will be issued within 10 days after the erection of alteration and inspection,
if the building or use is found to be in accordance with all codes and
ordinances.

occupancy. Copies will be furnished upon request to any person having
proprietary or tenancy interest in the building affected.

   1.   A Zoning Hearing Board is hereby established. The Board shall consist
of three members, all of whom shall be appointed by the Borough Council. The
term of office of the members of the Board shall be for 3 years, excepting that
the membership of the first Board shall consist of the present Zoning Hearing
Board for the unexpired balance of their terms until the expiration of each
term on the first day of January of the next 3 years. Thereafter, members shall

regulations as it may deem necessary to carry into effect the provisions of
this Chapter.
   3.   Meetings of the Board shall be held at the call of the Chairman and at
such other times as the Board may determine. The Chairman, or in his absence
the acting Chairman, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of
witnesses. All meetings of the Board shall be open to the public. The Board

(Ord. 385, 12/6/1982, § 1601)
§ 27-1602.   Powers and Duties.
   1.   Powers Relative to Error. To hear and decide appeals where it is
alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination
made by the Zoning Officer in the enforcement of this Chapter, including any
order requiring an alleged violator to stop, cease and desist.
   2.   Powers Relative to Variations. When it is alleged that the provisions
of this Chapter inflict unnecessary hardship upon the applicant, the Board may
grant a variance if the following conditions are found relevant in a given
case:
   A.   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions including
irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property
and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions, and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of this Chapter
in the neighbor hood or district in which the property is located.
   B.   That because of such physical circumstances or conditions there is no
possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of this Chapter and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
   C.   That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the applicant.
   D.   That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, not be detrimental to the public welfare.
   E.   That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance
that will afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of
the regulation in issue.
   In granting any variances, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions
and safeguards as it may deem necessary.
   3.   Powers Relative to Special Exceptions.
   A.   Upon appeal, the Board shall be empowered, to permit the following
special exceptions, in addition to those otherwise specifically set forth in
other Parts of this Chapter.
   B.   To permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of a
district divides a lot of record in single ownership.
   C.   To permit the reconstruction of a nonconforming building which has been
damaged by explosion, fire, act of God, or the public enemy to the extent of
less than 75 percent of its fair market sales value when the Board finds some
compelling public necessity requiring a continuance of the nonconforming use.
   D.   To interpret the provisions of this Chapter where the street layout
actually on the ground varies from the street layout as shown on the map fixing
the several districts, which map is attached to and made a part of this
Chapter.
   E.   To vary parking regulations of this Chapter whenever the character or
use of the building is such as to make unnecessary the full provision of
parking facilities or when such regulations would impose an unreasonable
hardship upon the use of the lot, as contrasted with merely granting an
advantage or a conve nience.
   4.   Challenge to the Validity of Any Ordinance or Map. The Zoning Hearing
Board shall hear challenges to the validity of a zoning ordinance or map except
as indicated in § 1003 and § 1004(1)(b) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code, 53 P.S. §§ 11003, 11004(1)(b). In all such challenges, the
Zoning Hearing Board shall take evidence and make a record thereon as provided
in §
27-1603 of this Chapter. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall
decide all contested questions and shall make findings on all relevant issues
of fact which shall become part of the record on appeal to the court.
   5.   Exercise of Powers. In exercising the above powers, the Board may, in
conformity with the provisions of this Chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or
partly, or may modify the order, requirement decision or determination as ought
to be made and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom
the appeal is taken. In considering all appeals to this Chapter, the Board
shall, before making any finding in a specific case, first determine that the
proposed change will not permit a nonpermitted use for the district and will
not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, or
increase the danger of fire, or materially diminish or impair established
property values within the surrounding area, or in any other respect impair the
public health, safety, comfort, morals, and welfare of the Borough. Every
change granted or denied by the Board shall be accompanied by a written finding
of fact based on sworn testimony and evidence, specifying the reason for
granting or denying the variance or special exception. The decision of the
Board shall be made a part of any building permit or occupancy certificate in
which a variance or special exception is allowed.
   6.   Condition. In arriving at its decision, the Board may impose reasonable
conditions, restrictions or safeguards in the furtherance of the general intent
of this Chapter, including requiring a bond to assure compliance with such
conditions, restrictions or safeguards.
   7.   Required Action. The concurring vote of a majority of the members of
the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or
determination of the Zoning Officer, or to decide in favor of the applicant on
any matter upon which it is required to pass under this Chapter, or to allow
any variance or special exception under this Chapter.
   8.   Appeal from Action of the Board. Any person aggrieved by any decision
of the Zoning Hearing Board or any taxpayer or the Borough Council may appeal
to the Court of Common Pleas by petition duly verified, setting forth that such
decision is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in
accordance with law, and specifying the grounds relied upon.
(Ord. 385, 12/6/1982, § 1602)
§ 27-1603.   Procedure.

such other time as allowed under the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,
53 P.S. § 10101 et seq., by filing with the Zoning Officer and the Board a
notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The Zoning Officer shall
forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the record upon
which the action appealed from is taken.
   2.   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from, unless the Zoning Officer certifies to the Board after the
notice of appeal was filed with him that by reason of the facts stated in the
certificate a stay would be, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or
property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a
restraining order which may be granted by the Board or by a court of record on
application, on notice to the Zoning Officer and due cause shown.
   3.   The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal
(within 45 days of the date the appeal was filed). A public notice of such
hearing shall be published once each week for 2 successive weeks in a newspaper

the date of the hearing. A similar notice shall be given to all parties who
have stated an interest in said hearing and a notice of said hearing shall also

rendered within 45 days after the hearing, or if such hearing is continued
within 45 days after such continued hearing. Upon the hearing, any party may
appear in person or by agent or by attorney.
   4.   Upon receipt of an appeal or petition involving a variance or special
exception and before conducting a hearing thereupon, the Board shall refer the
matter to the Planning Commission/Committee for its recommendation, unless the
Board decides that such reference is inappropriate. The Planning Commission/
Committee shall report the result of its study to the Board within 10 days
following its receipt of the appropriate documents. If no such report is filed
with the Zoning Hearing Board, the Board shall assume that the Planning
Commission/Committee has acted favorably; but, in any event the recommendation
of the Planning Commission/Committee shall be advisory, and not obligatory,
upon the Zoning Hearing Board.
   5.   The Board may also hear all challenges to the validity of this Chapter
or Map under the provisions of § 910 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10910. Any landowner who desires to challenge on
substantive grounds the validity of an ordinance or map or any provision
thereof, which prohibits or restricts the use or development of land in which
he has an interest may submit a curative amendment to the governing body with a
written request that his challenge and proposed amendment be heard and decided
under § 609.1 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §
10609.1. The Board or the governing body shall, in such cases, comply with all
requirements set forth in the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53

accompanied by findings of fact and conclusions based thereon together with the
reasons therefor. Conclusions based on any provision of this act or of any
ordinance, rule or regulation shall contain a reference to the provision relied
on and the reasons of the facts found. If the hearing is conducted by a hearing
officer and there has been on stipulation that his decision or findings are
final, the Board shall make his report and recommendations available to the
parties and the Board shall make a final decision and entry of findings.
   J.   If the Board fails to render its decision or findings within 45 days
after the last hearing, or fails to hold a requested hearing within 60 days
after the appli cant’s request for a hearing, the decision shall be deemed to
have been rendered in favor of the applicant, unless the applicant has agreed,
in writing, to an extension of time. When a decision has been rendered in favor
of the applicant because of the failure of the Board to meet or render a
decision as hereinabove provided, the Borough shall give public notice of said
decision within 10 days in the same manner as provided in paragraph .A of this
subsection. Nothing in this subsection shall prejudice the right of any party
opposing the application to urge that such decision is erroneous.

findings shall be delivered to the applicant personally or mailed to him not
later than the day following its date. To all other persons who have filed

believed that there was no such violation, in which event there shall be deemed
to have been only one such violation until the fifth day following the date of
the determination of a violation by the magisterial district judge and
thereafter each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate
violation.
