FOREWORD
History
This comprises the codification of the ordinances of the Borough of Marysville.
The Borough of Marysville was incorporated as the Borough of Haley by the Act
of 1866, P.L. 870, and the name changed to "Marysville" by the Act of 1867,
P.L. 261, No. 244.
The Code of Ordinances of the Borough of Marysville was prepared by Penns
Valley Publishers, a division of Fry Communications, Inc.:and adopted by the
Borough of Marysville Borough Council on May 10, 2004 by Ordinance Number 553.
Organization
The Code contains four parts which are (1) the valid current ordinances of the
Borough of Marysville contained in Chapters 1 through 27, (2) the Appendix,
which lists by abstracted title all ordinances of a temporary or "one time"
nature, (3) the Key to the disposition of each ordinance ever enacted by the
Borough of Marysville, and (4) the Index, which is an alphabetical arrangement
of subjects.
In the Code each Chapter is separated by a divider tab, and specific ordinances
can be located by subject on the contents page at the beginning of each
Chapter. The Index may also be used to search for a subject when one is looking
for general information on a particular subject, or if it is not known in which
Chapter the subject might be found. The Appendix consists of several general
categories containing a chronological listing of short subject descriptions
along with a reference to the original ordinance and its date of enactment, if
known.
The Key to disposition indicates what action has been taken by the Borough of
Marysville Borough Council with regard to every ordinance ever enacted. An
ordinance has either been (1) specifically repealed, (2) superseded by another
ordinance, (3) is located in a Chapter of the Code book, or (4) is located in
the Appendix. Annual tax rate and budget ordinances are located only in the
Key. The Key is a cross reference to the original ordinance books of the
Borough of Marysville, and to the location within the Code of each ordinance by
number.

Applicant shall pay all reasonable and necessary charges above the application fee by the Borough's

legal review.

1.   The applicant shall be required to pay into an escrow a sum equal to the established fee before
any further action may be taken by the Borough in review of the plan. Failure to pay such sum into
escrow in a timely fashion shall result in disapproval of the plan and any fees due for work
associated with the first review letter shall remain due and payable.
2.   Such escrow shall be used for the reasonable and necessary charges incurred by the Borough for
review of the plan by the appropriate professional consultants, including the Borough Engineer. Such
charges shall be reasonable and in accordance with the ordinary and customary charges to the Borough
for such services and may not be based on hourly rates in excess of those charged by the Borough
Engineer and his or her staff as set forth in the retainer agreement between the Borough and the
Borough Engineer, for services for which reimbursement from applicants is sought.
3.   The Borough shall deduct from the escrow each month the current and/or outstanding charges for
plan review by the Borough Engineer and staff, and shall send a statement each month to the
developer setting forth the amount of such deduction and the services for which such deductions were
made. Any dispute over the amount of such review fees shall be resolved according to procedures set
forth in 53 P.S. 10503(1), or its successor.
4.   If, after completion of a portion of the plan review, the Engineer determines that the cost of
review is likely to exceed the original escrow amount, then the Engineer shall calculate such amount
and shall notify the Borough applicant directly in writing and the applicant shall, within 7 days of
receipt of the Engineer's letter, supplement the escrow in the additional amount determined by the
Engineer. Failure of the applicant to do so shall result in the disapproval of the plan. If, after
review of the plan is completed, any funds remain in the plan review escrow, such funds shall be
returned to the applicant only if the plan is disapproved. If the plan is approved, such funds shall
be credited to the engineering inspection fee escrow described below.
                                                                                      
Engineering Inspection Fee                                                             
1.   The applicant shall, by date not less than 5 days before the first Council meeting at which the
applicant's plan is considered by Council, pay into escrow a sum determined by the Borough Engineer
to represent the reasonable estimated cost of the following:
   A.   Inspection of the site layout by the Borough Engineer or by an appropriate member of the
Borough Engineer's staff.
   B.   Inspection by the Borough Engineer or by an appropriate member of the Borough Engineer's
staff of improvements, infrastructure and structures, during and after construction.
   C.   Final inspection by the Borough Engineer or by an appropriate member of the Borough
Engineer's staff upon completion of installation of required improvements, infrastructures and
structures.
   D.   Other engineering verifications, inspections and/or administrative tasks by the Borough
Engineer or by an appropriate member of the Borough Engineer's staff or required by Borough
ordinance or under State or Federal law, in connection with the application or development.
2.   Such estimates shall include the reasonable and necessary charges incurred by the Borough for
such inspections and other required tasks by the appropriate professional consultants, including the
Borough Engineer. Such charges shall be reasonable and in accordance with the ordinary and customary
charges to the Borough for such services and may not be based on hourly rates in excess of those
charged by the Borough Engineer and his or her staff as set forth in the retainer agreement between
the Borough and the Borough Engineer for services for which reimbursement from applicants is not
sought.
3.   The Borough shall deduct from the escrow each month the current and/or outstanding charges for
inspections and other required tasks by the Borough Engineer and staff and shall send a statement
each month to the developer setting forth the amount of such deduction and the services for which
such deductions were made. Any dispute over the amount of such inspection fees shall be resolved
according to procedures set forth in 53 P.S. 10510(g), or its successor.
4.   If after the completion of a portion of the inspections, the Borough Engineer determines that
the cost of the further required inspections is likely to exceed the original escrow amount, then
the Engineer shall calculate such amount and shall notify the applicant directly in writing, and the
applicant shall, within 7 days of receipt of the Engineer's letter, supplement the escrow in the
additional amount determined by the Engineer. Failure of the applicant to do so shall result in the
issuance of a stop work order, which shall remain in effect until such payment is received by the
Borough. If, after such inspections are completed, any funds remain in the engineering inspection
fee escrow, such funds shall be returned to the applicant only if all of the applicant's other
financial obligations to the Borough are fully discharged. If the applicant's other financial
obligations to the Borough are not fully discharged, such funds shall be applied to the discharged
of such obligation(s).

Purpose: Permit and related fees are collected to cover the costs of permit applications, plan
review, park and recreation improvements, the issuance of the permits, required site inspections and
certificate of occupancy. Fees set forth herein are intended to cover the cost of one inspection. If
additional inspections are necessary due to the applicant's failure to meet required standards, or
for any other reason not attributable to the Borough, additional fees may be charged, and if charged
shall reflect the Borough's actual additional cost for such inspections.
Estimated Value of Construction: "Estimated value" means the reasonable costs, as determined by the
Code Enforcement Officer, of all services, labor, materials and use of equipment entering into and
necessary to the prosecution and completion of the work. The following average square foot
construction costs shall be used to compute the "estimated value" of construction by multiplying per
square foot construction cost by the total square footage of area for the proposed use.
The fee for a zoning permit shall be $5.00 per $1,000 of construction cost, with a $50 minimum fee.
Construction cost shall be determined by the most recent National Building Valuation Data Report as
published by International Code Council.

The fee for filing of an appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board, or for an application for variance, or

appellant or applicant and shall require reimbursement to the Borough of Marysville for such excess
costs. [Res. 245]

to return to her position as an employee of the Borough at the end of the term
of allowed disability and non-disability maternity and child bearing leave.
During periods of actual medical disability, as certified by the employee's
doctors, before or after the birth of a child, the employee will be eligible
for all sick leave benefits, medical insurance benefits and disability income
benefits normally provided by the Borough to employees disabled by reason of
illness and as defined in the Borough's sick leave policies.
In addition to disability leave as a result of maternity and child bearing, an
employee will be entitled to non-disability maternity and child bearing leave
for a period of 6 months less the period of time during which the employee is
on disability leave. During such non-disability maternity and child bearing
leave, an employee shall not be paid a salary or be entitled to any fringe
benefits, but shall continue to accrue seniority. Employees on such leave will
be permitted to continue participation in the Borough's insured fringe benefit
programs by remitting the amount of premiums normally paid by the Borough at
least 10 days prior to the due date for remittance of such premium by the
Borough to the insurance company.
An employee on leave shall renotify the Borough Manager, in writing, of such
employee's desire to be reinstated at least 30 days prior to her intended date
of return. The Borough will offer that employee, if the position is available,
the job previously held or one equivalent to it. Once an employee on leave
voluntarily sets a return date, that date may not be altered except by
certification of continued medical disability by the employee's physician.
The Borough may request a doctor's certificate at any time during the period of
an employee's claimed disability.
To reiterate, it is the intent of this policy that the maximum time period of
leave allowed to an employee for maternity and child bearing leave shall be 6
months, unless the employee is certified as totally disabled by her doctor for
a period greater than 6 months, in which event the period of leave shall be
equal to the period of certified disability.

PART 11
VIOLATION TICKETS
§1-1101.   Purpose.
This Part shall be known and cited as the Violation Tickets Ordinance of the
Borough of Marysville. The purpose of the Ordinance is to allow the Borough of
Marysville (the “Borough”) to issue tickets instead of citations for certain
alleged violations of the Marysville Borough Code (the “Code”). A person who
does not dispute violating the Code may pay the ticket instead of requiring the
Borough to issue a citation, which must be litigated in an often costly and
lengthy legal proceeding before a Magisterial District Judge. Accordingly, the
Borough may maintain and enforce its laws and the Code while a person alleged
to have violated the Code may resolve that matter without the necessity of the
issuance of a citation and a hearing before the Magisterial District Judge.
This process will also preserve the person’s right to dispute the alleged
violation of the Code, and to receive the full benefit of procedural and
substantive due process of law.
(Ord. 634, 12/14/2020)
§1-1102.   Definitions.
The following definitions apply to this Part:
OWNER: Any person, agent, operator, firm, corporation, association, or
partnership, or other legal entity having a legal or equitable interest in the
property, or has a recorded title interest to the property as the same may have
been recorded in the official records of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the
County of Perry, or the Borough, including, without limitation, the guardian of
an estate, and the executor or administrator of the estate of a person if
ordered to take possession of real property by a court of competent
jurisdiction.
PERSON: Any individual, firm, corporation, association, partnership, limited
liability company or other legal entity.
VIOLATOR: An owner or person claiming an interest in the subject property
through the owner, including, without limitation, a tenant, who has been
alleged to have violated the applicable provisions of the Code, as set forth in
more detail herein, as amended from time to time by resolution of the Borough.
In the event a tenant or nonowner-occupant of the subject property has caused
the violation of the Code and the issuance of a violation ticket for such
violation, the Borough may pursue the tenant, the legal and/or equitable owner
of the subject property, or both in accordance with this chapter, the Code, and
all other applicable local, state, and federal laws, rules, ordinances, and/or
regulations.
(Ord. 634, 12/14/2020)

   C.   Any violation of the provisions of any chapter of the Code set forth in
this Part, or which may be hereafter added to the provisions of this Part by
resolution of the Council as set forth above, may be cause for a violation
ticket to be issued to the violator.
   D.   Service of the violation ticket upon the violator may be accomplished
in any of the following manners:
      1.   Personal service by handing the violation ticket to the violator or

continues or is permitted to continue shall constitute a separate offense for
which a separate violation ticket may be issued and a fine imposed.

1-1103 D.1. through D.3. herein, to pay the amount of the violation ticket. If
the amount of the violation ticket is not paid within 10 days of service of the
same, such failure to pay shall result in the issuance of a citation for the
offense as enumerated on the violation ticket, or any other remedy available to
the Borough.
   B.   The person in receipt of a violation ticket may, within 10 days from
the service of the same, provide written notice to the Borough Manager that the
person disputes the issuance of the violation ticket. In such event, the
Council shall, at its next regularly scheduled, public meeting, allow the
person to address Council with his or her concerns regarding the violation
ticket. Council shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, approve or deny the
person’s appeal.

PART 1
DISORDERLY CONDUCT
§ 6-101.   Disorderly Conduct Prohibited.
   1.   Disorderly conduct, as defined in §5503 of the Crimes Code, 18
Pa.C.S.A. §5503, is hereby prohibited within the Borough of Marysville. A
person is guilty of disorderly conduct if, with intent to cause public
inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof he or
she:
      A.   Engages in fighting or threatening, or in violent or tumultuous
behavior.
      B.   Makes unreasonable noise.
      C.   Creates a hazardous or physically offensive condition by any act
which serves no legitimate purpose of the actor.
   2.   Provided, as used in this Section, the word "public" means affecting or
likely to affect persons in a place to which the public or a substantial group
has access. Among the places included are streets, alleys and sidewalks,
transport facilities, schools, prisons, apartment houses, places of business or
amusement, any neighborhood or any premises which are open to the public.
(Ord. 553, 5/10/2004, §1)
§ 6-102.   Penalty for Violation.
Any person who shall violate any provision of this Part shall, upon conviction
thereof, be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $600 plus costs and, in
default of payment of said fine and costs, to a term of imprisonment not to
exceed 30 days, or both.
(Ord. 553, 5/10/2004, §1)
PART 2
CURFEW
§ 6-201.   Short Title.
This Part shall be known and may be cited as the Borough of Marysville "Curfew
Ordinance."
(Ord. 346, 2/4/1980, §1)
§ 6-202.   Purposes and Findings.
This is a Curfew Ordinance prescribing, in accordance with prevailing community
standards, regulations for the conduct of minors on streets at night, for the
protection of younger children in the Borough from each other and from other
persons on the streets during nighttime hours, for the enforcement of parental
control and responsibility for their children, for the protection of the public
from nocturnal mischief by minors and for the reduction of the incidence of
juvenile criminal activity, all for the good of minors, the furtherance of
family responsibility, and the public good, safety and welfare.
      A.   Council finds that a curfew is a very real local need, necessary as
a significant factor and tool to minimize juvenile delinquency in light of
Marysville's local situation and facts: (1) the Borough is primarily a
residential area, (2) there is a general community sense of the need of
cessation, at the proper time, of outdoor activities of minors on the streets,
reflected in the curfew hours declared by this a Part. The curfew also takes
into consideration nocturnal crime and juvenile mischief that may occur after
the curfew hours. (3) Council finds that Marysville Borough is not overcrowded.
Recreational areas are provided in the Borough; however, these facilities are
generally closed for usage at times when the activities which this Part
attempts to prevent occur.
      B.   Council finds that parental responsibility for the whereabouts of
children is the noun and, as parental control decreases the likelihood of
juvenile delinquency increases, there is a need for nocturnal curfew for minors
that will achieve the purposes stated in this Section.
(Ord. 346, 2/4/1980, §2)
§ 6-203.   Definitions.
   1.   For the purpose of this Part the following terms, phrases, words and
their derivations, shall have the meaning given herein:
      BOROUGH - the Borough of Marysville, Perry County, Pennsylvania, with
administrative offices at Overcrest Road, P.O. Box "A," Marysville,
Pennsylvania 17053.
      MINOR - any person under 18 years of age.
      PARENT - any person having legal custody of a minor (1) as a natural or
adoptive parent, (2) as a legal guardian, (3) as a person who stands in loco
parentis, or (4) as a person to whom legal custody has been given by order of
court.
      REMAIN - to stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily upon the
streets, including the congregating of groups (of interacting minors) totaling
four or more persons in which any minor involved would not be using the streets
for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or going home. The phrase
"be or remain" is intended to be interpreted in the same way as in Baker v.
Borough of Steelton, 17 Dauph. 17 (1912).
      STREET - a legal right of way of whatsoever nature, open to the use of
the public for purposes of vehicular travel, or in the case of a sidewalk
thereof for pedestrian travel and includes, but is not limited to, the legal
right-of-way, the cartway of traffic lanes, the curb, the sidewalks, whether
paved or unpaved and any grass plots or other grounds found within the legal
right-of-way of a street.
      TIME OF NIGHT - referred to herein is based upon the prevailing standard
of time, whether Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Saving Time,
generally observed at that hour by the public in the Borough, and prima facie
shall be the time then observed in the Borough Office and police station.
      YEAR OF AGE - continues from one birthday, such as the 17th to (but not
including the day of) the next, such as the 18th birthday, making it clear that
"under 18 years of age" herein is treated as equivalent to 17 or less years of
age.
   2.   When not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense
include the future, words in the plural number include the singular and words
in the singular number include the plural. The word "shall" is always mandatory
and not merely directory.
(Ord. 346, 2/4/1980, §3)
§ 6-204.   Curfew of Minors.
It shall be unlawful for any person under 18 years of age to be or remain in or
upon the streets within the Borough of Marysville at night during the period
ending at 6 a.m. and beginning :
      A.   At 10 p.m. for minors under 14 years of age.
      B.   At 11 p.m. for minors between 14 and 18 years of age. (Ord. 346, 2/
4/1980, §4)
§ 6-205.   Exceptions.
In the following exceptional cases a minor on a Borough street during the
nocturnal hours fixed by §6-204 shall not be considered in violation of this
Part.
      A.   When accompanied by a parent of such minor
      B.   When accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor to
take said parent's place in accompanying said minor for a designated period of
time and purpose within a specified area.
      C.   When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United
States Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech
and the right of assembly. Such minor shall evidence the bona fide nature of
such exercise by first delivering to the Borough Police Station a written
communication, signed by such minor and countersigned, if practicable, by a
parent of such minor with the parent's home address and telephone number,
addressed to the Mayor of the Borough, specifying when, where and in what
manner said minor will be on the streets at night (during hours when this Part
is otherwise applicable to said minor) in the exercise of a First Amendment
right specified in such communication.
      D.   When there is reasonable necessity that the minor be out on the
streets, but only after such minor's parent has communicated to Borough Police
Station personnel facts establishing such reasonable necessity, and specifying
the route, designated time, the described purpose and points of origin and
destination. A copy of such communication, or of the police record thereof,
duly certified by the Police Station personnel to be correct, with an
appropriate notation of the time it was received and of the names and address
of such parent and minor, shall be admissible evidence.
      E.   When the minor is on the sidewalk of the place where such minor
resides, or on the sidewalk of either of the minor's next-door neighbors who
have not communicated an objection to the police officer.
      F.   When returning home, by a direct route from (and within 30 minutes
of the termination of) a school activity, or an activity of a religious or
other voluntary association, of which prior notice, indicating the place and
probable time of termination, has been given in writing to, and duly filed for
immediate reference by the Chief of Police or the officer assigned by him on
duty at the police station, thus encouraging (here as in other exceptional
situations) conduct on the part of minors involved in such activities and
striking a fair balance among somewhat conflicting interests.
      G.   When authorized, by special permit from the Mayor, carried on the
person of the minor thus authorized, as follows: When necessary nighttime
activities of a minor may be inadequately provided for by other provisions of
this Part, then recourse may be had to the Mayor of the Borough, either for a
regulation as provided in subsection (H) or for a special permit as the
circumstances warrant. Upon the Mayor's finding of necessity for the use of the
streets to the extent warranted by a written application (as judicially
approved in People v. Walton, 161 P.2d 498, 503-503, (Cal. App. 1945), signed
by a minor and by a parent of such minor if feasible stating (1) the name, age
and address of such minor, (2) the name, address and telephone number of a
parent thereof, (3) the height, weight, sex, color of eyes and hair and other
physical characteristics of such minor, (4) the necessity which requires such
minor to remain upon the streets during the curfew hours otherwise applicable,
and (5) the street or route and the beginning and ending of the period of time
involved by date and hour, the Mayor may grant a permit in writing for the use
by such minor of such streets and at such hours as in the Mayor's opinion may
reasonably be necessary. In an emergency this may be handled by telephone, or
other effective communication, with a corresponding record being made
contemporaneously, either to the Mayor, or if available, to the police officer
authorized by the Mayor to act on his behalf in an emergency, at the police
station.
      H.   When authorized by regulation issued by the Mayor, the Mayor may
promulgate regulations designating "reasonable necessity" handled similarly to
§
6-205(G) but adapted to necessary night time activities of more minors that can
readily be dealt with on an individual, special permit basis. Normally such
regulation by the Mayor permitting use of the streets should be issued
sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicity through news media and
through other agencies such as the schools and shall define the activity, the
scope of the use of the streets permitted, the period of time involved not to
extend more than 30 minutes beyond the time for termination of such activity,
and the reason for finding that such regulation is reasonably necessary to
implement the purposes of this Part.
      I.   When the minor carries a certified card of employment, renewable
each calendar month, dated or re-issued not more than 45 days previously,
signed by the Mayor and briefly identifying the minor, the addresses of his
home and of his place of employment, and his hours of employment.
      J.   When the minor is, with parental consent, in a motor vehicle. This
contemplates normal travel. From excess of caution, this clearly exempts bona
fide interstate movement through Marysville, and also exempts interstate travel
beginning or ending in Marysville.
      K.   When the minor is 17 years of age, if and when the Mayor shall have
determined, by formal rule first reported to and approved by Council, reported
in its minutes and the press, finding: (1) the facts as to the extent (minimal)
of juvenile delinquency in such age group permitting such rule; (2) that,
currently, such rule is in the best interests of said minors and of the
Borough; and (3) that this Part should be relaxed; then the Mayor by such
formal rule, covering a period of time designated therein or until decision
thereof not exceeding 1 year from the date thereof, may take appropriate action
excepting designated minors, minors in a defined group or area, or all minors
(as the current facts may warrant) 17 years of age at that date or attaining 17
years of age during the period that such formal rule is and remains in effect.
      L.   Each of the foregoing exceptions, and their several limitations,
such as provisions for notification, are severable. Additional exceptions may
be considered by Council as warranted by future experience illuminated by the
views of student government associations, school personnel, citizens,
association, neighborhood spokesmen, parents, officers and persons in authority
concerned positively with minors as well as with juvenile delinquency.
(Ord. 346, 2/4/1980, §5)
§ 6-206.   Parental Responsibility.
It shall be unlawful for a parent having legal custody of a minor knowingly to
permit, or by insufficient control to allow, such minor to be or remain upon
any Borough street under circumstances not constituting an exception to, or
otherwise beyond the scope of, this Part. The term "knowingly" includes
knowledge which a parent should reasonably be expected to have concerning the
whereabouts of a minor in that parent's legal custody. This Section is intended
to require neglectful or careless parents to conform to reasonable community
standards of parental responsibility through an objective test. It shall be no
defense that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities, conduct or
whereabouts of such minor
(Ord. 346, 2/4/1980, §6)
§ 6-207.   Police Procedures.
A policeman of the Borough, upon finding or having his attention called to any
minor on the streets in prima facie violation of this Part, normally shall take
the minor to the Borough Police Station, where a parent shall immediately be
notified to come for such minor. At the police station the ranking officer on
duty shall ascertain the relevant facts, under constitutional safeguards, and
assume responsibility for accurate, effective, fair, impartial and uniform
enforcement. Said ranking officer on duty shall, within 24 hours, file a
written report with the Chief.
      A.   In the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate, a
policeman on the street shall in the first instance use his best judgment in
determining age.
      B.   When a parent, immediately called, has come to take charge of the
minor, and the appropriate information has been recorded, the minor shall be
released to the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be located, or
fails to take charge of the minor, then the minor shall be released to the
juvenile authorities, except to the extent that in accordance with police
regulations, approved in advance by juvenile authorities, the minor temporarily
may be entrusted to a relative, neighbor or other person who shall on behalf of
a parent assume the responsibility of caring for the minor pending the
availability or arrival of a parent.
      C.   In the case of a first violation by a minor, the Chief of Police
shall by certified mail send to a parent written notice of said violation with
a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of this
Part, including enforcement of parental responsibility and of applicable
penalties.
(Ord. 346, 2/4/1980, §7)
§ 6-208.   Penalties.
Prevailing community standards about the time when minors should be off the
streets, are reflected in this Part. The penalties for violation are as
follows:
      A.   If, after written notice pursuant to §6-207(C) of a first violation
by a minor, a parent violates §6-206 (in connection with a second violation by
said minor) this shall be treated as a first offense by the parent. For such
first parental offense a parent shall be fined $100 and for each subsequent
offense by a parent the fine shall be increased by an additional $50, e.g.,
$150 for the second, $200 for the third offense, to a maximum of $600 per
offense plus costs. The District Justice, upon finding a parent guilty, shall
sentence the parent to pay such fine and the costs of prosecution, and upon
refusal to pay such fine and costs, to be imprisoned in the Perry County Jail
for a period not exceeding 30 days, or both. [Ord. 553]
      B.   Any minor who shall violate any of the provisions of this Part more
than 3 times shall be reported by the Chief of Police to a society or
organization whose purpose it is to take charge of incorrigibles and
delinquents, and proceedings shall then be taken, under the Juvenile Act, 42
Pa.C.S.A. §6301 et seq., before the Juvenile Court for the treatment,
supervision and rehabilitation of such minor
      C.   A like procedure, before the juvenile authorities, shall be followed
in any case where the imposing of a fine or fines upon a parent shall not be
effective, or where for any other reason the provisions of this Part cannot be
made effective by the imposition of penalties under this Section.
(Ord. 346, 2/4/1980, §8; as amended by Ord. 553, 5/10/2004, §1)
§ 6-209.   Construction.
Severability is intended throughout and within the provisions of this Part. In
the event any provision, term, phrase, Section, sentence, clause or Part of
this Part or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall be
held to be invalid, such invalidity shall not affect or impair any remaining
provision, Section, sentence, clause or ordinance, it being the intent of the
Borough that such remainder shall be and remain in full force and effect. The
Mayor is authorized to give advisory opinions, in writing or immediately
reduced to writing, interpreting terms, phrases, parts or any provisions, which
shall be binding, and shall be adhered to by the police, until this Part is
amended in such respect. Normally, such advisory opinions shall be in response
to good faith, signed letters addressed to him at the Borough administration
building, questioning (A) as ambiguous, (B) as having a potentially chilling
effect on constitutional rights, specifically constitutional rights
specifically invoked, or (C) as otherwise invalid in all three categories with
respect to proposed conduct definitely described. This administrative remedy
must be exhausted prior to presenting to any court a question in any of said
three categories. Borough Council does not intend a result that is absurd,
impossible of execution, or unreasonable. It is intended that this Part be held
inapplicable in such cases, if any, where its application would be
unconstitutional. A constitutional construction is intended and shall be given.
Borough Council does not intend to violate the Constitution of the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania or the Constitution of the United States of America.
(Ord. 346, 2/4/1980, §9)
PART 3

meanings, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning-
   ALARM - circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or

to obstruct ingress or egress to and from any private or public facility or the
act of standing, sitting, lying or idling in and about any street, sidewalk,
walls, steps, overpass, or public or private place under circumstances that
warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity.
   VICINITY - vicinity shall be deemed to include, to the fullest extent
permitted and as reasonable under the circumstances, any point within 100 feet
of a facility necessary to control the effective dispelling of an alarm for
safety of persons or property, prevention of disruption of activities in which
such facility specializes and minimization of trespassing.

§ 6-303.   Arrest Procedure.
   1.   Prior to arrest or conviction under §
6-302(A), if practicable and unless flight by the actor or other circumstances
make it impracticable, a police officer shall afford the actor an opportunity
to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by requesting said
actor to identify himself or herself and explain his or her presence and
conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this Part if it
appears at the hearing that the explanation given by the actor was true and, if
believed by the police officer at the time, would have dispelled the alarm.
   2.   A police officer, acting reasonably and objectively, may require
persons violating §
6-302(C), to disperse. If reasonably necessary to dispel any alarm which would
otherwise be warranted, a police officer may clear the area of such persons,
causing those who fail or refuse to leave to be taken to the police station.
   3.   If any persons are taken to the police station, the ranking officer on
duty shall ascertain relevant facts, under constitutional safeguards, and
assume centralized responsibility for accurate, effective, fair, impartial and
uniform enforcement. Such persons may thereupon be permitted to return or be

alarm for the safety of persons or property in the area affected. Said ranking
officer on duty shall, within 24 hours file a written report with the Police
Chief.
   4.   Any police officer shall be and is hereby authorized to arrest on view

PART 3
IDENTIFICATION OF FLOODPLAIN AREAS
§ 8-301.   Identification.
The identified floodplain area shall be:
   A.   Any areas of the Borough, classified as special flood hazard areas
(SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance
Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated June 20, 2019 and issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof, including all
digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study .
   B.   The above referenced FIS and FIRMs and any subsequent revisions and
amendments are hereby adopted by the Borough and declared to be a part of this
Chapter.
(Ord. 582, 4/13/2009, §300; as amended by Ord. 625)
§ 8-302.   Description and Special Requirements of Identified Floodplain Areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
   A.   The floodway area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without increasing the water surface elevation by more than one foot at any
point. This term shall also include floodway areas which have been identified
in other available studies or sources of information for those special flood
hazard areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
      1.   Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted
unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed
encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      2.   Within any floodway area, no new construction or development shall
be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the Department of
Environmental Protection Regional Office.
   B.   The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations
have been provided.
      1.   The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas identified
as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base
flood elevations have been provided and a floodway has been delineated.
      2.   AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE
zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided but no floodway has been determined.
         i.   No permit shall be granted within any AE Zone without floodway,
no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements,
or other development shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice that the proposed development together with all other
existing and anticipated development, would not result in an increase in flood
levels of more than one foot within the entire community during the occurrence
of the base flood discharge.
         ii.   No new construction or development shall be located within the
area measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse, unless
the appropriate permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection Regional Office.
   C.   The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base flood
elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and floodway
information from other Federal, State, or other acceptable sources shall be
used when available. Where other acceptable information is not available, the
base flood elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on
the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site.
   In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional
engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the
technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the municipality. In the absence of any
of the above data or documentation, the community may require elevation of the
lowest floor to be at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade.
   D.   The AO and AH Area/ District shall be those areas identified as Zones
AO and AH on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject to inundation by
1% annual chance shallow flooding where average depths are between one and
three feet. In Zones AO and AH, drainage paths shall be established to guide
floodwaters around and away from structures on slopes.
(Ord. 582, 4/13/2009, §301; as amended by Ord. 625)
§ 8-303.   Changes in Identification of Area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Council where
studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person documents the
need for such revision. However, prior to any such change to the special flood
hazard area change, approval must be obtained from the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six
months after the date such information becomes available, a community shall
notify FEMA of the changes to the special flood hazard area by submitting
technical or scientific data. See §
8-401 B for situations where FEMA notification is required.
(Ord. 582, 4/13/2009, §302; as amended by Ord. 625)
§ 8-304.   Boundary Disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Borough and any party aggrieved by
this decision or determination may appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board. The
burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
(Ord. 582, 4/13/2009, §303; as amended by Ord. 625)
§8-305.   Jurisdictional Boundary Changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other corporate
boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community shall review
flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary changes. The
community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in areas subject to
annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or exceed those in CFR 44
60.3.
(Ord. 625)

grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds

occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT - any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial
damage” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
   UNIFORM CONSTRUCTION CODE - the Statewide building code adopted by the
Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1999, applicable to new construction in all
municipalities whether administered by the municipality, a third party, or the

buildings, the Code adopted the International Residential Code (IRC) and
International Building Code (IBC) by reference as the construction standard
applicable with the State floodplain construction. For coordination purposes,
references to the above are made specifically to various sections of the IRC
and the IBC.
   VARIANCE - a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain
management regulation.

   2.   Application to Install Service Line. Any person owning an occupied
building upon property accessible to the sewer system desiring to install a
service line from the service lateral to such building shall first make written
application on the form furnished by the Borough. The application must be
signed by such person or his duly authorized agent, and must be completely

approval. Any revisions in design considered necessary in the opinion of the
Borough shall be made by the Borough at cost of time and materials, legal
expenses and other expenses and paid for by the developer. The Borough shall
approve any plan to the sewer system upon the recommendation of the consulting
engineer of the Borough and undertake to secure approvals from the necessary
State agencies. An amount equal to the estimated cost of the necessary
revisions and all other costs shall be deposited with the Borough before such
revisions of the plan should be made.
Such approved extensions may then be constructed by and at the expense of the
individual builder or developer but only under the inspection of an inspector
for the Borough. The cost of such inspection, including salaries and expenses
shall be borne by the individual, builder, or developer making the extension.
The estimated cost of the inspection of construction shall be deposited with
the Borough before construction commences.

the individual, builder or developer shall deed the extension, free of all
encumbrances, to the Borough. The extension to the sewer system shall be
accepted by the Borough only after an inspection is made by the Borough or its
duly authorized representative. No connections shall be made to the extension
until the extension has been inspected and the extension has been accepted by
the Borough. When the extension has been accepted by the Borough, all
connections shall be made in accordance with these rules and regulations,
including all the necessary inspection of house connections, securing of
permits and other pertinent requirements.
   5.   Separate House Connections. Unless written permission is obtained from
the Borough, a separate house connection will be required for each individual
building or house whether constructed as a detached unit or as one of a pair or
row, but a single house connection will be permitted to serve a school,
factory, an apartment house or other permanent multiple-unit structure whose
individual apartments or units shall not be subject to separate ownership.
   6.   Existing House Connections. Existing house connections may be utilized
providing they are inspected by the Borough or its representative and found to
be reasonably true to grades and alignment, in good condition for the purpose
of conveying sanitary sewage and have reasonably tight joints of approved
materials. If the existing lines do not conform to this requirement a new line
must be laid in accordance with the specifications contained herein.
   7.   Common Waste System.
      A.   A single house connection will be permitted to serve a double house
in which the house drain is common to both houses or is not readily separable.
In such a case, it will be necessary for each owner to make separate
application and pay separate connection charges for the installation and pay
the prescribed sewer rentals for each property. In addition, it shall be
necessary for both property owners to sign an agreement relieving the Borough
of any responsibility or obligation caused by or resulting from installation of
a single house connection.
      B.   Said agreement shall be in recordable form and shall be recorded
with the Recorder of Deeds of Perry County. Said agreement shall run with the
land and shall bind all heirs, executors, administrators, successors, assigns
and subsequent owners or possessors. The agreement shall provide for the joint
responsibility for care and maintenance of the line. Additionally, said
agreement shall provide that any disagreement between the parties concerning
future maintenance of the common house drain and house connection shall be
sufficient cause for the Borough to require the installation of additional
connections to the sewer main to provide individual service lines and service
laterals to both houses. Said installation shall be made at the joint expense
of the property owners and lines and laterals shall be their sole
responsibility.
   8.   Service Laterals and Service Lines. Service lines shall be subject at
all times to the inspection and approval of the Borough or its representative
who shall have supervision and control over the same. Any service line not so
approved shall be relaid at the expense of the property owner if ordered by the
Borough or its representative. The service lateral and service line shall be
constructed from the street sewer main to the building by and at the expense of
the property owner who has obtained a permit. All service lines or house
connections heretofore or hereafter installed shall be maintained by and at the
sole expense of the property owner.
   9.   Pipe and Installation.
      A.   All service laterals and house connections shall be constructed of
one of the following types of pipe:
         (1)   Vitrified clay sewer pipe at least 6 inches in internal diameter

      Cement joints will not be permitted.
The pipe shall be installed with a rniniminn grade of 1%, the best possible
alignment and shall have adequate cover to protect the line from crushing or
frost action. All service laterals and house connections shall be constructed
in accordance with the "Specifications for the Construction of the Sanitary
Sewerage System of the Marysville Borough Authority" on file in the Borough
Office.
   10.   Cleanouts and Traps.
      A.   Generally, cleanouts shall be provided in each house connection and
at intervals to permit complete rodding with a 100-foot-long auger or tape.
Cleanouts shall be constructed by using a "Y" fitting in the run of pipe with a
45 degree bend and riser to the ground surface. The riser pipe must be provided
with a standard 4 inch screw-type ferrule.
      B.   All connections to the sewer system must be provided with a house
trap between the main house drain and the service line or house connection.
Traps shall be of the running type with approved cleanouts and fresh-air inlet
on the upstream side. This provision may be waived by the Borough upon
certification by a qualified plumber that the existing system is functional and
adequate. It shall be a condition of said waiver that the property owner
execute and deliver to the Borough a release acknowledging the request for
waiver, the certification of the plumber and relieving the Borough of any
liability or responsibility as a result of the waiver.
   11.   Special Conditions.. Whenever, in the opinion of the Borough or its
representative, the trenching conditions require either a specific type of
pipe, jointing material or encasement in concrete, such materials as it may
direct shall be installed to protect the property owner and/or the Borough for
special conditions as follows:
      A.   Where wet trenching conditions occur, V.C. pipe with hot poured
bituminous compound joints or slip seal joints will not be permitted. ABC pipe
with compression-type joints, asbestos cement pipe, or cast iron pipe is
preferred.

inches below the bottom of the pipe and the trench refilled to the grade line
with clean earth or crushed stone.
   12.   Connections to Service Laterals. Connections to service laterals, if
of the same pipe size, shall be made by properly joining to the bell end of the
service lateral provided. If cast iron pipe 4 inches in diameter is used, the
connection shall be made with a standard reducing fitting of clay or cast iron.
This applies also to the connection of the house drain to the house connection
pipe. Projecting the smaller pipe into the larger and sealing will not be
permitted. Where a house connection is made with pipe larger in diameter than
the 6 inches service lateral provided, the house connection shall be extended
to the sewer main and properly connected as specified herein.
   13.   Connections to Street Sewer Mains. Connections to street sewer mains
where no branch fitting has been previously provided shall be made with an
approved saddle-type fitting properly installed and encased in a 6 inch
envelope of concrete extending completely around the barrel of the sewer main
pipe.
   14.   Street Opening Permits and Restoration of Surface. Wherever the
surface of any public street, sidewalk or cartway is disturbed by construction
of the service laterals, the surfacing material shall be restored in kind by
the Borough street employees, with the property owner responsible for payment
of the cost of such restoration and resurfacing, following billing therefore by
the Borough. Such restored surface shall be maintained to the satisfaction of
the Borough. Any and all construction in a public street of the Borough shall
be in compliance with the ordinances of the Borough and all necessary permits
shall be obtained from the Borough before construction is commenced, including
the permit required for opening or disturbing the surface of a street.
   15.   Supervision and Inspection. The construction of service laterals and
house connections shall, at all times, be subject to supervision and inspection
by the Borough or its representative and shall conform to the Borough
specifications. The service laterals and house connections shall not be covered
until permitted by the Engineer or Borough representative and all backfilling
of trenches shall be under their supervision and shall be thoroughly compacted
by tamping in 6 inch layers to a minimum height of 12 inches above the pipe.
The representative of the Borough is authorized to enter upon any property to
make necessary inspections.
   16.   Connections Through Private Property. Connections with sewers where
same are run through private property shall in all respects be governed by
these rules and regulations.
   17.   Drainage into Sewer System. No roof drainage, surface water, waste
from hydrants or ground water from underground drainage fields shall be
admitted or be permitted to drain into the sewer system. The sewer system is
intended to convey sanitary sewage only.
   18.   Disconnection of Service Laterals. The Borough shall have the right to
close up or disconnect from the sewer system any service lateral or house
connection used for carrying rain water, surface water, ground water or
objectionable matter, or whenever any violations of this Part are committed.

this requirement. All such existing facilities may be so required, as
determined by subsection (4)(A).
      C.   Interceptors shall not be required for single-family residences,
duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes, or apartment complexes, unless the Borough
first determines there are discharges from the property that will create
problems in the POTW. The determination shall be made based upon an
investigation of the property, and a comparison of the content and amount of
discharge from the property with the discharges of other properties similar in
size and use. Upon a determination that the discharges will create problems in
the POTW, the Borough may require the installation of a sufficiently sized
grease interceptor to treat the discharges.
   5.   Compliance Date.
      A.   On or after the effective date of this Section, an existing facility
shall be required to install an approved, adequately sized, and properly
operated and maintained grease interceptor when any of the following conditions
exist:
         (1)   It is found by the Borough to be contributing grease in
quantities sufficient to cause sanitary sewer line stoppages or necessitate
increased maintenance on the sanitary sewer collection system (POTW) in order
to keep main line stoppages from occurring.
         (2)   It is remodeling the food preparation or kitchen waste plumbing
facilities in such a manner to be subject to a permit issued by the Borough.
         (3)   Its interceptor allows a discharge of oil or grease in excess of
500 mg/l.
      B.   New facilities required by this or other applicable ordinances to
maintain a grease interceptor shall install such a unit prior to commencement

      A.   Where oil and grease are a byproduct of food preparation and/or
cleanup, reasonable efforts shall be made to separate waste oil and grease into
a separate container for proper disposal. Except as contained in byproducts of
food preparation and/or clean up, waste oil and grease shall not be discharged
to any drains or grease interceptors. Such waste shall be placed in a container
designed to hold such waste and either utilized by industry or disposed of at
suitable locations.
      B.   None of the following agents shall be placed directly into a grease
interceptor, or into any drain that leads to the interceptor:
         (1)   Emulsifiers, de-emulsifiers, surface active agents, enzymes,
degreasers, or any type of product that will liquefy grease interceptor wastes,
         (2)   Any substance that may cause excessive foaming in the POTW.
         (3)   Any substance capable of passing the solid or semi-solid
contents of the grease interceptor to the POTW.
      C.   The influent to interceptors shall not exceed 140ºF. The temperature
at the flow control device inspection port shall be considered equivalent to
the temperature of the influent.
      D.   Toilets, urinals, and other similar fixtures shall not discharge
through a grease interceptor.
      E.   All waste shall only enter the grease interceptor through the inlet
flow control device, then the inlet pipe.
      F.   Where food-waste grinders are installed, the waste from those units
shall discharge directly into the building drainage system without passing
through a grease interceptor. Living quarters, as defined in this Section, are
exempted from this requirement.
   7.   Requirements for Grease Interceptors.
      A.   All commercial and industrial facilities dealing with grease shall,
at the permittee’s expense and as required by the Borough:
         (1)   Provide an adequately sized grease interceptor. Requirements for
grease trap sizing and the design criteria are provided in subsection (7)(B).
         (2)   Locate the interceptor in a manner that provides ready and easy
accessibility for cleaning and inspection.
         (3)   Obtain a written interceptor service agreement with a licensed
transporter for a term of at least 1 year, or for the duration of the operation
of the establishment, whichever is less, to maintain the interceptor in
effective operating condition. A service agreement must be in effect as long as
the facility is in operation.
         (4)   Unless otherwise specified by the Borough, service the
interceptor every 90 days and maintain backup copies of trip tickets and a
service log, on the premises of the facility, for at least 5 years. Copy of
same to be filed with the Borough office.

         (3)   Sizing Requirements. Sizing methods described herein are
intended as guidance in determining grease trap/interceptor sizes that will
afford the Borough’s sanitary sewer system (POTW) a minimum degree of
protection against grease and other obstructing materials. Sizing
determinations are based on operational data provided by business owners or
their contractors. In approving a customer’s plumbing or grease interceptor
design, the Borough does not accept liability for the failure of a system to
adequately treat wastewater to achieve effluent quality requirements specified
under this Section. It is the responsibility of the generator and/or
contractors to insure the appropriate level of treatment necessary for
compliance with environmental and wastewater regulations. Minimum acceptable
grease trap/interceptor sizing shall be accomplished as follows:
            (a)   Sizing according to formulas found in subsection (4) below.
            (b)    Where sizing formulas result in determination of a grease
trap less than 750 gallons in capacity, this minimum size is recommended.
However, under no circumstances should exterior grease traps less than 500
gallons be utilized.
            (c)   In the circumstance of “single service kitchens” with no food
preparation (heat/serve only), and which use only paper service items, a
minimum 50-gallon per minute (gpm) flow rated, or 100 pound grease retention,
mechanical grease trap may be used. In these instances, the grease trap is to
be installed in an area separate from food handling area, and the trap must be
readily accessible for cleaning and maintenance.
         (4)   Grease Trap Sizing Formulas. It is the responsibility of the
generator and his/her contractors to ensure that the wastewater discharged from
their facility is in compliance with the Borough’s discharge limitations. For
the purpose of plans review, a general assessment of grease trap/interceptor
design and size will be performed using the following formulas. (These formulas
have been demonstrated as industry standards capable of achieving the Borough’s
discharge criteria when systems are maintained in proper conditions.)
   Method 1: Uniform Plumbing Code, Appendix H
 
Number of meals   waste flow   retention time    storage      Size Requirement
Per peak hour   x rate (2)   x (3)             x factor (4) = (liquid capacity)
(1)
 
Factors:
1)   Number of meals served at peak operating hour (Seating Capacity) x Peak
Factor
a.   Where Peak Factor for fast food restaurant is   1.33
b.   And, Peak Factor for all other food service types is   1.00
2)   Waste Flow Rate:
a.   With dishwasher   6 gallon flow
b.   Without dishwasher   5 gallon flow
c.   Single service kitchen   2 gallon flow
d.   Food waste disposer   1 gallon flow
3)   Retention Times
a.   Commercial kitchen waste/dishwasher   2.5 hours
b.   Single service kitchen/single serving   1.5 hours
4)   Storage Factors
a.   Fully equipped commercial kitchen   8 hr operation = 1
b.   16 hr operation = 2
c.   24 hr operation = 3
d.   Single service kitchen   = 1.5   
The Uniform Plumbing Code includes a built-in safety factor that can yield very
large grease trap size specifications. At this time, the Borough is not
requiring traps larger than 4,000 gallons. However, the decision to use a trap
smaller than that specified by the formula and calculations above is to be
addressed in the plan submission.
   Method 2: 5-Hour Detention/Peak Flow
      A.   Gallons of water used per hour of operation
      B.   A x 0.75 = average “gray water” flow per hour
      C.   B x 1.9 peak flow factor
      D.   C x 5 hours detention = volume trap
Required volume of trap = A x B x C x D
         (5)   Alternate Sizing Formulas/Proposals. Facilities that propose the
use of alternate sizing techniques and/or procedures that result in
specifications that differ from calculated requirements (or are less than the
minimum 750 gallon recommendation), must submit formulas and other bases to
support proposed grease trap size/installation. Submission should also provide
documentation of ability to meet effluent quality requirements. This proposal
must be signed by a licensed plumbing contractor or engineer licensed in the
State of Pennsylvania.
         (6)   Construction/Installation. All permitting, construction, and
inspection activities must be completed in accordance with the Borough
ordinances. Additionally, the following specifications must be incorporated
into grease trap design.
            (a)   The grease interceptor shall be constructed with a minimum of
two chambers or shall have a minimum of two tanks in series. If two chambered,
the dividing wall must extend to within 1 foot of the bottom of the tank and
within 2 inches of the top and be securely fastened to both sides.
            (b)   There must be inlet and outlet tees made of schedule 40 PVC
installed. The inlet tee should extend down approximately one-third the depth
of the trap from the top and the outlet tee should be located 12 to 18 inches
off of the bottom of the trap.
            (c)   Grease traps are to be installed at a minimum distance of 10
feet from sinks and dishwashers to allow for adequate cooling of wastewater.
Water temperatures must be less than 140ºF prior to entering grease trap.
            (d)   All grease bearing waste streams should be routed through an
appropriate grease trap/inceptor, including: three-compartment sinks, pot/pan
sinks, soup kettles, hand-washing sinks, dishwashers, mop sinks and floor
drains.
Notable Exceptions: Drains that receive “clear waste” only, such as from ice
machines, condensate from coils and drink stations, may be plumbed to the
sanitary system without passing through the grease interceptor.
         (7)   Customer (Generator) Responsibilities.
            (a)   It is the responsibility of the customer (waste generator) to
insure compliance with the Borough of Marysville’s discharge limitations.
            (b)   Hazardous wastes, such as acids, strong cleaners, pesticides,
herbicides, paint, solvents, or gasoline should not be disposed of where they
would go through grease or grit traps. If commercial dishwashers are discharged
through a grease interceptor, care must be taken in system design. Dishwashers
use detergents and elevated water temperatures that will melt grease. If the
interceptor is either too small or too close to the commercial dishwasher,
grease may pass through the interceptor and into the collection system.
            (c)   Generators are responsible for maintaining grease traps in
continuous proper working condition. Further, generators are responsible for
inspecting, repairing, replacing, or installing apparatus and equipment as
necessary to ensure proper operation and function of grease traps and
compliance with discharge limitations at all times.
            (d)   The generator must have a grease trap/grease interceptor
service contract (for pumping, cleaning, and inspection), at a minimum
frequency of every 90 days to ensure proper function. The trap shall be
maintained more frequently if needed to meet the Borough’s discharge criteria.
Records of maintenance are required to be maintained on site for 5 years. (90-
day maintenance frequency assumes proper sizing and installation consistent
with this guidance).
            (e)   Enzymes, solvents, and emulsifiers are not permitted, as they
will only change the form of grease, allowing it to be carried out of the trap
with the wastewater and deposited in the collection system (POTW). Biological
treatment systems must be pre-approved by the Borough. These systems will not
alleviate the necessity for inspection and proper maintenance.
   8.   Grease Interceptor Construction.
      A.   Any person responsible for discharges requiring a grease interceptor
shall, at his own expense and as required by the Borough, provide plans and
specifications for equipment and facilities of a design type and design
capacity approved by the Borough. The grease interceptor must be in compliance
with the current applicable Borough ordinances. The person shall locate the
interceptor in a manner that provides easy accessibility for cleaning and
inspection and maintain the interceptor in effective operating condition. The
Borough shall inspect the interceptor during construction and upon completion.
The Borough shall make a final inspection before any service connections are
made.
      B.   Construction of items listed herein in accordance herewith or in
accordance to the Borough’s specifications shall not constitute a defense to
unlawful discharge and shall not limit the generator’s liability for any
surcharge stated in this division.
      C.   If the Borough determines that there is a need for installation or
upgrading of sample ports or grease interceptors on an existing establishment,
the Borough may order the installation or upgrading of such interceptors on
that existing establishment. If the Borough orders such installation, then the
Borough shall serve notice of such order upon the grease generator. Within 10
days of receipt of such order, the grease generator may demand a hearing to
review such order, in which case the Borough shall schedule a hearing to review
such order within 30 days of receiving the demand for review from the grease or
grit generator. If a hearing to review the order is scheduled, the Borough
shall serve notice of the hearing to review such order upon the grease
generator at least 10 days before the date of such hearing. At the hearing to
review the order, the grease generator may present evidence, and the Borough
may make new findings and issue new orders concerning the subject of the
original hearing. After receiving notice of the order to install or upgrade
ports or interceptors on an existing establishment, it shall be unlawful for a
grease generator to allow or cause any discharge into the sanitary sewer not in
compliance with such order.
      D.   Where the process wastewaters are generated in only part of the
facility, the process wastewaters may, at the option of the Borough, discharge
into a grease interceptor servicing only those areas that provide a suitable
sampling port.
      E.   The Borough may waive the requirement for a grease interceptor
provided the grease generator can verify that only domestic sewage is being
discharged, with no floor drains or process water. The Borough may require
testing by the user in connection with this request, with all costs for this
testing being at the user’s expense.
   9.   Service/Inspection Ports and Monitoring Ports.
      A.   Except for “under the sink grease interceptors,” each interceptor
shall be located outside of a building or structure in an area accessible for
service, and so installed and connected that it shall be at all times easily
accessible for inspection, and for cleaning and removal of the intercepted
waste. Inlet flow control inspection ports, interceptor inspection ports, and
effluent monitoring ports shall be in areas where vehicles may not temporarily
block access to inspection. The use of ladders or the removal of bulky
equipment or stored materials in order to inspect inlet flow control devices,
inspect or service interceptors, or sample interceptor effluent shall
constitute a violation of accessibility. Inspection ports and monitoring ports
shall be located so as to allow inspectors quick and easy access to the inlet
flow control device, each compartment of the interceptor, and the effluent from
the interceptor. An interceptor shall not be installed in any part of a
building where food is handled. The location of all interceptors, inspection
ports, and monitoring ports shall meet the approval of the Borough and shall be
shown on the approved building plans.
      B.   An inspection port shall be provided for the flow control device
regulating flow into the interceptor.
      C.   A one-piece removable metal plate covering the entire interceptor
shall be preferred as an interceptor inspection port, though at the discretion
of the Borough, standard manhole ports may be installed over each divider in
the interceptor, but in either case all parts of the interceptor shall be
easily accessible for cleaning and visual inspection.
      D.   A monitoring port shall be provided for ease in sampling the treated
effluent from the interceptor and shall be as close as possible to the
connection with the Borough POTW within the bounds of the facility property.
The port shall be installed according to the specifications of the Borough. The
port shall be installed and maintained at the user’s expense. A generator shall
properly place, monitor, and maintain the monitoring port so that wastewater
samples taken from the monitoring port are representative of wastewater leaving
the interceptor. It shall be unlawful for a grease generator to divert sewage
around a monitoring point into the POTW.
   10.   Under the Sink Grease Interceptors.
      A.   In the event that an outside grease interceptor is not practicable,
an “under the sink grease interceptor” may be installed subject to the approval
of the Borough. In addition to the regular requirements of grease interceptors,
“under the sink grease interceptors” are subject to the additional
requirements.
      B.   General Requirements.
         (1)   The location of such interceptors shall be in as close proximity
to the source of wastewater as physically possible.
         (2)    The lid shall be secured to the body with a single bolt. No
wing nuts or screws shall be permitted.
         (3)   Baffle systems and all other internal pieces shall be removable
to facilitate cleaning and replacement, but must be in place at all other
times.
         (4)    The lid shall cover the deep seal trap. The deep seal trap
shall be constructed so as to eliminate the possibility of sewer gas entering
the kitchen area.
         (5)   The interceptors shall be constructed with bottom supports so
that the body of the interceptor does not corrode by coming into contact with
the floor.
         (6)   The interceptor shall be coated with a powder coated
electrostatically applied cathodic epoxy coating so as to be resistant to
corrosion.
         (7)   The interceptor shall be equipped with a flow control fitting.
      C.   Installation Requirements.
         (1)    The interceptor may be set on the floor, partially recessed in
the floor with top flush with the floor, or fully recessed below the floor to
suit piping and structural conditions, as acceptable by the Borough.
         (2)   There shall be sufficient clearance for the removal of the
interceptor cover for cleaning.
         (3)   Unless specifically approved by the Borough, runs of pipe
exceeding 25 feet between fixture and interceptor shall not be permitted.
         (4)   The interceptor shall not be installed in a waste line from a
garbage grinder. Any garbage grinder waste shall bypass the interceptor.
         (5)   A suitable flow control fitting shall be installed ahead of the
interceptor in the waste line beyond the fixture and as close as possible to
the underside of the lowest fixture. When wastes of two or more sinks or
fixtures are combined to be used by one interceptor, a single flow control
fitting shall be used.
         (6)   Air intake for flow control either shall terminate under the
sink drain board as high as possible to prevent overflow, or shall terminate in
a return bend at the same height and on the outside of the building.
         (7)   To retain water and prevent siphoning, all interceptors shall
have a vented waste, sized in accordance with the Plumbing Code.
         (8)   With the approval of the Borough, one interceptor may be used to
serve multiple fixtures if the fixtures are located close together and the
interceptor is sized to meet the combined flow of all the fixtures.
      D.   Maintenance Requirements.
         (1)    Interceptors shall be serviced at least every week. After
accumulated grease and waste has been removed, the interceptor shall be
thoroughly inspected to make certain that inlet, outlet, and air relief ports
are clear of obstructions.
         (2)    Grease and other waste removed from the interceptor shall not
be introduced into any drain, sewer, or natural body of water. The waste shall
be placed in proper containers for proper disposal. It shall not be mixed with
“edible” grease. Grease and waste removed from an interceptor shall not be
disposed of in such a matter so as to become food for animals or humans.
         (3)    The grease generator shall maintain adequate documentation that
the interceptor is appropriately cleaned and inspected.
   11.   Interceptor Maintenance.
      A.   Interceptor Maintenance Service Contract.
         (1)   All grease generators having interceptors shall perform all
business transactions relating to interceptor pumping, cleaning, and servicing,
and to liquid waste collection, transportation and/or disposal on a contractual
basis via a written contract having a duration of at least 1 year, and provide
copies of all such contracts to the Borough. Any modifications or changes to
the contract must be submitted to the Borough within 10 working days of the
change or modification. It is a violation for a grease generator to discharge
through an interceptor without a service contract.
         (2)   A contract shall at a minimum:
            (a)   From the customer:
               1)    Contain the customer name, address and telephone number,
and the name, address, and telephone number of the facility to be serviced if
different.
               2)    Contain the name of a primary and secondary contact person
for the facility.
               3)    Indicate the size of each interceptor.
               4)    Indicate the precise and unambiguous location of the
interceptor or interceptors to be serviced, including a diagram if necessary.
               5)    Indicate the frequency of pumpage required.
               6)    Be signed and dated by an authorized representative
indicating acceptance of the terms of the contract.
            (b)   From the vacuum truck cleaning service:
               1)    Contain the vacuum truck company name, address, and
telephone number.
               2)    Contain the name of a primary and secondary contact
person.
               3)    Be signed and dated by an authorized representative
indicating acceptance of the terms of the contract.
               4)    The name, address, and telephone number of the disposal
site.
               5)    Additionally, the transporter shall provide a:
                  a)    Certificate of insurance.
                  b)    Certificate of assurance.
                  c)    Certificate of indemnification.
            (c)   Other. Contain a statement of the duration of the contract,
to be not less than 1year, or for the duration of the operation of the
facility, whichever is less.
      B.   Required Pumping Frequency.
         (1)    Unless otherwise specified by the Borough, each interceptor in
active use shall be cleaned at least once every quarter or more frequently as
needed to prevent carry over of grease into the POTW, unless it can be
demonstrated to the Borough that the pumping frequency can be performed at
greater intervals. The Borough may specify cleaning more frequently when
quarterly pumping is shown to be inadequate. Additional pumping may be required
during time periods where increased loading is anticipated. Any grease
generator desiring a schedule less frequent than quarterly shall submit a
request to the Borough along with copies of the cleaning records for the last
four interceptor cleanings, including measurements of the thickness of the
surface scum/grease layer.
         (2)   At any time if an inspection finds the interceptor to be full,
immediate steps shall be taken by the grease generator to pump out and clean it
as soon as is practicable. The inspector shall make an evaluation of the
advisability of allowing discharge to continue, and may at his or her
discretion order an immediate cessation of all discharge from the facility.
      C.   All interceptors shall be maintained by the grease generator at the
grease generator’s expense.
      D.   Requirement for Increased Pumpage or Servicing. If the Borough finds
that a change in pumpage or servicing of an interceptor is necessary for an
establishment to meet the discharge limits stated in this Section, the Borough
may order a change in pumpage or servicing of an interceptor. If the Borough
orders a change in the pumpage or servicing, then the Borough shall serve
notice of such order upon the generator. Within 10 days of receipt of such
order, the generator may demand a hearing to review such order, in which case
the Borough shall schedule a hearing to review such order within 30 days of
receiving the demand for review from the generator. If a hearing to review the
order is scheduled, the Borough shall serve notice of the hearing to review
such order at least 10 days before the date of such hearing. At the hearing to
review the order, the generator may present evidence, and the Borough may make
new findings and issue new orders concerning the subject of the original
hearing. After receiving notice of an order by the Borough to change the
frequency and/or methods of pumpage or servicing, it shall be unlawful for a
generator to allow or cause any discharge into the sanitary sewer (POTW) not in
compliance with such order.
      E.   Interceptor Maintenance Log.
         (1)   Every generator having an interceptor shall maintain an
interceptor maintenance log indicating each pumping for the previous 12 months.
This log shall include the date, time, amount pumped, hauler and disposal site,
and shall be kept in a conspicuous location on the premises of the facility for
inspection. Said log shall be made immediately available to any authorized
Borough inspector.
         (2)   The information required in the maintenance log must be
submitted to the Borough quarterly. The reporting period shall be the calendar
year. The report shall be submitted within 30 days after the end of the
quarterly reporting period to the Borough.
      F.   Cleaning Procedures.
         (1)   The owner or an employee of the facility shall supervise the
interceptor cleaning, and shall be physically present and observe the entire
cleaning operation.
         (2)   A generator shall cause the liquid waste hauler, transporter, or
any other person cleaning or servicing an interceptor to completely evacuate
all contents, including floating materials, wastewater, and bottom sludges and
solids, of all grease and/or grit interceptors and other interceptors during
servicing. Skimming the surface layer of waste material, partial cleaning of
the interceptor or use of any method that does not remove the entire contents
of the collection device is prohibited. The suction of the floating materials
shall be done prior to removal of other contents. After complete evacuation,
the walls, top, and bottom of the interceptor shall then be thoroughly scraped
and the residue removed. The interceptor shall then be steam cleaned and the
residue removed. Upon completion of the servicing, the manager of the facility
shall make an inspection of the interior of the interceptor and then personally
sign the trip ticket. The manager shall make an appropriate entry in the
facility interceptor maintenance log, and post the generator section of the
trip ticket in a conspicuous place with the log on the premises.
         (3)   It shall be unlawful for a generator to allow, the discharge of
liquid, semi- solids, or solids back into an interceptor during and/or after
servicing. Decanting or discharging of removed waste back into the interceptor
from which the waste was removed or any other interceptor, for the purpose of
reducing the volume to be disposed, is prohibited.
         (4)   Each interceptor pumped shall be fully evacuated unless the
interceptor volume is greater than the tank capacity on the vacuum truck in
which case the transporter shall arrange for additional transportation capacity
so that the interceptor is fully evacuated within a 24-hour period following
the transporter’s inability to fully evacuate the interceptor.
      G.   Disposal of Interceptor Pumpage. All waste removed from each
interceptor shall be disposed of at a facility permitted and authorized to
receive such waste in accordance with all applicable Federal, State, and local
regulations. In no way shall the pumpage be returned to any private or public
portion of the POTW, without prior written approval from the Borough, nor may
it be returned to any portion of the POTW. Additionally, grease removed from an
interceptor shall not be recycled so as to become a food product or part of a
food product for animal or human consumption.
   12.   Required Reporting. All permitted interceptor waste generators shall,
quarterly, submit to the Borough:
      A.   Copies of all manifests made by liquid waste transporters servicing
their grease interceptor during the reporting period.
      B.   A copy of the interceptor maintenance log or receipt from hauler.
      C.   A copy of the interceptor service contract.
      D.   Any other information, including analysis of the discharge to the
POTW of such pollutants as the Borough may require.
   13.   Grease Interceptor Treatment Products.
      A.   Use of grease interceptor treatment products, including bacteria,
designed to digest grease, is specifically prohibited without prior written
consent of the Borough.
      B.   Acceptance of such products for use may be considered only where a
valid screening test, showing the product’s ability to treat the waste and to
produce an influent in compliance with this Section, has been performed in
accordance with methods outlined by the Borough.
      C.   Screening tests for such grease interceptor treatment products shall
be designed by the Borough.
      D.   The results of screening tests shall be subject to technical review
by the Borough.
      E.   All costs of screening tests shall be borne by the facility whether
or not the product is accepted for use.
      F.   If a product is accepted for use, each facility shall obtain written
permission from the Borough to use the product.
      G.   Complete descriptions of the chemical composition of all products
must be disclosed to the Borough.
      H.   The Borough may revoke permission to use such products where the
effluent from the interceptor or basin in which the product is used fails to
meet the requirements of this Section.
   14.   Facility Closure. When a facility with a grease interceptor closes for
business, and is subsequently:
      A.   Razed or demolished, then any grease interceptor or interceptors or
traps shall be either:
         (1)   Physically removed; or
         (2)   Have all effluent pumped out, a straight line plumbed from the
inlet to the outlet, and the remainder of the tank filled with soil or sand.
      B.   Remodeled such that the grease interceptor will not be used, then
the grease interceptor or interceptors or traps may be left in place, however:
         (1)   The grease interceptor or interceptors or traps shall have all
effluent pumped out, the trap cleaned thoroughly, and the grease interceptor or
interceptors or traps left dry and empty.
         (2)   Be re-plumbed as to bypass the existing grease interceptor or
interceptors or traps, either by straight through or by bypassing methods,
while leaving the empty trap and in place for possible future utilization by
another business.
      C.   Replaced with a type of business that will not utilize the grease
interceptor, then that business may have any existing grease interceptor or
interceptors or traps:
         (1)    Physically removed; or
         (2)    Re-plumbed as to bypass the existing grease interceptor or
interceptors or traps, either by straight through or by bypassing methods,
while leaving the empty trap and in place for possible future utilization by
another business; or
         (3)   Re-plumbed with a straight line plumbed from the inlet to the
outlet, and the remainder of the grease interceptor or interceptors or traps
filled with soil or sand.
In all instances, the owner of the premises shall appropriately inform the
Borough and perform the closure at such a time so as to permit an inspector to
be physically present during the removal or filling of the interceptor.
   15.   Monitoring, Inspection and Entry.
      A.   It shall be unlawful for a grease generator to refuse to allow
inspectors to enter their premises during reasonable hours to determine whether
the grease generator is complying with all of the requirements of this Section
and permit or order issued hereunder. A grease generator shall allow the
inspectors access to all parts of the premises for purposes of inspection,
sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of additional
duties. Arrangements for the immediate access of the Borough or his designate
representative shall have been made ahead of time, and such failure to make
adequate arrangements shall not be considered a legitimate reason to refuse
admittance of the Borough.
      B.   In cases where a facility includes private living quarters, the
right of access shall extend to all common areas, and any other area or areas a
facility employee, including the manager and/or owner, may enter without
expressed permission of the residents of such a facility.
      C.   Search Warrants. If the Borough has been refused access to a
building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
Section, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program of the Borough designed to verify compliance
with this Section or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the
overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the Borough
may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
   16.   Confidentiality and Proprietary Information.
      A.   Information and data on a grease generator, or any other entity,
obtained from reports, surveys, grease interceptor permits, and monitoring
programs, and from the Borough’s inspection and sampling activities, and any
other information submitted to the Borough pursuant to this Section, shall be
available to the public without restriction.
   17.   Violation.
      A.   It is unlawful for any grease generator to discharge into the POTW
in any manner that is in violation of this Section, or of any condition set
forth in this Section. Additionally, a person commits an offense if the person
causes or permits the plugging or blocking of, or otherwise interferes with or
permits the interference of, a grease interceptor or the POTW, including
alteration or removal of any flow constricting devices so as to cause flow to
rise above the design capacity of the interceptor.
      B.   No person, and/or facility shall discharge grease in excess of 500
mg/l to the POTW. If such discharge occurs, the person or facility shall be
considered in violation of this Section and subject to the remedies described
herein. This includes non-permitted facilities.
      C.   The Borough and/or Borough may suspend water or sewer service when
such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the Borough, in order to stop
an actual or threatened discharge which:
         (1)   Presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment
to the health or welfare of persons or the environment.
         (2)   Causes stoppages or excessive maintenance to be performed to
prevent stoppages in the sanitary sewer collection system.
         (3)   Causes interference to the POTW.
         (4)   Causes the Borough to violate any condition of its NPDES or
TPDES permit.
      D.   Any person notified of a suspension of the water or sewer service
shall immediately stop or eliminate the discharge. In the event of a failure of
the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Borough shall
take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate termination of water
or sewer service, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or sewer
connection or endangerment to any individuals. The Borough shall reinstate the
water or sewer service when such conditions causing the suspension have passed
or been eliminated. A detailed written statement submitted by the grease
generator describing the cause(s) of the harmful discharge and the measure(s)
taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the Borough within
15 days of the date of occurrence.
      E.   In addition to prohibiting certain conduct by natural persons, it is
the intent of this Section to hold a corporation, association, LLC, LLP or PS
legally responsible for prohibited conduct performed by an agent acting in
behalf of a corporation or association and within the scope of his office or
employment.
      F.   Any person, operator or owner who shall violate any provision of
this Section, or who shall fail to comply with any provision hereof, shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be subject to a fine of not
more than $2,000 for each violation and each day a violation continues, shall
constitute a separate offense and shall be punished accordingly.
      G.   A permittee is liable to the Borough for any expense, loss, or
damage occasioned by the Borough for reason of appropriate clean-up and proper
disposal of said waste materials. Additionally, an administrative fee equal to
one-half of assessed clean-up costs shall be levied by the Borough against the
guilty party.
   18.   Authorization. The Borough is authorized to promulgate such rules and

§ 18-506.   Replacement Areas.
   1.   Requirements.
      A.   Should any lot on which an onlot disposal system exists be
subdivided after the effective date of this Part, the new lot or lots not
served by the existing onlot disposal system, and not served by a community
sewage system, shall have designated upon the plans for such lot sufficient and
suitable space for an onlot disposal system and also a replacement area as
described more fully herein. The newly created lot within which lies the onlot
disposal system which had previously served the undivided lot shall be exempt
from the requirements of this Section.
      B.   If a subdivision or land development plan shall be submitted with
respect to any lot not served by an onlot disposal system on the effective date
of this Part, and such plan does not provide for connection of proposed
structures to a community sewage system, then the subdivision or land
development plan shall set forth a suitable area on each lot for an onlot
disposal system. The plan shall also set forth, for each lot to be served by an
onlot disposal system, a separate replacement area as defined in this Part..
      C.   The replacement area provided shall comply with the Act and with all
regulations issued by the DEP as incorporated into this Part concerning
individual onlot disposal systems, including isolation distances and with the
terms of this Part and any other applicable Borough ordinances.

      A.   Each applicant who shall submit a plan for the subdivision or
development of land or who shall apply for a permit for the installation of an
individual onlot disposal system, or who shall request approval of a planning
module for land development or the adoption of a revision, exception to
revision or supplement to the Official Plan shall demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Borough SEO that a suitable area exists on the lot or on
each lot to be created for an initial individual onlot disposal system and for
the replacement area. The Borough SEO shall perform or observe all tests
required for the location of an individual onlot disposal system to confirm the
suitability of the replacement area. Allowance of open land for the replacement
area without testing performed or observed by the Borough SEO shall not
constitute compliance with the requirements of this Section.
      B.   The location of the initial individual onlot disposal system and the
replacement area as approved by the Borough SEO shall be identified on the plot
plans and diagrams submitted as part of the permit application.
      C.   If the application has been submitted as a part of an application
for subdivision or land development approval or as part of a request that the
Borough approve a planning module for land development or amend its Official
Plan or a request for an exception to the revision of the Official Plan, the
location of each initial individual onlot disposal system and each replacement
area shall be noted upon the plans. If the application is for subdivision or
land development approval, a note constituting a permanent easement shall be
added to the plans stating that no improvements shall be constructed upon the
replacement area and the deed to be recorded for each lot created as part of
the subdivision or land development shall contain language reflecting this
limitation.
      D.   Any revisions to a permit or plan affecting a replacement area that
previously has been approved pursuant to the provisions of this Part shall be
reviewed by the SEO and submitted for approval by the Council.
   3.   Construction Restrictions.
      A.   The easement for the replacement area noted upon the plan and
recorded with the Perry County Recorder of Deeds shall state that no permanent
or temporary improvements of any character, other than shallow-rooted plant
matter, shall be constructed upon the replacement area.
      B.   This provision shall be enforced by the Borough unless the person
who desires to construct such improvements shall demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Borough SEO that an alternate replacement area that
complies with all applicable regulations of the DEP, this Part and all other
applicable Borough ordinances, exists upon the lot. If such an alternate
replacement area shall be identified, the alternate replacement area may be
considered to be the replacement area required by this Part and shall be
designated as the replacement area. The newly designated replacement area shall
thereafter be considered the replacement area for the purposes of this Part.
   4.   Relief from Replacement Area Requirement.
      A.   If any lot held in single and separate ownership as of the effective
date of this Part does not contain land suitable for a replacement area, the
applicant submitting a land development plan or a planning module for land
development or desiring to install an individual onlot disposal system may
request that the Council grant an exception to the requirement of providing a
replacement area. The applicant for such an exception shall present credible
evidence to the Council demonstrating that the lot was held in single and
separate ownership on the effective date of this Part, the size of the lot,
inability of the applicant to acquire adjacent land or the unsuitability of
adjacent land which might be able to be acquired and the testing conducted to
determine that the lot is not suitable to provide a replacement area. An
exception shall be granted only if applicant proves by clear and convincing
evidence that applicant's plan shall dispose of sewage in a manner consistent
with all applicable Borough, Commonwealth and Federal law and conducive to the
public health.
      B.   At all times, the burden to present credible evidence and the burden
of persuasion shall be upon the applicant for an exception from the terms of
this Part. In no case shall any lot be excepted from the requirements of §18-
504.
(Ord. 535, 7/8/2002)
§ 18-507.   Inspections.
   1.   Any onlot disposal sewage system may be inspected by the Borough's SEO
at any reasonable time as of the effective date of this Part.
   2.   The inspection may include a physical tour of the property, the taking
of samples from surface water, wells, other groundwater sources, the sampling
of the contents of the sewage disposal system itself and/or the introduction of
a traceable substance into the interior plumbing of the structure served to
ascertain the path and ultimate destination of wastewater generated in the
structure. A copy of the inspection report shall be furnished to the owner and
current resident which shall include all of the following information which is
reasonably available to the individual or agency responsible for conducting the
inspection:
      A.   Date of inspection.

fall on a Sunday or postal holiday, in which case notice shall be deemed
received the following postal business day. Should access be refused by the
occupant, the SEO or CEO, or other appropriate Borough officer, shall commence
an immediate procedure to obtain a search warrant from the district justice.
Upon receipt of a search warrant to inspect the property, the SEO or CEO, shall
be accompanied by an officer of the Borough Police, State Police or a deputy of
the County Sheriff and the inspection shall be completed in accordance with
this Section.
   4.   A schedule of routine inspections may be established by the Borough, if
necessary, to assure the proper function of the systems within the Borough.
   5.   The Borough's SEO shall inspect systems known to be, or credibly
alleged to be, malfunctioning. Should said inspections reveal that the system
is malfunctioning, the Borough shall take action to require the correction of
the malfunction. If total correction is not technically or financially feasible
in the opinion of the Borough and a representative of the DEP, then other
appropriate action by the owner to mitigate the malfunction shall be required.
   6.   There may arise geographic areas within the Borough where numerous
onlot disposal systems are malfunctioning. A resolution of these area-wide
problems may necessitate detailed planning and a Borough sponsored revision to
the area's Act 537 Official Sewage Facilities Plan. When a DEP authorized
Official Sewage Facilities Plan Revision has been undertaken by the Borough,
mandatory repair or replacement of individual malfunctioning sewage disposal
systems within the study area may be delayed, at the discretion of the Borough,
pending the outcome of the plan revision process. However, the Borough SEO may
compel immediate corrective action whenever a malfunction, as determined by the
Borough SEO or the Pennsylvania DEP, represents a serious public health or
environmental threat.

requirements are such, in the opinion of the Borough Manager or his duly
designated agent, as will cause undue hardship on the commercial establishment,

      C.   Containers containing garbage shall be covered with a lid which fits
securely and prevents access to flies.

kept in good condition. Any container that does not conform with this Chapter

prompt collection of refuse, shall be replaced upon notice. Failure to replace
said defective container may result in the loss of refuse collection until such
time as the container is replaced.

      A.   No person shall place any refuse upon any street, alley, walk or
other public place, or upon any private property, except in proper receptacles

shall be disposed of in accordance with the directions of the Borough Manager.
   4.   Location of Containers. Containers should be placed, wherever possible,
at a point nearest the street or alley from which collection from a vehicle can

§ 20-105.   Collection and Collection Charges.
   1.   Refuse collected by the Borough collector will be made at least once a

or small businesses with other dwelling units or small businesses or with one
or more commercial establishments in one improved property, and each thereof
having the use of the trash collection system of the Borough, then each such
dwelling unit, each small business, and each such commercial establishment
shall be charged the rates and charges as though each thereof were in a
separate structure and as though each thereof had a direct and separate refuse
collection service.
      C.   [Reserved].
[Ord. 442]
   6.   All fees and charges for dumpster or containerized rental, service and
collection shall be made by the Borough collector to the ultimate customer and

first day of January, April, July, and October of each year for the quarterly
calendar period commencing on said date. The bill for refuse collection charges
for the first month or quarter during which a property becomes occupied shall
be pro-rated. All bills shall be due and payable within 30 days of the billing
date and shall be subject to interest and penalties as set forth in §
20-105.

armed forces of the United States, rates and charges for refuse collection will
not be billed for the duration of active duty as specified in his/her service
orders if a copy of the service orders is submitted to the Borough Secretary.

§ 20-108.   Dumpsters.
The Borough Manager may, in his or her sole discretion, upon good cause shown,
waive the requirements of subsection (1). “Good cause” shall be shown only by
physical impossibility, dangerousness or impracticality of placing a dumpster
or dumpsters upon the property in question and may not be established by
financial hardship. If the Borough Manager waives the requirements of
subsection (1), then in that case, the owner of the property shall construct
and maintain an adequate enclosure such as to prevent refuse from being
scattered.
1.   No building containing six or more residential or small business units,

STREET EXCAVATION
§ 21-101.   Permits.
   1.   No person, firm or corporation shall dig open any street, alley or
sidewalk of the Borough of Marysville or make any excavation therein, for any
purpose whatsoever, without first obtaining from the Borough Secretary a
written permit to do so and paying for said permit a fee in an amount as
established from time to time by resolution of Borough Council, excepting only
that a permit shall not be required for public work done pursuant to contracts
with the Borough of Marysville or by the Borough. Within 30 days after any such
opening in a street or macadam alley, the person, firm or corporation
performing such work shall pay to the Borough an additional fee in an amount as
established from time to time by resolution of Borough Council. [Ord. 553{'}'}
   2.   Any permit issued under this Part shall set forth the location and
description of the premises for which said opening is to be made, the owners
thereof, the dimensions and purpose of the opening, and the time during which
said opening shall be unpaved. No opening shall remain unpaved for more than 6
days unless the Borough Manager shall extend said time in writing for a period
not exceeding 6 additional days.
   3.   Before the issuance of any permit hereunder the applicant shall agree
that, if, because of settling or any other reason within a period of 2 years
after the opening is filled and restored, any costs shall be incurred by the
Borough of Marysville to correct the damage to the restored surface resulting
directly or indirectly from said excavation, including any legal or engineering
services, the applicant will reimburse the Borough of Marysville for the amount
of the said additional costs.
   4.   The permit shall be issued subject to regulations by the Borough
Council, preventing unnecessary interference with the proper use of the highway
by the public, and subject to the following conditions: The applicant shall
furnish, place and maintain suitable and sufficient warning signs, flashing
lights, flags, arrow boards and approved reflectors, do or allow no tunneling;
fence or barricade the excavation area while said openings are in place; and
indemnify and save harmless the Borough and its agents from all suits, actions
or claims of any character brought for or on account of any injuries or damages
received or sustained by any person or persons during the performance of the
work by said applicants.
{'{'}Ord. 446, 7/12/1993, §§1-4; as amended by Ord. 553, 5/10/2004, §1)
§ 21-102.   Regulations.
   1.   Whenever any opening shall remain in place overnight, a steel plate of
sufficient size and thickness with sufficient warning devices as are necessary
to protect persons and vehicles from harm shall be placed. Whenever the
sidewalk of any street or alley has been excavated, it shall be the duty of the
person or persons, firm or corporation doing the same, to place a strong and
substantial foot bridge with appropriate hand railings over such excavation, in
the line of the sidewalk, as wide as the sidewalk and securely nailed on each
side, so that foot passengers may pass over safely and conveniently at all
times. In all cases where openings occur across the greater part of the
roadway, a substantial driveway shall be maintained across the opening by the
applicants until it is restored.
   2.   The width of all openings shall be no greater than is necessary for
doing the work being permitted, and in no case shall be nearer than 18 inches
to the curb and whenever it shall be deemed necessary by the Borough Manager or
the Borough Engineer, sheeting and bracing shall be used to keep the sides of
the opening or openings perpendicular and prevent unnecessary caving, all
expense to be paid by the applicants, and all work shall be under the
supervision and approval of the Borough Manager. The failure or refusal of the
Borough Manager or the Borough Engineer to suggest the use of bracing or
sheeting, or a better quality, grade or section, or larger sizes of steel or
timber, or to suggest sheeting, bracing, struts, or shoring to be left in
place, shall not in any way or to any extent relieve the applicant of any
responsibility concerning the condition of excavation or of any of his
obligations relating to injury to persons or property, nor impose any liability
on the Borough Manager or Borough Council, Marysville Borough, or the Borough
Engineer, their agents or employees.
   3.   Applicants shall fill the opening in such a manner as will assure
against settling and shall make their own paving repairs to restore surface to
its original condition. The trench shall be backfilled to a point at least 2
inches below the existing street surface with select granular material (2RC) as
specified in the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Publication 408,
latest edition, or material approved by the Borough Engineer. Two compacted
inches of temporary bituminous material shall then be placed. The temporary
bituminous material shall remain in place for a minimum of 90 days and a
maximum of 110 days from the time of placement. The temporary bituminous
material and select granular material (2RC) shall at that time be removed to a
point 8 inches below the existing street grade. Any settlement shall be
repaired by the placement and compaction of additional select granular material
(2RC) as necessary for the final subgrade to be 8 inches below the existing
street grade. The opening shall then be saw cut back a distance of 1 foot on
all sides. Said cut back shall be excavated a minimum of 8 inches in depth. A

and the concrete shall be cured in accordance with the requirements of §503 of
the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Publication 408, latest edition,
for a minimum of 96 hours for the class A and 72 hours for the high early
strength cement concrete. After the cement concrete has cured as required, the

Manager or Borough Engineer shall inspect the area from time to time and if for
a period of two years from the date the said area is repaved, further filling
or repair shall be required to keep the area in good order and repair, the
Borough Manager shall cause such repairs as shall be necessary to be made and
shall bill the applicant for the same.
   4.   Curb and sidewalk repair or construction shall be constructed from
concrete in accordance with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation

thoroughfare, including all appurtenances and structures such as guardrails or
drain pipes, shall be restored to a condition equal to that which existed
before the start of any work authorized by the permit.
      B.   If the permittee opens the pavement, whether to install a new
facility or to modify an existing facility or for any other reason, and the
wearing course is less than 10 years old, the permittee shall, in addition to
the minimum restoration conditions outlined herein, overlay the pavement in
accordance with the following conditions:
         (1)   When a longitudinal opening longer than 10 feet and wider than 3
feet is made in the pavement, the permittee shall overlay the traffic lane(s)
in which the opening was made for the entire length of highway that was opened.

made, for the entire length of highway that was opened, if the Borough
determines that the present serviceability index of the highway, street, alley,
or thoroughfare, has been impaired by the openings.
      D.   Overlays of pavement shall extend a minimum of 2 feet outside the
opening. Overlay areas shall be milled a depth of 1½ inches and after

to do so, and if he shall fail to do so promptly, the Borough of Marysville
shall collect the cost thereof and 10% additional, together with all charges
and expenses in the manner provided by law including, but not being limited to,
legal fees, engineering fees and the filing of a municipal claim against the
said property. If said applicant is a utility with no property to be claimed,
no further permits shall be issued and no work allowed in the Borough of
Marysville until such time said utility may make complete restitution to the
Borough of Marysville.
   7.   The Borough Secretary shall keep an accurate record of all permits

PART 5
DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 22-501.   Intent.
   1.   The purpose of the design standards are:
      A.   To promote a compact, mixed use community which serves as an
activity center for the surrounding area and to promote revitalization, direct
reinvestment, and sustain the economic vitality while being sensitive to design
context and individual neighborhood character;
      B.   To ensure the provision of a full range of public facilities,
services, and infrastructure (water service, sewer service, transportation, and
communications) and allow the coordinated expansion of such facilities the
economic vitality while being sensitive to design context and individual
neighborhood character;
      C.   To incorporate flexibility into traditionally regulated areas and
promote a unified streetscape to strengthen the visual and physical character
of existing neighborhoods. The intent is to retain and promote the existing
businesses and to facilitate new development that contributes to and upgrades
established neighborhoods;
      D.   To attract new commercial and professional businesses that provide
quality jobs. To support community-based business development. To create a
sustainable economy that connects people with job opportunities;
      E.   To improve the transportation system to service employers, employees
and community members. To provide adequate, affordable, and accessible mass and
specialized transit services. To develop aesthetically pleasing, interconnected
transportation systems that encourage walking, biking, and public transit, and
discourage high-speed traffic which will protect and improve the quality of our
air;
      F.   To encourage the preservation, adaptation, re-use, and protection of
the integrity of historic buildings and structures, archaeological sites, and
other cultural resources. To design new buildings to complement the
architectural character of the surrounding neighborhood;
      G.   To allow for a range of housing types at a range of densities on
land sufficient to accommodate current and projected housing needs. To increase
housing choice, affordability, diversity in housing types and tenure (rental
and ownership options);
      H.   To improve the character and form of development in order to enhance
the quality of life for current and new residents. To establish cohesive, safe
neighborhoods, and a clean, healthy physical environment. To design new
communities to accommodate citizens from a wide range of economic levels,
occupations, age groups, backgrounds, and interests; and
      I.   To preserve, protect, enhance, and restore the native plant and
animal diversity and functioning natural systems. To develop a permanently
preserved open space system that provides a diversity of publicly accessible
open space resources in the form of town squares, greenways, and parks. To
protect, conserve, and improve surface and groundwater resources.
   2.   The intent of the design standards is to provide clear, quantitative
review standards that are easy to administer and offer certainty to developers
and citizens alike while maintaining a degree of design flexibility to allow
and encourage creative site and building designs and encourage alternative
design solutions that result in a better, distinctive product.
(Ord. 614, 5/11/2015)
§ 22-502.   General.
Use of a sketch plan per §
22-402 is strongly encouraged to be used in conjunction with Part 5.
(Ord. 614, 5/11/2015)
§ 22-503.   Compliance with Borough Ordinances Required.
All plans shall be designed in compliance with the Borough zoning ordinance and
all other applicable ordinances, plans, studies, and local requirements.
(Ord. 614, 5/11/2015)
§ 22-504.   Zoning Approvals Required Prior to Plan Submission.
When a plan proposal requires the grant of a special exception, conditional use
or variance from the Borough zoning ordinance, the applicant shall obtain such
special exception, conditional use or variance approval from the Borough and/or
Zoning Hearing Board, as applicable, prior to the submission of the preliminary
plan. The plan shall be designed and developed in accordance with any
conditions that have been imposed upon the grant of such special exception,
conditional use or variance by the Borough Council and/or Zoning Hearing Board,
as applicable.
(Ord. 614, 5/11/2015)
§ 22-505.   Site Layout/Development Pattern.
   1.   General.
      A.   Building design projects shall be compatible with adjacent
development where appropriate. The layout of principal buildings, accessory
structures, and parking areas along a street is an example of a repeated site
pattern that creates a cohesive visual identity and attractive pedestrian
street scene for an area. Creating a strongly defined street edge will improve
the pattern of development. A sense of visual unity is created within a
neighborhood when similar building features are repeated.
      B.   Building orientation strongly influences a development site’s focus
of activity. A building oriented at least in part to an adjoining public street
can create a strong presence in the public realm, and can contribute
significantly to a pedestrian-friendly built environment. Building design that
creates or adds to the visual interest of a streetscape and a pedestrian scale
is an essential element of development projects. Building height, scale, and
massing can be used to emphasize important corners, designate points of entry,
and promote compatibility with surrounding uses. Planting shall be sited,
massed, and scaled to maintain visibility of doors and first floor windows from
the street and from within the development.
   2.   General Arrangement.
      A.   Buildings and open space shall be compatible with, or complement the
established proportion and building mass of adjacent developments and maintain
a pedestrian scale and character when appropriate. In order to maintain or
create a sense of place and “arrival”, all developments at the intersection of
2 arterial and/or collector streets shall comply with the following site layout
and building orientation standards:
         (1)   Parking areas and drive-through facilities shall not be located
within a 150 foot radius measured from the intersection of the centerline of
the 2 streets;
         (2)   Land development located within a 150-foot radius from the
intersection of the centerline of the 2 streets shall include 1 or more of the
following focal point features which shall be visible from the intersecting
streets:
            (a)   A distinctive architectural or building design that does not
represent standard franchise architecture;
            (b)   Fountains or other water feature;
            (c)   Public plazas or other open space;
            (d)   Natural, historic or cultural feature (See §
22-522); or
            (e)   Significant landscape feature. (See §
22-523)
      B.   Entry facades shall orient to create an inviting image, consistent
front, and street edge definition.
      C.   To the maximum extent practicable, the orientation of new lots
created shall repeat the predominant relationship of buildings to buildings and
buildings to street along the same and facing block faces.
(Ord. 614, 5/11/2015)
§ 22-506.   Lot Access.
   1.   Connections to compatible adjacent land uses should be provided to the
maximum extent feasible.
      A.   Common or shared service and delivery access to compatible land uses
should be provided between adjacent parcels and/or buildings.
      B.   Projects should not become an isolated island in the surrounding
community. Instead, to offer greater connectivity and reduce vehicle congestion
between adjacent land uses, the following standards shall apply except where
prohibited for overriding public safety or other traffic related
considerations:
         (1)   The internal street system shall connect to the perimeter public
street system to provide multiple direct connections to, and between local
destinations.
         (2)   The internal street system shall connect to the perimeter public
street system to provide community connections to knit separate developments
together rather than forming barriers between them.
   2.   In order to maximize the efficiency of the street network, major
traffic generators should be located so that their primary access is from a
thoroughfare or commercial access street.
      A.   If a land use is proposed at a location or density that will have a
significant effect (increase of 25 ADT) on current traffic patterns, a traffic
impact study shall be required to ensure that the street network can
accommodate the anticipated traffic demands and to define required street
improvements.
      B.   The number of entrances should be minimized to the extent possible
in order to reduce conflicting points and facilitate traffic flow. The specific
location of primary vehicle entrances is dependent on the following factors:
         (1)   The location of existing or planned median breaks;
         (2)   Separation distances between the entrance and major
intersections, minor intersections, and adjacent entrances;
         (3)   The need to provide shared access to adjacent parcels of land;
         (4)   The need to align with previously approved or constructed access
points on the opposite side of the street;
         (5)   The minimum number of entrances needed to move traffic onto and
off the site safely and efficiently; and
         (6)   The need to provide multiple direct connections to, and between,
local destinations such as parks, schools, and shopping.
   3.   Specific design or geometries of development streets and access drives
shall meet the intent of these design guidelines. (See §
22-511)
      A.   Configuration and design shall be appropriate given the size of the
development and the capacity of the street.
      B.   Geometries shall be dependent on a variety of factors including
traffic volume, speed, and distribution. The resulting design should provide an
efficient ingress and egress to the development and the following design issues
should be addressed in each case:
         (1)   The number of in-bound and out-bound lanes;
         (2)   Lane width;
         (3)   Throat length (i.e. the distance between the street and the
first point at which cross traffic or left turns are permitted);
         (4)   Curb radii;
         (5)   The need or desirability of a raised median;
         (6)   The need for a deceleration lane; and
         (7)   Accommodation for pedestrian and non-motorized crossings.
   4.   A clear system of driveways / access drives / streets shall be
established to carry the highest volumes of traffic within the site. (See §
22-511)
      A.   Internal driveways / access drives / streets shall contain no
perpendicular parking spaces that directly access them.
      B.   Truck loading and circulation facilities shall be appropriately
designed and provided for. To the greatest extent possible, these areas should
be separate from customer parking and pedestrian areas.
      C.   As the size of the development and the volume of the trucks
increase, internal circulation patterns should reflect an increased separation
between non-truck and truck traffic.
(Ord. 614, 5/11/2015)
§ 22-507.   Lot Frontage.
All lots must front on a public street or a private street.
(Ord. 614, 5/11/2015)
§ 22-508.   Provisions for Future Subdivision.
Lots resulting from a proposed subdivision that will be large enough to be
further subdivided should be configured to facilitate such future subdivision.
Adequate street right-of-way shall be provided as necessary.
(Ord. 614, 5/11/2015)
§ 22-509.   Flag Lots.
General. Flag lots represent a viable design alternative under the following
standards. In such cases, evidence shall be submitted to the Borough that
documents the circumstances and demonstrates that the platting of flag lots
shall not restrict the development potential and pattern of development of the
tract and adjacent lands.
   A.   Adjacent flagpoles shall be encouraged to share a common access point.
   B.   Flag lots are encouraged when infill situations exist to achieve
maximum densities.
   C.   The width of a flagpole should be determined by the function of the
driveway, number of lots served, setbacks, grading, and utility requirements.
(Ord. 614, 5/11/2015)
§ 22-510.   Double/Reverse Frontage Lots.
   1.   Residential double frontage lots are only permitted when a reduction of
driveway intersections along a street with a high volume of vehicular movements
is desired or the maintenance of the integrity of a corridor is desired.
   2.   All double frontage lots shall include an identification of the
frontage for use as a street access.
(Ord. 614, 5/11/2015)
§ 22-511.   Streets, Access Drives and Driveways.
   1.   General.
      A.   New streets are compatible with established street patterns and
support the expansion of the overall street system. This may be accomplished by
evaluating future access strip connections prior to submitting plans.
      B.   Maintaining established street patterns within communities helps to
retain a visual continuity and unity to an area. Projects shall repeat
established patterns of vehicle circulation, when feasible, and shall provide
safe, convenient, and efficient vehicular access both within a development and
to the surrounding communities. Circulation patterns shall be designed to limit
points of access from major thoroughfares and minimize the impacts of non-
residential traffic on adjacent residential properties. Joint use with adjacent
landowners is encouraged and access easements to adjoining properties should be
explored. Internal vehicle circulation shall provide a clear visual path to
provide safe, convenient, and efficient vehicular access within and between
developments.
   2.   Consideration should be given to where snow placement easements will be
situated on the site.
   3.   Arrangement. The following criteria shall be considered in the design
of new streets.
      A.   The alignment of streets shall conform to the established pattern
and shall take into account existing topography and other site constraints when
providing for the appropriate extension of existing streets.
      B.   Local streets shall be arranged so as to discourage excessive speeds
when their function is to remain local.
      C.   Curvilinear streets and cul-de-sacs should be utilized only where
topography and natural features dictate them on the site, and where their use
will be consistent with adjoining development patterns. Curvilinear streets
shall not be used immediately adjacent to an existing grid street system
without providing a transition that continues and protects the grid. New street
systems shall take into consideration the dispersal of traffic and to the
ultimate functioning of the existing street system and regional transportation
network.
      D.   Streets shall be laid out to provide convenient and safe access to
the property. Where appropriate, the Borough may require additional cartway
improvements and/or right-of-way width along existing street frontages to
accommodate the anticipated traffic increases and to facilitate vehicular
turning movements to and from individual lots.
      E.   Where a development abuts an existing or proposed arterial and
collector street, the Borough may require access management techniques such as
the use of marginal access streets, double frontage lots, or other such
treatment that will provide protection for abutting properties, reduce the
number of intersections with the arterial street, and separate the local and
through traffic.
      F.   The use of permeable pavement is encouraged on sidewalks, plazas,
driveways and parking lots. Permeable pavement shall not be located on
industrial sites, fueling stations, sites with expansive soils or high depth to
bedrock, areas draining to the permeable pavement greater than 5 acres, areas
with the water table less than 2 feet below the bottom of the pavement base,
and less than 100 feet from drinking wells. Permeable pavement is not allowed
on anything intended for dedication to the Borough.
      G.   Streets shall be designed with drainage grates that are safe for
crossing by bicycles and pedestrians.
      H.   Each street shall be designed to meet the design requirements by use
of
Appendix E.
(Ord. 614, 5/11/2015)
§ 22-512.   Street Hierarchy.
   1.   Each proposed street shall be classified and designed to meet the
standards for 1 of the street types by use of
Appendix E. This classification should be according to the street hierarchy of
the existing transportation network
   2.   Private streets may be used provided the subdivision is 3 lots or less
and the Borough determines that no public benefit will be served by dedication.
Applications that propose a private street shall be accompanied by a
maintenance agreement in accordance with
Appendix F. The maintenance agreement shall be submitted with the final plan
and recorded with the Perry County Recorder of Deeds as part of the final plan.
A note shall be placed on the subdivision plan referencing the maintenance
agreement. This maintenance agreement shall establish the conditions under
which the street will be maintained in accordance with the design approved on
the final plan, and shall stipulate:
      A.   Ownership interest in the private street;
      B.   No limitations on users unless identified in the private agreement;
      C.   A statement indicating that civil court, not the Borough, is
responsible for mitigating differences relating to the agreement;
      D.   The method of assessing maintenance and repair cost;
      E.   Private streets shall meet applicable public street standards;
      F.   The private right-of-way shall be 50 feet in width; and
      G.   Any amendments to the private agreement shall be submitted to the
Borough for review and shall not take effect until approved and recorded with
the Perry County Recorder of Deeds.
(Ord. 614, 5/11/2015)
§ 22-513.   Determination of Required New Street Design Standards.
General. Each street shall be designed to meet the design requirements by use
of
Appendix E and
Appendix F. Newly created right-of-way and cartway width for each interior
street classification shall be determined by the proposed use, projected ADT
and the intensity of development permitted and existing along each street. Each
cartway width shall be based on the travel lane, on-street parking, multi-modal
lanes, and gutter width.

suitable pervious material. See §
22-523.3 for street tree standards. When buffer areas are provided, buffer
areas should be a minimum of 4 feet wide with 8 feet preferred when planted
with trees.
      E.   Rights-of-way.
      (1)   Centerline of the right-of-way may not always be the centerline of
the travel lanes.
      (2)   Where the right-of-way width of the new street is different than
the existing street, a transition area shall be provided, the design of which
is subject to Borough approval.
      (3)   The right-of-way width shall be designed to meet the design
requirements by use of
Appendix E. Right-of-way widths may change for each street, based on the
anticipated future development.
   F.   Vertical Street Alignments.
      (1)   Vertical curves shall be used in changes in grade exceeding 1%.
      (2)   Alignment.

tangential arc with a minimum radius of 5 feet and a maximum radius of 25 feet.
The right-of-way radii at intersections shall be substantially concentric with
the edge of the cartway. Curb return radii of 10 -15 feet should be used where
high pedestrian volumes are present or the volume of turning vehicles is low.
Larger radii should be used when parking or non-motorized lanes are not
provided.
      (6)   Where warranted by a traffic impact study, the Planning Commission
or Borough Council may require additional traffic lanes or additional right-of-
way to facilitate vehicular turning movements at existing or proposed street
intersections within subdivision or land development plans.

§ 22-514.   Access Drives.
Access drives shall be designed to meet the following requirements:
   A.   Any property that utilizes an access drive shall have frontage along a
public or private right-of-way.
   B.   The plan shall note that the access drive does not qualify for
dedication to the Borough and that the landowner assumes all responsibility for
its maintenance.
   C.   Access drives shall be designed for their intended function. All travel
lanes shall be a minimum of 8 feet wide; however, sufficient design information
must be submitted to indicate that the number of travel lanes and width
proposed has been designed to accommodate the anticipated traffic to and from
the development.
   D.   Access drives shall maintain a centerline separation distance of 125
feet from all other access drives and streets. Access drive intersections with
other access drives within the site shall not be subject to such restrictions.
   E.   Proper sight distance shall be provided at access drive intersections
with existing public and private streets according to this Chapter.
(Ord. 614, 5/11/2015)
§ 22-515.   Driveways.
All driveways shall, at a minimum, be designed in accordance with the
following:
   A.   Driveways must be designed in conformance with the sight distance
specified in this Chapter.
   B.   Driveway access to a street shall not be located less than 25 feet from
the edge of the cartway of the intersecting street.
   C.   Driveway access to lots shall be provided to the street of lesser
classification.
   D.   To maintain good access management in the street network, when a
driveway intersects with a collector or arterial street, joint, shared use, or
reverse frontage driveways should be encouraged when such design would increase
traffic safety by decreasing the potential for vehicular conflict.
   E.   Driveways shall be paved within the intersecting street right-of-way.
   F.   Leveling areas shall be provided a minimum of 10 feet from the edge of
street cartway with a maximum slope of 10%.

the rights of ownership, access, and maintenance. The Borough is not
responsible to settle conflict issues with joint or shared driveways.
   H.   Driveways shall be paved with pervious or impervious surfaces.
(Ord. 614, 5/11/2015)
§ 22-516.   Single Access/Cul-De-Sac Streets.
   1.   To the greatest extent possible, through streets shall be provided. The
feasibility of a through street will be based on the physical features of the
tract proposed for development and/or adjoining lots, the potential for
extension of the street to adjoining lands based on existing development
patterns, restrictions imposed by other government regulations and other
recorded documentation, and the ability of the design to meet all requirements
of this Chapter. When single access/cul-de-sac streets are proposed, the
application shall be accompanied by a written analysis of the merits of the
design and the reasons that a through street would not be desirable.
   2.   The length of a single access/cul-de-sac street shall be measured from
the centerline intersection with the through street to the center point of the
turnaround.
   3.   All single access/cul-de-sac streets shall have a minimum length of 250
feet and a maximum length of 500 ft. Temporary single access/cul-de-sac street
shall not have a minimum length.
   4.   Permanent single access/cul-de-sac streets shall serve a maximum of 250
ADT for residential development and a maximum of 500 ADT for non-residential
development. Permanent single access/cul-de-sacs may be extended beyond above
referenced ADT for the following justification provided:
      A.   The cul-de-sac is a boulevard construction or; or
      B.   The adjacent land is 100% built-up.
   5.   Any temporary cul-de-sac street designed for access to an adjoining
property or for authorized phased development and which is greater than one lot
deep shall be provided with a temporary all-weather turnaround. The use of such
turnaround shall be guaranteed to the public until such time as the street is
extended. Sidewalks along temporary cul-de-sacs must be continued at the same
time that the street is continued.
   6.   Cul-de-sacs shall have a circular “T” shaped or “hammerhead” shaped
turnarounds. Turnarounds shall be constructed completely within the right-of-
way.
   7.   Restoration to the temporary cul-de-sac paved areas and sidewalk system
within the right-of-way shall be the responsibility of the developer.
   8.   Permanent cul-de-sacs with a circular turnaround shall be paved, have a
minimum radius of 42 feet without a center island and 45 feet with a center
island.
   9.   Cul-de-sacs with center islands must be constructed to accommodate
emergency vehicles. For example, but not limited to, depressed curbing.
   10.   A 15-foot by the length of the adjacent lot snow easement is required
at the end of cul-de-sacs for snow removal activities.

Borough Council.
   3.   At least 2 street name signs shall be placed at each four-way street
intersection and 1 at each “T” intersection.
   4.   Signs shall be free of visual obstruction. The design of street name
signs should be consistent, of a style appropriate to the Borough, of a uniform
size and color, and erected in accordance with PennDots Handbook of Approved
Signs (Publication 236) and all applicable PennDot sign regulations.
   5.   Private streets shall be provided with street name signs in conformance
with this section. The plan shall note that it is the responsibility of the
developer to install the street name signs for private streets.
(Ord. 614, 5/11/2015)
§ 22-518.   Traffic Signs.

below the bottom of the pavement base, and less than 100 feet from drinking
wells. Permeable pavement includes paving units, porous asphalt pavement, or
porous concrete (using single-sized aggregate and low water content); uniformly
graded stone aggregate with void space; filter fabric lining the subsurface
beds; and uncompacted (or hand compacted) subgrade. Permeable pavement shall
consider the infiltration rate of the soil subgrade under the base. Constant
supervision during construction is encouraged as sediment must be kept from the
aggregate base.
   2.   Off-street parking shall conform to
Chapter 27, Part 5 of the zoning ordinance.
   3.   On-Street Parking.
      A.   On-street parking on at least 1 side of the street is encouraged on
access drives and proposed streets with speeds equal to or less than 30 mph.

(Ord. 614, 5/11/2015)
§ 22-521.   Pedestrian Access and Circulation.
   1.   General. By creating a safe, continuous network of walkways within, and
between developments, and completing partially constructed sidewalk patterns
within communities, pedestrians feel more inclined to safely walk, visit, or
shop. Walkways should provide an inviting and convenient option for pedestrian
movement within a community and promote direct pedestrian access to neighboring
residential, non-residential, and public uses.
   2.   Design Guidelines.
      A.   Trails. Trails shall be provided except for minor subdivisions.
         (1)   Trail width shall be a minimum of 4 feet.
         (2)   Easements 10 feet wide are required for trails. Provide a plan
note indicating such easement must be 5 feet on either side of the centerline
of the trail as constructed.
         (3)   Encroachments into the trail shall not result in less than a 4-
foot wide minimum clearance width from any obstacles.
         (4)   Marked crosswalks shall be provided within the vehicular travel
ways intersecting with trails.
      B.   Sidewalks.
         (1)   Paved sidewalks shall be provided on both sides of a new street.

4-foot wide minimum clearance width from any obstacles.
         (6)   Sidewalks shall not exceed a cross slope of 2%.
         (7)   Ramp cuts shall be located at all sidewalks intersecting with
vehicular travel ways.
         (8)   Marked crosswalks shall be provided within the vehicular travel
ways intersecting with sidewalks.
(Ord. 614, 5/11/2015)
§ 22-522.   Preservation of Natural, Historic, and Cultural Features.
   1.   General. Mature trees, topography, natural drainage ways, scenic
vistas, and historic sites are a few of the elements that contribute to the
distinct character of the Borough. To protect these features and resources that
enhance the local character, infill and redevelopment projects shall work with
the context and integrity of this environment by preserving natural,
historical, and cultural features to the maximum extent possible.
   2.   Design Guidelines. Development projects should integrate existing
natural features, required open space, existing historic structures, and
cultural resources located on and around the site into the overall design and
layout of the development.
      A.   A site analysis shall be submitted using all applicable reports,
plans, and maps to determine whether significant natural or other features
exist on a site that should be protected, with priority being given to the
following areas (which are not listed in order of priority or significance):
         (1)   Floodplains, surface drainage swales, streams and other bodies
of water;
         (2)   Wetlands;
         (3)   Existing significant trees;
         (4)   Historical, cultural, or archeological sites or areas recognized
by the Borough, state, or federal governments as significant;
         (5)   Prominent topography;
         (6)   Steep slopes; and
         (7)   Visual impact.
      B.   The proposed building and impervious footprint(s) shall be clearly
identified on each plan to identify potential impacts to existing trees, other
natural features, historic structures, and cultural resources.
(Ord. 614, 5/11/2015)
§ 22-523.   Landscaping.
   1.   General. Landscaping plants intercept rainfall, reduce storm water
runoff, prevent erosion, and reduce the need for detention. Landscape plants
also provide shade and reduce the temperature created by additional impervious
surfaces. Plants release moisture back into the environment, improve air
quality, and remove contamination from the soil and water by absorbing excess
nutrients, filter sediments, and break down pollutants. Planting native plants
helps provide habitat, food, and protection for native species and ecosystems.
Planting native species generally increases the chance for long term
survivability of the plant because they are naturally adapted to local
conditions. Planting non-native species and cultivars could be incorporated in
designs when they provide a superior plant for spatial constraints and urban
stress mitigation found in local site conditions. Existing significant trees
which help contribute to the sense of place should be preserved to the maximum
extent practical.
   2.   Design Guidelines.
      A.   Native plant materials should be incorporated in all designs. The
use of native plant material can help improve water quality, provide additional
and improved wildlife habitat, and typically adapt to local conditions which
then require less maintenance. Native plants must be used near greenways,
suburban forested areas, wetlands, and riparian areas.
      B.   Except as noted above, non-native plants may be included in place of
a native plant if it is not considered invasive and the plant does not
introduce pests or diseases. A non-native plant may be incorporated into
designs when they prove to be better suited for the soil, environment, or
spatial constraints, urban stress mitigation, and integration into the
surrounding ecosystem.
      C.   The following is a list of invasive plants which may not be used in
any urban planting schedule:
         (1)   Trees. Tree-of-heaven (ailanthus altissima), norway maple (*acer
platanoides), sycamore maple (acer pseudoplatanus), empress tree (paulownia
tomentosa), callery pear (*pyrus calleryana), siberian elm (ulmus pumila)
         (2)   Shrubs. Japanese barberry (*berberis thunbergii), European
barberry (berberis vulgaris, russian olive (elaegnus angustifolia), autumn
olive (elaeagnus umbellate), winged euonymus (*euonymus alatus), border privet

honeysuckle (lonicera tartarica), standish honeysuckle (lonicera standishii),
morrow’s honeysuckle (lonicera morrowii), Amur honeysuckle (lonicera maackii),
bell’s honeysuckle (lonicera morrowii x tatarica), common buckthorn (rhamnus
catharticus), glossy buckthorn (rhamnus frangula), wineberry (rubus
phoenicolasius), multiflora rose (rosa multiflora), Japanese spiraea (*spiraea
japonica), guelder rose (*viburnum opulus var. opulus).
         (3)   Grasses. Cheatgrass (bromus tectorum), Japanese stilt grass
common reed (phragmites australis), reed canary grass (phalaris arundinacea),
johnson grass (sorghum halepense), and bamboo (poaceae), shattercane (sorghum
bicolor ssp. drummondii)
         (4)   Flowers. Garlic mustard (alliaria petiolata), goutweed
aegopodium podagraria), bull thistle (crisium vulgare), canada thistle (cirsium
arvense), musk thistle (carduus nutans), jimsonweed (datura stramonium),
goatsrue (galega officinalis), giant hogweed (heracleum mantegazzianum, dame’s
rocket (hesperis matronalis), purple loosestrife (lythrum salicaria, L.
virgatum), eurasian water-milfoil (myriophyllum spicatum), star-of-bethlehem
(ornithogallum nutans, umbellatum), japanese knotweed (polygonum (falopia)
cuspidatum/ polgonum sachalinense), wild parsnip (pastinaca sativa), beefsteak
plant (perilla frutescens), lesser celandine (ranunculus ficaria), water
chestnut (trapa natans).
         (5)   Vines. Fiveleaf akebia (akebia quinata), porcelain-berry
(ampelopsis brevipedunculata), oriental bittersweet (celastrus orbiculatus),
japanese honeysuckle (lonicera japonica), kudzu (pueraria lobata), mile-a-
minute vine (polygonum perfoliatum).
* Species with cultivars that are known to be non-invasive may be acceptable
within a planting plan.
   3.   Street Trees / Screening / Vegetative Buffering.
      A.   Any existing vegetation that is in appropriate locations, of an
acceptable species and quality may be used to fulfill landscaping or buffering
requirements.
      B.   Any landscaping should create, or be part of the process to create
larger landscape patches and corridor ecosystems and larger interior areas and
less edge areas. Connectivity to existing landscaping shall be encouraged.
      C.   In order to aid surveillance and minimize the potential for crime,
planting shall also be sited, massed, and scaled to maintain visibility of
doors and first floor windows from the street and from within the development
to the greatest extent possible. Planting patterns shall not obstruct sight
lines or create isolated areas, especially near pedestrian walking paths.
      D.   Trash disposal areas, such as dumpster or compactor sites, shall be
effectively screened so as to be screened with a combination of architectural

         (7)   Natural environment areas;
         (8)   Recreational amenities; or
         (9)   Trails.
      F.   All planting shall be performed in conformance with good nursery and
landscape practice. Plant materials shall conform to the standards recommended
by the American Association of Nurserymen, Inc., in the American Standard of
Nursery Stock, ANZIZ60, current edition, as amended.
         (1)   Provide a landscape plan note indicating that the top of the
main order root (first large set of roots that divide from the trunk) shall be
planted no lower than 1 or 2 inches into the soil.
         (2)   Planting designs are encouraged to share planting space for
optimal root growth whenever possible. Continuous planting areas vs. isolated
planting boxes are encouraged.
         (3)   No staking and wiring of trees shall be allowed without a
maintenance note for the staking and wiring to be removed within 1 year of
planting.
         (4)   All street trees shall be provided by the applicant in
accordance with the following standards:
            (a)   The trees shall be nursery grown in a climate similar to that
of the locality of the project. Varieties of trees within the right-of-way
shall be subject to the approval of the authority that accepts ownership of the

3 of the tree or shrub shall be damaged or dead without replacement.
Replacement plants shall conform to all requirements of this section and shall
be maintained after replanting for an additional 24 months.
            (f)   The plant’s growth shall not interfere with the street
cartway, sidewalk, signage, easements, clear sight triangles, or utility line.
Within the clear sight triangle, typical branching shall not be within 10 feet
of ground level after 10 years of growth.
            (g)   No one species shall comprise more than 33% of the entire
number of street trees in a particular development.
            (h)   Existing significant trees and natural features, such as
drainage corridors, shall be preserved to the maximum extent practicable and
incorporated into site plans and site design as major amenities.
            (i)   If a significant tree is designated to be preserved but is
removed or substantially damaged during the clearing, grading, or construction,
the applicant or developer shall be required to replace the removed or damaged
tree with one approved by the Shade Tree Commission.
      G.   Street trees shall be provided in all land developments which
include new streets.
         (1)   Street trees shall not be located farther than 40 feet away from
the new street right-of-way.
         (2)   The number of street trees shall be based on 2 street trees
required for every 100 linear foot of new street measured from the centerline.
         (3)   The spacing of trees shall be based on the size of the tree
canopy at maturity with trees spaced no closer than 30 feet on center if the
tree canopy is less than 30 foot spread at maturity, spaced 30-60 feet on
center if the tree canopy is 30 to 50 feet spread at maturity, and street trees
spaced 50 to 100 feet on center if the tree canopy is over 50 feet spread at
maturity. When a less formal arrangement is desired, where more massing is
appropriate, or improvements such as benches are located grouping of street
trees is encouraged.
         (4)   Street trees shall be one of the following species:

(Ord. 614, 5/11/2015)
§ 22-524.   Lighting Requirements.
   1.   Purpose. The purpose of this subsection is to require and set minimum
standards for outdoor lighting to:
      A.   Provide for and control lighting in outdoor public places where
public health, safety and welfare are potential concerns;
      B.   Protect drivers and pedestrians from the glare of non-vehicular
light sources;
      C.   Protect neighbors and the night sky from nuisance glare and light
trespass from improperly selected or poorly placed, aimed, applied, maintained
or shielded light sources;
      D.   Promote energy-efficient lighting design and operation;
      E.   Protect and retain the intended visual character of the various
venues of the Borough.
   2.   Applicability.
      A.   This subsection applies to uses that are proposed to operate during
hours of darkness where there is public assembly and traverse, including but
not limited to the following: multi-family residential, residential,
commercial, industrial, recreational and institutional uses, and sign,
billboard, architectural and landscape lighting applications.
      B.   The Borough Council may require lighting be incorporated for other
uses, applications and locations, as it deems necessary.
      C.   The glare-control requirements herein contained apply to lighting in
all uses, applications and locations.
   3.   Criteria.
      A.   Illumination Levels. Lighting, where required by this Chapter or
otherwise required or allowed by the Borough, shall have intensities and
uniformities and glare control in accordance with the current recommended
practices of the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA) as
contained in the IESNA Lighting Handbook and applicable Recommended Practices,
except as may otherwise be required by the Borough.
      B.   Lighting Fixture Design.
         (1)   Fixtures shall be of a type and design appropriate to the
lighting application and as approved by the Borough.
         (2)   For the lighting of predominantly horizontal surfaces such as,
but not limited to parking areas, roadways, vehicular and pedestrian passage
areas, merchandising and storage areas, automotive-fuel dispensing facilities,
automotive sales areas, loading docks, cul-de-sacs, active and passive
recreational areas, building entrances, sidewalks, bicycle and pedestrian
paths, and site entrances, fixtures shall be aimed straight down and shall meet
IESNA full-cutoff criteria. Fixtures with an aggregate rated lamp lumen output
per fixture that does not exceed the rated output of a standard 60-watt
incandescent lamp, i.e., 1,000 lumens, are exempt from the requirements of this
paragraph.
         (3)   For the lighting of predominantly non-horizontal surfaces such
as, but not limited to, facades, landscaping, signs, billboards, fountains,
displays and statuary, fixtures shall be fully shielded and shall be installed
and aimed so as to not project their output into the windows of neighboring
residences, adjacent uses, past the object being illuminated, skyward or onto a
public roadway. Fixtures with an aggregate rated lamp lumen output per fixture
that does not exceed the rated output of a standard 60-watt incandescent lamp,
i.e., 1,000 lumens, are exempt from the requirements of this paragraph.
         (4)   “Barn lights,” aka “dusk-to-dawn lights,” where visible from
other properties, shall not be permitted unless fully shielded.
      C.   Installation.
         (1)   Electrical feeds for lighting poles shall be run underground,
not overhead.
         (2)   Poles supporting lighting fixtures for the illumination of
parking areas and located directly behind parking spaces, or where they could
be hit by snow plows, shall be placed a minimum of 5 feet outside paved area or
tire stops, or placed on concrete pedestals at least 30 inches high above the
pavement, or suitably protected by other Borough-approved means.
         (3)   Pole mounted fixtures for the illumination of horizontal tasks
shall be aimed straight down.
   4.   Residential Development Fixture Placement.
      A.   For residential developments where lot sizes are or average less
than 20,000 square feet, street lighting shall be provided at:
         (1)   The intersection of public streets with entrance streets to the
proposed development;
         (2)   Intersections involving proposed public or non-public streets
within the proposed development;
         (3)   The apex of the curve of any street, public or non-public,
within the proposed development, having a radius of 300 feet or less;
         (4)   Cul-de-sac bulbs;
         (5)   Terminal ends of center median islands having concrete structure
curbing, trees and/or other fixed objects not having breakaway design for
speeds of 25 m.p.h. or greater;
         (6)   Defined pedestrian crossings located within the development.
         (7)   At other locations along the street as deemed necessary by the
Borough.
      B.   Where lot sizes permit the parking of less than 3 vehicles on the
residential lot, thereby necessitating on-street parking, street lighting shall
be provided along the length of the street.
      C.   In multi-family developments, common parking areas shall be
illuminated.
      D.   In residential developments with lots of less than 20,000 square
feet, where 5 or more common contiguous parking spaces are proposed, such
spaces shall be illuminated.
   5.   Plan Submission. For subdivision and land-development applications
where site lighting is required by this Chapter, is otherwise required by the
Borough or is proposed by applicant, lighting plans shall be submitted to the
Borough for review and approval with preliminary and final subdivision/land
development plan applications and conditional use applications and shall
contain the following:
      A.   A plan or plans of the site, complete with all structures, parking
spaces, building entrances, traffic areas (both vehicular and pedestrian),
vegetation that might interfere with lighting, and adjacent uses that might be
adversely impacted by the lighting. The lighting plan shall contain a layout of
all proposed fixtures by location, orientation, aiming direction, mounting
height and type. The submission shall include, in addition to proposed area
lighting, all other exterior lighting, e.g., architectural, building-entrance,
landscape, flag, sign, etc.
      B.   A 10'x10' illuminance grid (point-by-point) plot of maintained
horizontal footcandles overlaid on the site plan, plotted out to 0.0
footcandles, which demonstrates compliance with the light trespass, intensity
and uniformity requirements as set forth in this Chapter or as otherwise
required by the Borough. When the scale of the plan makes a 10'x10' grid plot
illegible, a larger grid spacing may be used.
      C.   The lamp lumen ratings and types, maintenance (light-loss) factors
and IES file nomenclature used in calculating the illuminance levels.
      D.   Description of the proposed equipment, including fixture catalog
cuts, photometries, glare reduction devices, lamps, on/off control devices,
mounting heights, pole foundation details and mounting methods.
      E.   Landscaping plans shall contain lighting fixture locations and shall
demonstrate that the site lighting and landscaping have been coordinated to
minimize conflict between vegetation and intended light distribution, both
initially and at vegetation maturity.
      F.   When requested by the Borough, applicant shall also submit a visual-
impact plan that demonstrates appropriate steps have been taken to mitigate the
potential consequences of on-site and off-site glare and to retain the intended
character of the Borough. This plan may require the inclusion of initial
vertical footcandle values at specific off-site venues, e.g., bedroom windows
of adjacent residential uses.
      G.   Plan Notes - The following notes shall appear on the lighting plan:
         (1)   Post-approval alterations to lighting plans or intended
substitutions for approved lighting equipment shall be submitted to the Borough
for review and approval.
         (2)   The Borough reserves the right to conduct post-installation
inspections to verify compliance with the Ordinance requirements and approved
lighting plan commitments, and if deemed appropriate by the Borough, to require
remedial action at no expense to the Borough.
         (3)   All exterior lighting shall meet IESNA full-cutoff criteria
unless otherwise approved by the Borough.
   6.   Street Lighting Dedication.
      A.   When street lighting is to be dedicated to the Borough, applicant
shall be responsible for all costs involved in the lighting of streets and
street intersections until the street is accepted for dedication.
      B.   Prior to dedication and in the event of the formation of a
homeowner’s association and/or property management declaration, Borough shall
require said agency to enter into an agreement guaranteeing the Borough payment
of all costs associated with dedicated street lighting.
      C.   Assumption of costs of dedicated street lighting. Upon dedication of

and preserve stream channels;
      C.   Provide design, construction and maintenance criteria for permanent
on-site stormwater management facilities for the purpose of controlling
stormwater, erosion and sedimentation pollution;
      D.   Encourage recharge of groundwater and the preservation and
restoration of the flood carrying capacity of streams; and
      E.   Provide for the proper installation and maintenance of stormwater
management facilities. This part does not imply that areas within or outside
any identified flood-prone areas shall be free from flooding or flood damage.
   2.   Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan.
      A.   General Requirements and Standards.
         (1)   In conjunction with the submission of a subdivision or land
development plan and for any activities involving earth disturbance of more
than 5,000 square feet, an erosion and sedimentation control (E&S) plan must be
submitted to the County Conservation District for their approval in accordance
with the requirements of the “Rules and Regulations”, Chapter 102, EROSION
CONTROL authorized under P. L. 1987, June 22, 1987. A copy of the E&S Plan must
be provided to the Borough. Subsequently, an approved erosion and sedimentation
control plan, together with a letter from the Perry County Conservation
District indicating whether a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) Permit from the Department of Environmental Protection for earthmoving
activity is required, must be provided to the Borough.
         (2)   The applicant shall be responsible to prepare and forward all
applicable erosion and sedimentation control plan information and other data to
the appropriate county and state agencies.
         (3)   The Borough shall not issue a zoning or building permit to those
engaged in earth moving activities requiring a Department of Environmental
Protection permit or other NPDES Permits, until the Department has reviewed and
issued any applicable permit.
         (4)   Maintenance of erosion and sediment control measures is required
by the applicant/developer. The Perry County Conservation District and the
Borough, as authorized by the Municipalities Planning Code, reserve the right
to inspect these measures at any time before the building occupancy permit is
issued and may issue a notice of violation if the installed measures are found
to be in significant non-compliance. Said notice will list the specific type,
location and scope of each violation, and a period of time during which the
person(s) responsible for the earth-moving activity must correct the
violations. Failure to comply with the notice or multiple violations may result
in a cease and desist order issued by the Borough to prevent or restrain
building, construction or conduct of business, and to correct or abate
accelerated erosion and sediment pollution to waters of the Commonwealth.
         (5)   Earth disturbance activities other than those necessary for
preparation of sites for building foundations, stormwater and sediment control
devices and on-site sewage disposal systems, shall be minimized between October
15 and February 15.
         (6)   In the preparation of erosion and sedimentation control plans
the person preparing such plans shall consult with the Perry County
Conservation District to determine the measures needed to control erosion and
sedimentation pollution. The Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control Program
Manual, prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection in
accordance with Chapter 102 shall be used in the preparation of such plans.
Copies are available in the Perry County Conservation District office.
   3.   Stormwater Management Plan.
      A.   A stormwater management plan shall be submitted when any person,
partnership, business or corporation shall undertake a subdivision or land
development that involves any of the following activities and in no case will
these activities be undertaken without written approval from the Borough:
         (1)   Earth disturbing activity involving 5,000 square feet or more,
except agricultural activity, provided such activity conforms to USDA Natural
Resource Conservation Service guidelines;

         (3)   Installation of stormwater systems or appurtenances thereto;
         (4)   Movement or alteration to an existing stormwater management
system, included but not limited to, pipes, swales, basins, infiltration
trenches, etc;
         (5)   Placement of fill, structures or pipes in the floodplain as
designated on the official floodplain map, and as may be documented by other
pertinent sources of floodplain information used by the Borough;
         (6)   Installation of impervious cover totaling 5,000 square feet or
more on a single lot, or 2 or more lots when proposed as part of an overall
plan.
         (7)   In accordance with Part 3 (§22-305), Modifications of
Requirements, the Borough may waive the requirements of this Section in favor
of the following: Whenever any activity set forth in this Section is determined
by the Borough Engineer not to require retention or detention of stormwater
runoff and direct discharge of stormwater runoff is approved by the Borough
Council, the owner/developer shall be required to determine the impact of said
direct discharge on all downstream drainage facilities and property as
identified by the Borough Engineer and shall submit, with the Preliminary and
Final Plans, a report of the study of the impacts on downstream facilities and
property.
      B.   Content of the Stormwater Management Plan. The stormwater management
plan shall be submitted in mapped tabular and digital form in accordance with
the standards contained in Exhibits 5-1 through 5-4 and shall identify all
proposed stormwater management facilities and supportive information outlined
in this Section. Stormwater management data shall be prepared by a professional
engineer or landscape architect registered in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
to perform such duties. A certificate of accuracy must accompany stormwater
management plans, and a signature and seal of the engineer or landscape
architect responsible must appear on the plan. For subdivision or land
development activities, the stormwater management plan shall be included as
part of the subdivision or land development plan submission(s) to the Borough
and shall include the following items:
         (1)   A general statement describing the project, the date the project
is expected to begin and end, a description of existing and proposed
conditions; ownership and maintenance of facilities, and conclusions.
Conclusions shall include a comparison of existing and proposed peak rates of
runoff at all points where runoff leaves the applicant’s property;
         (2)   A 7 ½ minute USGS topographic map, or equivalent, illustrating
the project location and its total watershed(s), and additional maps as
necessary, to clearly indicate the delineation of all drainage areas, both on
site and off site, used in all computations for all drainage and stormwater
management facilities;
         (3)   Existing and finished contours, 2-foot intervals, except in
areas where slope is greater than 20%, in which case the contour interval shall
be 5 feet;
         (4)   Aerial extent of the project soils from Perry/Cumberland Soil
Survey with annotations for erodible soils, hydric soils, and soils with hydric
inclusions;
         (5)   Boundary lines of the project area;
         (6)   Existing drainage on project and adjoining properties such as
floodplain, wetlands, streams, lakes, ponds and easements;
         (7)   All calculations, assumptions, criteria, and references used in
the design of the stormwater management facilities, the establishment of
existing facilities capacities, and the pre- and post-development discharges;
         (8)   All plans and profiles of the proposed stormwater management
facilities, including horizontal and vertical location, size and type of
material;
         (9)   For all basins, a plotting or tabulation of the storage volumes
and discharge curves with corresponding water surface elevations, inflow
hydrographs, and outflow hydrographs, including all assumptions and calculation
methodologies;
         (10)   The guidelines for lot grading within the subdivision. This
information shall identify the direction of stormwater runoff flow within each
lot and the areas where stormwater runoff flows will be concentrated. This
information shall be shown by topographical data including contours and spot
elevations. Plans which assume future transfer of lot ownership shall show
individual lot grading which maintains the proposed stormwater management plan,
or a phasing plan shall be submitted with separate calculations which address
interim stormwater management.
         (11)   When stormwater management plans are for a portion of a larger
project or include offsite flows through the subject property, a generalized
stormwater management plan for the entire project shall be included in the
plan. This generalized plan shall demonstrate how the stormwater for the
proposed section will relate to the entire development. If temporary facilities
are required for construction of a section, such facilities shall be included
in the submitted plans. In the event temporary measures cannot adequately
handle the stormwater runoff, the main outfall shall be included as part of the
construction of the proposed sections and detailed information regarding these
facilities shall be included with the plan.
      C.   General Design Guidelines for Stormwater Management Facilities. The
following design guidelines are presented as the minimum acceptable standards
available at the time this Chapter was adopted. New and innovative procedures
are encouraged and shall be permitted on a case by case basis as approved by
the Borough Engineer. Future stormwater ordinances, whether stand-alone or
amended to the SALDO, shall be consistent with the applicable county, state
and/or federal watershed management plan(s).
         (1)   In the interest of:
            (a)   Reducing the total area of impervious surface;
            (b)   Preserving existing features which are critical to stormwater
management; and
            (c)   Reducing the concentration of stormwater flow, the designer
should consider the best utilization of land for the least disturbance of
natural features, resources and terrain.
         (2)   Existing on-site natural and manmade stormwater management
facilities shall be utilized when and where possible.
         (3)   Stormwater shall not be transferred from one watershed to
another, unless:
            (a)   The watersheds are sub-watersheds of a common watershed which
join together within the perimeter of the property;
            (b)   The effect of the transfer does not alter the peak discharge
onto adjacent lands; or
            (c)   Easements from the affected landowner are provided.
         (4)   Consideration shall be given to the relationship of the subject
property to the drainage pattern of the watershed. A concentrated discharge of
stormwater to an adjacent property shall be within an existing watercourse or
enclosed in an easement or returned to a pre-development condition.
         (5)   Innovative stormwater best management practices (BMPs) and
recharge facilities may be proposed (e.g., rooftop storage, drywells, cisterns,
recreation area ponding, diversion structures, porous pavements, holding tanks,
infiltration systems, stream channel storage, in-line storage in storm sewers,
and grading patterns). They shall be located, designed, and constructed in
accordance with the latest technical guidance published by the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection provided they are accompanied by
detailed engineering plans and performance capabilities and supporting site
specific soils, geology, runoff and groundwater and infiltration rate data to
verify proposed designs. Additional guidance from other sources may be accepted
at the discretion of the Borough Engineer. A pre-application meeting with the
Borough Engineer is required.
         (6)   Infiltration/groundwater recharge stormwater management
facilities shall be located, designed, and constructed in accordance with the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection’s NPDES Permit, Post
Construction Stormwater Management (PCSM) guidelines for stormwater discharges
associated with construction activities, and standards and specifications for
infiltration practices.
         (7)   Infiltration Guidelines and Criteria.
            (a)   Land development in which impervious cover of natural ground
is increased shall provide facilities to minimize the total increase in
stormwater runoff to that which would have occurred from the land prior to
development. A Post-Construction Stormwater Management Plan (PCSM) shall be
designed to control stormwater resulting from the 2-year - 24-hour frequency
storm through activities that retain site soil permeability, maintain or
restore the site’s vegetative cover, maintain or replicate the original
contours, and do not result in direct stormwater discharges to surface waters
and allow sites to maintain their natural ability to control runoff volume and
velocity, infiltrate stormwater, filter sediments and pollutants, and recycle
nutrients.
            (b)   Stormwater Best Management Practice (BMP) Facilities which
provide for percolation and/or storage of water, including: cisterns, French
drains, seepage pits, and seepage terraces shall be provided to limit site
runoff increases in those areas where soils and water table conditions permit,
as determined by soils analysis.
            (c)   On wooded lots, future runoff increases shall be limited
through notes or graphics on approved land development plans prescribing
“minimum disturbance/minimum maintenance” areas where special care is taken to
preserve existing site vegetation through careful control of the envelope of
disturbance during proposed new construction.
            (d)   Vegetated berms or other approved runoff trapping devices
such as cisterns may be used in lieu of or in conjunction with infiltration
facilities where site conditions limit the use of infiltration techniques.
            (e)   Measures may be imposed to protect against ground or surface
water pollution where the type of business or the nature of the soils
underlying a runoff structure would constitute a substantial risk of
contamination. These measures shall be outlined in a pollution prevention
contingency (PPC) plan prepared under the NPDES permit requirements for post-
construction stormwater management (PCSM) plan.
      D.   Drainage Design and Construction Standards.
         (1)   Peak Flow.
            (a)   Stormwater management facilities shall be designed so that
the peak discharge of calculated post-development runoff to an adjacent
property does not exceed the peak discharge of the calculated pre-development
runoff for the required storm frequencies at any point on the perimeter of the
land being develop. The design plan and construction schedule must incorporate
measures to minimize soil erosion and sedimentation pollution. Because it is
not economically sound to provide facilities that can manage the greatest storm
on record unless danger to life may be involved, property may be destroyed, or
traffic flow on main highways may be interrupted, the runoff calculations for
the post-development and pre-development comparison shall use 2.33, 5, 10, 25,
50 and 100-year frequency storm events unless, as stated above, danger to life,
property, or traffic may be involved.
            (b)   In these cases, the Borough may require the comparison,
design, and storage of a greater storm event and/or the comparison of a greater
post development storm event with a smaller pre-development storm event. In all
cases undeveloped land within the project shall be considered good sod surface
or natural forest, whichever best describes the pre-development condition.
            (c)   Runoff coefficient for post development condition shall be
based on the land uses listed in Exhibit 5-1.
            (d)   In cases where impervious cover exists, the Borough Engineer,
at the request of the Planning Commission or Borough Council, will determine
the characteristics of the pre-developed site for appraising stormwater
management requirements.
         (2)   System Design.
            (a)   The design of stormwater management facilities (i.e. grass
waterways, open channels, swales, ditches, etc.) and all other water carrying
facilities shall be based upon a post 10-year frequency storm event.
            (b)   The design of pipes and inlets and their appurtenances shall
be based on a post 25-year storm event.
            (c)   Stormwater management facilities that convey off-site
stormwater through the site shall be designed to convey a post development 100-
year frequency storm event.
            (d)   Stormwater management designs must include provisions that
allow for the overload conveyance of the post development 100-year frequency
storm event to flow through the site without damage to any public or private
property.
         (3)   Rain Fall.
            (a)   Runoff calculations for the purposes of developing
hydrographs shall be based on the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
Soil-Cover-Complex Method. The Rational Formula of Q=CIA shall be used for all
conveyance calculations.
            (b)   When the Soil-Cover-Complex Method is used, stormwater runoff
calculations shall be based on the NOAA Atlas 14.
            (c)   When the Rational Method is used, appropriate values of
rainfall intensity shall be from the latest edition of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, Department of Transportation Design Manual, Part 2, Highway
Design, and Chapter 10 (Exhibit 5-2)
         (4)   Time of Concentration. Times of concentration shall be based on
NRCS Segmental Methodology utilizing the following design parameters:
            (a)   Overland Flow. The maximum length for each reach of overland
flow before concentrated swale flow develops is 300 feet, 100 feet for sheet
flow and 200 feet for shallow concentrated flow. The appropriate value of
Manning’s “n” factor for the given conditions shall be used for determining the
times of concentration.
            (b)   Concentrated Flows. At points where overland flows
concentrate in field depressions, swales, gutters, curbs, or pipe collection
systems, the time of concentration between these design points shall be based
on the Manning Equation and/or acceptable engineering design standards as
approved by the Borough Engineer.
         (5)   Any proposed direct stormwater discharge at the perimeter of the
site shall not be beyond the capacity of any existing, immediately contiguous,
stormwater management facility into which the discharge flows, regardless of
pre-existing conditions.
         (6)   Natural drainage ways shall be utilized to the maximum extent
possible in carrying stormwater runoff, provided such use remains consistent
with the purpose of this Part.
         (7)   Detention and Retention Basins.
            (a)   Basins shall be designed to safely pass the peak discharge of
a post-development 100-year frequency storm event through an emergency spillway
with 1 foot of freeboard between the maximum pool elevation and the top of the
facility assuming that the outlet structure is 100% clogged. The spillway shall
be no more than 50-feet wide and shall be located in undisturbed material and
clearly located on the plan. All outlets shall be combined in a manner which
will not damage the integrity of the basin or the downstream drainage area.
            (b)   Retention basins and/or detention basins, and water carrying
facilities shall be stabilized promptly in accordance with current soil
conservation service practices.
            (c)   Retention basins and/or detention basins shall be designed
and maintained to insure the design capacity after sedimentation has taken
place.
            (d)   Basins which are not designed to release all stormwater shall
be specifically identified as retention basins or permanent pond basins. Such
basins should not be mown, but rather encouraged to generate ecosystems to
maximize recharge, including infrequent planting of native species.
            (e)   All other basins shall have provisions for de-watering,
including the bottom of the basin, and shall not create swampy conditions which
are difficult to maintain. Low flow channels and tile fields may be used to de-
water the bottom of a basin.
            (f)   Retention basins and/or detention basins which are designed
with earth fill dams shall incorporate the following minimum standards:
               (i)   The maximum water depth shall not exceed 6 feet in depth
unless otherwise approved by the Borough Council after consultation with the
Borough Engineer.
               (ii)   The minimum top width of a dam breast shall be 5 feet
unless otherwise approved by the Borough Council after consultation with the
Borough Engineer.
               (iii)   The height of the dam shall not exceed 8 feet from the
inside toe of slope, unless otherwise approved by the Borough Council after
consultation with the Borough Engineer.
               (iv)   The side slopes of the compacted earth fill shall not be
steeper than 3 horizontal to 1 vertical (3:1).
               (v)   Basins without restricted access shall have impoundment
areas with side slopes no steeper than 5 horizontal to 1 vertical. Basins with
steeper side slopes shall be protected by fencing that will restrict access,
but will include access gate(s) for maintenance. Fencing at an adequate height
to protect the public from entering any retention or detention basin shall be
provided.
               (vi)   A cutoff trench of impervious material shall be provided
under all dams, with side slopes of 3 horizontal to 1 vertical or flatter. A
dam with steeper sides shall be provided with a key trench.
               (vii)   All pipes and culverts through dams shall be fitted with
watertight joints and shall have properly spaced concrete cutoff collars or
factory welded anti-seep collars.
               (viii)   Minimum floor elevations for all structures that would
be affected by a basin, other temporary impoundments, or open conveyance
systems where ponding may occur shall be 2 feet above the 100-year stormwater
surface, if basement or underground facilities are proposed, detailed
calculations addressing the effects of stormwater ponding on the structure and
water-proofing and/or flood-proofing design information shall be submitted for
approval.
               (ix)   Trash racks are to be placed on detention basin
structures and/or pipe inlets/outlets
         (8)   Piping.
            (a)   The capacities of pipes shall be calculated by the Manning
Equation or any other method of equal caliber which is acceptable to the
Borough Engineer.
            (b)   Curved pipes, tee joints, elbows, and wyes are prohibited
except for pipes with at least a 36-inch diameter or height. Minor horizontal
deviations for smaller pipe shall be reviewed on a case by case basis.
            (c)   All piping used in the storm drainage system shall be in
accordance with PennDOT 408 specifications. A minimum pipe size of 18 inches in
diameter shall be used in all street systems (public or private) proposed for
construction in the Borough. A minimum pipe size of 15 inches in diameter for
on-site surface drainage requirements is permitted on private facilities which
receive no off-site drainage. Pipes shall be designed so as to provide a
minimum velocity of 2 ½ feet per second when flowing full. Arch pipe of
equivalent cross-section area may be used in lieu of round pipe where cover or
utility conflict conditions exist.
            (d)   All storm drainage piping discharging to the ground surface
shall be provided with either reinforced concrete headwalls and end sections or

            (f)   The “n” factor for concrete or any other smooth pipe shall be
.010 for velocity and .013 for capacity.
         (9)   Swales and Channels. The capacities of swales and roadside
gutters shall consider all possible hydraulic conditions. Swales shall meet the
following requirements:
            (a)   For grass swales and roadside gutters, two design
considerations shall be met:
               (i)   The channel velocity and stability of the swale or gutter
shall be based upon a low degree of retardance (“n” of 0.03);
               (ii)   The channel capacity shall be based on a high degree of
retardance (0.050).
            (b)   The “n” factor to be used for paved or rip-rap swales or
gutters shall be in accordance with the Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control
Program Manual, prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection.
            (c)   Grass lined or planted channels shall have a minimum slope of
0.7%.
         (10)   Inlets and Culverts.
            (a)   Inlets and culverts shall be constructed in accordance with

Roadway Construction Standard Drawings contained in PennDOT Standards for
Roadway Construction (RC-34) or other detail approved by the Borough Engineer.
            (b)   All inlets shall have weep holes covered with geotextile
fabric placed at the appropriate elevations to completely drain the subgrade
prior to placing the base course and surface course.
            (c)   The maximum allowable spread of water on streets in a 25-year
storm event is ½ of a travel lane.
            (d)   Stormwater management calculations shall include an inlet
capacity analysis in order to verify spacing and to compute by-pass flow.
            (e)   All inlets in paved areas shall have heavy duty bicycle safe
grating. A note to this effect shall be added to the subdivision and land
development plan.
            (f)   All pipes entering or exiting inlets shall be cut flush with
the inlet wall.
            (g)   Inlets deeper than 5 feet shall be provided with manhole type
steps for access. A note to this effect shall be added to the subdivision and
land development plan.
            (h)   At the bottom of any inlet, additional concrete shall be
added and adequately formed to provide for a smooth and efficient flow of water
within the inlet. (Refer to PennDOT Standards for Roadway Construction RC-34).
         (11)   Manholes.
            (a)   Manholes, when proposed, shall be spaced not more than 400
feet apart. Additionally, manholes shall be placed at points of abrupt changes
in the horizontal or vertical direction of storm sewers. Inlets may be
substituted for manholes where they will serve a useful purpose.
            (b)   Manholes shall be constructed in accordance with
specifications set forth in the PennDOT, Publication 408, and as detailed in
the Roadway Construction Standard Drawings (RC-34).
         (12)   Runoff Velocity.
            (a)   The maximum velocity of stormwater runoff shall be maintained
at levels which result in a stable channel both during and after channel
construction. The following are characteristics of a stable channel:
               (i)   It neither aggrades nor degrades beyond tolerable limits;
               (ii)   The channel banks do not erode to the extent that the
channel cross-section is changed appreciably;
               (iii)   Excessive sediment bars do not develop;
               (iv)   Excessive erosion does not occur around culverts and
bridges or elsewhere;
               (v)   Gullies do not form or enlarge due to the entry of
uncontrolled stormwater runoff.
               (vi)   Where channel or swale bends occur, the computed
velocities shall be multiplied by the following factor for the purpose of
designing channel erosion protection:
                  1.5 When swale bend is 0 to 30 degrees;
                  1.75 When swale bend is 30 to 60 degrees;
                  2.00 When swale bend is 60 to 90 degrees;
                  2.50 When swale bend is 90 degrees or greater
               (vii)   Where the velocity of stormwater runoff exceeds the
allowable velocity for soils, erosion protection must be provided. The methods
of erosion protection proposed must be supported by the appropriate design
information and references.
            (b)   Grass lined or planted channels shall be considered stable if
the calculated velocity does not exceed the allowable velocities shown below:
               (i)   Three feet per second where only sparse vegetation can be
established and maintained because of shade or soil conditions, and for all
roadside swales.
               (ii)   Four feet per second where normal growing conditions
exist and vegetation is to be established by seeding.
               (iii)   Five feet per second where a dense, vigorous sod can be
quickly established or where water can be temporarily diverted during
establishment of vegetation. Netting and mulch or other equivalent methods for
establishing vegetation shall be used.
               (iv)   Six feet per second where there exists a well established
sod or vegetation of good quality. These calculated grass lined or planted
channel flows may be exceeded if the designer can provide supportive design
criteria as proof of erosion prevention.
               (v)   Calculated grass lined or planted channel flows may be
exceeded if the designer can provide acceptable supportive design criteria as
proof of erosion prevention. Where the velocity of stormwater runoff exceeds
the allowable velocity, erosion protection must be provided. The method of
erosion protection proposed must be supported by the appropriate design
information and/or references.
         (13)   Compliance with Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)
Chapter 105 Regulations. A DEP permit in accordance with Chapter 105 shall be
required for any obstruction or encroachment in the regulated waters and
wetlands of the Commonwealth, prior to the approval of the final plan. All
areas of the Borough shall be classified as suburban or urban (see DEP Section
105.141) for bridge and culvert designs. In the event any question or conflict
arises between this Part and the DEP Chapter 105 Regulations, the design
criteria contained in the DEP regulations shall govern.
         (14)   Compliance with Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
Section 408 Specifications. All materials, workmanship and methods of work
shall comply with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Form 408
specifications and/or the Municipal Standard Materials and Construction
Specifications for Public Improvements, as accepted and commonly used by the
Borough. Requests for modification of requirements for relief of the
requirements of this Part and/or from the Form 408 Specifications may be
approved by the Borough Council after consultation with the Borough Engineer in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Part 3 of this Chapter.
      E.   Emergency Spillways. An emergency spillway shall be provided to
safely pass the proposed peak 100-year storm with 1 foot of freeboard between
the maximum pool elevation and the top of the facility assuming that the
spillway is 100% clogged and there is no storage available.
      F.   Seasonal High Groundwater Table. The invert of all stormwater ponds
and underground infiltration/ storage facilities shall be located a minimum of
2 feet above the seasonal high groundwater table. The invert of stormwater
ponds can be lowered if adequate subdrainage is provided.
      G.   Easements. Drainage easements in accordance with §
22-525 of this Chapter shall be provided along all areas where stormwater
runoff from land development facilities is proposed. The easements shall run
from the origin of such facilities through all areas of a project where piping,
swales or natural watercourses exist. In the event that runoff from a project
is to discharge to other than a natural watercourse on an adjoining property,
appropriate easement agreements shall be executed by the developer with
adjoining property owners. In no case shall any drainage easement be less than
30 feet in width.
   4.   Clear Water Systems.
      A.   General. In order to provide for the efficient and effective
disposal of concentrated rainfall runoff from roof drains and area drains, and
the collected ground water from floor drains, footer drains and sump pump pits,
clear water collection systems shall be designed and installed in all
subdivision and land developments.
      B.   Pipe Specifications.

management plan computations.
      G.   Clear Water Systems Plan. The type, size and location of the clear
water system piping shall be shown on the preliminary and/or final construction
drawings including sufficient details for construction of the system as
designed.
   5.   Other Approvals. Compliance with Part 5 does not preclude the need to
obtain other permits and approvals as required by Borough, the County
Conservation District, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the US Government and
other agencies. Other permits and approvals may include zoning and building
permits from the Borough, and erosion and sedimentation control plan, national
pollutant discharge elimination system permit (NPDES), water obstruction and
encroachment permit, dam safety permit, submerged lands license agreement,
Sections 401 and 404 of the Clean Water Act, and others. The most stringent of
all pertinent requirements shall apply.
   6.   Ownership and Maintenance of Erosion and Sedimentation Control and
Stormwater Management Facilities.
      A.   Before the Borough grants approval of the erosion and sedimentation
control plan and/or stormwater management plan and final plan applications, the
applicant shall provide information to the Borough in writing describing the
ownership and maintenance responsibilities for such facilities. A note to this
effect shall be placed on any preliminary and/or final plan.
      B.   In cases where permanent erosion and/or stormwater management
facilities are held as common facilities and/or owned by a home owners
association, land owner, corporation, partnership, etc., it shall be the
responsibility of that entity to maintain the facilities. In such cases, a
legally binding agreement between the owner and the Borough shall be prepared
by the applicant describing the ownership arrangement and the provisions for
maintaining all permanent stormwater management facilities. The agreement shall
include provisions providing for the inspection of all facilities by the
Borough on a regular basis and after each major flood event, where facilities
are critical to the public welfare. In addition, the applicant shall present to
the Borough a copy of restrictions and agreements with an affidavit stating
that such restrictions and agreements shall be added to the deed of conveyance
to each grantee to whom property of the development is to be conveyed.
Agreements shall conform to the BMP Maintenance and Monitoring Agreement

      C.   Delinquency. In the event that the owner of stormwater management
facilities shall, at any time after the construction or establishment of the
facility, fail to adhere to the ownership and maintenance agreement and keep
any said facility or facilities in reasonable working order and condition in
accordance with established standards, guidelines and agreements, the Borough
Council may serve written notice upon the owner, association, condominium,
corporation, partnership, etc. in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Part 3 of this Chapter.
      D.   In cases where permanent erosion and stormwater management
facilities, rights-of-way, and access easements to these facilities are
dedicated to the Borough and accepted by the Borough Council, it shall be the
Borough’s responsibility to maintain these facilities.
   7.   Borough Liability. The degree of stormwater management sought by the
provisions of this Section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes.
This Section shall not create liability on the part of the Borough, any
appointed or elected official of the Borough, the County Conservation District,
or any officer, engineer or employee thereof for any erosion, sedimentation
pollution or flood damages that may result from reliance on this article or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

RAINFALL COEFFICIENT “C” FOR RATIONAL FORMULA AND “CN” RANGE
NOTE: The C values provided in Table 4.2 have been equated to approximate CN
values (Hydrologic soil groups B & C) and percent imperviousness through use of
the Rossmiller C factor nomograph. If required, a specific C value may be
developed by use of Figure 4.1 - Rossmiller’s nomograph. In most cases,
however, use of Table 4.2 will provide a sufficiently accurate “C” value. This
table should not be used to determine CN numbers for the TR - 55 Method.
EXHIBIT 5-2
RAINFALL INTENSITY COMPUTATION
The following figure contains generalized rainfall intensity-duration curves to
be used especially for storm durations less than 60 minutes. A 1-hour storm
must be supplied from the previously described rainfall estimating procedure,
and entered at duration 60 minutes in the following Figure. From the
intersection of the 1-hour storm intensity and the 60-minute ordinate the user
follows the path of the nearest curve to the duration of the design storm, then
moves horizontally to the y-axis to read the corresponding storm intensity in
inches/hour.
Example: Given a 1-hour storm of 2.5 in./hr., find the 30-minute intensity for
the same storm recurrence frequency. Start at 60-minute duration and 2.5 in./
hr. intensity, move along curves to 30 minutes, and read the 30-minute
intensity as 3.9 in./hr.

OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE PLAN FOR STORMWATER BMPs
A.   INSPECTIONS
   1.   Stormwater facilities and permanent BMPs must be inspected, at a
minimum on an annual basis, or as requested by the Borough, in accordance with
this O & M Plan. The property owner has two options:
         i.   Employing a qualified registered professional to conduct the
inspections and prepare reports; or
         ii.   Entering into an agreement with the Borough for the Borough to
conduct the inspections and prepare reports. This can be included in the
Stormwater Facilities and Best Management Practices (BMP) Maintenance and
Monitoring Agreement (M & M Agreement).
   2.   If Option i. is chosen, the entity conducting the inspection shall be
required to submit a report to the Borough within thirty days following
completion of the inspection. The report shall document the condition of the
facilities and recommend needed repairs. Recommended repairs and other
corrective actions shall be implemented by the property owner within thirty
days of the report date.
   3.   If Option ii. is chosen, the property owner shall be responsible for
reimbursing the Borough for the costs involved in accordance with the M & M
Agreement.
   4.   Inspections of open basins shall include but not be limited to:

IMPROVEMENT AND MAINTENANCE GUARANTEES
§ 22-601.   General Statement.
   1.   No plat shall be finally approved unless the streets shown on such plat
have been improved to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable condition,
or improved as may be required by the subdivision and land development
ordinance and any walkways, curbs, gutters, street lights, fire hydrants, shade
trees, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers and other improvements as may
be required by this Chapter have been installed in accordance with this
Chapter. In lieu of the completion of any improvements required as a condition
for the final approval of a plat, including improvements or fees required
pursuant to §22-602.2.B.(4), the applicant shall deposit with the Borough
financial security in an amount sufficient to cover the costs of such
improvements or common amenities including, but not limited to, roads, storm
water detention and/or retention basins and other related drainage facilities,
recreational facilities, open space improvements, or buffer or screen plantings
which may be required. The applicant shall not be required to provide financial
security for the costs of any improvements for which financial security is
required by and provided to the Department of Transportation in connection with
the issuance of a highway occupancy permit pursuant to Section 420 of the act
of June 1, 1945 (P.L. 1242, No. 428) known as the “State Highway Law.”
   2.   If water mains and/or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with
apparatus or facilities related thereto, are to be installed under the
jurisdiction and pursuant to the rules and regulations of a public utility or
municipal authority separate and distinct from the Borough, financial security
to assure proper completion and maintenance thereof shall be posted in
accordance with the regulations of the controlling public utility or municipal
authority and shall not be included within the financial security as otherwise
required by this section.
   3.   No final plan shall be signed by the Borough for recording in the
Office of the County Recorder of Deeds unless:
      A.   Financial security in accordance with the requirements of §22-602 is
accepted by the Borough, and/or;
      B.   The improvements required by this Chapter have been properly
guaranteed or completed.
(Ord. 614, 5/11/2015)
§ 22-602.   Financial Security and Improvement Guarantee.
   1.   General.
      A.   The administration of the financial security shall comply with the
provisions of Article V, Section 509 the PA Municipalities Planning Code, Act
247, as amended, and other applicable laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
      B.   Such financial security shall provide for, and secure to the public,
the completion of any improvements which may be required on or before the date
fixed in the formal action of approval or in the developer’s agreement for
completion of the improvements. (See
Appendix D)
   2.   Submission of Improvements Guarantee. Final plan applications that
include public improvements that have not been installed shall include an
improvement guarantee in the form of financial security.
      A.   Type of Financial Security.
         (1)   Without limitation as to other types of financial security which
the Borough may approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
Federal or Commonwealth chartered lending institution irrevocable letters of
credit and restrictive or escrow accounts in such lending institutions shall be
deemed acceptable financial security for the purposes of this section.
         (2)   Such financial security shall be posted with a bonding company
or Federal or Commonwealth chartered lending institution chosen by the party
posting the financial security, provided said bonding company or lending
institution is authorized to conduct such business within the Commonwealth.
         (3)   Such bond, or other security shall provide for, and secure to
the public, the completion of any improvements which may be required on or
before the date fixed in the formal action of approval or accompanying
agreement for completion of the improvements.
      B.   Amount of Financial Security.
         (1)   The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion
of the required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost of completion
estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for completion by the
developer. Annually, the Borough may adjust the amount of the financial
security by comparing the actual cost of the improvements which have been
completed and the estimated cost for the completion of the remaining
improvements which have been completed and the estimated cost for the
completion of the remaining improvements as of the expiration of the 90th day
after either the original date scheduled for completion or a rescheduled date
of completion. Subsequent to said adjustment, the Borough may require the
developer to post additional security in order to assure that the financial
security equals said 110%. Any additional security shall be posted by the
developer in accordance with this subsection.
         (2)   The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an
estimate of the cost of completion of the required improvements, submitted by
the applicant prepared by a professional engineer licensed as such in
Pennsylvania and certified by such engineer to be a fair and reasonable
estimate of such cost. The estimate submitted to the Borough shall be organized
and itemized to provide a detailed line by line estimate of costs of all public
improvements required. The Borough, upon the recommendation of the Borough
Engineer, may refuse to accept such estimate for good cause shown. If the
applicant and the Borough are unable to agree upon an estimate, then the
estimate shall be recalculated and recertified by another professional engineer
licensed as such in Pennsylvania and chosen mutually by the Borough and the
applicant. The estimate certified by the third engineer shall be presumed fair
and reasonable and shall be the final estimate. In the event that a third
engineer is so chosen, fees for the services of said engineer shall be paid
equally by the Borough and the applicant.
         (3)   If the party posting the financial security requires more than 1
year from the date of posting of the financial security to complete the
required improvements, the amount of financial security may be increased by an
additional 10% for each 1 year period beyond the first anniversary date from
posting of financial security, or to an amount not exceeding 110% of the cost
of completing the remaining required improvements as reestablished on or about
the expiration of the preceding one-year period.
         (4)   In the case where development is projected over a period of
years, the Borough may authorize submission of final plans by section or stages
of development subject to such requirements or guarantees as to improvements in
future section or stages of development as it finds essential for the
protection of any finally approved section of the development.
      C.   Developer’s Agreement. The applicant shall declare the intent to
provide an improvement guarantee by executing the developer’s agreement
included in this Chapter. The developer’s agreement shall be executed prior to
the recordation of the final plan.
   3.   Plan Approval Conditioned Upon Financial Security. When requested by
the developer, in order to facilitate financing, the governing body or the
planning agency, if designated, shall furnish the developer with a signed copy
of a resolution indicating approval of the final plan contingent upon the
developer obtaining a satisfactory financial security. The final plan or record
plan shall not be signed nor recorded until the financial improvements
agreement is executed. The resolution or letter of contingent approval shall
expire and be deemed to be revoked if the financial security agreement is not
executed within 90 days unless a written extension is granted by the governing
body; such extension shall not be unreasonably withheld and shall be placed in
writing at the request of the developer.
   4.   Release of Financial Security.
      A.   As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request the Borough to release or
authorize the release, from time to time, of such portions of the financial
security necessary for payment to the contractor or contractors performing the
work. Any such requests shall be in writing addressed to the Borough, and the
Borough shall have 45 days from receipt of such request within which to allow
the Borough Engineer to certify, in writing, to the Borough that such portion
of the work upon the improvements has been completed in accordance with the
approved plan. Upon such certification the Borough shall authorize release by
the bonding company or lending institution of an amount as estimated by the
Borough Engineer fairly representing the value of the improvements completed
or, if the Borough fails to act within said 45 days period, the Borough shall
be deemed to have approved the release of funds as requested. The Borough shall
always, prior to final release at the time of completion and certification by
the Borough Engineer, require retention of a minimum of 10% of the estimated
cost of the aforesaid improvements. Such funds will be released only after
certification by the Borough Engineer that all required public improvements so
guaranteed have been completed satisfactorily.
      B.   When the developer has completed all of the necessary and
appropriate improvements, the developer shall notify the Borough, in writing,
by certified or registered mail, of the completion of the aforesaid
improvements and shall send a copy thereof to the Borough Engineer. The Borough
shall, within 10 days after receipt of such notice, direct and authorize the
Borough Engineer to inspect all of the aforesaid improvements. The Borough
Engineer shall, thereupon, file a report, in writing, with the Borough, and
shall promptly mail a copy of the same to the developer by certified or
registered mail. The report shall be made and mailed within 30 days after
receipt by the Borough Engineer of the aforesaid authorization from the
governing body; said report shall be detailed and shall indicate approval or
rejection of said improvements, either in whole or in part, and if said
improvements, or any portion thereof, shall not be approved or shall be
rejected by the Borough Engineer, said report shall contain a statement of
reasons for such nonapproval or rejection.
         (1)   The Borough shall notify the applicant, within 15 days of
receipt of the Borough Engineer’s report, in writing by certified or registered
mail of the action of said Governing Body with relation thereto.
         (2)   If the Borough or the Borough Engineer fails to comply with the
time limitation provisions contained herein, all improvements will be deemed to
have been approved and the applicant shall be released from all liability,
pursuant to this performance guaranty bond or other security agreement.
         (3)   If any portions of the said improvements are not approved or are
rejected by the Borough, the applicant shall proceed to complete the same with
the required corrections and, upon completion, the same procedure of
notification, as outlined herein, shall be followed. Upon satisfactory
completion of all required improvements, after consultation with the Borough
Manager and the Borough Engineer, the Borough may release to the applicant any
remaining financial security, including by not limited to, the withheld 10%
minimum.
      C.   Nothing herein shall be construed as a limitation of the applicant’s
right to contest or question by legal proceedings or otherwise, any
determination of the Borough or the Borough Engineer.
   5.   Remedies to Effect Completion of Improvements. In the event that any
improvements which may be required have not been installed as provided in this
Chapter or in accordance with the approved final plan, the Borough is hereby
granted the power to enforce any financial security by appropriate legal and
equitable remedies. If proceeds of the financial security are insufficient to
pay the cost of installing or making repairs or corrections to all the
improvements covered by said security, the Borough may, at its option, install
all or part of such improvements and may institute appropriate legal or
equitable action to recover the funds necessary to complete the remainder of
the improvements. All of the proceeds, whether resulting from the security or
from any legal or equitable action brought against the applicant, or both,
shall be used solely for the installation of the improvements covered by such
security, and not for any other Borough purpose.
   6.   Other Effects of Financial Security. If financial security has been
provided in lieu of the completion of improvements required as a condition for
the final approval of a plan as set forth in this Section, the Borough shall
not condition the issuance of building, grading or other permits relating to
the erection or placement of improvements, including buildings, upon the lots
or land as depicted upon the final plan upon actual completion of the
improvements depicted upon the approved final plan. Moreover, if said financial
security has been provided, occupancy permits for any building or buildings
shall not be withheld following:
      A.   The application of the asphalt binder course the streets providing
access to and from existing public roads to such building or buildings; as well
as
      B.   The completion of all other improvements as depicted upon the
approved plan, either upon the lot or lots or beyond the lot or lots in
question if such improvements are necessary for the reasonable use of or
occupancy of the building or buildings.
(Ord. 614, 5/11/2015)
§ 22-603.   Inspection of Improvements During Construction.
   1.   Prior to the initiation of construction, the developer shall notify the
Borough in order to coordinate an inspection schedule with the construction
schedule. Additionally, the Borough Engineer shall be notified 4 working days
in advance of any intended date of construction. The provisions stated herein
shall be construed as mandating periodic inspections and the undertaking of
periodic inspections shall not be construed as an acceptance of the work during
construction or as a final inspection of the construction.
   2.   Reimbursement for Inspections. The applicant shall reimburse the
Borough for the reasonable and necessary expense incurred for the inspection or
improvements according to a schedule of fees adopted by resolution of the
Borough and as amended from time to time.
      A.   In the event the applicant disputes the amount of any such expense
in connection with the inspection of improvements, the applicant shall, within
100 working days of the date of billing, notify the Borough and the Borough
Engineer that such expenses are disputed as unreasonable or unnecessary, in
which case the Borough shall not delay or disapprove a subdivision or land
development application or any approval or permit related to development due to
the applicant’s request over disputed Borough Engineer expenses.
      B.   If, within 100 days from the date of billing, the Borough and the
Applicant cannot agree on the amount of expenses which are reasonable and
necessary, then the Applicant and the Borough shall jointly, by mutual
agreement, appoint another professional engineer licensed as such in
Pennsylvania to review the said expenses and make a determination as to the
amount thereof which is reasonable and necessary.
      C.   The professional engineer so appointed shall hear such evidence and
review such documentation as the professional engineer in his sole opinion
deems necessary and render a decision within 50 days after the date of
appointment. The applicant shall be required to pay the entire amount
determined in the decision within 60 days.
      D.   In the event that the Borough and applicant cannot agree upon the
professional engineer to be appointed within 20 days of the request for
appointment of an arbitrator, then, upon application of either party, the
President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of the judicial district in which
the Borough is located (or if at the time there be no President Judge, then the
senior active judge then sitting) shall appoint such engineer, who, in that
case, shall be neither the Borough Engineer nor any professional engineer who
has been retained by, or performed services for, the Borough or the applicant
within the preceding 5 years.
      E.   The fee of the appointed professional engineer for determining the
reasonable and necessary expenses shall be paid by the applicant if the amount
of payment required in the decision is equal to or greater than the original
bill. If the amount of payment required in the decision is less than the
original bill by $2,500 or more, the Borough shall pay the fee of the
professional engineer, but otherwise the Borough and the applicant shall each
pay 1/2 of the fee of the appointed professional engineer.
(Ord. 614, 5/11/2015)
§ 22-604.   Dedication of Improvements.
All improvements shall be deemed to be private improvements and only for the
specific project until such time as the same have been offered for dedication
and formally accepted by the Borough. No responsibility of any kind with
respect to improvements of the final plan shall be transferred until the
improvements have been formally accepted. No improvements shall be accepted for
dedication except upon submission of as-built drawings by the developer and
inspection of the final construction by the Borough in accordance with the
provisions of this Chapter.
(Ord. 614, 5/11/2015)
§ 22-605.   Maintenance Guarantee.
   1.   Where the Borough accepts dedication of all or some of the required
improvements following completion, the Borough may require the posting of
financial security to secure the structural integrity of said improvements as
well as the functioning of said improvements in accordance with the design and
specifications as depicted on the final plan for a term not to exceed 18 months
from the date of acceptance of dedication. Said financial security shall be of
the same type as otherwise required in this Section with regard to installation
of such improvements, and the amount of the financial security shall not exceed
15% of the actual cost of installation of said improvements.
   2.   If water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with
appurtenances or facilities related thereto, are to be installed under the
jurisdiction and pursuant to the rules and regulations of a public utility or
borough authority separate and distinct from the Borough, financial security to
assure proper completion and maintenance thereof shall be posted in accordance
with the regulations of the controlling public utility or municipal authority
and shall not be included within the financial security as otherwise required
by this Part.
(Ord. 614, 5/11/2015)
§ 22-606.   As Built Plans.
Within 90 days of construction completion of all required improvements
including facilities proposed for dedication to the Borough and prior to final
inspection by the Borough of all improvements and site grading for which an
improvement guarantee has been posted, the developer shall submit a plan
labeled “as-built plan,” which shall depict the actual location, dimensions and
elevations of all existing improvements and site grading. In addition, the plan
shall indicate that the existing grading, drainage structures and/or drainage
systems and erosion and sediment control practices, including vegetative
measures, are in substantial conformance with the previously approved drawings
and required specifications. The plan shall note all deviations from the
previously approved drawings. The applicant’s engineer shall certify that the
construction of the storm water management facility was completed in accordance
with the plans and specifications as originally submitted and approved by the
Borough. Three copies of the as- built plan (2 paper and 1 transparency) shall
be submitted to the Borough, which shall distribute a paper copy to the Borough
Engineer and retain 2 copies for Borough files for future reference.
(Ord. 614, 5/11/2015)
PART 7
SUPPLEMENTAL REQUIREMENTS, TESTS AND STUDIES
§ 22-701.   Traffic Impact Study.
   1.   Purpose. Whenever a traffic impact study is required, it is anticipated
that the study will enable the Borough to assess the impact of a proposed
development on the local transportation system. Its purpose is to ensure that
proposed developments do not adversely affect the transportation network and to
identify any traffic problems associated with access from the site to the
existing transportation network. The study’s purpose is also to delineate
solutions to potential problems and to present improvements to be incorporated
by the developer in the proposed development.
   2.   Definitions. ON-SITE IMPROVEMENT - All street improvements constructed
on the applicant’s property, or the improvements constructed on the property
abutting the applicant’s property necessary for the ingress and egress to the
applicant’s property.
   3.   Applicability.
      A.   A traffic impact study (TIS) shall be required for all subdivisions
or land development that at build-out are projected to generate 20 or more two-
way “trip ends” in the development’s peak hour, or 200 average daily two-way
trip ends. Calculation of the number of trip ends shall be done in accordance
with the latest edition of the publication titled Trip Generation, published by
the Institute of Transportation Engineers, or upon traffic studies conducted
within the last 5 years at comparable developments.
      B.   The Borough Council, at its discretion, may require the preparation
of a traffic impact study for any other subdivision or land development or
other major change of use of property.
      C.   The boundaries of the study area to be analyzed shall include those
existing and proposed streets and intersections which may be affected by the
proposed subdivision or land development, as determined by the Borough
Engineer.
   4.   Traffic Impact Study Contents.
      A.   General site description. The site description shall include the
location, proposed land uses, acreage, construction staging and completion date
of the proposed subdivision or land development. Types of dwelling units shall
be included for residential developments and gross and usable floor area for
non-residential developments. A brief description of surrounding land uses and
other proposed land developments within the study area shall be provided. A
study area map shall also be included.
      B.   Transportation facilities description.
         (1)   The study shall describe the proposed internal transportation
system, including vehicular, bicycle, pedestrian and other intermodal
circulation, all internal roadway widths and rights-of-way, parking conditions,
traffic channelizations and any traffic controls within the site.
         (2)   The study shall describe location and design of proposed access,
including sight distance limitations and distance from adjacent driveways and
intersections.
         (3)   The traffic impact study report shall describe the external
roadway system within the study area. Major intersections in the study area
shall be identified and mapped. All existing and proposed public transportation
services and facilities within the Borough limits shall be documented.
Pedestrian and bicycle facilities on abutting properties shall also be
documented. All proposed or approved roadway improvements within the study area
shall be noted.
      C.   Existing traffic conditions. Existing traffic conditions shall be
documented for all streets and intersections in the study area. Traffic volumes
shall be recorded for existing average daily traffic, existing peak hour
traffic and for traffic during the development’s peak hour. Complete traffic
counts at all intersections in the study area shall be conducted, encompassing
the peak hours of the development and roadway. A volume capacity analysis using
the procedures of the current Highway Capacity Manual and based upon existing
volumes shall be performed during the peak hour(s) of the development and for
all roadways and major intersections in the study area. Levels of service shall
be determined for each location.
      D.   Transportation impact of the development. Estimation of vehicular
trips to result from the proposal shall be completed for the peak hour(s) of
both the street system and the development. The current Highway Capacity Manual
shall be followed in making such estimates. These generated volumes shall be
distributed to the study area and assigned to the existing streets and
intersections throughout the study area. Documentation of all assumptions used
in the distribution and assignment phase shall be provided. Traffic volumes
shall be assigned to all access points. Pedestrian volumes shall also be
calculated, if applicable. If school crossings area to be used, pedestrian
volumes shall be assigned to each crossing. Any characteristics of the site
that will cause unusual trip generation rates and/or traffic flows shall be
noted.
      E.   Analysis of transportation impact. The total future traffic demand
based on full occupancy of the proposed subdivision or land development shall
be calculated for the existing and proposed streets and intersections. This
demand shall consist of the combination of the existing traffic expanded to the
completion year through the use of an accepted background growth rate, the
development-generated traffic, and the traffic generated by other proposed
developments in the study area. A volume/capacity analysis shall also be
conducted using the total future demand and the future roadway capacity. If
staging of the proposed development is anticipated, calculations for each stage
of completion shall be made. For projects on state roads for which a volume/
capacity analysis is required by PENNDOT, a complete copy of such report as is
filed with PennDOT shall also be filed with the Borough. The future demand
analysis shall be performed using the peak hour(s) for all streets and major
intersections in the study area. The Borough Engineer may also require this
analysis to be conducted for the peak hour(s) of the development. Volume/
capacity calculations shall be completed for all movements at major
intersections. Levels of service for all streets and intersections shall be
listed.
      F.   Conclusions and recommended improvements.
         (1)   For existing intersections in the study area, the study shall
determine specific improvements which would provide a level of service and
delay no worse than conditions without the subject development in the
completion year.
         (2)   For new intersections that are established to serve as access to
the proposed development, any through movements on any impacted roadway within
the study area showing a Level of Service D or better shall be considered
acceptable. All other movements at intersections on any road within the study
area shall be considered acceptable. Specific recommendations for improving
unacceptable intersections and movements shall be listed.
         (3)   Improvements listed may include street and intersection design
and improvements, traffic signal installation and operation, traffic signal
timing, and other improvements.
         (4)   For unsignalized intersections where the traffic impact of the
development causes the side street approach to degrade to a level of service F,
the intersection shall be evaluated for a signal warrant.
         (5)   Actions to facilitate use of public transportation and improve
service shall be included.
         (6)   The listing of recommended improvements for both streets and
transit shall include, for each improvement, the party responsible for the
improvement, a preliminary cost estimate and funding of the improvement, the
phase of development during which the improvement must be completed, and the
estimated annual maintenance cost. Any roadway improvement which requires
increased right-of-way shall be identified.
         (7)   The Borough Council shall review the traffic impact study or
have its own consulting Traffic Engineer review the impact study at the
applicant’s expense, to analyze its adequacy in solving any traffic problems
that will occur due to the subdivision or land development.
         (8)   The Borough Council may decide that certain improvements
contained in the study are required for preliminary plan approval and may
attach such improvements as conditions to the plan approval.
         (9)   For projects on state roads, upon the submission of the
preliminary access plans or highway occupancy permit to PENNDOT, the applicant
shall submit a copy of such plans along with attached subdivision or land
development plans to the Borough. Approval of a site access plan by PENNDOT
does not guarantee final approval of the subdivision or land development by the
Borough.
   5.   Preparation, Review and Escrow of Costs.
      A.   The preparer of the traffic impact study shall be a professional
engineer with experience in preparation of traffic impact studies. At the time
of filing preliminary or final plans for subdivision and/or land development,
for which a traffic impact study is required, the applicant shall pay a
separate filing fee to be established by resolution by Borough Council.
      B.   Upon receipt of such study, the Borough Engineer shall, as part of
the initial review of the study, calculate an estimated cost of study review,
and include such estimate in the first review letter. The applicant shall be
required to pay into escrow a sum equal to the estimated cost of study review
before any further action may be taken by the Borough Engineer in review of the
study. Failure to pay such sum into escrow in timely fashion shall result in
disapproval of the study, and any fees due for work associated with the first
review letter shall remain due and payable.
      C.   Such estimate shall include the reasonable and necessary charges
incurred by the Borough for review of the study by the appropriate professional
consultants, including the Borough Engineer. Such charges shall be reasonable
and in accordance with the ordinary and customary charges to the Borough for
such services, and may not be based on hourly rates in excess of those charged
by the Borough Engineer in his or her staff as set forth in the retainer
agreement between the Borough and the Borough Engineer, for services for which
reimbursement from applicants is not sought.
      D.   The Borough shall deduct from the escrow each month the current and/
or outstanding charges for study review by the Borough Engineer and staff,
shall send a statement each month to the developer setting forth the amount of
such deduction and the services for which such deductions were made. Any
dispute over the amount of such review fees shall be resolved according to
procedures set forth in 53 P.S. Section 10503 (1), or its successor.
      E.   If, after completion of a portion of the study review, the Borough
Engineer determines that the cost of review is likely to exceed the original
escrow amount, then the Borough Engineer shall calculate such amount, and shall
notify the applicant directly in writing, and the applicant shall, within 7
days of receipt of the Borough Engineer’s letter, supplement the escrow in the
additional amount determined by the Borough Engineer. Failure of the applicant
to do so shall result in the disapproval of the study. If, after review of the
study is completed, any funds remain in the plan review escrow, such funds
shall be returned to the applicant only if the study is disapproved. If the
study is approved, such funds shall be credited to the Municipal Engineer
Review Fee escrow described in Part 3 of the Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance.
(Ord. 614, 5/11/2015)
§ 22-702.   Parks and Open Space.
   1.   Dedication. All plans for residential subdivision of land or
residential land developments shall provide for the dedication of land for park
and open space uses, and/or, upon agreement by the applicant, the construction
of recreation facilities, the payment of fees in lieu thereof, the private
reservation of land, or any combination thereof. All dedications of land for
park and open space purposes shall be consistent with standards contained
within the officially adopted park and recreation plan or parks and recreation
chapter of the Borough’s comprehensive plan, if such chapter meets the intent
and criteria of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, and is
officially adopted by the Borough.
   2.   General Requirements. When the Borough has an officially adopted park
and recreation plan or qualifying comprehensive plan, applicants shall
designate areas of residential subdivisions or residential Land Developments
for parks, playgrounds, or other public open space and recreational uses in
accordance with the provisions of such plans. The applicant shall make an
irrevocable offer of dedication for such land to the Municipality, as required
by the Borough. Title to such land shall be good and marketable, free of liens
or other defects, and acceptable to the Borough Solicitor. The Borough may,
upon agreement of the applicant, authorize the transfer of the land to a
homeowner’s association or to a non-profit corporation whose purpose is the
conservation or preservation of land.
   3.   Amount of Land to be Dedicated.
      A.   The amount of park and open space land to be dedicated shall be
equal to a minimum of 2,500 square feet per dwelling unit and in conformance
with Marysville Borough Comprehensive Plan.
      B.   If the applicable plan specifically designates a future park site
within the acreage of the tract proposed for development, all subdivision plans
shall be designed in conformance with such designation in that all land
required to be dedicated shall correspond to the location of the future park
site.
   4.   Fee in Lieu of Dedication. The applicant may, with the consent and
approval of the Borough, elect to pay a fee to the Borough in lieu of the park
and open space dedication and so note on the plans.
      A.   The amount of any fee to be paid in lieu of dedication of land shall
be equal to the average fair market value (FMV) of the land (based on the
unimproved land value) otherwise required by this section or shall be in
accordance with any existing, municipally adopted flat fee-in-lieu schedule
which establishes a fixed price per lot, unit, or acre. If no formula is
provided in any other Borough planning documents, the formula to be used in
computing the fee based upon fair market value shall be: N x (average FMV of
one acre) = fee.
Where: N = the number of acres required to be dedicated for park and open space
purposed, calculated in accordance with Section 702.3.A., and FMV = fair market
value based on the unimproved land value.
      B.   The applicant shall provide the Borough with all information
necessary to determine the fair market value (FMV) of the land, including, but
not limited to, the following:
         (1)   If the applicant is the equitable owner, or purchased the land
in fee simple less than 2 years prior to the preliminary or final plan
submission, a copy of the agreement of sale or real estate transfer tax
affidavit of value.
         (2)   If the applicant is the equitable owner, or purchased the land
in fee simple more than 2 years prior to the preliminary or final plan
submission, an opinion of value of the property by a state certified appraiser
acceptable to the Borough. Any applicant aggrieved by the fee established shall
have the right to secure a second opinion of value of the property by a state
certified appraiser acceptable to the Borough. The 2 estimated values shall be
averaged, with the result being the amount upon which the fee will be based.
      C.   Such fee shall be payable to the Borough prior to the recording of
each final phase of the plan and shall be in an amount equal to the percentage
of the total number of dwelling units in the phase.
   5.   Park and Recreation Fund. All fees paid by the developer in lieu of
dedication of park and open space land shall be paid to the Borough and upon
its receipt shall be deposited in a separate interest-bearing account. Fees
deposited to this account shall be used only for the purpose of providing,
acquiring, operating or maintaining park or recreational facilities and shall
be administered as required by the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
   6.   General Design Criteria.
      A.   The type of areas to be dedicated for park and open space land
within a subdivision or land development plan shall principally involve
neighborhood parks which are defined as “those parks providing primarily active
outdoor recreational opportunities located within ½ mile radius from a majority
of the residences to be served thereby”. Exceptions to this will be when
dedications are made to an existing community park which serves the subdivision
and is located within the Borough.
      B.   The land set aside for park and open space uses shall meet the
following design criteria:
         (1)   The park and recreational facilities shall be reasonably
accessible to the development.
         (2)   The park and open space land shall be accessible from a street
either directly or by pedestrian connection or shall adjoin and become a part
of an already existing public park or open space area that is accessible from a
street. Where access to the park is by public road, the width of the frontage
shall be a minimum length deemed necessary by the Borough for access,
visibility of the site, and public safety.
         (3)   No more than 25% of the park and open space land shall contain
detention basins or other storm water management facilities, or be located
within a floodplain or wetland unless such area is part of a linear trail or
green way along an existing watercourse. In all cases, land containing
detention basin or other storm water management facilities, floodplains, or
wetlands, must be suitable for public recreation use without compromising the
function of these areas.
         (4)   The park and open space land shall be compact and contiguous
unless the land is located adjacent to and combined with existing park and open
space land, or specific topographic features require a different configuration.
An example of such topographic features would be the provision of linear public
open space along a scenic creek.
         (5)   When public park and open space land exists adjacent to the
tract to be subdivided or developed, the park and open space land shall be
located to adjoin and enlarge the presently existing park and open space land.
         (6)   The park and open space land shall be accessible to utilities
such as sewer, water, and power that are provided within the subdivision, and
if so, the developer shall extend such utilities to the park and open space
land.
         (7)   If the developer is planning to construct facilities for
recreation on the dedicated property as an amenity for the development, such
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with current standards
established by the national recreation and park association. Where applicable,
facilities constructed shall also comply with the accessibility guidelines of
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Playground equipment constructed
or placed on parkland shall be in compliance with guidelines from the Consumer
Products Safety Commission.
   7.   Existing Trails. When a subdivision or land development is traversed by
or abuts an existing public trail, customarily used by pedestrians and/or
equestrians, the applicant shall make provision for the continued recreational
use of the trail, subject to alterations of the course of the trail within the
boundaries of the development under the following conditions:
      A.   The points at which the trail enters and exits the tract shall
remain unchanged.
      B.   The propose alteration exhibits quality trail design according to
the generally accepted principals of landscape architecture.
      C.   The proposed alteration does not run coincidentally with the paved
road intended for use by motorized vehicles. The land set aside for the
continuation of such existing trail shall be counted towards the amount of park
and open space land.
   8.   Trails and Linear Parks. The trail or linear park shall conform to any
applicable Borough park and open space plan, any county-wide trail and
recreation plan, and Marysville Borough Comprehensive Plan, Perry County
Comprehensive Plan and Perry County Greenways Plan. The Borough may require, as
a condition of final plan approval, the dedication and improvement of trails
and linear parks, which may be credited toward the park and open space land
requirement. Trails and linear parks developed and dedicated for public use may
be credited toward the park and open space land requirement.
   9.   Additional Recreation Reservations. The provisions of this section are
minimum standards and shall not be construed as prohibiting a developer, with
the approval of the Borough, from dedicating or reserving other land for
recreation purposes in addition to the requirements of this Chapter.
(Ord. 614, 5/11/2015)

STORMWATER FACILITIES AND BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMP)
MAINTENANCE AND MONITORING AGREEMENT
THIS AGREEMENT, made and entered into this                      day of
                  , 20          , by and between
                                                         , (hereinafter the
“Owner”), and Marysville Borough, Perry
County; Pennsylvania, (hereinafter “Municipality”);
WITNESSETH
   WHEREAS, the Owner is the owner of certain real property identified as
(address)                                                                  ,
Tax Parcel Number
                                                                                       
(hereinafter “Property”).
   WHEREAS, the Owner is proposing to make improvements to the Property; and
   WHEREAS, the Drainage Plan (hereinafter “Plan”) for the Property which is
expressly made a part hereof, as approved or to be approved by the
Municipality, provides for detention, retention, infiltration and/or treatment
of stormwater within the confines of the Property; and
   WHEREAS, the Municipality and the Owner, successors, heirs and assigns agree
that the health, safety, and welfare of the public require that on-site
stormwater management facilities and BMPs be constructed and maintained on the
Property: and
   WHEREAS, the Municipality requires, through the implementation of its
Stormwater Management Ordinance, that stormwater management facilities and BMPs
as shown on the Plan be constructed and adequately maintained by the Owner,
successors, heirs and assigns.
   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing promises, the mutual
covenants contained herein, and the following terms and conditions, the parties
hereto agree as follows:
The on-site stormwater management facilities and BMPs shall be constructed by
the Owner, successors, heirs and assigns, in accordance with the terms,
conditions, details and specifications identified in the Plan.
The Owner, successors, heirs and assigns, shall maintain the stormwater
management facilities and
BMPs in good working condition, acceptable to the Municipality so that they are
performing their design functions
The Owner, successors, heirs and assigns, hereby grant permission to the
Municipality, its authorized agents and employees, upon presentation of proper
identification, to enter upon the Property at reasonable times, and to inspect
the stormwater management facilities and BMPs whenever the Municipality deems
necessary. The purpose of the inspection is to assure safe and proper
functioning of the facilities. The inspection shall cover the entire
facilities, berms, outlet structures, pond areas, access roads, etc. When
inspections are conducted, the Municipality shall give the Owner, successors,
heirs and assigns, copies of the inspection report with findings and
evaluations. At a minimum, maintenance inspections shall be performed in
accordance with the schedule specified in the BMP Operation and Maintenance
Plan.
All reasonable costs for said inspections shall be borne by the Owner,
successors, heirs and assigns, and payable to the Municipality.
The owner shall convey to the Municipality easements and/or rights-of-way to
assure access for periodic inspections by the municipality and maintenance, if
required.
In the event the Owner, successors, heirs and assigns, fail to maintain the
stormwater management facilities and BMPs in good working condition acceptable
to the Municipality, the Municipality shall give proper notice to Owner setting
forth the specifics of such failure to maintain, the remediation required, and
deadline to complete such action. After failure by the Owner to remedy within
the specified time limit, the Municipality may enter upon the Property and take
such necessary and prudent action to maintain said stormwater management
facilities and BMPs and to charge the costs of the maintenance and/or repairs
to the Owner, successors, heirs and assigns. This provision shall not be
construed as to allow the Municipality to erect any structure of a permanent
nature on the land of the Owner, outside of any easement rights that the
Municipality may have. It is expressly understood and agreed that the
Municipality is under no obligation to maintain or repair said facilities, and
in no event shall this Agreement be construed to impose any such obligation on
the Municipality.
The Owner, successors, heirs and assigns, will perform operation, maintenance
and inspections in accordance with the BMP Operations and Maintenance Plan for
the stormwater management facilities and BMPs including sediment removal as
outlined on the approved Drainage Plan.
In the event the Municipality, pursuant to this Agreement, performs work of any
nature, or expends any funds in performance of said work for labor, use of
equipment, supplies, materials, and the like on account of the Owner’s,
successors’, heirs’ or assigns’ failure to perform such work, the Owner,
successors, heirs and assigns, shall reimburse the Municipality upon demand,
within 30 days of receipt of invoice thereof, for all costs incurred by the
Municipality hereunder. If not paid within said 30-day period, the Municipality
may enter a lien against the property, including any and all properties when
the Owner is a Homeowners Association, in the amount of such costs, or may
proceed to recover his costs through proceedings in equity or at law as
authorized by law.
The Owner, successors, heirs and assigns, shall indemnify the Municipality and
its agents and employees against any and all damages, accidents, casualties,
occurrences or claims which might arise or be asserted against the Municipality
for the construction, presence, existence or maintenance of the stormwater
management facilities and BMPs by the Owner, successors, heirs and assigns.
In the event a claim is asserted against the Municipality, its agents or
employees, the Municipality shall
promptly notify the Owner, successors, heirs or assigns, and they shall defend,
at their own expense, any suit based on such claim. If any judgment or claims
against the Municipality, its agents or employees shall be allowed, the Owner,
successors, heirs and assigns shall pay all costs and expenses in connection
therewith.
In the event of an emergency or the occurrence of special or unusual
circumstances or situations, the Municipality may enter the Property, if the
Owner is not immediately available, without notification or identification, to
inspect and perform necessary maintenance and repairs, if needed, when the
health, safety or welfare of the citizens is at jeopardy. However, the
Municipality shall notify the Owner of any inspection, maintenance, or repair
undertaken within five days of the activity. The Owner shall reimburse the
Municipality for its costs.
It is agreed between the two entities known as Owner that they shall be bound
jointly and severally by the terms, covenants and agreements herein.

§ 23-402.   Construction.
   1.   Casing.
      A.   All wells serving as a water supply shall be equipped with a
watertight and durable wrought iron, steel, or other type of approved well
casing having a minimum thickness of 0.1875 inches or PVC plastic casing having
a minimum thickness of 0.175 inches. The sections of casing shall be joined
together by threaded couplings or joints, by welding, or by any other
watertight approved joint or coupling. The casing shall be carried to a minimum
depth of 20 feet and (then) extended an additional 5 feet into firm bedrock or
other impervious strata, firmly seated in competent formation with a drive shoe
and grouted in place. Well casing material other than wrought iron or steel
must be resistant to the corrosiveness of the water and to the stresses to
which it will be subjected during installation, and the grouting operation.
Casing and grouting materials must be compatible. The criteria established in
AWWA Standard Al 00-84 must be followed. Casings shall terminate a minimum of 1
foot above the surrounding, finished surface grade and shall not be cut
shorter. All casings for water supply or geothermal return wells shall be
fitted with a water-tight or sanitary seal well cap.
      B.   Ferrous casings shall be new pipe meeting ASTM or API specifications
for water well construction, have additional thickness and weight if minimum
thickness is not considered sufficient to assure reasonable life expectancy of
the well, be capable of withstanding forces to which it is subjected, and have
full circumference welds or threaded pipe joints.
      C.   Non-ferrous casings shall meet appropriate ANSI/ASTM or NSF
Standards for well casing applications as outlined in A WW A Standard Al 00-84.
Non-ferrous casing materials shall not impart any taste, odor, or toxic
substances to the well water. Non-ferrous casing, if used, shall not be driven.
The casing shall be placed a minimum of 5 feet into the consolidated formation
with a niinimum annular opening of 3 inches or larger so that the grout may be
placed in accordance with the provisions of §
23-402.2.
      D.   Whenever maintenance such as pump, drop pipe, foot valve, or
electrical wiring repair or replacement is done to an existing well where the
casing terminates at or below the surrounding surface grade, the casing shall
be extended so that it meets the requirement of §
23-402.1.A, in that the casing shall extend to a minimum of 1 foot above the
surrounding finished surface grade. This shall apply to all casings that
currently terminate in well pits. These casings shall be extended above the
surrounding ground surface and the pit shall be eliminated.
      E.   Casings of existing wells that terminate below the surrounding
finished grade may be extended by: welding steel extensions to existing casings
where practicable; glued PVC coupling joints; or any other method specifically
approved by this Borough.
      F.   In all cases where a casing is extended, a pitless adapter and a
sanitary seal well cap must be installed.
   2.   Grout Materials and Placement.
      A.   All grout information (type of cement or bentonite and number of
bags of cement or bentonite used for grouting) must be submitted in writing on
well construction form (Form 23-2) to the Borough by the well driller within 30
days of completion of the well drilling process.
      B.   In all well installations an annular space shall be provided between
the well casing and the earth formation. The annular space shall be completely
filled with approved grout materials, in one continuous operation, under
pressure from the bottom to the natural land surface, within 24 hours after
completion of the drilling. In the event that grouting is done following the
completion of all drilling operations, care must be taken to prevent the
entrance of driller’s mud into the annulus during the completion of the
borehole by the use of a rubber packer or other acceptable method. The annular
space shall be completely cleared of all obstructions prior to the placement of
the grout material. Exterior grouting methods must be used in this instance.
The casing shall be sealed effectively against entrance of water from water
bearing zones that are subject to pollution, through which the casing may pass,
by grouting a minimum of 10 feet above and 10 feet below the polluted or
undesirable water-bearing zone. During the installation of the pitless adapter,
grout material may be removed from the exterior of the casing in order to
provide a watertight seal between the casing and the pitless adapter.
      C.   After the grout has been placed in the annular space, drilling of
the borehole may proceed for a maximum of 4 hours, and if not completed within
that time period, a curing time of 36 hours must be provided before drilling
can resume. A curing time of 12 hours for Type III Portland cement must be
provided immediately following the placement of the grout. Drilling is not
permitted during the curing period. If casings of smaller diameter are used in
the lower portions of the well, effective watertight seals shall be provided
between the casings where they telescope for a minimum distance of 4 feet.
      D.   The annular space of all well installations must be filled with one
of the following listed grout materials.
         (1)   Neat cement grout shall consist of a mixture of API Class G (or
Class B similar to ASTM CI50 Type II) and water in the ratio of 0.67 cu. ft. of
water per 94 lb. sack weighing approximately 228 lbs/cu ft3. A maximum of 6% by
weight bentonite and 2% by weight of calcium chloride may be added.
         (2)   Pozmix-cement grout shall consist of a mixture of 50% by volume
of Pozzolan A (74 lbs./cu. ft3) and 50% by volume of API Spec. 10, Class G
cement with 0.77 cu. ft. of water per 84 lbs. of mixture. To this mixture may
be added a maximum of 2% by weight, bentonite and a maximum of 2% by weight of
calcium chloride, at the discretion of the contractor.
         (3)   Concrete grout shall contain 5.3 sacks of portland cement (ASTM
C150 Type II) per cubic yard of concrete and a maximum of 7 gal. of water per
94 lb. sack of cement. The maximum slump shall be 4 in. the aggregate shall
consist of 47% sand and 53% coarse aggregate, conforming to ASTM Designation C-
33. The maximum size aggregate should be 0.75 in. Concrete grout shall not be
placed in an annulus of less than 3 in.
         (4)   Sand cement grout shall consist of a mixture of portland cement
(ASTM CI 50 Type II), sand and water in the proportion of not more than two
parts by weight of sand to one part of cement with not more than 6 gal. of
water per 94 lb. sack of cement.
         (5)   Bentonite grout shall be a pure bentonite with at least 20%
solids by weight when mixed with water. Hydration of the bentonite must be
delayed until the bentonite mix has been placed down the well. This can be done
by using additives with the dry bentonite or in water; mixing calcium bentonite
with sodium bentonite; or by using granular bentonite, which has less surface
area.
      E.   In all well installations if rapid loss of grout material occurs
during placement, coarse fill material (e.g. sand, gravel, crushed stone, dry
cement) may be used in the zone or zones in which the rapid loss is occurring.
The remainder of the annular space shall be grouted as provided below. In no
case shall pouring, dumping or shoveling of grout material into the annular
space be deemed an approved method of grout placement.
   3.   Grout Placement.
      A.   Grout Pipe Outside Casing.
         (1)   The minimum annular space of VA inches around the entire outside
of the casing shall be provided by drilling a borehole 3 inches larger than the
outside diameter of the casing to be inserted. All grout shall be placed by
pumping through the grout pipe. The entire interval to be grouted shall be open
and without obstructions. Washing or jetting with water is recommended for
cleaning the borehole and may serve to remove obstructions caused by caving
which otherwise would prevent a proper grout. It is recommended that the grout
pipe extend from the surface to the bottom of the interval to be grouted. The
grout pipe may remain extended to the bottom of the interval during and after
grouting, or it may be raised slowly as the grout is placed provided that the
discharge end of the grout pipe remains submerged in the emplaced grout at all
times until grouting is completed. In the event of interruption in the grouting
operations, the bottom of the grout pipe shall be raised above the grout level
and should not be re-submerged until the air and water have been displaced from
the grout pipe.
         (2)   Grouting Depths Greater than 30 feet. The minimum length of
grout pipe that shall be inserted into the annular space is 30 feet.
         (3)   Grouting Depths of 30 feet and less. Grout may be placed by a
tremie pipe inserted only a short distance (approximately 5 feet) into the
annular space provided that the entire interval to be grouted is clearly
visible from the surface and is dry. An annular space larger than the minimum
1½ inches may be required to assure visibility from the surface.
      B.   Grout Pipe Inside Casing. The bottom of the casing is fitted with a
packer arrangement, also referred to as a cementing shoe or float shoe, and the
casing is placed in the borehole a short distance off the bottom. The float
shoe allows grout to be pumped through the grout pipe and upward into the
annular space, while preventing grout leakage into the casing during grouting
and after removal of the grout pipe. Grouting is continued until cement appears
at the surface at which time the grout pipe is disconnected from the float
shoe. The float shoe is drilled out after the grout sets and hardens
sufficiently.
      C.   Interior Method Two Plug. The first plug separates the grout from
the fluid in the casing, and the other separates the grout from water pumped in
above it. First, the casing is placed a short distance off the bottom. After
pumping water through the casing to circulate fluid in the annular space and
clear any obstructions from the hole, the first plug is inserted, and the
casing is capped. A measured volume of grout is pumped in, which is sufficient
to fill the annular space. The casing then is opened, and the second plug
inserted. A measured volume of water is pumped in above the second plug until
it is pushed to the bottom of the casing and most of the grout is expelled up
and into the annular space. The water in the casing is held under pressure to
prevent the backflow of grout until it has set and hardened.
      D.   Interior Method Upper Plug. The casing is placed a short distance
off the bottom, and the water is pumped into the casing to circulate fluid
through the annular space to clear any obstructions from the hole. A measured
quantity of grout slightly greater than that needed to fill the annular space
is pumped into the capped casing. Because this grout is in direct contact with
the drilling fluid, there will be a narrow zone of weak grout between the
drilling fluid and good grout; however, this zone should remain inside the
casing and not be forced into the annular space. The casing is opened, and a
drillable plug is inserted. A measured volume of water is pumped in above the
plug until it is pushed to the bottom of the casing and most of the grout is
expelled up and into the annular space. The water in the casing is held under
pressure until the grout sets and hardens.
      E.   Interior Method Capped Casing. The casing is placed a short distance
off the bottom, and water is pumped into the casing to circulate fluid in the
annular space and clear any obstructions from the hole. The grout pipe passes
through an airtight cap at the top of the casing and is positioned 3 to 4 feet
above the bottom of the casing. The grout pipe is assembled so that it can be
pulled through the cap a distance of about 20 feet after the injection of grout
is completed. A bleeder valve is provided to release air from inside the casing
as it is filled with water. The first step is to fill the casing and annular
space with water. With the upper end of the casing closed, grouting is started
by forcing the cement through the grout pipe upward into the annular space.
Grouting is continued until the cement overflows around the casing at ground
surface. Just enough water is pumped to clear the cement from the grout pipe,
and the grout pipe is lifted free of the grout. Both the casing and grout pipe
shall be kept tightly closed under pressure until the cement sets and hardens.
      F.   Grout Displacement Method. The hole is filled with the estimated
volume of grout required to fill the annular space, and the casing is lowered
into the hole. The bottom of the casing is closed in a tight, drillable plug.
Guides often are used to keep the casing centered in the hole. As the casing is
lowered, the grout is forced upward around it to fill the annular space. If the
pipe does not sink to the bottom under its own weight, it is filled with water.
      G.   Unconsolidated Formations. When drilling through an unconsolidated
formation, a steel drive shoe shall be required. Grouting shall be done in
accordance with the following:
         (1)   If caving conditions are experienced on wells deeper than 30
feet, the annular space shall be grouted from the point where caving occurred
or from a depth of 30 feet, whichever is greater, to land surface.
         (2)   If the annular space cannot be grouted in accordance with this
Chapter, the well shall be decommissioned and sealed in accordance with Part 7
of this Chapter.
      H.   Other grouting methods and materials may be used subject to prior
written approval of the Borough.
   4.   Packers. Packers, when used, shall be of materials that will not impart
taste, odor, toxic substances or bacterial contamination to the well water.
   5.   Well screens. Well screens, when used, shall:
      A.   Provide the maximum amount of open area while still maintaining
structural strength;
      B.   Have the size of openings in the screen based on a sieve analysis of
the material contained in the surrounding geological formation or gravel pack;
      C.   Be constructed of materials resistant to damage by chemical action
of groundwater or cleaning operations;
      D.   Have sufficient diameter to provide adequate specific capacity and
low aperture velocity. Usually, the entrance velocity should not exceed 0.1
feet per second;
      E.   Be installed so that the pumping water level remains above the
screen under all operating conditions;
      F.   Be designed and installed to permit removal or replacement without
adversely affecting water-tight construction of the well; and
      G.   Be provided with a bottom plate or washdown bottom fitting of the
same material as the screen.
   6.   Gravel packs. Gravel packs when used:
      A.   Shall be well rounded particles, 95% siliceous material, that are
smooth and uniform, free of foreign material, properly sized, washed and
disinfected immediately prior to or during placement;
      B.   Shall be placed in one uniform continuous operation;
      C.   Gravel refill pipes, when used, shall be Schedule 40 steel pipe
incorporated within the pump foundation and terminated with screwed or welded
caps at least 12 inches above the pump house floor or concrete apron;
      D.   Gravel refill pipes located in the grouted annular opening shall be
surrounded by a minimum of 1½ inches of grout; and
      E.   Protection from leakage of grout into the gravel pack or screen
shall be provided.
   7.   Pit Installations. Pit installations for new well construction will
only be allowed when specifically approved by the Borough. Pit installations
are where the casing terminates in an open space, constructed below the ground
surface. If the installation of a well pit is permitted it shall comply with
the following requirements:
      A.   Well pits shall be maintained free of water at all times.
      B.   The floor of the pit shall be a watertight reinforced concrete
platform at least 4 inches thick poured around the casing and shall be provided
with a watertight seal. The floor of the pit shall extend at least 2 feet from
the center of the casing in all directions. In all cases, the pit shall be
sized to allow adequate working space. The casing shall extend above the floor
for at least 12 inches. An insect resistant well cap shall be installed. The
surface of the floor shall be pitched toward a drain that has a minimum
diameter of 4 inches and discharged by gravity to the surface of the ground in
an area not subject to flooding or to a basement that is effectively protected
against flooding.
      C.   Drain openings shall be effectively screened to prevent the entrance
of insects and rodents. The drain shall not be connected to any sewer or other
drain.
      D.   The pit shall have watertight reinforced concrete walls 4 inches
thick or equivalent, which provide for an effective watertight seal against the
floor. The top of the pit shall be a watertight reinforced monolithic concrete
slab at least 4 inches thick, which shall be sealed with the wall so as to
effectively prevent the entrance of water.
      E.   The top of the pit shall not be more than 6 inches below the ground
surface. A durable watertight manhole shall be installed in the top of the pit
centered over the casing and effectively sealed with the top to prevent the
entrance of water. This manhole shall be at least 24 inches in diameter. It
shall extend at least 3 inches above the surrounding ground surface and be
covered by an impervious durable cover of concrete, steel, or equivalent
material that overlaps the manhole vertically by at least 2 inches. The manhole
cover shall be effectively secured to the manhole by bolting, locking or
equivalent means, and shall be kept secured.
      F.   Pit installations shall not be used in areas subject to flooding by
ground or surface water or where the groundwater level rises to within 1 foot
of the bottom of the proposed pit. When pipes enter the pit, the annular space
between the pipes and the wall shall be effectively sealed by a watertight
permanent seal.
   8.   Pitless Installations. Pitless installations are those installations
where the casing terminates above the ground or surrounding finished grade
surface.
      A.   Where pitless installations are used, they shall be of a design that
provides an effective seal against the entrance of ground or surface water into
the well, access casing, and into the piping leading to the pump. All buried
suction lines shall be effectively encased, or otherwise protected to prevent
external damage or contamination. Pitless installations must be so designed as
to be structurally sound and to provide for ready removal of drop piping
without excavation. Pitless adapters shall be installed at a minimum depth of
30 inches so that it will be safely below the frost line, but no deeper than 48
inches. The access casing shall be effectively protected against corrosion and
shall extend at least 12 inches above the natural ground or surrounding
finished grade surface. The ground level or surrounding finished grade surface
at this point shall be elevated above the adjacent ground level and graded to
drain away in all directions. The top of the access shall be effectively sealed
against the entrance of water, insects, and rodents. An insect resistant cap
shall be installed. The pitless adapter shall not be submerged in water or used
in areas used by automobiles and other vehicles.
      B.   Where surface installations (i.e., pump rooms, etc.) are used, a
watertight reinforced concrete platform at least 4 inches thick and extending
for at least 2 feet in all directions from the center of the casing shall be
poured around the casing to provide an effective watertight seal with the
casing, or shall be made watertight with an effective permanent seal. The
surface of the platform shall slope to the edges. The casing shall extend above
the slab at least 12 inches and shall be effectively sealed against the
entrance of contamination. An insect resistant well cap shall be installed
where appropriate. All pumping equipment shall be protected against freezing.
If a pump room is proposed, it shall be so sized to allow adequate working
space.
   9.   Venting. Where venting is required, an overlapping cover or pipe with
the opening facing downward shall be required. Such venting shall be
effectively protected against the entrance of insects and rodents. An insect
resistant well cap shall be installed. In no case shall openings be less than
12 inches from the ground, or, in the case of pit installations, the floor.
   10.   Private Water Supply System Standard.
      A.   A private water supply system shall produce at least 480 gallons of
water in a 2-hour period (4 gpm), at least once each day for each separate
residence, facility or use. Greater yields maybe required depending on the
intended use.
      B.   If the sustained yield of the private well or water system is not
capable of meeting the total private water supply system standard, sufficient
storage shall be required. Borehole capacity and/or a storage tank shall
provide storage capacity.
   11.   Minimum Yield for Private Wells.
      A.   All potable water supply wells intended to serve as a private water
supply shall be approved for yield in accordance with this section. Replacement
wells servicing existing improved properties may be exempt from this
requirement at the discretion of the Borough Engineer.
      B.   The criteria for approval shall be a minimum well yield of 1 gallon
per minute.
      C.   For wells with yields of 2 gallons per minute or less, a minimum of
400 gallons of storage capacity shall be provided. Borehole storage shall be
measured from the pump level to the top of the static water column. Wells with
yields between 2 and 4 gallons per minute shall provide the storage capacity
required to meet the individual water supply standard described in §
23-402.10.
      D.   The minimum well yield requirements set forth in this section are
deemed sufficient to supply an adequate quantity of water for normal indoor
household or equivalent usage. A supplemental source of water may be needed to
support outdoor or other non-consumptive uses.

§ 24-202.   Definitions.
The following words and phrases, when used in this Part shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in this Section, except where the context indicated or
requires a different meaning

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 26-101.   Short Title.
This Chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Marysville Borough
Stormwater Management Ordinance of 2022.”
(Ord. 643, 10/10/2022)
§ 26-102.   Statement of Findings.
The governing body of the Municipality finds that:
   A.   Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases runoff volumes, flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying
capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public
facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines flood plain management
and flood control efforts in downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, threatens public health and safety, and increases nonpoint source
pollution of water resources.
   B.   A comprehensive program of stormwater management (SWM), including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff,
is fundamental to the public health, safety, and welfare and the protection of
people of the Commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
   C.   Stormwater is an important water resource that provides groundwater
recharge for water supplies and supports the base flow of streams.
   D.   The use of green infrastructure and low impact development (LID) are
intended to address the root cause of water quality impairment by using systems
and practices which use or mimic natural processes to: 1) infiltrate and
recharge, 2) evapotranspire, and/or 3) harvest and use precipitation near where
it falls to earth. Green infrastructure practices and LID contribute to the
restoration or maintenance of pre-development hydrology.
   E.   Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are required
to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer
systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
program.
(Ord. 643, 10/10/2022)
§ 26-103.   Purpose.
The purpose of this Chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
the Municipality and its watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing the
benefits described in §
26-102, through provisions designed to:
   A.   Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim, and restore the
existing and designated uses of the waters of this Commonwealth.
   B.   Preserve natural drainage systems.
   C.   Manage stormwater runoff close to the source, reduce runoff volumes and
mimic predevelopment hydrology.
   D.   Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater planning
and management.
   E.   Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and
groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources.
   F.   Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
   G.   Provide proper operation and maintenance of all stormwater best
management practices (BMPs) that are implemented within the Municipality.
   H.   Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.
(Ord. 643, 10/10/2022)
§ 26-104.   Statutory Authority.
The Municipality is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect
runoff by the authority of the Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, The
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, and/or the Act of
October 4, 1978, P.L. 864 (Act 167), 32 P.S. §§680.1, et seq., as amended, The
Stormwater Management Act.
(Ord. 643, 10/10/2022)
§ 26-105.   Applicability.
All regulated activities and all activities that may affect stormwater runoff,
including land development and earth disturbance activity, are subject to
regulation by this Chapter.
(Ord. 643, 10/10/2022)
§ 26-106.   Repealer.
Any other ordinance provision(s) or regulation of the Municipality inconsistent
with any of the provisions of this Chapter is hereby repealed to the extent of
the inconsistency only.
(Ord. 643, 10/10/2022)
§ 26-107.   Severability.
In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction declares any section or
provision of this Chapter invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity
of any of the remaining provisions of this Chapter.
(Ord. 643, 10/10/2022)
§ 26-108.   Compatibility with Other Requirements.
Approvals issued and actions taken under this Chapter do not relieve the
applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for
activities regulated by any other code, law, regulation or Chapter.
(Ord. 643, 10/10/2022)
§ 26-109.   Erroneous Permit.
Any permit or authorization issued or approved based on false, misleading or
erroneous information provided by an applicant is void without the necessity of
any proceedings for revocation. Any work undertaken or use established pursuant
to such permit or other authorization is unlawful. No action may be taken by a
board, agency or employee of the Municipality purporting to validate such a
violation.
(Ord. 643, 10/10/2022)
§ 26-110.   Waivers.
   1.   If the Municipality determines that any requirement under this Chapter
cannot be achieved for a particular regulated activity, the Municipality may,
after an evaluation of alternatives, approve measures other than those in this
Chapter, subject to §
26-110, subsections 2. and 3.
   2.   Waivers or modifications of the requirements of this Chapter may be
approved by the Municipality if enforcement will exact undue hardship because
of peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question, provided that the
modifications will not be contrary to the public interest and that the purpose
of the Chapter is preserved. Cost or financial burden shall not be considered a
hardship. Modification may be considered if an alternative standard or approach
will provide equal or better achievement of the purpose of the Chapter. A
request for modifications shall be in writing and accompany the stormwater
management site plan submission. The request shall provide the facts on which
the request is based, the provision(s) of the Chapter involved and the proposed
modification.
   3.   No waiver or modification of any regulated stormwater activity
involving earth disturbance greater than or equal to one acre may be granted by
the Municipality unless that action is approved in advance by the Department of
Environmental Protection (DEP) or the delegated county conservation district.
(Ord. 643, 10/10/2022)
PART 2
DEFINITIONS
§ 26-201.   Definitions.
   1.   For the purposes of this Chapter, certain terms and words used herein
shall be interpreted as follows:
      A.   Words used in the present tense include the future tense; the
singular number includes the plural, and the plural number includes the
singular; words of masculine gender include feminine gender; and words of
feminine gender include masculine gender.
      B.   The word “includes” or “including” shall not limit the term to the
specific example but is intended to extend its meaning to all other instances
of like kind and character.
      C.   The words “shall” and “must” are mandatory; the words “may” and
“should” are permissive.
   2.   These definitions do not necessarily reflect the definitions contained
in pertinent regulations or statutes, and are intended for this Chapter only.
      AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY – activities associated with agriculture such as
agricultural cultivation, agricultural operation, and animal heavy use areas.
This includes the work of producing crops including tillage, land clearing,
plowing, disking, harrowing, planting, harvesting crops or pasturing and
raising of livestock and installation of conservation measures. Construction of
new buildings or impervious area is not considered an agricultural activity.
      APPLICANT – a landowner, developer, or other person who has filed an
application to the Municipality for approval to engage in any regulated
activity at a project site in the Municipality.
      BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE (BMP) – activities, facilities, designs,
measures, or procedures used to manage stormwater impacts from regulated
activities, to meet state water quality requirements, to promote groundwater
recharge, and to otherwise meet the purposes of this Chapter. Stormwater BMPs
are commonly grouped into one of two broad categories or measures: “structural”
or “non-structural.” In this Chapter, non-structural BMPs or measures refer to
operational and/or behavior-related practices that attempt to minimize the
contact of pollutants with stormwater runoff, whereas structural BMPs or
measures are those that consist of a physical device or practice that is
installed to capture and treat stormwater runoff. Structural BMPs include, but
are not limited to, a wide variety of practices and devices, from large-scale
retention ponds and constructed wetlands, to small-scale underground treatment
systems, infiltration facilities, filter strips, low impact design,
bioretention, wet ponds, permeable paving, grassed swales, riparian or forested
buffers, sand filters, detention basins, and manufactured devices. Structural
stormwater BMPs are permanent appurtenances to the project site.
      CONSERVATION DISTRICT – a conservation district, as defined in Section 3
(c) of the Conservation District Law (3 P. S. §851(c)) that has the authority
under a delegation agreement executed with DEP to administer and enforce all or
a portion of the regulations promulgated under 25 Pa. Code 102.
      DEP – the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.
      DESIGN STORM – the magnitude and temporal distribution of precipitation
from a storm event measured in probability of occurrence (e.g., a 5-year storm)
and duration (e.g., 24 hours) used in the design and evaluation of stormwater
management systems. Also see RETURN PERIOD.
      DETENTION VOLUME – the volume of runoff that is captured and released
into the waters of the Commonwealth at a controlled rate.
      DEVELOPMENT SITE (SITE) – see PROJECT SITE.
      DISTURBED AREA – an unstabilized land area where an earth disturbance
activity is occurring or has occurred.
      EARTH DISTURBANCE ACTIVITY – a construction or other human activity which
disturbs the surface of the land, including, but not limited to: clearing and
grubbing; grading; excavations; embankments; road maintenance; building
construction; and the moving, depositing, stockpiling, or storing of soil,
rock, or earth materials.
      EROSION – the natural process by which the surface of the land is worn
away by water, wind, or chemical action.
      EXISTING CONDITION – the dominant land cover during the 5-year period
immediately preceding a proposed regulated activity.
      FEMA – Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      FLOODPLAIN – any land area susceptible to inundation by water from any
natural source or delineated by applicable FEMA maps and studies as being a
special flood hazard area. Also includes areas that comprise Group 13 Soils, as
listed in Appendix A of the Pennsylvania DEP Technical Manual for Sewage
Enforcement Officers (as amended or replaced from time to time by DEP).
      FLOODWAY – the channel of the watercourse and those portions of the
adjoining floodplains that are reasonably required to carry and discharge the
100-year flood. Unless otherwise specified, the boundary of the floodway is as
indicated on maps and flood insurance studies provided by FEMA. In an area
where no FEMA maps or studies have defined the boundary of the 100-year
floodway, it is assumed—absent evidence to the contrary—that the floodway
extends from the stream to 50 feet from the top of the bank of the stream.
      FOREST MANAGEMENT/TIMBER OPERATIONS – planning and activities necessary
for the management of forestland. These include conducting a timber inventory,
preparation of forest management plans, silvicultural treatment, cutting
budgets, logging road design and construction, timber harvesting, site
preparation, and reforestation.
      GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE – systems and practices that use or mimic natural
processes to infiltrate, evapotranspire, or reuse stormwater on the site where
it is generated.
      HYDROLOGIC SOIL GROUP (HSG) – infiltration rates of soils vary widely and
are affected by subsurface permeability as well as surface intake rates. Soils
are classified into four HSGs (A, B, C, and D) according to their minimum
infiltration rate, which is obtained for bare soil after prolonged wetting. The
NRCS defines the four groups and provides a list of most of the soils in the
United States and their group classification. The soils in the area of the
development site may be identified from a soil survey report that can be
obtained from local NRCS offices or conservation district offices. Soils become
less pervious as the HSG varies from A to D (NRCS1,2).

way and provide for diffused flow at the property line.
   2.   Agricultural activity is exempt from the SWM site plan preparation
requirements of this Chapter provided the activities are performed according to
the requirements of 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102.
   3.   Forest management and timber operations are exempt from the SWM site
plan preparation requirements of this Chapter provided the activities are
performed according to the requirements of 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102.
   4.   Exemptions from any provisions of this Chapter shall not relieve the
applicant from the requirements in §
26-301.4. through §
26-301.12.
   5.   The Municipality may deny or revoke any exemption pursuant to this
Section at any time for any project that the Municipality believes may pose a
threat to public health and safety or the environment.
(Ord. 643, 10/10/2022)
§ 26-303.   Volume Controls.
The green infrastructure and low impact development practices provided in the
BMP Manual4 shall be utilized for all regulated activities wherever possible.
Water volume controls shall be implemented using the Design Storm Method in
Subsection A. or the Simplified Method in Subsection B. below. For regulated
activity areas equal or less than one acre that do not require hydrologic
routing to design the stormwater facilities, this Chapter establishes no
preference for either methodology; therefore, the applicant may select either
methodology on the basis of economic considerations, the intrinsic limitations
on applicability of the analytical procedures associated with each methodology
and other factors.
   A.   The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual4) is applicable to any
size of regulated activity. This method requires detailed modeling based on
site conditions.
      (1)   Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the 2-year 24-hour duration precipitation.
      (2)   For modeling purposes:
         (a)   Existing (predevelopment) non-forested pervious areas must be
considered meadow in good condition.
         (b)   Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present, shall
be considered meadow in good condition in the model for existing conditions.
   B.   The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual4) provided below is
independent of site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm Method is
not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated activities greater
than one acre or for projects that require design of stormwater storage
facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
      (1)   Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first 2 inches of
runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
      (2)   At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious surfaces
shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it shall not be
released into the surface waters of this Commonwealth. Removal options include
reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration.
      (3)   Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed runoff; however, in
all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the permanently removed runoff should
be infiltrated.
      (4)   This method is exempt from the requirements of §
26-304, Rate Controls.
(Ord. 643, 10/10/2022)
§ 26-304.   Rate Controls.
   1.   For areas not covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
stormwater management plan: Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed
the pre-development discharge rates for the 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-
year, 24-hour storm events. If it is shown that the peak rates of discharge
indicated by the post-development analysis are less than or equal to the peak
rates of discharge indicated by the predevelopment analysis for 1-, 2-, 5-,
10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year, 24-hour storms, then the requirements of this
section have been met. Otherwise, the applicant shall provide additional
controls as necessary to satisfy the peak rate of discharge requirement.
   2.   For areas covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
stormwater management plan: For the 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year,
24-hour storm events, the post-development peak discharge rates will follow the
applicable approved release rate maps. For any areas not shown on the release
rate maps, the post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the pre-
development discharge rates.
(Ord. 643, 10/10/2022)
§ 26-305.   Riparian Buffers.
   1.   In order to protect and improve water quality, a riparian buffer
easement shall be created and recorded as part of any subdivision or land
development that encompasses a riparian buffer.
   2.   Except as required by Chapter 102, the riparian buffer easement shall
be measured to be the greater of the limit of the 100-year floodplain or a
minimum of 35 feet from the top of the streambank (on each side).
   3.   Minimum Management Requirements for Riparian Buffers.
      A.   Existing native vegetation shall be protected and maintained within
the riparian buffer easement.
      B.   Whenever practicable invasive vegetation shall be actively removed,
and the riparian buffer easement shall be planted with native trees, shrubs and
other vegetation to create a diverse native plant community appropriate to the
intended ecological context of the site.
   4.   The riparian buffer easement shall be enforceable by the Municipality
and shall be recorded in the appropriate County Recorder of Deeds Office, so
that it shall run with the land and shall limit the use of the property located
therein. The easement shall allow for the continued private ownership and shall
count toward the minimum lot area a required by Zoning, unless otherwise
specified in the municipal Zoning Ordinance.
   5.   Any permitted use within the riparian buffer easement shall be
conducted in a manner that will maintain the extent of the existing 100-year
floodplain, improve or maintain the stream stability, and preserve and protect
the ecological function of the floodplain.
   6.   The following conditions shall apply when public and/or private
recreation trails are permitted within riparian buffers:
      A.   Trails shall be for non-motorized use only.
      B.   Trails shall be designed to have the least impact on native plant
species and other sensitive environmental features.
   7.   Septic drainfields and sewage disposal systems shall not be permitted
within the riparian buffer easement and shall comply with setback requirements
established under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 73.
(Ord. 643, 10/10/2022)
§ 26-306.   Stormwater Design Requirements.
   1.   Collection and Conveyance Facilities.

facilities that service drainage areas within the site shall be based upon the
peak flow from a 25- year storm frequency event.
      B.   All developments shall include design provisions that allow for the
overland conveyance of the post-development 100-year peak flows through the
site without damage to any private or public property.
      C.   Method of Calculations. Runoff calculations for on-site stormwater
conveyance facilities shall be based upon the Rational Method or an acceptable
engineering design method, subject to Borough approval.
      D.   Criteria, Methodology and Assumptions. Appropriate values for runoff
coefficients, time of concentration, and rainfall intensity shall be from the
latest edition of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of
Transportation Design Manual, Part 2, Highway Design, Chapter 10. Use of other
criteria, methodology, assumptions, references, calculation methods and/or
computer modeling may be accepted, provided detailed design information and
programming with references are submitted and approved by the Borough.
   2.   Stormwater Basins.
      A.   The peak discharges and volumes of runoff may be determined by using
the latest version of Technical Release No. 55, Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds, or an acceptable engineering method, subject to Borough approval.
      B.   Retention basins and detention basins shall be designed with a
minimum one-foot freeboard above the design elevation of the 100-year water
surface at the emergency spillway. Additionally, basins shall be designed to
safely discharge the full 100-year peak discharge of a post-development storm
event through an emergency spillway in a manner which will not damage the
integrity of the basin. Basins shall not be located over any existing or
proposed utility line. Infiltration facilities with a depth of 18 inches or
less shall not be subject to this requirement.
      C.   Stormwater basins located in known sinkhole-prone areas are required
to be lined to prevent infiltration into the ground, unless intended to be
infiltration facilities.
      D.   Basins shall be constructed and maintained to ensure the design
capacity after sedimentation has taken place.
      E.   Basin discharge outlets shall be designed to release runoff in a
condition which reflects pre-development characteristics.
      F.   Basins which are not designed to release all stormwater shall be
specifically identified as retention basins or permanent pond basins. All
surface basins shall have provisions for de-watering, particularly the bottom,
and shall not create swampy and/or unmaintainable conditions.
      G.   Discharge structures shall be designed to eliminate the possibility
of blockage during operation.
      H.   Basins which are located in or adjacent to a residential zone and
viewed by the Borough as a potential hazard to the public safety shall be
completely surrounded by a fence or wall of not less than four feet in height.
      I.   Earth Fill Dams. Basins which are designed with earth fill dams
shall be designed by a registered professional engineer with experience in
earth-filled dams and shall incorporate the following minimum standards:
         (1)   The maximum water depth (measured from the base to the crest of
the emergency spillway) shall not exceed six feet, unless approved by waiver of
the Borough.
         (2)   The minimum top width of all dams shall be five feet, unless
approved by waiver of the Borough.
         (3)   The side slopes of earth fill dams shall not be steeper than
three horizontal to one vertical on both sides of the embankment.
         (4)   Basins without restricted access shall have impoundment areas
with side slopes no greater than five horizontal to one vertical.
         (5)   A cutoff trench of impervious material shall be provided under
all dams.
         (6)   All pipes and culverts through dams shall be reinforced concrete
or HDPE and have properly spaced concrete cutoff collars.
         (7)   All outlet structures shall be reinforced concrete.
         (8)   Minimum floor elevations for all structures that would be
affected by a basin, other temporary impoundments, or open conveyance systems
where ponding may occur shall be two feet above the 100-year water surface
elevation and/or one foot above the 500-year water surface elevation. If
basement or underground facilities are proposed, detailed calculations
addressing the effects of stormwater ponding on the structure and water-
proofing and/or flood-proofing design information shall be submitted for
approval.
      J.   The Borough may, upon recommendation of the Borough Engineer, impose
additional requirements on earth fill dams for the safety and welfare of the
Borough.
   3.   Pipe and Swale Design.
      A.   The capacity of gutters, inlets, culverts, outlet structures and
swales shall consider all possible hydraulic conditions. The following are
minimum design standards.
         (1)   Grass swales and roadside gutters shall consider both the
channel velocity and stability.
         (2)   The “n” factors to be used for paved or rip-rap swales or
gutters shall be based on the latest edition of the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation Design Manual, Part 2, Highway Design, Chapter 10.
         (3)   The “n” factors for corrugated metal pipe shall be based upon
the manufacturer's standard.
         (4)   The velocity to be used in the design of any piped stormwater
conveyance system shall be a minimum of two and one-half feet per second.
         (5)   Inlets, culverts, and basin discharge systems shall be designed
for the worst case condition. Inlet capacity shall be based on design standards
provided by the latest edition of the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation's Design Manual, Part 2, Highway Design, Chapter 10. If
acceptable information is not available, inlets in non-ponding areas shall be
designed for a maximum capacity of five cubic feet per second. Where ponding
occurs, inlet capacity shall be based on accepted engineering design practices.
Culvert design shall consider either inlet/outlet control or a combination of
hydraulic losses through the system, whichever is greater. Basin discharge
systems shall be designed to the same standards as culverts. If it cannot be
readily determined which hydraulic condition controls, the basin discharge rate
shall be based on the highest possible discharge rating curve, with the basin
capacity sized to store the excessive storm runoff, based on the lowest
possible discharge rating curve.
      B.   Stormwater Flow Along Streets and Access Drives. Inlets shall be
along the curb line and are not permitted along the curb radius at an
intersection. When possible, inlets shall be located away from the side lot
property line to avoid conflicts with driveways. For the purpose of inlet
placement, curb, gutter, or roadside swale, flow depths for a ten- year storm
frequency with a five minute duration shall not exceed three inches in a swale
condition, two inches in a gutter condition, and one-half inch across
intersections and travel lanes. In no case shall inlets be spaced more than 600
feet apart and function at less than 65% efficiency based on the criteria in
the PennDOT Design Manual.
      C.   Manhole Locations. Manholes shall not be spaced more than 500 feet
apart. Additionally, manholes shall be placed at points of changes in the
horizontal or vertical direction of storm sewers. Inlets may be substituted for
manholes where they will serve a useful purpose.
      D.   Alignment Requirement. If less than a 48-inch diameter, curves in
pipes or box culverts without an inlet or manhole are prohibited. T-joints,
elbows, and wyes are always prohibited on piping 12 inches or greater.
      E.   Minimum Pipe Size. Stormwater management pipe collection and
conveyance systems shall have a minimum diameter of 15 inches.
      F.   Material Specifications. All materials and installations must be
approved for use by the Borough Engineer and comply with the Borough
Specification Manual.
      G.   Surface Flow Characteristics.
         (1)   The maximum swale, gutter, or curb velocity of stormwater runoff
shall be maintained at levels which result in a stable condition both during
and after construction. The following are considered characteristics of a
stable condition:
            (a)   It neither aggrades nor degrades beyond tolerable limits.
            (b)   The channel banks do not erode to the extent that the channel
cross section is changed appreciably.
            (c)   Sediment bars do not develop.
            (d)   Erosion does not occur around culverts and bridges or
elsewhere.
            (e)   Gullies do not form or enlarge due to the entry of
uncontrolled stormwater runoff.
            (f)   Grass-lined channels shall be considered stable if the
calculated velocity does not exceed the allowable velocities shown below:
               1)   Three feet per second where only sparse vegetation can be
established and maintained because of shade or soil condition.
               2)   Four feet per second where normal growing conditions exist
and vegetation is to be established by seeding.
               3)   Five feet per second where a dense, vigorous sod can be
quickly established or where water can be temporarily diverted during
establishment of vegetation. Netting and mulch or other equivalent methods for
establishing vegetation shall be used.
               4)   Six feet per second where there exists a well-established
sod of good quality.
         (2)   Where swale bends occur, the allowable velocities listed above
shall be divided by the following factors:
 
Degree of Bend Velocity
0 to 30        1.50
30 to 60       1.75
60 to 90       2.00
90 and over    2.50
 
         (3)   The above grass-lined channel flows may be exceeded if the
designer can provide acceptable supportive design criteria as proof of erosion
prevention.
      H.   Where the velocity of stormwater runoff exceeds the allowable
velocity, erosion protection must be provided. The method of erosion protection
proposed must be supported by the appropriate design information and/or
references.
      I.   Sump pump discharges and roof drains will be directed to lawn areas
away from residences, into areas that will surface drain to conveyance
structures (e.g., swales and storm sewer collection systems).
   4.   Erosion and Sedimentation.
      A.   All land disturbance facilities shall conform to the requirements of
the Perry County Conservation District and the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection, and with the following provisions.
      B.   A Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection “NPDES
Construction Activities” permit in compliance with 25 Pa. Code Chapter 92 is
required for any earth disturbance of one acre regardless of the planned runoff
(hereinafter collectively referred to as “Regulated Earth Disturbance
Activities”). This includes earth disturbance on any portion of, part of, or
during any stage of, a larger common plan of development.
      C.   Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate DEP regional office or County Conservation
District must be provided to the Borough. The issuance of an NPDES construction
permit (or permit coverage under the statewide General Permit (PAG-2))
satisfies the requirements of this Section.
      D.   A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan and any required
permit, as required by DEP regulations, shall be always available at the
project site.
      E.   The following principles shall be applied to the design plan and
construction schedule to minimize soil erosion and sedimentation: a) Stripping
of vegetation, grading, or other soil disturbance shall be done in a manner
which will minimize soil erosion. b) Whenever feasible, natural vegetation
shall be retained and protected. c) The extent of the disturbed area and the
duration of its exposure shall be kept to a minimum, within practical limits.
d) Either temporary seeding, mulching, or other suitable stabilization measures
shall be used to protect exposed critical areas during construction. e)
Drainage provisions shall accommodate the stormwater runoff both during and
after construction. f) Soil erosion and sedimentation facilities shall be
installed prior to any on-site grading. g) The design plan and construction
schedule shall incorporate measures to minimize soil erosion and sedimentation.
h) Retention and/or detention basins and water carrying facilities shall be
stabilized in accordance with current engineering and soil conservation service
practices.
      F.   Floodplain. All stormwater management plans shall conform with the
floodplain standards specified in latest ordinance as amended.
      G.   Easements. When considered appropriate, easements shall be provided
where stormwater or surface water drainage facilities are existing or proposed,
whether located within or beyond the boundaries of the property. Easements for
maintenance of pipes and culverts shall run from outlet to inlet. Normal lot
grading will not require easements. Swales which receive runoff from more than
one other lot must be provided with an easement. Easements shall have a minimum
width of 20 feet and shall be adequately designed to provide area for (a) the
collection and discharge of water; (b) the maintenance, repair, and
reconstruction of the drainage facilities; and (c) the passage of machinery for
such work. When considered appropriate, easements shall include a description
of an ownership and maintenance program, in a recordable form, that clearly
sets forth responsibility for all temporary and permanent stormwater management
facilities.
   5.   Ownership and Maintenance of Stormwater Management Facilities.
      A.   The intent of these regulations is to provide private ownership and
maintenance of stormwater management facilities, erosion and sedimentation
control facilities and floodplain control facilities. Under no circumstances
does the Borough intend to accept dedication of erosion control and
sedimentation basins. The Borough does not encourage the dedication of
stormwater management facilities that are located outside public street rights-
of-way. Where the stormwater management plan proposes that the Borough own or
maintain a stormwater management facility, a description of the methods,
procedures, and the extent of maintenance shall be described in such an offer.
      B.   Maintenance of all stormwater management facilities during
development shall be the sole responsibility of the developer and shall
include, but not be limited to:
         (1)   Removal of silt from all basins, traps or other structures or
measures when 30% of capacity is filled with silt;
         (2)   Periodic maintenance of temporary control facilities as
described in the soil erosion and sedimentation control plan such as
replacement of silt fencing, straw filters or similar measures;
         (3)   Establishment or re-establishment of vegetation by seeding and
mulching or sodding of scoured areas or areas where vegetation has not
successfully been established;
         (4)   Installation of necessary controls to correct unforeseen
problems caused by storm events within designed frequencies;
         (5)   Removal of all temporary measures and installation of permanent
measures upon completion of the project; and
         (6)   Requirements of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection, Chapter 102 Regulations.
      C.   Ownership of all stormwater management facilities after construction
shall be the sole responsibility of the developer or the private landowner as
set forth in the plan. The only stormwater management facilities which are to
be controlled by the Borough shall be those facilities which have been offered
for dedication and accepted for dedication by the Borough. Future offers for
dedication can only be made for facilities which meet current Borough
specifications.

NOTICE TO PROPERTY OWNERS
(Executed Document to Accompany Permit Submission)
Pursuant to the Marysville Borough Stormwater Management Ordinance, a property
owner that makes application for a Stormwater Management Permit is responsible
for certain aspects of the installation, operation and long-term maintenance of
proposed stormwater Best Management Practices (BMP’s). This notice is intended
to outline the most common Owner’s responsibilities, and how failure to comply
may result in a delay in the project schedule, the denial for the request of a
Certificate of Occupancy, or a requirement for the posting of financial
security prior to the release of a Certificate of Occupancy.
THE PROPERTY OWNER IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE TO INSURE THEIR OBLIGATIONS ARE
MET, EVEN IF AN ENGINEER AND/OR CONTRACTOR ARE ENGAGED TO DESIGN AND PERFORM
THE WORK. IN THE EVENT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS ARE NECESSARY, THE BOROUGH WILL
PURSUE THE PROPERTY OWNER AND NOT THE CONTRACTOR. CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT
LANGUAGE TO MINIMIZE THE OWNER’S RISK IS RECOMMENDED.
Owner(s) shall initial each section below:
______ The Owner shall ensure one (1) acre of disturbed area is not exceeded at
any one time. In the event this disturbed area exceeds one (1) acre, an
additional NPDES permit will be required. NPDES permits typically cost several
thousand dollars to prepare and implement and take three (3) months or more to
obtain, potentially delaying the Owner’s ability to occupy the house.
______ The Borough does not typically require financial security (cash, letter
of credit or bond equal to the cost of the proposed stormwater BMP’s, typically
several thousand dollars) be posted at the time a permit is issued, subject to
the permitted BMP’s being installed, inspected and functional PRIOR to a
request for a Certificate of Occupancy. The Owner should be actively involved
in understanding the Contractor’s schedule and sequence of construction so that
there is no delay in permission to occupy the house. For example, if
construction is scheduled to be complete in November after the growing season
is over, the Borough will require financial security be posted if the BMP’s are
not installed and stabilized (grass growing) at the time a Certificate of
Occupancy is requested.
______ The preparing engineer will be required to certify that construction of
the stormwater BMP’s are installed per the approved plan. This certification of
construction is required to be submitted PRIOR to a request for a Certificate
of Occupancy, or the Borough will require that financial security be posted.

activities.
   4.   Any earth disturbance activities which exceed one (1) acre in area will
require the Owner to obtain a NPDES Permit issued by the Perry County
Conservation District. A certificate of occupancy and/or performance guarantee
will be held until a NPDES permit is obtained, improvements installed and the
permit terminated.
The Stormwater Management Plan shall include the following Owner’s
Certification, which shall be executed by the Owner(s) prior to final plan
approval:

cannot be altered or removed without prior approval by Marysville Borough. I
further acknowledge that any earth disturbance in excess of one (1) acre will
require an NPDES permit issued by the Perry County Conservation District at our
own expense and may result in delays to the project. In the event that
Performance and Maintenance Guarantees have not been posted, the posting of
such guarantees will be required a condition of issuance of the Certificate of
Occupancy for the proposed construction.
**Schedule of Required Inspections
The following schedule of inspections will be required at a minimum:
   1.   Pre-construction, after erosion control measures & temporary protection
fencing installed.
   2.   After infiltration facility excavation is complete to subgrade, with

determine limiting zones within the footprint of the proposed infiltration BMP
in accordance with the PA PCSM BMP Manual – Appendix C. Testing may be deferred
to be performed during construction at proposed subgrade elevations subject to
the posting of financial security PRIOR to permit approval.
****Construction Schedule and Financial Security
   Schedule of installation shall address proposed completion and stabilization
of lawn areas during accepted planting seasons. Construction sequence shall
address the timing of construction of infiltrations facilities as it relates to
the sequence of construction. Infiltration facilities shall be installed after
bulk grading is complete and contributing drainage areas are graded and
established. Performance and Maintenance Guarantees will be required in the

in general. Recognizing that the Borough desires to promote quality development
and a pleasing community character that will stimulate business and attract
people, this Part provides appropriate sign standards and regulations for the
following purposes:

roads and highways in the Borough.
      B.   To reduce distractions and obstructions from signs which would
adversely affect traffic safety, and to alleviate hazards caused by signs
projecting over or encroaching upon public ways.
      C.   To discourage excessive visual competition in signage and ensure
that signs aid orientation and adequately identify uses and activities to the
public.
      D.   To preserve or enhance the Borough’s character by requiring new and
replacement signage which is:
         (1)   Creative and distinctive.
         (2)   Compatible with the surroundings.
         (3)   Appropriate to the type of activity to which it pertains.
         (4)   Expressive of the identity of individual proprietors or of the

(Ord. 462, 8/14/1995; as amended by Ord. 551, 4/12/2004)
§ 27-602.   Administration.
   1.   Permit; Application Procedure.
      A.   No sign, with the exception of those outlined in §
27-603(1) and signs installed by the direction of municipal, State, Federal or
other governmental agency, shall be erected, placed, installed, altered,
relocated or replaced until a permit has been applied for and issued.
Applications shall be on forms provided by the Borough and shall be made to the
Zoning Officer. An application for an off-premises sign shall be accompanied by
written consent of the owner or lessee of the property upon which the sign is
to be erected or placed. Permit requirements apply to temporary signs.
      B.   Plans and specifications shall be submitted with the application
showing the location, dimensions, message, materials, illumination, letter
sizes colors, location of sign in relationship to the building and details of
construction including load stresses and anchorage. Plans shall be drawn to
scale and be sufficiently clear, comprehensive, detailed and legible so that
together with any accompanying specifications and information, determination
can be made as to whether or not the proposed sign will comply with the
requirements of these regulations and with the installation requirements of the
Building Code of the Borough.
      C.   Any sign permit issued shall be valid only while such sign and
support structure is maintained in a safe, sound and nonhazardous condition.
      D.   If necessary, a conforming sign may be removed and reinstalled for
normal maintenance activities without requiring the submission of an
application.
      E.   Temporary signs located within the right-of-way will be removed and
disposed of by the Borough.
   2.   Measurement of Sign Area. The area of a sign shall be computed in the
following manner:
      A.   The measurement of sign area shall mean the entire area within a
single perimeter enclosed by one continuous line, connecting the extreme wedges
or points of a sign, together with any material of color forming an integral
part of the display or used to differentiate such sign from the background
against which it is placed.
      B.   When two sides of a double-faced sign are located not more than 28
inches apart at the widest point and not more than 18 inches apart at the
narrowest point, and display identical writing or representation, only one of
the sides shall be used to determine the surface area. Any additional sides of
a multi-faced sign shall be considered as a separate sign for purposes of
computing the total surface area of the sign.
      C.   Sign area shall not include the main supporting sign structure in
determining sign area.
   3.   Measurement of Height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the
distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest
attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower
of (A) existing grade prior to construction of (B) the newly established grade
after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding or excavating
solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade
cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the
assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is
equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or
the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on
the lot whichever is lower.
   4.   Measurement of Setback Requirements. The setback requirement shall be
measured from the outermost edge of the sign to the existing right of way line.
   5.   Signs Within Intersection Sight Triangles.
      A.   No signs may obstruct the line of sight in accordance with the
Borough of Marysville Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance [
Chapter 22].
      B.   To ensure clear line of sight, signs that may be located in the
intersection sight triangle shall be at a height under 3½ feet or over 12 feet
provided all other ordinance requirements have been met.
   6.   Line of Sight.
      A.   No signs may obstruct the line of site requirements as defined in
Borough of Marysville Code of Ordinances.
      B.   To insure clear line of sight, signs that may be located in the
intersection or private exit way in which nothing is erected, placed, planted
or allowed to grow in such a manner as to limit or obstruct the sight distance
of motorists entering or leaving the intersection.

PART 7
NON-CONFORMITIES
§ 27-701.   Purpose.
   1.   Within the districts established by the zoning ordinance adopted on
February 1, 1971, or amendments that may be later adopted, there exist lots,
buildings, structures and uses which were lawful before the ordinance was
passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under
the terms of this Part or later amendment.
   2.   The legitimate interests of those who lawfully established these
nonconformities are recognized in Part 7 by permitting such uses to continue
subject to regulations for and limitations upon their restoration,
reconstruction or extension. It is recognized however, that nonconformities
substantially and adversely affect the development, maintenance, use and
taxable value of other properties in the district that are subject to the
regulations of this Part. In order to secure eventual compliance with the
standards of this Part, it is therefore necessary to regulate nonconformities
and to prevent their reestablishment once they have been discontinued. It is
further the intent of this Part that nonconformities not be used as grounds for
adding other buildings or structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same
district.
   3.   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Part shall affect the plans,
construction or designed use of any building or structure on which actual
construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date or amendment to
this Part. Actual building construction means the placing and fastening of
construction materials in a permanent manner. In the case where a demolition or
removal of an existing building or structure has been substantially begun
preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be
actual construction if a building permit has not been obtained, provided that
work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the building or
structure is accomplished and a certificate of occupancy is issued.
(Ord. 588, 12/13/2010)
§ 27-702.   Continuation of Nonconformity.
The Zoning Officer shall be responsible for the proper registration of premises
occupied by a lawful nonconforming use, lot, building or structure existing
after the effective date of this Part and issuance of a certificate of
nonconformance, which shall be for the purpose of ensuring to the owner the
right to continue such nonconformity in accordance with the provisions of Part
7. It is the property owner’s responsibility to provide a completed application
for a certificate of nonconformance, evidence that the nonconformity was
existing prior to February 1, 1971 to present and documentation of the
existence of the nonconformity prior to February 1, 1971 to present to the
Zoning Officer to assist in the identification and registration of
nonconforming uses, lots, buildings or structures they are accountable for. A
certificate of nonconformance shall be required when a nonconforming use,
structure or building is proposed or changed to another nonconforming use,
expanded or repaired prior to the issuance of a building or zoning permit.
(Ord. 588, 12/13/2010)
§ 27-703.   Nonconforming Lots of Record.
In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding
limitations imposed by other provisions of this Part, a single-family dwelling
and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at
the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Chapter passed February 1,
1971. This provision shall apply even though such lots fail to meet the
requirements for area, width or street frontage requirements, which are
generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and other
requirements not involving area, width or street frontage, of the lot shall
conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Any
variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only through application to and
authorized by the Zoning Hearing Board.
(Ord. 588, 12/13/2010)
§ 27-704.   Nonconforming Uses.
   1.   Where, at the effective date of adoption of amendment of this Chapter,
passed February 1, 1971, a lawful use of land, building or structures exists
that is made no longer permissible under the terms of this Chapter, such use
may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
following provisions:
      A.   Restoration. When nonconforming use status applies to the land, the
removal of the use shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land and any
further use of land shall conform to the applicable zoning requirements of that
district. “Removal,” for the purpose of this subsection, is defined as the
removal by any means to any extent of more than 50% of the replacement cost at
the time of removal.
      B.   Extension. A nonconforming use of a building may be extended to any
portion of the building that was designed or arranged for such use at the time
of adoption or amendment of this Chapter.
      C.   Reconstruction. In the event that a building or structure containing
a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed by any means to any extent, it may
be reconstructed; provided that such reconstruction does not occupy an area
greater than the structure that was damaged or destroyed, and provided that the
reconstruction starts within 18 months. If the structure is reconstructed in
strict compliance with the foregoing, the nonconforming use as set forth in the
certificate of nonconformance may be resumed.
      D.   Repairs and maintenance. On any building or structure devoted in
whole or in part to a nonconforming use, work may be done as ordinary repairs,
or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing.

activities as, but not limited to, baseball, basketball, soccer, tennis, track,
football and miniature golf are specifically permitted by the Borough for
operation during hours of darkness, the following requirements shall apply:
      A.   Lighting shall be accomplished through the use of fixtures
conforming to IESNA full-cutoff criteria. The Borough may consider the use of
other than full-cutoff fixtures only when it can be demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the Borough that acceptable control of glare and light trespass
can be achieved, taking into account the proximity of the facility to adjacent
properties that could be adversely impacted. Such a proposal shall be
accompanied by a visual impact plan as described in
Chapter 22, “Subdivision and Land Development,” Part 6, §22- 602(8)(F)(6).
      B.   Sporting events shall be timed to end at such time that all lighting

      A.   All lighting shall be aimed, located, designed, fitted and
maintained so as not to present a hazard to drivers or pedestrians by impairing
their ability to safely traverse and so as not to create a nuisance by
projecting or reflecting objectionable light onto a neighboring use or
property.
      B.   Floodlights and spotlights, where their use is specifically approved
by the Borough, shall be so shielded, installed and aimed that they do not
project their output into the windows of neighboring residences, adjacent uses,
past the object being illuminated, skyward or onto a public roadway or
pedestrian way.
      C.   Parking facility and vehicular and pedestrian way lighting (except
for safety and security applications and all-night business operations), for
commercial, industrial, recreational and institutional uses shall be
automatically extinguished no later than one hour after the close of business

premises for a commercial establishment may remain illuminated while the
establishment is actually open for business, and until 1 hour after closing.
      E.   Vegetation screens shall not be employed to serve as the primary
means for controlling glare. Rather, glare control shall be achieved primarily
through the use of such means as cutoff fixtures, shields and baffles, and
appropriate application of fixture mounting height, wattage, aiming angle and
fixture placement.
      F.   The illumination projected from any property to a residential use
shall at no time exceed 0.1 footcandle, measured line-of-sight from any point
on the receiving property.

at no time shall exceed 1.0 footcandle, measured line-of-sight from any point
on the receiving property.
      H.   Externally illuminated billboards and signs shall be lighted by
fixtures mounted at the top of the billboard or sign and aimed downward. The
fixtures shall be designed, shielded and aimed to limit the light output onto
and not beyond the sign or billboard.
      I.   Except for certain recreational lighting, fixtures meeting IESNA
full-cutoff criteria shall not be mounted in excess of 20 feet above finished
grade. Fixtures not meeting IESNA full-cutoff criteria shall not be mounted in
excess of 16 feet above finished grade. For recreational lighting maximum
mounting height requirements, subsection (6)(E) above.
      J.   The United States and the State flag shall be permitted to be
illuminated from dusk till dawn. All other flags shall not be illuminated past
11 p.m. Flag lighting sources shall not exceed 10,000 lumens per flagpole. The
light source shall have a beam spread no greater than necessary to illuminate
the flag.
      K.   Under-canopy lighting, for such applications as gas/service
stations, hotel/theater marquees, fast-food/bank/drugstore drive-ups, shall be
accomplished using flat- lens full-cutoff fixtures aimed straight down and
shielded in such a manner that the lowest opaque edge of the fixture shall be
below the light source at all lateral angles. The average illumination
intensity in the area directly below the canopy shall not exceed 20 maintained
footcandles and the maximum intensity shall not exceed 40 maintained
footcandles.
      L.   The use of white strobe lighting for tall structures such as
smokestacks, chimneys and radio / communications / television towers is
prohibited during hours of darkness, except as specifically required by FAA.
      M.   Glare or Heat. Any operation producing intense glare or heat shall
be conducted within an enclosed building or with other effective screening in
such a manner as to make such glare or heat completely imperceptible from any
point along the property line. No heat from any use shall be sensed at any
property line to the extent of raising the ambient temperature of air or
materials more than 5ºF. Any operation or activity that produces glare shall be
conducted so that direct or indirect light from the source shall not cause
illumination in excess of 0.5 footcandles measured at the property line.
   8.   Nonconforming Lighting. Any lighting fixture or lighting installation
existing on the effective date of this Section that does not conform with the
requirements of this Section, shall be considered as a lawful nonconformance. A
nonconforming lighting fixture or lighting installation shall be made to
conform with the requirements of this Section when:
      A.   Minor corrective action, such as re-aiming or shielding can achieve
conformity with the applicable requirements of this Section.
      B.   It is deemed by the Borough to create a safety hazard.
      C.   It is replaced by another fixture or fixtures, abandoned, relocated
or repaired (except for routine maintenance).
      D.   There is a change in use of the property.
      E.   All lighting not in compliance with this Section 10 years hence,
shall immediately be brought into compliance.
   9.   Measurement.
      A.   Lighting levels shall be measured in footcandles. Measurement shall
be taken with a direct reading portable light meter or light reading equipment
recommended by the Borough Engineer.
      B.   Method. Readings shall be taken by qualified personnel so that the
light reading meter has been exposed long enough to provide a constant reading.
Measurements shall be made after dark with the light sources in question on,
then with the same sources off. The difference between the two readings shall
be compared to the maximum permitted illumination at the property lien at
ground level. This procedure eliminates the effects of moonlight and other
ambient light.
   10.   Flickering or flashing of lights shall be prohibited.
   11.   Light sources or luminaries shall not be located within required
buffer yard areas except for pedestrian walkways.

violating the Part to have believed that there was no such violation, in which
event there shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until the 5th
day following the date of the determination of a violation by the district
justice and thereafter each day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate violation. All judgments, costs and reasonable attorneys fees
collected for the violation of this Chapter shall be paid over to the Borough
of Marysville.

zoning map, but only for those provisions which specifically relate to the
landowner's curative amendment and challenge.
   3.   The Borough Council, if it determines that a vahdity challenge has
merit, may accept a landowner's curative amendment, with or without revision,
or may adopt an alternative amendment which will cure the challenged defects.

housing units of a type actually available to and affordable by classes of
persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by the challenged provisions of this

or,
            (c)   Reference to this entire Chapter which requires revisions.

Chapter to correct the declared invalidity.
   2.   Within 180 days from the date of the declaration and proposal, the
Borough shall enact a curative amendment to validate or reaffirm the vahdity of
this Chapter pursuant to the provisions of §609 of the Pennsylvania
Municipahties Planning Code, in order to cure the declared invalidity of this
Chapter.

above, the Borough Council shall not be required to entertain or consider any
landowner's curative amendment hied under §609.1 of the Municipahties Planning
Code, nor shaU the Zoning Hearing Board be required to give a report requested
under §§909.1 or 916.1 of the Municipahties Planning Code subsequent to the
declaration and proposal based upon grounds identical or substantially similar
to those specified by the resolution required by subsection (1)(A), above. Upon
completion of the procedures set forth in subsections (1) and (2), above, no
rights to a cure pursuant to the provisions of §§609.1 and 916.1 of the
Municipalities Planning Code, shall, from the date of the declaration and
proposal, accrue to any landowner on the basis of the substantive invahdity of
this Chapter for which there has been a curative amendment pursuant to this
Section.
   4.   The Borough, having utilized the procedures set forth in this Section,
may not again utilize said procedure for a period of 36 months following the
date of enactment of a curative amendment, or reaffirmation of the vahdity of
this Chapter; provided, however, if after the date of declaration and proposal
there is a substantially new duty imposed upon the Borough by virtue of a
change in statute or by virtue of a Pennsylvania appellate court decision, the
Borough may utilize the provisions of this Section to propose a curative
amendment to this Chapter to fulfill said duty or obligation.

such reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to those expressed in
this Chapter, as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this
Chapter and the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.

period required by the subsection or fails to commence, conduct or complete the
required hearing as provided in Section 908(1.2) of the Municipahties Planning
Code, the decision shall be deemed to have been rendered in favor of the

jurisdiction. A copy of the final decision or, where no decision is called for,
of the findings shall be dehvered to the applicant personally or mailed to him
no later than the day following its date.

shall be paid at the time application or request for notice is made. All such
fees paid as above described are and shall be non-refundable.
      C.   Jurisdiction. The Zoning Hearing Board shall have such jurisdiction,

Municipahties Planning Code.
      D.   Appeals. The Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged

procedures or has misinterpreted or misapplied any provision of a valid rule or
regulation governing the action of the Zoning Officer. Nothing herein contained

court where appropriated and authorized by the Municipahties Planning Code.
      E.   Variances. The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is
alleged that the provisions of this Chapter inflict unnecessary hardship upon
the apphcant. The Board shall prescribe the form of application and require
preliminary application to the Zoning Officer. The Board may grant a variance,
provided the following findings are made where relevant in a given case:
         (1)   That there are no unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape or
exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions
and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of
this Chapter in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
         (2)   That, because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity
with the provisions of this Chapter and the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
         (3)   That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appeUant.
         (4)   That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located nor

adjacent property nor be detrimental to the pubhc welfare.
         (5)   That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance which will afford relief and represent the least modification possible
of the regulation in issue.
            In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of
this Chapter.
      F.   Parties Appellant Before Board. Appeals under §
27-1002(D) above, and proceedings to challenge this Chapter may be filed with

            (a)   No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the
Board later than 30 days after any application for development, prehminary or
final, has been approved by an appropriate municipal agency or body if such
proceeding is designed to secure reversal or to hmit the approval in any manner

reason to beheve that such approval had been given. If such person has
succeeded to his interest after such approval, he shall be bound by the
knowledge of his predecessor in interest.
            (b)   The failure of anyone other than the landowner to appeal from
an adverse decision on a tentative or prehminary plan by the Borough Council or
from an adverse decision by the Zoning Officer on a challenge to the vahdity of
an ordinance or map shall preclude an appeal from a final approval except in
the case where the final submission substantially deviates from the approved
tentative or prehminary approval.

in §
27-1002 of this Part, and during its pendency before the Board, all land

Zoning Officer or any agency or body and all official action thereunder shall
be stayed, unless the Zoning Officer or any other appropriate agency or body
certifies to the Board facts indicating that such stay would cause imminent
peril to life or property; in which case, the development or official action
shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted
by the Board or the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals on petition
after notice to the Zoning Officer or other appropriate agency or body. When an
apphcation for development, preliminary or final, has been duly approved and
proceedings designed to reverse or limit the approval are filed with the Board
by persons other than the applicant, the apphcant may petition the court having
jurisdiction of zoning appeals to order such persons to post bond as a
condition to continue the proceedings before the Board. The question of whether
or not such petition should be granted and the amount of the bond shall be
within the sound discretion of the court.

hearing.
      G.   If the Borough Council or the Zoning Hearing Board, as the case may

46th day after the close of the last hearing.
   4.   The Zoning Hearing Board or Borough Council, as the case may be, shall
commence its hearing within 60 days after the request is filed unless the
landowner requests or consents to an extension of time.
   5.   Pubhc notice of the hearing shall include notice that the validity of
the ordinance or maps is in question and shall give the place where and the
times when a copy of the request, including any plans, explanatory material or
proposed amendments may be examined by the public.
   6.   The challenge shall be deemed denied when:

         (5)   A commercially reasonable agreement could not be reached with
the owners of such structures.
      E.   All other uses ancillary to the antenna and associated equipment
(including a business office, maintenance depot, vehicle storage, etc.) are
prohibited from the personal wireless service facilities site unless otherwise
permitted in the C-2 District in which the personal wireless service facilities
site is located.
      F.   Standards of Approval of All Personal Wireless Service Facilities.
         (1)   Antenna Height. In no case shall an antenna support structure
and antenna together extend beyond 100 feet in height. [Ord. 508A]
         (2)   Setback from Base of Antenna Support Structure. If a new antenna
support structure is constructed (as opposed to mounting the antenna on an
existing structure), the minimum distance between the base of the support
structure or any guy wire anchors and any property line right-of-way line shall
be the largest of the following:
            (a)   Thirty percent of antenna height.
            (b)   Forty feet.
Except as hereinafter provided, in all cases, monopole antenna support
structure shall be preferred. The Borough Council may grant use of guy wire,
free standing or any other type of antenna support structure after review by
the Planning Commission and a public hearing before the Borough Council. The
applicant must establish the following for approval:
            (a)   Cost of erecting a monopole would preclude the provision of
adequate service to the public or erection of a safe antenna support structure.
            (b)   The proposed antenna structure would have the least practical
adverse visual impact on the environment and closely resembles a monopole.
         (3)   Antenna Support Structure Safety. The applicant shall
demonstrate that the proposed antenna and support structure are safe and the
surrounding areas will not be negatively affected by support structure failure,
falling ice or other debris. The applicant shall also demonstrate compliance
with guidelines recommended by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI)
(ANSI/IEEEC95-1-1992) as amended, with respect to radio frequency emissions.
         (4)   Fencing. A fence shall be required around the antenna support
structure, accessory building(s) and other equipment unless the antenna is
mounted on an existing structure. The fence shall be a minimum of 6 feet in
heigh and a maximum of 8 feet in height, shall completely enclose the antenna,
support structure and related facilities, shall not contain openings greater
than 9 square inches and shall contain, at all entrances, gates which shall be
locked except during such times as the site is manned by authorized operations
or maintenance personnel.
         (5)   Equipment Building. One equipment building only shall be
permitted. Said equipment building shall not exceed 250 square feet.
         (6)   Accessory Use. An antenna support structure shall not be
considered an accessory use and may not be established on a parcel of ground
with any other use without first complying with the requirements of the Borough
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance [
Chapter 22].
         (7)   Landscaping. The following landscaping shall be required to
screen as much of the antenna support structure as possible, the fence
surrounding the support structure and any other ground level features (such as
a building) and in general soften the appearance of the personal wireless
service facility site. The Borough Council may permit any combination of
existing vegetation, topography, walls, decorative fences or other features
instead of landscaping if they achieve the same degree of screening as the
required landscaping. If the antenna is mounted on an existing structure and
other equipment is housed inside an existing structure, landscaping shall not
be required.
            (a)   An evergreen screen shall be required to surround the site.
The screen can be either a hedge (planted 3 feet on center maximum) or a row of
evergreen trees (planted 10 feet on center maximum). The evergreen screen shall
be a minimum heigh of 6 feet at planting and shall grow to a minimum of 15 feet
at maturity.
            (b)   In addition, existing vegetation on and around the site shall
be preserved to the greatest extent possible.

automated, adequate parking shall be required for maintenance workers. If the
site is not automated, the number of required parking spaces shaU equal the
number of people onsite at the largest shift.
         (10)   Visual Impact. Antenna support structures shall be painted in a
color that best allows it to blend into the surroundings unless otherwise
required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulation. The use of
grays, blues and greens may be appropriate; however, each case should be
evaluated individually. No antenna support structure may be artificiaUy lighted
except when required by the FAA.
         (11)   Minimum Visual Impact Requirements. Personal wireless service
facilities shall result in a minimal visual impact for those residents in the
immediate area and for those in the larger community who view these facihties
from a distance. Minimal visual impact shall include the foUowing:
            (a)   For facihties located in highly developed portions of the
Borough, buUdings may be used to accomplish the screening noted above.
            (b)   It is acknowledged that large, multi-use towers located
within major use transmission areas cannot be effectively screened. In order to
minimize the visual impact, such new facihties should be located in close
proximity to other comparable structures. Accompanying buildings, ground-
mounted antennas and other equipment and structures should be subject to
screening recommendations.
            (c)   FAA requirements for coloring and lighting of towers
supersedes Borough requirements for visual minimum impact.
            (d)   If an antenna is instaUed on a structure other than a tower,
the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a
neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of
the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as
visually unobtrusive as possible.
         (12)   Signs. No portion of any antenna or antenna support structure
shall be used for a sign or other advertising purpose including, but not
limited to, company name and telephone number and no banners, streamers or any
other objects or items not essential to the function or support of the antenna
or antenna support structure shall be attached to or displaced from same.
         (13)   Bonding. The Borough Council, at its sole discretion, may
require the applicant or owner to establish, as a condition of approval of any
application, a maintenance and/or performance bond in an amount sufficient to
cover the installation, maintenance and/or construction of the antenna, antenna
support structures and accessory structures of buildings during its/their
lifetime and in an amount sufficient to remove the antenna support structure if
said structure is no longer in use for its original communication purpose. The
amount required shall be determined at the sole discretion of Borough Council
based upon the unique characteristics of the antenna, support structure and
accessory structures or buildings.
         (14)   As-Built Plans. Within 60 days of completion of the initial
construction and any additional construction, applicant shall furnish two
complete sets of plans, drawn to scale and certified to the Borough as
accurately depicting the location of personal wireless service facility
constructed pursuant to the building permit.
         (15)   Inspection. Beginning in December of the 10th year after the
construction of any antenna support structure and by December of each even
numbered year thereafter, and at any time a new carrier antenna is added, the
antenna support structure shall be inspected by an expert who is regularly
involved in the maintenance, inspection and/or erection of antenna support
structures. At a minimum, this inspection shall be conducted in accordance wit
the Tower Inspection Class Checklist provided in the Electronics Industries
Association (EIA) Standard 222 “Structural Standards for Steel Antenna Towers
and Antenna Support Structures.” A copy of said inspection report shall be
provided to the Borough. At the time said report is provided to the Borough,
applicant shall pay a fee in an amount to be established, from time to time, by
resolution of Borough Council or such other amount as the Borough Council
shall, from time to time, set forth in a resolution. [Ord. 553]
         (16)   Removal. Any antenna support structure that is no longer is use
for its original communication purpose shall be removed at the owner’s expense.
The owner shall provide the Borough with a copy of the notice to the FCC of
intent to cease operations and shall be given 12 months from the date of
ceasing operations to remove the obsolete antenna structure and accessory
structure. In the case of multiple operators sharing use of a single tower,
this provision shall not become effective until all users cease operations.

PART 12
PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT
§ 27-1201.   Purpose.
The purpose of this Part is:
      A.   To ensure that the provisions of this Chapter which are concerned
with the uniform treatment of dwelhng type, bulk, density and open space within
each zoning district need not necessarily be applied to the improvement of land
by other than lot-by-lot development in a manner which would distort the
objectives of that zoning ordinance.
      B.   To encourage innovations in residential development and renewal so
that the growing demand for housing may be met by a greater variety in type,
design and layout of dwelhng, and by the conservation and more efficient use of
open space supplementary to said dwelhngs.
      C.   To provide greater opportunities for better housing and recreation
for all who are or will be residents of the Borough.
      D.   To encourage a more efficient use of land and pubhc services and to
reflect changes in the technology of land development so that the economies so
secured may endure to the benefit of those who need homes.
      E.   To encourage more flexible land development which will respect and
conserve natural resources such as streams, floodplains, ground water, wooded
areas and areas of unusual beauty or importance to the natural ecosystem.
      F.   And in aid of these purposes, to provide a procedure which can
relate the type, design and layout of residential development to the particular
site and the particular demand for housing existing at the time of development
it a manner consistent with the preservation of the property values within
existing residential areas, and to assure that the increased flexibility of
regulations over land development estabhshed hereby is carried out pursuant to
sound, expeditious and fair administrative standards and procedures.

Failure of the Borough Council to render a decision on an application for final
approval and communicate it to the apphcant within the time and in the manner
required by this Section shaU be deemed an approval of the apphcation for final
approval, as presented, unless the apphcant has agreed in writing to an

§ 27-1206.    Open Space Provisions.
   1.    Standards for Location and Management of Open Space.
      A.   The open space shah be located so as to be consistent with the
objectives set forth in the application for planned residential development.
Where possible, it shall be designed as a contiguous area easily accessible to
the residents, and preserving natural features.
      B.   There shall be provisions which insure that the open space land
shall continue as such and be properly maintained. The developer shall either:
         (1)   Dedicate the land to pubhc use if the Borough or another public
agency has indicated it wiU accept such, or another public agency has indicated
it will accept such dedication.
         (2)   Retain ownership and responsibihty for maintenance of such open
space land.
         (3)   Provide for and estabhsh one or more organizations for the
ownership and maintenance of ah common open space.
In the case of subsection (B)(3), above, such organization shall be a non-
profit homeowners association, unless the developer demonstrates that a
community open space trust is a more appropriate form or organization.
      C.   If a homeowners association or open space trust is formed, it shah
be governed according to the foUowing regulations:
         (1)   The organization shall be organized by the developer and
operated with financial subsidization by the developer, if necessary, before

         (2)   Membership in the organization shall be mandatory for all
landowners and purchasers of homes therein, their successors, heirs and
assigns.
         (3)   The organization shall be responsible for maintenance of,
insurance, and taxes for the common open space.
         (4)   The members of the organization shall share equitably the costs
of maintaining and developing common open space, in accordance with procedures
established by them.
         (5)   The organization shall have or hire adequate staff to administer
common facilities and maintain the common open space.
         (6)   In the event that the organization established to own and
maintain a common open space, or a successor organization, shall at any time
after establishment of the planned residential development fail to maintain the
common open space in a reasonable order and condition in accordance with the
development plan, the Borough may serve written notice upon such organization
or upon the residents and owners of the planned residential development setting
forth the manner in which the organization has failed to maintain the common
open space in a reasonable condition, and said notice shall include a demand
that such deficiencies be cured within 30 days thereof, and shall state the
date and place of a hearing thereon which shall be held within 14 days of the
notice. At the hearing the Borough may modify the terms of the original notice
as to the deficiencies and may give an extension of time within which such
deficiencies shall be cured. If the deficiencies set forth in the original
notice or in the modifications thereof shall not be cured within said 30 days
or any extension thereof, the Borough, in order to preserve the taxable values
of the properties within the planned residential development and to prevent the
common open space from becoming a public nuisance, may enter upon said common
open space and maintain the same for a period of 1 year. Said entry and
maintenance shall not vest in the public any rights to use the common open
space except when the same is voluntarily dedicated to the pubhc by the
residents and owners and formally accepted by the Borough pursuant to this
Chapter. Before the expiration of said year, the Borough shall, upon its
initiative or upon the request of the organization theretofore responsible for
the maintenance of the common open space, call a pubhc hearing upon notice to
such organization, or to the residents and owners of the planned residential
development, to be held by the Borough, at which hearing such organization or
the residents and owners of the planned residential development shah show cause
why such maintenance by the Borough shaU not, at the election of the Borough,
continue for a succeeding year. If the Borough shah determine that such
organization is not ready and able to maintain said common open space in a
reasonable condition, the Borough may, in its discretion, continue to maintain
said common open space during succeeding years, subject to a similar hearing
and determination in each year thereafter. The decision of the Borough in any
such case shaU constitute a final administrative decision subject to judicial
review. The cost of such maintenance by the Borough shall be assessed ratably
against the properties within the planned residential development that have a
right of enjoyment of the common open space and shah become a tax hen on said
properties. The Borough, at the time of entering upon said common open space
for the purpose of maintenance, shall file a notice of such hen in the office
of the Prothonotary of the County, upon the properties affected by such lien
within the planned residential development.
         (7)   In accordance with the Municipahties Planning Code the
provisions of the development plan relating to (1) the use, bulk and location
of buildings and structures, (2) the quality and location of common open space,
and (3) the intensity of use or the density of residential units, shah run in
favor of the Borough and shall be enforceable in law or in equity by the
Borough, without hmitations on any powers of regulation otherwise granted the
Borough by law. The development plan shah specify those of its provisions which
shah run in favor of, and be enforceable by residents of the planned
residential development and, in addition, the manner in which such residents
may modify or release such rights.
         (8)   If the Borough or a pubhc agency including, but not hmited to,
the school district, fire department, or sewer authority, determines that land
for public use will be needed as a result of the construction of the planned
residential development, the developer may be required to set aside such land
for eventual acquisition by the Borough or public agency. If such land is not
acquired by the appropriate body by the date of the sale or rental of 51% of
the total dwelhng units in the planned residential development, then at the
option of the developer, the land may be used for residential purposes subject
to the provisions of this Part. If the developer chooses to dedicate such land,
