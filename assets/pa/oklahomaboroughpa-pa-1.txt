the Water Authority for measuring all water used other than that obtained from
the Water Authority, and the quantity of water used to determine the sewage
collection charges shall be the quantity of water measured by all such meters
plus the quantity of water obtained from the Water Authority. In lieu of such
additional meters, the borough may establish under §
51.035 of this chapter a flat rate charge which shall be applicable to such
non-metered water usage.
   (E)   When water usage is used as the basis of charges, then if it is
established to the satisfaction of the borough that a portion of the water used
in or on any property served by the public sanitary sewage system does not and
cannot enter said system, and in the event that the total water used in or on
said property exceeds 100,000 gallons per quarter, the borough may determine,
in such manner and by such method as it may deem practical, the percentage of
the water entering the public sanitary sewage system, or the borough may
require or permit the installation of additional meters in such manner as to
determine either the quantity of water excluded from the public sanitary sewage
system or the quantity of water, sewage or industrial waste actually entering
the public sanitary sewage system, exclusive of stormwater runoff. In such
case, the sewage collection charge shall be based upon the quantity of water
estimated, measured or computed by the borough to be actually entering the
public sanitary sewage system, exclusive of stormwater runoff.
   (F)   When water usage is used as the basis of charges, then any person
requesting consideration for a reduction of the amount of the sewage collection
charges because of water not entering the public sanitary sewage system shall
make written application to the borough for such consideration, giving the name
of such person, his or her address and setting forth supporting data fully
describing other sources of water, if any, as well as the disposition of water
alleged not to be entering the public sanitary sewage system. The application
shall be accompanied by a sketch to approximate scale showing the plan of the
property, the water distribution system, sewer layout, existing meters and
proposed meters in the scheme to determine the quantity of flow entering, or
not entering, the public sanitary sewage system. The cost of furnishing,
installing and maintaining any meters, other than those utilized to measure
water purchased from the Water Authority, shall be borne by the applicant. The
type, size, location, arrangement and maintenance of such meters shall be
subject to the approval of the borough, the Authority and the Water Authority.

GREASE TRAPS AND INTERCEPTORS
§ 51.095 AUTHORITY AND FINDINGS.
   The Authority is hereby authorized to establish an inspection and
maintenance program, along with rules, regulations and standards to require
commercial and industrial borough users whose use is likely to generate harmful
grease, fats and oils, to install and maintain traps, interceptors and recovery
devices to prevent the introduction, disposal and/or discharge of such grease,
fats, oils and other wastes and substances, food particles or organic or
inorganic solid or semisolid waste that can be collected and intercepted by a
grease interceptor, usually in layers of floatable, suspended and settleable
substances, which are or can be ultimately removed from a grease interceptor
for proper disposal (hereinafter “harmful grease”).
(Prior Code, § 18-402) (Ord. 2010-12, passed 9-13-2010)
§ 51.096 GREASE TRAP MAINTENANCE AND PROTECTION SYSTEM.
   The grease trap maintenance and protection system shall be implemented and
administered as follows.
   (A)   The objective of the grease trap protection and maintenance system is
to reduce the operational and maintenance costs of maintaining the public
sewers, sewage disposal system and sewer system by preventing the accumulation
of harmful grease within the sanitary sewer lines.
   (B)   The Council and/or its designee or agent, and persons designated and
under the instruction and supervision of any of them, may inspect and
investigate compliance with this subchapter and enforce violations hereof.
   (C)   Commercial or industrial generators of harmful grease shall install,
operate and maintain a GREASE INTERCEPTOR or INTERCEPTOR approved by the
Council, which shall mean a watertight receptacle to intercept, collect and
prevent the passage of harmful grease into the service connection and,
ultimately, the sewer, sewer system and/or sewage disposal system to which the
receptacle is directly or indirectly connected.
   (D)   Commercial or industrial generators of harmful grease shall install,
operate and maintain a GREASE RECOVERY DEVICE approved by the Council, which
shall mean a type of grease interceptor that mechanically removes harmful
grease from the waste stream for later disposal.
   (E)   Grease and grease interceptors and grease recovery devices shall:
      (1)   Be stored on premises in an integral recovered grease container;
      (2)   Be stored in such a manner as to minimize odors and insects;
      (3)   Not be mixed with edible grease;
      (4)   Be properly disposed of in accordance with all applicable rules and
regulations; and
      (5)   If stored on site, it shall be stored in proper containers so as to
prevent odors and leaking.
   (F)   The following facilities shall discharge all waste from sinks,
dishwashers and drains, and any other fixtures through which harmful grease may
be discharged, into an adequately sized, properly maintained and functioning
grease trap protection and maintenance system before the discharge enters the
service connection and, ultimately, the sewer, sewer system and/or sewage
disposal system to which the receptacle is directly or indirectly connected, as
well as providing a grease interceptor inlet flow control device inspection
port and a grease interceptor effluent monitoring port:
      (1)   Every commercial food preparation and service facility, including,
but not limited to, bakeries, boarding houses, butcher shops, cafés,
clubhouses, commercial kitchens, delicatessens, fat rendering plants, ice cream
parlors, hospitals, meat packing plants, restaurants, schools, slaughter
houses, soap factories and similar facilities, especially where meat, poultry,
seafood, dairy products or fried foods are prepared or served;
      (2)   All shopping centers that have food processing facilities;
      (3)   All food courts; and
      (4)   All other facilities discharging harmful grease that, in the
opinion of the Council, will, alone or in concert with other substances from
the discharges of other facilities, have a reasonable chance to impede or stop
the flow in the sewer, sewer system and/or sewage disposal system to which any
service connection is directly or indirectly connected.
   (G)   (1)   Grease interceptors or recovery devices shall not be required
for single-family residences, duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes or apartment
complexes unless the Council first determines there are discharges from the
property that will create problems in the sewer, sewer system and/or sewage
disposal system. The determination shall be made based upon an investigation of
the property and a comparison of the content and amount of discharge from the
property with the discharges of other properties similar in size and use.
      (2)   Upon a determination that the discharges will secrete problems in
the sewer, sewer system and/or sewage disposal system to which any service
connection receptacle is directly or indirectly connected, the Council may
require the installation of a sufficiently sized grease inceptor or recovery
device to treat the discharges.
   (H)   Those borough users of the sewer, sewer system and/or sewage disposal
system who are or may be determined to be subject to the requirements of this
subchapter shall:
      (1)   Describe the method or means by which harmful grease is being
disposed of in accordance with applicable rules and regulations when providing
records in accordance with division (H)(3) below;
      (2)   Maintain and inspect the grease interceptor and/or recovery device
as often as necessary to properly dispose of harmful grease, and not less often
than every 90 days, and maintain on the premises of the facility and produce,
upon request by the Council, backup copies of trip tickets and/or a service log
for at least two years;
      (3)   Within ten days after notice from the Council, provide copies of
records to the Council demonstrating service, cleaning and maintenance of the
interceptor and/or recovery device every 90 days;
      (4)   Allow demand inspection of the facility and of records by
inspectors during reasonable hours; and
      (5)   Pay the costs of inspecting, administering, implementing and
enforcing this subchapter in the event of failure to comply with the provisions
hereof.
   (I)   It is unlawful for any generator of harmful grease to discharge into
the service connection and, ultimately, the public sewer, sewer system and/or
sewage disposal system to which the receptacle is directly or indirectly
connected in any manner that is in violation of this subchapter, or of any
condition set forth in this subchapter. Additionally, a person commits an
offense if the person causes or permits the plugging or blocking of, or
otherwise interferes with or permits the interference of, a grease interceptor
or recovery device so as to cause the flow to rise above the design capacity of
the interceptor.
   (J)   The Council may suspend water or sewer service when such suspension is
necessary, in the opinion of the Council, in order to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which:
      (1)   Presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to
the health or welfare of persons or the environment;
      (2)   Causes stoppages, or excessive maintenance to be performed to
prevent stoppages, in the public sewer, sewer system and/or sewage disposal
system;
      (3)   Causes interference to the public sewer, sewer system and/or sewage
disposal system;
      (4)   Causes the borough or Council to violate any condition of its
permits;
      (5)   Any person notified of a suspension of the water or sewer service
shall immediately stop or eliminate the discharge. In the event of a failure of
the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Council shall
take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate termination of water
or sewer service, to prevent or minimize damage to the sewer, sewer system and/
or sewage disposal system to which the receptacle is directly or indirectly
connected or endangerment to any individuals. The Council shall reinstate the
water or sewer service when such condition cause(s) of the harmful discharge
and the measure(s) taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to
the Council within 15 days of the date of occurrence; and
      (6)   A person is liable to the Council for any expense, loss or damage
incurred by the Council for reason of appropriate cleanup and proper disposal
of harmful grease. Additionally, an administrative fee equal to one-half of the
assessed cleanup costs shall be levied by the Council against the responsible
party.

level; and
      (3)   The establishment of a parking permit program for certain affected
areas should facilitate the efficient movement of traffic by providing for
parking preference during certain hours of the day and days of the week.
Therefore, the borough considers it to be in the interest of the people of the
borough to provide for the establishment of a residential permit parking
program to ensure primary access to available parking spaces by neighborhood
residents and also to provide a cleaner ambient air level.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      COMMUTER VEHICLE. A motor vehicle parked in a residential area by a
person not a resident of that residential area.
      PROPRIETOR. A person who owns or leases real estate within a residential
area of which he or she is not a resident, but who owns or manages a business
enterprise or professional office maintained at that address. For the purposes
of this section, a PROPRIETOR shall be entitled to one parking permit for that
business or professional office address.
      RESIDENT. A person who owns or leases real property within a residential
area and who maintains either a voting residence or bona fide occupancy, or
both, at that address.
      RESIDENTIAL AREA. A contiguous area containing public highways or parts
of public highways primarily abutted by residential property or residential and
nonbusiness property (such as schools, parks, places of worship, hospitals and
nursing homes).
   (C)   Criteria.

or more of the legal, on-street parking capacity of the area. For the purpose
of this criterion, a legal parking space shall be 20 linear feet.
         (b)   During the same period as specified in division (C)(1)(a) above,
10% or more of the vehicles parked (or standing) on the streets in the area are
not registered in the name of a person residing in the area. For the purpose of
this criterion, the latest available information from the Commonwealth
Department of Transportation regarding registration of motor vehicles shall be
used.
      (2)   Provided, in determining that a specific area identified as
impacted and eligible for residential permit parking is designated as a
residential permit parking area, the following factors are taken into
consideration:
         (a)   The local and metropolitan needs with respect to clean air and
environment;
         (b)   The possibility of a reduction in total vehicle miles driven in
the borough;
         (c)   The likelihood of alleviating traffic congestion, illegal
parking and related health and safety hazards;
         (d)   The proximity of public transportation to the residential area;
         (e)   The desire and need of the residents for residential permit
parking and their willingness to bear the administrative costs in connection
with it; and
         (f)   The need for parking in excess of the residential permit parking
program in proximity to establishments located in the residential permit
parking area and used by the general public for religious, health or

      (2)   Signs shall be erected along the streets in each residential permit
parking area indicating the days, hours, locations and conditions under which
parking shall be by permit only.
   (E)   Application for permit.
      (1)   Application for a residential parking permit shall be made to the
Chief of Police by the person desiring the permit, who shall be only the owner
or the driver of a motor vehicle who resides on or is a proprietor of property
immediately adjacent to a street or other location within a residential parking
permit area. A separate application shall be required for each motor vehicle,
and each application shall be accompanied by a permit fee, in an amount as

borough, to be applied to the cost of administering the residential permit
parking program.

         (a)   The name of the owner or the driver, as the case may be, of the
motor vehicle;

and
         (d)   The driver number as taken from the applicant’s current driver’s
license.
      (3)   At the discretion of the Chief of Police, the applicant shall be
required, at the time of making application, to present his or her driver’s
license and the vehicle registration card.
   (F)   Issuance of permit. Upon receipt of the application and the permit
fee, and determination by him or her that the information upon the application
shows that the applicant is entitled to a residential parking permit, the Chief
of Police shall issue to the applicant a residential parking permit, which
shall be valid for the remainder of the calendar year. The permit shall display
the serial and registration numbers of the motor vehicle, the residential
parking area number and the expiration date. The permit shall be renewable
annually before the expiration date upon making application for renewal and
payment of the permit fee. It shall be unlawful and a violation of this section
for any person to display other than the current and valid permit while
standing or parking in a residential permit parking area at any time when those
permits are to be displayed.
   (G)   Temporary and exemption parking permits. Temporary parking permits may
be issued by the Chief of Police, upon payment of a fee in an amount as
established by resolution of the Borough Council, to bona fide visitors of
residents of a designated residential permit parking area, and exemption
parking permits may be issued, without payment of a fee, to persons with a

motor vehicle operated by him or her in any designated residential parking area
during those times when the parking of motor vehicles is permitted in that
area. While a vehicle for which a residential parking permit has been issued is
so parked, that permit shall be displayed so as to be clearly visible through
the windshield of the vehicle. A residential parking permit shall not guarantee
or reserve to the holder a parking space within a designated residential permit
parking area.
      (2)   A residential parking permit shall not authorize its holder to
stand or park a motor vehicle in any place where or at any time when the
stopping, standing or parking of motor vehicles is prohibited or set aside for
other specified types of vehicles, nor shall the permit exempt its holder from
observance of any traffic or parking regulation other than residential permit
parking regulations or restrictions.
      (3)   No person other than the permit holder whose name appears on the
permit shall use a residential parking permit or display it on a vehicle
operated; any such use or display by a person other than the permit holder
shall constitute a violation of this section by the permit holder and by the
person who so used or displayed the parking permit.
      (4)   It shall constitute a violation of this section for any person
falsely to represent himself or herself as eligible for a residential parking
permit or to furnish false information in an application to the Chief of Police
in order to obtain a residential parking permit.
   (I)   Revocation of permits. The Chief of Police shall have the authority to
revoke the residential parking permit of any permit holder found to be in
violation of any provision of this section. Upon written notification to the
present holder of the revocation, the permit holder shall surrender the permit
to the Chief of Police. Failure to do so, when so requested, shall constitute a
violation of this section. Provided, any person receiving such a notice may,
within ten days after the date of the notice, appeal to the borough for a
hearing on the revocation, and the decision of the borough shall be final.

their choices.

   (A)   It is the intent of this regulation to further the purpose of the
zoning regulations. The borough, through its planning and zoning regulations,
wishes to provide for its citizens and tourists an atmosphere that is both
safe, healthy and aesthetically pleasing, one that fosters activities
appropriate for visitors of all ages on its thoroughfares. In addition, the
borough, through its Neighborhood Planning Program and Comprehensive Plan,
recognizes that some residential neighborhoods, because of their proximity to
commercial districts, are more susceptible to the effects of intensive or
obnoxious activities. This regulation aims to preserve neighborhood integrity
while fostering a positive and wholesome image for visitors from out of the
area.
   (B)   (1)   It is further the purpose of this chapter to promote the health,
safety and general welfare of the citizens of the borough and to establish
reasonable regulations.
      (2)   The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect
of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative
materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the
intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to
sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access
by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone
or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.

§ 111.12 LOCATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES.
   (A)   (1)   A person is guilty of a violation of the Zoning Ordinance (
Chapter 156 of this code) if he or she operates or causes to be operated a
sexually oriented business outside of the district in which a sexually oriented
business is a permitted use. No sexually oriented business shall be located
outside a district in which a sexually oriented business is a permitted use.
      (2)   Sexually oriented businesses as defined herein shall be permitted
in the General Industrial District (M). Hours of operation shall be from 8:00
a.m. to 10:00 p.m., Monday through Saturday. No hours of operation on Sundays
and legal holidays.
   (B)   A person is guilty of a violation of the Zoning Ordinance (
Chapter 156 of this code) if he or she operates or causes to be operated a
sexually oriented business within 1,000 feet of a church; a public or private
pre-elementary, elementary or secondary school; a public library; a child care
facility or nursery school; a public park adjacent to any residential district;
a child-oriented business; a college and/or public or private university; and
any residentially zoned districts in the borough.
   (C)   A person is guilty of a violation of the Zoning Ordinance (
Chapter 156 of this code) if he or she causes or permits the operation,
establishment, substantial enlargement or transfer of ownership or control of a
sexually oriented business within 1,000 feet of another sexually oriented
business.
   (D)   A person is guilty of a violation of the Zoning Ordinance (
Chapter 156 of this code) if he or she causes or permits the operation of a
substantial enlargement of the sexually oriented business.
   (E)   For the purposes of this part of the Zoning Ordinance (
Chapter 156 of this code), measurement shall be made in a straight line,
without regard to intervening structures or objects, from the nearest portion
of the building or structure used as a part of the premises where a sexually
oriented business is conducted, to the nearest property line of the premises of
a church, public or private pre-elementary, elementary or secondary school,
public library, child care facility, child-oriented business or nursery school;
or to the nearest boundary of an affected public park, college, university or
residentially zoned district.
   (F)   For purposes of this section of this part of the Zoning Ordinance (
Chapter 156 of this code), the distance between any two sexually oriented

structures or objects, from the closest exterior wall of the structure in which
each business is located.
   (G)   Any sexually oriented business lawfully operating on the date of
enactment of this chapter that is in violation of any part of this section
shall be deemed a nonconforming use. Any preexisting nonconforming use sexually
oriented business that is abandoned or is not used as such for a period of at
least 12 months loses its preexisting nonconforming status and must thereafter
comply with all provisions of this chapter to reopen. At the time of the
writing of the ordinance codified in this chapter, there are no such
preexisting uses in the borough. In the event that two or more sexually
oriented businesses are within 1,000 feet of one another and otherwise in a
permissible location, the sexually oriented business which was first
established and continually operating at a particular location is the
conforming use and the later established business is nonconforming.
   (H)   A sexually oriented business lawfully operating as a conforming use is
not rendered a nonconforming use by the location, subsequent to the grant or
renewal of the sexually oriented business permit, of a church, public or
private pre-elementary, elementary or secondary school, public library, child
care facility, child-oriented business, nursery school or public park within
1,500 feet of the sexually oriented business. This provision applies only to
the renewal of a valid permit and does not apply when an application for a
permit is submitted after a permit has expired or has been revoked.

aggrieved by abandoned vehicles and unsightly mobile or modular homes or
trailers littering the borough, and said complainants have demanded that the
Council take action.

nuisance created by the abandoned vehicles, but that every effort to provide
due process to the owner of the abandoned vehicle shall be afforded.

the towing and storage charges and of the fine and costs, if applicable, as
well as the 10% penalty authorized by this code of ordinances, together with
the borough’s actual attorney fees and court costs. The notice shall state

   (E)   At the expiration of the 30-day notice period, the borough shall seek
title to the vehicle free and clear of any liens.

Existing Structures Code, 1987 (Second Edition), subject to provisions in this
subchapter amending, deleting, adding to and making insertions in that code.
Copies of that code have been placed on file with the Borough Secretary, and
will remain on file there. That entire existing structures code, except for
those portions that are deleted, amended or modified in the following sections
of this subchapter, is adopted and incorporated as fully as if set out verbatim
in this subchapter, and from the date on which this subchapter takes effect,
shall be controlling throughout the limits of the borough in all matters to
which that code is made applicable. In this subchapter, the BOCA National
Existing Structures Code may be referred to as “the Code” or “this Code.”
(Prior Code, § 5-101) (Ord. 207A, passed 2-13-1989)
§ 150.16 MODIFICATIONS TO BOCA NATIONAL EXISTING STRUCTURES CODES.
   The Code is amended and modified in the following respects.
   (A)   Whenever the words “name of jurisdiction” appear in brackets in the
code, the words “Borough of Oklahoma” shall be inserted in place of those
bracketed words. Likewise, the words “Borough of Oklahoma” shall be substituted
for the word “jurisdiction” wherever that word appears singly in the Code
without being preceded by the words “under the.”
   (B)   Wherever the term “code official” or the term “administrative
authority” appears in the Code, the term “building official” shall be
substituted for that term.
   (C)   Wherever the term “the legislative body of the jurisdiction” or the
term “chief authority of the jurisdiction” appears in the code, the term
“Borough Council” shall be substituted for that term.
   (D)   Wherever the term “the jurisdiction’s legal representative” or the
term “the jurisdiction’s attorney-at-law” appears in the code, the term
“Borough Solicitor” shall be substituted for that term.
   (E)   Section ES-100.1. of the code is amended to read as follows:
      ES-100.1. Title. This code shall be known as the “Existing Structures
Code of the Borough of Oklahoma,” hereinafter referred to as “the code” or
“this code.”
   (F)   Section ES-100.4. of the code is amended to read as follows:
      ES-100.4. Validity of other laws, regulations and ordinances. Nothing in
this code shall be construed to prevent the enforcement of other laws, State
regulations and ordinances of this borough which prescribe more restrictive or
stricter requirements or limitations. When the provisions specified in this
code for health, safety and welfare are more restrictive than the other
provisions, this code shall control, but in any case, the most rigid
requirements of either this code or other laws, regulations or ordinances shall
apply whenever they may be in conflict.
   (G)   Section ES-100.5. of the code is amended to read as follows:
      ES-100.5. Application of other codes. Any repairs or alterations to a
structure, or changes of use therein, which are caused directly or indirectly
by the enforcement of this code, shall be done in accordance with procedures
and provisions of the borough’s building code.

      ES-101.2. Saving clause. Nothing in this code or in the code adopting it
by reference shall be construed to affect any suit or proceeding pending in any
court at the time of enacting that code, or any rights acquired, liability
incurred or any cause or causes of action accrued or existing, under any
ordinance repealed by that ordinance. No right or remedy of any character shall
be lost, impaired or affected by that ordinance.
   (I)   Section ES-104.1. of the code is amended to read as follows:
      ES-104.1. Enforcement Officer. It shall be the duty and responsibility of
the code official to enforce the provisions of this code. Where, in the course
of his or her enforcement duties, the code official finds a violation in the
strict provisions or application of this code which violation, if corrected,
would not substantially serve to further the purpose of this code in protecting
the public health, safety and welfare, and where the elimination of that
violation would constitute a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, the
code official shall recommend to the Appeal Board that a variance be granted.
In considering such recommendations, the Appeal Board shall give consideration
to the special physical characteristics of existing older dwellings in the
borough which would require extensive structural alterations to conform to the
strict provisions or application of this code.
   (J)   Section ES-105.3.2. of the code is amended to read as follows:
      ES-105.3.2. Right of entry. If any owner, occupant or other person in
charge of a structure subject to the provisions of this code refuses, impedes,
inhibits, interferes with, restricts or obstructs entry and free access to any
part of the structure or premises where inspection authorized by this code is
sought, the Borough Solicitor may initiate proper action to seek, in a court of
competent jurisdiction, an order that such owner, occupant or other person in
charge cease and desist with such interference.
   (K)   Section ES-105.5. of the code is amended to read as follows:
      ES-105.5. Coordination of enforcement. Inspection of premises, and the
issuance and enforcement of notices and orders shall be the responsibility of
the code official. Whenever, in the opinion of the code official initiating an
inspection under this code, it is deemed necessary or desirable to have
inspections by other department or officer of Borough government, the code
official shall make reasonable effort to arrange for the coordination of such
inspections so as to minimize the number of visits by inspectors, and to confer
with the other department or officer for the purpose of eliminating conflicting
orders before any are issued. A department or officer shall not, however, delay
the issuance of any emergency orders which it determines must be issued.
   (L)   Section ES-105.6. of the code is amended by adding the following
sentence at the end of that section: “Furthermore, Borough Council shall have
authority, at its discretion, to abrogate any rule or regulation, or part
thereof, in which case that rule or regulation or part thereof shall cease to
be in effect in the Borough.”
   (M)   Section ES-105.7. of the code is amended to read as follows:

operations in such form and content as shall be prescribed by Council.

      ES-106.1. General. When a structure or part thereof is found by the code
official to be unsafe, or when a structure or part thereof is found unfit for
human occupancy or use, or is found unlawful, and the procedures prescribed by
the Building Code under the heading “Unsafe Buildings and Structure” shall be
found to be inadequate or unsuitable to remedy the situation, that structure or
part thereof may be condemned pursuant to the provisions of this code and may
be placarded and vacated. It shall not be re-occupied without approval of the
code official. Unsafe equipment shall be placarded and placed out of service.
   (O)   Section ES-110.2. of the code is amended to read as follows:
      ES-110.2. Penalty for violation. Any person who violates any provision of
this code or of the code adopting this code, or who violates or fails to comply
with any order made thereunder, or who builds in violation of any detailed
statement of specifications or plans submitted and approved thereunder, or any
certificate or permit issued thereunder, and from which no appeal has been
taken, or who fails to comply with such an order as affirmed or modified by the
Appeal Board or by a court of competent jurisdiction, within the time fixed
herein, shall severally, for each and every such violation and noncompliance,
respectively, upon conviction in a summary proceeding before a magisterial
district judge under the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, be sentenced
to pay a fine of not less than $200 nor more than $1,000 and costs of
prosecution, and, in default of payment of such fine and costs, to imprisonment
for not more than 90 days. The imposition of one penalty for any violation
shall not excuse the violation or permit it to continue; and all such persons
shall be required to correct or remedy such violations or defects within a
reasonable time; and when not otherwise specified, each ten days that
prohibited conditions are maintained shall constitute a separate offense.
   (P)   Section ES-111.1. of the code is amended to add the following sentence
at the end of that section: “Provided, the intent of this § ES-111.1.,
“Demolition,” is to provide a procedure to be available for use in cases where
the procedures prescribed by the Building Code under the heading “Unsafe
Buildings and Structures” or under the heading “Demolition” shall be found to
be inadequate or unsuitable to remedy the situation.”

“number,” enclosed in brackets, the following: “10.”
   (R)   Section ES-112.1. of the code is amended to read as follows:

issued in connection with the enforcement of any provision of this code, or of
any rule or regulation adopted by authority of this code, shall have the right
to appeal and shall be granted a hearing on the matter before the Board of
Appeals established by the BOCA National Building Code, which shall be composed
of the Borough Council, ex officio, and shall be the “Appeal Board” as referred
to in this code. The appeal shall proceed in the same manner and subject to the
same limitations as prescribed in the building code for appeals from the orders
and decisions of the building official under that code. The appeal shall be
filed with the borough, in writing, within 30 days of the rendition of the

§ 152.07 REPAIR AND RESTORATION OF BOROUGH STREET.
   (A)   Any person who shall access, open or excavate any improved street in
the borough shall thoroughly and completely backfill the opening or excavation,
using accepted materials and compaction techniques so as to prevent any
settling thereafter; and shall restore the surface to the same condition as it
was before the access, opening or excavation.
   (B)   Such restoration shall be in accordance with the specifications of the
Department of Highways of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Form 408 which are
hereby adopted as specifications of the borough for restoration of surfaces of
streets in the borough. The surface shall conform to the existing grade and
curb elevations and be of the same surface materials and treatment as the part
of the thoroughfare immediately adjoining the access, opening or excavation.
   (C)   If, within one year after the restoration of the street surface as
herein provided is completed, defects shall appear therein resulting from
defective backfilling or restoration by the applicant, the applicant shall
reimburse the borough for the cost of all necessary repairs to the permanent

street, including emergency excavation, protection of vehicular and pedestrian
traffic, backfilling and temporary pavement, shall be done by the applicant at
his or her expense, and all such work shall be subject to the provisions of
this subchapter and to the supervision and approval of the borough, provided
that the Borough Council may require that the cutting of the surface of
improved streets and the backfilling of all excavation therein shall be done by
the borough, and the charge therefore shall be paid by the applicant on the
basis of actual cost of the work plus 20% for inspection, design and
administrative services.
(Ord. 2 of 2024, passed 11-11-2024)
§ 152.08 REGULATIONS.
   (A)   No access, opening or excavation of any street shall extend from the

   (B)   No more than 450 linear feet shall be opened in any street at any one
time, unless otherwise specified by agreement or contract.
   (C)   The work of excavation and restoration shall be so conducted as not to
interfere with the water mains, sanitary and storm sewers, or their connections
with structures, or any other subsurface lines or facilities, until permission
is authorized by the utility, agency or person owning and maintaining such
lines.
   (D)   No tunneling or boring shall be allowed without the express approval
of the Borough Council and permission therefore is indicated upon the street
opening permit. The backfilling of a tunnel excavation or bore shall be made
only in the presence of the Borough Engineer or representative thereof where
commonwealth or borough owned facilities are involved.
   (E)   All openings or excavation shall be backfilled promptly with 2A
limestone or approved materials and thoroughly compacted in layers with an
approved mechanical back tamper, each of which shall not exceed six inches in
depth. On improved streets, the backfill material shall be placed to within ten
inches of the surface.

thoroughly bound and compacted, shall be installed flush with the surface of
the adjoining paving. Permanent paving shall be completed at such time as the
Borough Engineer so directs.
   (G)   During excavation in any street, every necessary and reasonable
precaution shall be taken by the applicant and/or the applicant’s contractor to
keep the street in a safe and passable condition both day and night by guards,
barriers, warning signs, safety lights, lanterns and other devices, and all
excavating permits are granted under and subject to the express condition that
the person to whom the same is issued shall indemnify, and hold harmless the
borough, from any loss in damages, or otherwise, which may occur at any time by
reason of said excavation, or by any leak, explosion or other injury from any
pipe, apparatus, conduit or any other material placed in the said excavation.
   (H)   The applicant shall notify the borough when the opening or excavation
is ready for backfilling and before any backfilling is done, in order for
inspection to occur while the work is being completed by approved backfilling
and compaction in the case of unimproved streets and by restoration of
temporary or permanent paving in the case of improved streets.
   (I)   In the event that any work performed by or for a permit holder shall,
in the opinion of the Borough Engineer be unsatisfactory and the same shall not
be corrected in accordance with the Engineer’s instructions within the time
fixed by the Borough Engineer, or in the event that the work for which the
permit was issued is not completed within the time fixed by the street opening
permit, the borough may proceed to correct such unsatisfactory work or complete
any such work not completed, and charge the actual cost thereof, plus 20% for
inspection services, to the applicant.
   (J)   In the case of any emergency involving a leak, explosion or other
accident in any subsurface pipe, line, construction or facility, it shall be
lawful for the person owning or responsible for such pipe, line, construction
or facility to commence an excavation to remedy such condition utilizing one of
the three street opening permits required to be secured for such situation.
   (K)   All other provisions of this subchapter shall be complied with. If any
such emergency condition shall not be immediately attended to by the owner or
person responsible for such pipe, line, construction or facility, the Borough
Council, after such notice to affected property owners as it shall deem
necessary under the circumstances of the particular case, shall proceed to do
the work necessary and required by such emergency, and charge the same on the
basis of cost plus 20% for inspection services to such owner, operator or
person.
   (L)   Payment for all work done by the borough under the specific provisions
of this subchapter shall be made by the person responsible or liable therefore
under these provisions within 30 days after an itemized bill is sent to such
person by the borough. Upon failure to pay such charges within such time, the
same shall be collectible by the borough in the manner provided by law for the
collection of municipal claims.
   (M)   If more than one opening within 100 LF is made in a lane then the
entire lane is to be milled and paved with wearing course from opening to
opening.
(Ord. 2 of 2024, passed 11-11-2024)
§ 152.09 NOTICE.
   (A)   The Borough Council shall give timely notice to all persons owning
property abutting on any street within the borough about to be paved or
improved, and to all public utility companies operating in the borough and all
such persons and utility companies shall make all water, gas, storm or sanitary
sewer connections, as well as any repairs thereto which would necessitate
excavation of the said street within 30 days from the issuance of such notice,
unless such time is extended in writing for cause shown by the Borough Council.

completion thereof, except in case of emergency, the existence of which
emergency and the necessity for the opening of such paving to be determined by

emergency as herein stated, the applicant shall make written application to
Borough Council, and a permit for such opening shall only be issued after

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the commonwealth has, by the passage of the Floodplain
Management Act of 1978, Act of Oct. 4, 1978, P.L. 851, No. 166, 32 P.S. §§
679.101 et seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to
adopt floodplain management regulations to promote public health, safety and
the general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Council of the borough
does hereby order as follows.
(Prior Code, § 8-101) (Ord. 2010-10, passed 12-14-2010)
§ 153.002 INTENT.
   The intent of this chapter is to:
   (A)   Promote the general health, welfare and safety of the community;
   (B)   Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in
order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future;
   (C)   Minimize danger to public health by protecting the water supply and
natural drainage;
   (D)   Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units and its residents by preventing excessive development in areas subject to
flooding; and
   (E)   Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
(Prior Code, § 8-201) (Ord. 2010-10, passed 12-14-2010)
§ 153.003 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or
corporation to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or
development anywhere within the borough unless a permit has been obtained from
the Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing buildings
or structures.
(Prior Code, § 8-202) (Ord. 2010-10, passed 12-14-2010) Penalty, see §
153.999
§ 153.004 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in
effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance provisions
shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those provisions are
more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of
this chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
(Prior Code, § 8-203) (Ord. 2010-10, passed 12-14-2010)
§ 153.005 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   (A)   The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this
chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
acceptable engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and
bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that areas
which are outside any identified floodplain areas, or that land uses permitted
within such areas, will be free from flooding or flood damages.
   (B)   This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the borough or
any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance
on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Prior Code, § 8-204) (Ord. 2010-10, passed 12-14-2010)

improvement of a structure the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the
market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial
damage (or repetitive loss) regardless of the actual repair work performed.
         (b)   The term does not, however, include either:
            1.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
            2.   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure.
      VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications or
other evidence of compliance required in 44 C.F.R. § 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)

Stormwater Management Ordinance.”
(Ord. 2020-04, passed 1-11-2021; Ord. 2021-01, passed 8-9-2021)
§ 154.002 FINDINGS.
   (A)   Stormwater runoff from lands modified by human activities threatens
public health and safety by causing decreased infiltration of rainwater and
increased runoff flows and velocities, which overtaxes the carrying capacity of
existing streams and storm sewers, causes property damage and risks to public
safety and greatly increases the cost to the public to manage stormwater.
   (B)   Inadequate planning and management of accelerated stormwater runoff
resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can
also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns,
accelerating stream flows (which increases scour and erosion of stream beds and
stream banks, thereby elevating sedimentation), destroying aquatic habitats and
elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings, such as sediments,
nutrients, heavy metals and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted
through loss of recharge.
   (C)   The borough is located in the Kiskiminetas River watershed(s), and as
such, will endeavor to cooperate with other municipalities located in the
watershed(s) to address issues of stormwater management, water quality,
pollution and flooding.
   (D)   Non-stormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to the pollution of waters of the commonwealth in the borough.
   (E)   Stormwater can be an important water resource by providing groundwater
recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams, which also protects and
maintains surface water quality.
   (F)   Public education on the control of pollution of stormwater is an
essential component in successfully managing stormwater.
   (G)   A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including reasonable
regulation of land development and redevelopment causing loss of natural
infiltration, is fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare and the
protection of the people of the borough and all the people of the commonwealth,
their resources and the environment.
   (H)   (1)   The use of open space conservation, green infrastructure, low
impact development (LID) and riparian buffers are intended to address the root
cause of water quality impairment by using systems and practices which use or
mimic natural processes to:
         (a)   Infiltrate and recharge;
         (b)   Evapotranspire; and
         (c)   Harvest and use precipitation near where it falls to earth.
      (2)   Green infrastructure practices, LID and riparian buffers contribute
to the restoration or maintenance of pre-development hydrology.
   (I)   Stormwater structures are considered vital infrastructure and can pose
a significant hazard. Outlets and waterways which carry stormwater shall be
maintained free of obstructions to allow for the non-restricted flow of
stormwater to avoid the impoundment of water.
   (J)   Occupancy and modification of floodplains shall be avoided wherever
there is a practicable alternative to reduce long- and short-term adverse
impacts in order to reduce the risk of flood loss, minimize the impact of
floods on human safety, health and welfare and to restore and preserve the
natural and beneficial values served by floodplains.
   (K)   Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are required
to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their municipal separate
storm sewer systems (MS4) under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES). The borough is subject to MS4 requirements.
   (L)   The Westmoreland Conservation District (WCD) is a recognized
regulatory agency with authority in the county and in this borough to regulate
erosion and sediment controls and stormwater management related to land
development activities. Because the WCD’s authority crosses municipal
boundaries, the WCD is enabled to oversee environmental issues for the general
benefit of all county residents.
   (M)   (1)   The Westmoreland County Integrated Water Resources Plan (current
edition) addresses all water resources and provides a decision-making tool for
development and redevelopment with respect to those resources, including
stormwater and its management.
      (2)   Refer to www.paiwrp.com and www.westmorelandstormwater.org.
(Ord. 2020-04, passed 1-11-2021; Ord. 2021-01, passed 8-9-2021)
§ 154.003 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety and welfare within
the borough and its watersheds by minimizing the harms and maximizing the
benefits described in this section through provisions designed to:
   (A)   Manage stormwater runoff impacts at their source by regulating
activities that cause the problems, reduce runoff volumes and mimic natural
hydrology;
   (B)   Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses;
   (C)   Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and stream beds;
   (D)   Utilize and preserve the existing natural drainage systems as much as
possible;
   (E)   Restore and preserve the natural and beneficial values served by
stream-side and waterbody floodplains;
   (F)   Focus on the infiltration of stormwater to maintain groundwater
recharge, to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to
otherwise protect water resources;
   (G)   Promote stormwater runoff prevention and emphasize infiltration and
evapotranspiration through the protection and conservation of natural resource
systems and the use of non-structural BMPs and other creative methods of
improving water quality and managing stormwater runoff;
   (H)   Promote the use of green infrastructure in development and
redevelopment where it can also improve stormwater management within the
broader watershed in which the project is located;
   (I)   Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93.4a, to protect and maintain existing uses
and maintain the level of water quality to support those uses in all streams,
and to protect and maintain water quality in special protection streams;
   (J)   Provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management;
   (K)   Provide for proper operations and maintenance of all permanent
stormwater management BMPs that are implemented in the borough;
   (L)   Provide a mechanism to identify the controls necessary to meet the
NPDES and MS4 permit requirements, and to encourage infrastructure improvements
that lead to the separation of storm sewer systems from sanitary sewer systems;
and
   (M)   Assist in detecting and eliminating illicit stormwater discharges into
the borough’s separate storm sewer system.
(Ord. 2020-04, passed 1-11-2021; Ord. 2021-01, passed 8-9-2021)

district, the release rate shall be 80% (in areas not covered by a stormwater
performance district, an 80% release rate or less is recommended as a standard;
this is to apply a “factor of safety” to stormwater calculations, to account
for the many variables in site design and stormwater management and to avoid a
land development project inadvertently increasing runoff and causing harm
downstream) of the pre-development peak flow as set by the borough.

§ 154.027 EXEMPTIONS FROM PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (A)   The following regulated activities are specifically exempt from the
stormwater management plan preparation and submission requirements articulated
in this chapter:
      (1)   Agricultural activity limited to plowing or tilling activities, for
animal concentrated (heavy) use areas, provided the activities are performed
according to the requirements of Chapter 102, or conservation practices being
installed as part of the implementation of a conservation plan written by an
NRCS or SCS-certified planner. This exemption does not include any other type
of earth disturbance subject to NPDES permit requirements, such as earth
disturbance equal to or greater than one acre;
      (2)   A high tunnel, if proof is provided that the high tunnel is exempt
pursuant to the provisions of Act 15 of 2018. Such an exemption does not exempt
high tunnels from other requirements applicable under federal, state or
municipal laws;
      (3)   Forest management and timber operations, provided the activities
are performed according to the requirements of Chapter 102;
      (4)   Resource extraction activities, provided they are done in
accordance with applicable commonwealth DEP regulations;
      (5)   Roadway resurfacing and maintenance projects which do not increase
impervious area and underground infrastructure projects are exempt from the
provisions of this chapter, provided the activities meet the requirements of
all other municipal, state and federal requirements;
      (6)   Domestic landscaping and/or vegetable gardening; and
      (7)   Voluntary green infrastructure (GI), or the retrofit of stormwater
management infrastructure as conversion to green infrastructure BMPs to correct
existing problems, that are solely intended to better manage runoff from
existing development, are not part of new development or redevelopment and that
do not fall under the requirements of this chapter or other development
ordinances.
   (B)   The borough may deny or revoke any exemption pursuant to this section
at any time for any project that the borough believes may pose a threat to
public health, safety, property or the environment.
(Ord. 2020-04, passed 1-11-2021; Ord. 2021-01, passed 8-9-2021)
§ 154.028 NO-HARM OPTION.
   (A)   Applicants may request approval of a “no-harm option” regarding
stormwater management for their project. “No-harm option” requests must meet
the following criteria deemed appropriate by the borough and in compliance with
all commonwealth laws and regulations:
      (1)   Project located near or adjacent to significantly larger body of
water;
      (2)   Project able to discharge directly into existing flood-control
feature;
      (3)   Project of a small size (less than 3,000 square feet) for suburban
and rural of new impervious surface, or less than 5,000 square feet for
suburban and rural of land use changes. Refer to the Regulated Development
Activity Table in §
154.026 this chapter;
      (4)   Project will generate less than one-half cubic feet per second for
the ten-year storm peak rate increase as compared to the pre-development peak
rate;
      (5)   Project is not part of a larger development being “piecemealed” in
order to avoid stormwater management regulations;
      (6)   Project is not part of a larger development which has grown
“piecemeal” over the past five years without SWM;
      (7)   Project is a small percentage (less than 5%) of a much larger site
and is incidental to the much larger site;
      (8)   Project is not located in a neighborhood, watershed or location
where known stormwater problems exist, such as overland flooding like flooding
of structures or roadways;
      (9)   Project does not discharge to a combined sewer; and
      (10)   Project will not degrade water quality of the receiving stream.
Refer to the Westmoreland County Integrated Water Resources Plan,
www.westmorelandstormwater.org, for maps of impaired streams to determine if
the project area is not within an impaired stream corridor or provide
documentation that further degradation will not occur.
   (B)   (1)   To qualify for the “no-harm” option, the applicant may, at the
request of the borough, submit calculations, drawings and details showing that
the project meets the above criteria.
      (2)   Projects approved for the “no-harm” option may be exempted from
constructing all or some of the usual stormwater management practices regularly
required for similar projects.
   (C)   To be approved, no-harm requests must be reviewed and approved by both
the Borough Engineer and by the WCD, but final approval rests with the borough.
(Ord. 2020-04, passed 1-11-2021; Ord. 2021-01, passed 8-9-2021)
§ 154.029 WAIVERS; MODIFICATIONS; DEMONSTRATED EQUIVALENCY.
   (A)   (1)   If the borough, in conjunction with the Borough Engineer, WCD or
DEP, as applicable, determines that any requirement under this chapter cannot
be achieved for a particular regulated activity, the borough may, after an
evaluation of alternatives, approve measures other than those in this chapter,
subject to divisions (B), (C) and (D) below and in compliance with all
commonwealth laws and regulations.
      (2)   The request for a waiver, modification or demonstrated equivalency
shall originate with the landowner, shall be in writing, include a study of
downstream effects and accompany the stormwater management plan submission to
the borough. The request shall provide the facts on which the request is based,
the provision(s) of this chapter involved and the proposed modification or
demonstrated equivalency. The Borough Engineer and the WCD shall review the
request to determine if it meets the requirements of this chapter, including
divisions (B), (C) and (D) below. If acceptable to the borough and the WCD, and
the regulated stormwater activity involving earth disturbance is less than one
acre, the borough may grant the waiver or modification. If the regulated
stormwater activity involving earth disturbance is equal to or greater than one
acre, the plan will be subject to the NPDES requirements of the DEP.
   (B)   Waivers, modifications or demonstrated equivalency of the requirements
of this chapter may be approved by the borough if enforcement will exact undue
hardship because of unique physical circumstances or preexisting site
conditions peculiar to the land in question, provided that the modifications or
demonstrated equivalency will not be contrary or detrimental to the public
interest and shall achieve the intended outcome, and that the purpose of the
chapter is preserved. Hardship must be due to such unique physical
circumstances or preexisting site conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of this chapter, and there is no
possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of this chapter. Cost or financial burden shall not be considered a
hardship. Hardship cannot have been created by the landowner or developer.
Modification or demonstrated equivalency shall not substantially or permanently
impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property(s) not under the
landowner’s control. Modification or demonstrated equivalency may be considered
if an alternative standard or approach will provide equal or better achievement
of the purpose of this chapter.
   (C)   No waiver, modification or demonstrated equivalency of any regulated
stormwater activity involving earth disturbance greater than or equal to one
acre may be granted by the borough unless that action is approved in advance by
the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) or the Westmoreland
Conservation District (WCD).
   (D)   (1)   Applicants may request approval of a demonstrated equivalent
stormwater activity for their project in lieu of performing traditional
stormwater management. Demonstrated equivalent stormwater activity requests
will be evaluated by the Borough Engineer and/or the WCD on a case-by-case
basis. Prior approval of a demonstrated equivalent stormwater activity on a
site does not set a precedent for future approval of the same or other
alternative activities on any site. The approval of a demonstrated equivalent
stormwater activity does not excuse the applicant from following standard E&S
and SWM practices as applicable on the original site.
      (2)   Demonstrated equivalent stormwater activities shall only be
approved when the following criteria are met:
         (a)   Traditional stormwater management activities on the site are
precluded by a particular site limitation, such as contaminated soil, steep
slopes, existing buildings/infrastructure or combined sewer;
         (b)   Construction of traditional stormwater management activities on
the site would require extra permits or lead to excessive permitting activities
and delays;
         (c)   The site in question does not already have a stormwater
management problem; and
         (d)   The site in question is not already contributing to water
quality problems in the receiving stream.
      (3)   Approvable demonstrated equivalent stormwater activities may
include the following:
         (a)   Restoration of an existing degraded wetland, stream channel,
floodplain or riparian buffer, including the daylighting of a stream;
         (b)   Restoration, retrofit or upgrade an existing stormwater
management feature (an inadequate detention pond, for example);
         (c)   Creation of new stormwater management features, especially green
infrastructure, for a previously unmanaged site;
         (d)   Provide a water-based benefit to the public other than
stormwater management (for example, extend a public sewer to an area not
already served); or
         (e)   Treatment of abandoned mine drainage.
      (4)   The proposal for demonstrated equivalency shall be accompanied by
documentation or methodology quantifying the equivalency of the proposed
project to what would have been originally required. Acceptable documentation
or methodology may include use of the worksheets and checklist found in the
Commonwealth DEP NPDES permit application, Appendix D of this chapter, or an
approved method showing the proposed equivalency:
         (a)   Controls approximately the same amount of runoff volume as what
would originally have been proposed;
         (b)   Improves approximately the same amount of runoff quality as
would have been originally proposed; or
         (c)   Is located within an impaired watershed or stream segment which
will benefit from the proposed project. IMPAIRMENT may include stream
impairment, reduced stream buffer and pollutant loading. Refer to the
Westmoreland County Integrated Water Resources Plan, which is available at
www.westmorelandstormwater.org.
      (5)   The demonstrated equivalent stormwater activity shall:
         (a)   Be constructed concurrently with the project for which it is
being applied;
         (b)   Be constructed according to plans approved by the borough and
the WCD, including any erosion control and stormwater management practices, as
applicable;
         (c)   Obtain all necessary permits;
         (d)   Be located on land owned by or controlled by the applicant or by
a cooperating public or private entity(s) (a school, church, club, municipality
and the like);
         (e)   Be protected by a perpetual easement or deed restriction, or
landowner agreement;
         (f)   Be located in the same general watershed as project for which it
is being applied; and
         (g)   Have an operation and maintenance plan (O&M) specifying who is
responsible for what tasks.

§ 154.030 SMALL PROJECTS.
   (A)   When a regulated development activity (refer to the table in §
154.026 of this chapter) creates an impervious area between 3,000 and 10,000
square feet, or total earth disturbance between 5,000 and 20,000 square feet,
the stormwater management requirements are as follows. Refer also to Appendix C
of this chapter.
   (B)   For new impervious surfaces, the first one inch(s) of runoff shall be
permanently removed from the runoff flow and shall not be released to waters of
the commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation, transpiration and
infiltration.
   (C)   Facilities, to the greatest extent possible and subject to borough
approval, shall be designed to drain the permanently removed runoff volume in a
period not greater than 72 hours. Runoff volumes in excess of one inch(s) shall
be safely conveyed to a stable vegetated area, natural watercourse, the curb or
gutter line of the roadway or the existing storm collection/conveyance/control
system, as applicable.
   (D)   This method is exempt from the requirements of §
154.051 of this chapter.
   (E)   A small project stormwater management plan must be submitted to the
borough and the WCD and shall consist of the following items and related
support material needed to determine compliance with §§
154.031 to
154.035 of this chapter. The applicant can also use protocols listed in
Appendix C of this chapter.
         (a)   Narrative. General description of proposed stormwater management
techniques, including calculations, assumptions and criteria used in the design
of the stormwater management facilities and BMPs, and construction
specifications of the materials to be used for stormwater management facilities
and BMPs;
         (b)   Stormwater management plan. Showing locations of all stormwater
management facilities and BMPs, especially green infrastructure, limits of
disturbance, including the type and amount of proposed impervious areas,
structures, roads, paved areas and buildings;
         (c)   Worksheet. Small project stormwater management worksheet;
         (d)   Signature. Signed agreement page for operation and maintenance
of stormwater facilities and BMPs (refer to Appendix B of this chapter); and
         (e)   Erosion and sediment control plan. Include all reviews and
letters of adequacy from the Conservation District.

§ 154.031 STANDARDS GENERALLY.
   (A)   Proposed land development must consider avoiding, minimizing and
mitigating impacts to the site that may increase stormwater runoff from the
proposed project. Applied sequentially, these three low-impact development
strategies should be an overall guide as a project is planned and carried out.
   (B)   (1)   The Westmoreland County Integrated Water Resources Plan provides
an online decision making tool to assist developers, designers and property
owners in addressing all water resources during development and redevelopment
and should be consulted.
      (2)   Refer to www.paiwrp.com and to www.westmorelandstormwater.org.
   (C)   The following provisions shall be considered the overriding
performance standards against which all proposed stormwater control measures
shall be evaluated and shall apply throughout the borough.
      (1)   (a)   Any landowner and any person engaged in the alteration or
development of land which may affect stormwater runoff characteristics shall
implement such measures as are reasonably necessary to prevent injury to
health, safety or other property. For alteration or development taking place in
stages, the cumulative development must be used in determining conformance with
this chapter.
         (b)   Such measures shall include such actions as are required:
            1.   To assure that the maximum rate of stormwater runoff is no
greater after development, as calculated using the standards in this chapter,
than prior to development activities for the two-, ten-, 50- and 100-year
storms. Rainfall data shall be obtained from NOAA Atlas 14, or other source
approved by the borough;
            2.   To manage the water quality, rate and volume and direction of
resulting stormwater runoff in a manner which otherwise adequately protects
health and property from possible injury; and
            3.   To notify adjacent property owners or owners of affected
properties of any alteration or increase of stormwater flows.
      (2)   Runoff treatment BMPs must be employed where necessary to ensure
the water quality, rate and volume requirements are met.
      (3)   Volume control BMPs shall be used to maintain existing hydrologic
conditions for small storm events by promoting groundwater recharge and/or
evapotranspiration. Runoff volume controls shall be implemented using the
Commonwealth DEP Stormwater BMP Manual, 2006, or other approved method such as
those listed in the following chart.

   (D)   The project plan shall specify permanent stormwater BMPs to be
implemented, operated and maintained to meet legal water quality, rate and
volume requirements. If methods other than low-impact development (LID) and
green infrastructure methods are proposed to achieve the volume and rate
controls required under this chapter, the SWM site plan must include a detailed
justification demonstrating that the use of LID and green infrastructure is not
practicable.
   (E)   (1)   In order to protect and maintain water quality, additional
stormwater runoff created by the development project must be captured, stored
and treated. In addition, post construction stormwater infiltration of runoff
must replicate the preconstruction infiltration of runoff to the maximum extent
possible, with the exception of hot spots. As a minimum, this shall be a volume
of additional runoff generated by a two-year, 24-hour storm.
      (2)   Preferred BMPs for a hot spot include storm inlet filters,
proprietary stormwater quality devices, underground detention tanks, detention
ponds with forebays, tree planting and green roof. Permeable pavement,
infiltration BMPs and rain gardens are not recommended for hotspots.
   (F)   In addition to the provisions set forth in divisions (A) through(D)
above, inclusive, as set forth above, all regulated development activities
within the borough shall be designed, implemented, operated and maintained to
meet the purposes of this chapter through these two elements:
      (1)   Erosion and sediment control during the earth disturbance
activities (e.g., during construction); and
      (2)   Water quality, rate and volume protection measures after completion
of earth disturbance activities (e.g., post-construction stormwater
management), including operations and maintenance.
   (G)   No regulated development activities within the borough shall commence
until the requirements of this chapter are met.
   (H)   All best management practices (BMPs) used to meet the requirements of
this chapter shall conform to the state water quality requirements, and any
more stringent requirements as determined by the borough.
   (I)   LID and green infrastructure techniques described in the PA DEP
Stormwater BMP Manual, 2006, or most current edition, are encouraged.
   (J)   Projects proposed in municipalities which are subject to the MS4
regulations must comply with that municipality’s approved MS4 permit, including
compliance with the six minimum control measures (MCMs) and with the
municipality’s pollutant reduction plan (PRP).

§ 154.032 WATERSHED STANDARDS.
   (A)   The stormwater management performance standards in this chapter are
intended to implement the provisions, standards and criteria contained in the
Stormwater Management Act (Act 167), the Act of Oct. 4, 1978, P.L. 851, 32 P.S.
§§ 680.1 et seq. If there is any discrepancy between the provisions of this
chapter and the provisions, standards and criteria of the Act, or if a
stormwater management plan is subsequently approved and adopted by the
appropriate governmental agency or body, then the provisions, standards and
criteria of the current watershed plan shall govern.
   (B)   The management of stormwater runoff is the key objective of 25 Pa.
Code Chapter 93 of the DEP regulations because runoff can change the physical,
chemical and biological integrity of waterbodies, thereby impacting rate,
volume and water quality.
   (C)   The project plan shall describe how these rate, volume and water
quality protection requirements will be met. Infiltration BMPs shall be
evaluated and utilized to the maximum extent possible to manage the net change
in stormwater runoff generated so that post construction discharges do not
degrade the physical, chemical or biological characteristics of the receiving
waters. These BMPs may be used to satisfy all or part of the requirements found
within this chapter.

§ 154.033 DESIGN CRITERIA FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FACILITIES, BMPS.
   (A)   General criteria.
      (1)   Applicants may select runoff control techniques, or a combination
of techniques, which are most suitable to control stormwater runoff from the
development site. Refer to the Acceptable Computation Methodologies for
Stormwater Management Plans Table in §
154.031 of this chapter. All controls must be subject to the approval of the
Borough Engineer and the WCD. The Borough Engineer may request specific
information on design and/or operating features of the proposed stormwater
controls in order to determine their suitability and adequacy in terms of the
standards of this chapter.
      (2)   If the proposed development site is located in an impaired water
shed according to Category 4 of the Commonwealth Integrated Water Quality
Monitoring and Assessment Report, or in a watershed with a TMDL according to
Category 5 of the same report, the applicant shall identify the source and
cause of impairment and shall propose, if required or applicable, the use of
BMPs to mitigate any impacts to the waters.
      (3)   The applicant should consider the effect of the proposed stormwater
management techniques on any special soil conditions or geological hazards

100-year storm frequencies. Rainfall data shall be obtained from NOAA Atlas 14,
or other source as approved by the borough.
      (2)   All stormwater management facilities and BMPs shall be equipped
with outlet/overflow structures to provide rate discharge control for the
designated storm frequencies. Provision shall also be made to safely pass the
entire post-development 100-year storm without breaching or otherwise damaging
the facilities, downstream or neighboring properties.
      (3)   Release of stormwater flow from a development site must be to an
existing stormwater conveyance or easement, whether natural or human-made.
Calculations and information shall be presented as to the ownership,
responsible party, capacity and stability of such conveyance. The release of
“sheet flow,” as from a level spreader, will be permitted on a case-by-case
basis as approved by the borough and WCD.
      (4)   All stormwater management facilities and BMPs shall be designed to
control volume and water quality as defined by the stormwater management
performance district.
      (5)   Shared stormwater management facilities and BMPs which provide
control of runoff for more than one development site within a single subarea
may be considered and are encouraged. Such facilities shall meet the criteria
contained in this section. In addition, runoff from the development sites
involved shall be conveyed to the facility in a manner that avoids adverse
impacts (such as flooding or erosion) to channels and properties located
between the development site and the shared storage facilities.
      (6)   Where stormwater management facilities and BMPs will be utilized,
multiple use facilities, such as wetlands, lakes, ballfields or similar
recreational/open space uses, are encouraged wherever feasible, subject to the
approval of the borough.
      (7)   Other considerations which shall be incorporated into the design of
the stormwater management facilities and BMPs include:

STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN REQUIREMENTS
§ 154.050 REQUIREMENTS GENERALLY.
   (A)   No development plan, subdivision plat or land development plan shall
be approved; no permit authorizing construction or development issued; nor any
earth disturbance activity subject to this chapter shall be initiated or
undertaken unless and until a stormwater management plan for such activity is
reviewed and approved in accord with the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   No regulated development activities within the borough shall commence
until approval by the borough of a stormwater management plan which
demonstrates compliance with state water quality requirements after
construction is complete. Refer to the Regulated Development Activity Table
located in §
154.026 of this chapter.
   (C)   The stormwater management plan must be designed, implemented and
maintained to meet state water quality requirements, and any other more
stringent requirements as determined by the borough.
   (D)   (1)   To control post-construction stormwater impacts from regulated
development activities, state water quality requirements can be met by BMPs,
including site design and green infrastructure, which provide for the
replication of pre-construction stormwater infiltration and runoff conditions,
so that post-construction stormwater discharges do not degrade the physical,
chemical or biological characteristics of the receiving waters.
      (2)   As described in the DEP Comprehensive Stormwater Management Policy
(#392-0300-002, September 28, 2002), this may be achieved by the following:
         (a)   Infiltration. Replication of pre-construction stormwater
infiltration conditions;
         (b)   Treatment. Use of water quality treatment BMPs to ensure
filtering out of the chemical and physical pollutants from the stormwater
runoff; and
         (c)   Streambank and streambed protection. Management of volume and
rate of post-construction stormwater discharges, using detention/retention and
other means, to prevent physical degradation of receiving waters (e.g., from
scouring).
   (E)   In the absence of an existing stormwater conveyance or easement,
whether natural or human-made, for the release of stormwater flow from a
development site, an easement must be provided. Information shall be presented
as to the ownership, responsible party and agreement for said easement.
   (F)   The stormwater management plan must meet DEP regulations that require
municipalities to ensure design, implementation and maintenance of best
management practices (BMPs) that control runoff from new development and
redevelopment after regulated development activities are complete. These
requirements include the need to implement post-construction stormwater
facilities and BMPs with assurance of long-term operations and maintenance of
those BMPs.
   (G)   Evidence of any necessary permit(s), such as Chapter 102, erosion and
sedimentation control, or Chapter 105, stream encroachment, for regulated
development activities from the WCD or the appropriate DEP regional office must
be provided to the borough. The issuance of an NPDES construction permit (or
permit coverage under the Statewide General Permit (PAG-2) may satisfy the
requirements of division (A) above after review and approval by the borough.
   (H)   Appropriate sections from the borough’s Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance (SALDO), and other applicable local ordinances, shall be
followed in preparing the SWM plans. In instances where the borough lacks
subdivision and land development regulations, SWM plans shall be reviewed and
approved pursuant to the county’s Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance
(SALDO). If the county’s SALDO does not have provisions for review and approval
of SWM plans, the SWM plans must be reviewed and approved pursuant to the
borough’s SWM ordinance.
   (I)   The borough shall not approve any SWM plan that is deficient in
meeting the requirements of this chapter. At its sole discretion and in
accordance with §§
154.050 to
154.054 of this chapter, when an SWM plan is found to be deficient, the borough
may either disapprove the submission and require a resubmission or, in the case
of minor deficiencies, the borough may accept the submission of modifications.
   (J)   The stormwater management plan (including all calculations) must be
prepared and sealed by a qualified professional with training and expertise in
hydrology and hydraulics. Documentation of qualifications may be required by
the borough.

APPENDIX A: NO-HARM PROJECT FORM
 
The following worksheet is to be used to estimate the change in the ten year
storm peak rate between developed and existing conditions to determine if a
regulated activity qualifies as “No-Harm”. The maximum new impervious area
qualifying for the No-Harm option is 3,000 square feet.
Methodology:
The worksheet is generated using NkCS Technical Release 55 (TR-55) Graphical
Peak Discharge method as described in Chapter 4 of TR-55. The calculations on
the following worksheet incorporate the following assumptions and methods:
•   Rainfall (P) for 10 year, 24 hour storm event in Oklahoma Borough = 4
in      (Fig B-5, TR-55)
•   NRCS Rainfall Distribution Type II                     (Fig B-2, TR-55)
•   Three Hydrologic Groups are considered for the simplified runoff
calculation within Oklahoma Borough; A, B, and Other. The Other category
includes C and D as well as all combination hydrologic groups (such as A/D). A
representative curve number was chosen for the Other category between the
values for groups C and D given in Table 2-2 of TR-55.
•   Curve Numbers                              (Tables 2-2 a-c, TR-55)

Wooded        43 65 80
Paved/Rooftop 98 98 98
Gravel        76 85 90
•   Runoff values taken from Table 2-1, TR-55 using the above curve numbers and
a rainfall of 4 inches.
•   Initial abstraction (Ia) based on the above curve numbers.            
(Table 4-1, TR-55)

75  0.667 98 0.041
 
* When Curve number falls outside of chart, chart limits were used.
•   Assume 6 minute Time of concentration (Tc) for project areas under 3,000 sf
•   The unit peak discharges (qu) were interpolated using the Initial
abstraction – Rainfall ratios (Ia/P) and Time of concentration were
interpolated using exhibit 4-II, TR-55. The limiting values of 550 and 1,000
csm/in are assumed for Initial abstraction – Rainfall ratios outside the range
shown on the exhibit, per TR-55 Chapter 4 guidance.
Instructions:
1.   Enter Proposed New impervious area in Box 1.
Impervious area is defined as a surface that prevents the infiltration of water
into the ground. Impervious surface includes, but is not limited to, any roof,
parking or driveway areas, and any new streets and sidewalks. Any surface areas
designed to initially be gravel or crushed stone shall be assumed to be
impervious surfaces, unless demonstrated otherwise in an approved stormwater
management plan. Any surface, gravel or otherwise used for permanent or
temporary storage of vehicles, containers, solar arrays or other similar items
shall be considered impervious or at a minimum the impervious area shall be
measured as the total impervious surface of the combined footprint of the
vehicles, containers, solar arrays and other similar items based on a
reasonable assumption of capacity at that site.
2.   Determine the Hydrologic Soil Group (HSG).
3.   Write the existing cover type in Box 2. Find the Cover Type from the table
on the worksheet that most clearly matches the existing conditions of the
project area.
4.   Write the runoff value in Box 3. Find the Runoff from the table on the
worksheet that matches both the Hydrologic Soil Group and the existing cover
type entered in Box 2.
5.   Write the Unit Peak Discharge value in Box 4. Find the Unit Peak Discharge
from the table on the worksheet that matches both the Hydrologic Soil Group and
the existing cover type entered in Box 2.
6.   Multiply Boxes 1, 3, and 4 then divide the result by 27,878,400 and place
the value in Box 5, Peak Discharge. This value is the existing peak discharge.
7.   Write the proposed cover type in Box 6. Find the Cover Type from the table
on the worksheet that most closely matches the proposed conditions of the
project area.
8.   Write the runoff value in Box 7. Find the Runoff from the table on the
worksheet that matches both the Hydrologic Soil Group and the proposed cover
type entered in Box 6.
9.   Write the Unit Peak Discharge value in Box 8. Find the Unit Peak Discharge
from the table on the worksheet that matches both the Hydrologic Soil Group and
the proposed cover type entered in Box 2.
10.   Multiply Boxes 1,7 and 8 then divide the result by 27,878,400 and place
the value in Box 9, Peak Discharge. This value is the proposed peak discharge.
11.   Subtract the existing peak discharge from the proposed peak discharge
(Box 9 – Box 5) and place the result in Box 10.
12.   If the value in Box 10 is less than or equal to 0.5, the project meets
the rate increase criteria for the No-Harm option, § 154.028 of the Oklahoma
Borough Code of Ordinances.
Example:
The next sheet shows an example for a fictional project proposing to place a
2,500 square foot workshop/garage in an area within Hydrologic Soil Group A on
a currently wooded portion of their parcel. In the example, the rate increase
is less than 0.5 cfs, therefore the rate increase meets the criteria for the
No-Harm Option.

APPENDIX C: SMALL PROJECT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SITE PLAN AND WORKSHEET
 
Oklahoma Borough
SMALL PROJECT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN
This small project stormwater management plan has been developed to assist
those proposing residential projects to meet the requirements of the Oklahoma
Borough Stormwater Management Ordinance (SWO) without having to draft a formal
stormwater management plan. This small project stormwater management plan is
only permitted for projects with new impervious area between 3,000 and 10,000
square feet, or total earth disturbance between 5,000 and 20,000 square feet,
(Section 302 Regulated Development Activity Table of the SWO) and by using the
recommendations in this Appendix for Volume Control. Additional information can
be found in Chapter 6 of the PA SW BMP Manual 2006 or most recent version.
A.   What is an applicant required to submit?
All requirements of Section 306 of the Oklahoma Borough Stormwater Management
Ordinance, including:
   •   A narrative including a brief description of the proposed stormwater
facilities and BMPs, types of materials to be used, total square footage of
proposed impervious areas, volume calculations;
   •   A sketch plan showing location of existing and proposed structures,
driveways, or other paved areas with approximate surface area in square feet;
location of any existing or proposed utilities, especially onsite septic system
and/or potable water wells showing proximity to infiltration facilities,
location and dimensions of all proposed stormwater facilities and BMPs;
   •   Small Project Stormwater Management Worksheet;
   •   Signed agreement page for installation, operation and maintenance of
stormwater facilities and BMPs (Refer to Appendix B); and
   •   Conservation District erosion and sediment control “Adequacy” letter as
required by Municipal, County or State regulations;
B.   Determination of Required Control Volume and Sizing Stormwater Facilities
and BMPs
By following the simple steps outlined below in the provided example and Small
Project Stormwater Management Worksheet, an applicant can determine the runoff
volume that is required to be controlled and how to choose the appropriate
stormwater facility or BMP to permanently remove the runoff volume from the
site. Impervious area calculations must include all areas on the lot proposed
to be covered by roof area or pavement which would prevent rain from naturally
percolating into the ground, including proposed impervious surfaces such as
sidewalks, driveways, parking areas, patios or swimming pools. NOTE: Sidewalks,
driveways or patios that are designed and constructed to allow for infiltration
(permeable paving systems) are not included in this calculation.

Step 1: Determine Total Impervious Surfaces and Required Control Volume:
TABLE I: Example
 
New        Dimensions Area
Impervious (width x   in   1” storm Multiplier  Required Control Volume 1” in
Surface    length)    SF   (0.083)                CF
           (FT)
Garage     20’ x 40800  0.167                  133 CF
Roof                  SF
Driveway   20’ x 20400  0.167                  67 CF
Court                 SF
Driveway   12’ x 50600  0.167                  100 CF
                      SF
                    SF                         CF
                    SF                         CF
                    SF                         CF
 
Total Required Control Volume (enter in Table 2):
                                                           300 CF
In Table 1, as in the example above and as shown on the Figure 1 example sketch
plan, list each of the new improvements that create impervious area on the
property along with their dimensions and total area in square feet in the first
three columns. Then, depending on the design storm required by the
municipality, multiply the area in square feet by the design storm multiplier
to determine required control volume and list in the last column. Add each of
the required control volumes together to equal the Total Required Control
Volume and enter in Table 2.
Step 2: Sizing the Selected Volume Control BMP(s)
Several Best Management Practices (BMPs) are suitable for small stormwater
management projects. However, their application depends on the volume required
to be controlled, how much land is available, and the site constraints.
Proposed residential development activities can apply both nonstructural and
structural BMPs to control the volume of runoff from the site. A number of
these different volume control BMPs are described below. Note that Figure 1 is
an example of how these BMPs can be utilized on a property to control the total
required control volume.
Credit can be taken for non-structural best management practices (BMPs) on a
site to reduce the total volume required to be controlled. Credits must follow
the requirements listed in this Appendix. Fill out Table 2 with proposed non-
structural BMP credits and structural BMP control volumes entered in Tables 6
and 10 to meet the total required control volume.
TABLE 2: Example
 
Required Control Volume (Table 1)            300 CF
Non-structural BMP Credit (Table 6)          137 CF
Adjusted Required Control Volume             163 CF
(after credits) (Table 1 - Table 6)
Structural BMP Control Volume (Table 10)     202 CF
TOTAL Volume Controlled (Table 6 + Table 10) 338 CF
 
NOTE: Total Volume Controlled shall be greater than or equal to Required
Control Volume.
Step 3: Choosing and Measuring Non-Structural BMPs
   1.   Tree Planting and Preservation
Trees and forests reduce stormwater by capturing, storing and evapotranspiring
rainfall through their roots and leaves. Tree roots and leaf litter also create
soil conditions that promote infiltration of rainwater into the soil and that
breakdown excessive nutrients and pollutants. For more information refer to the
PA DEP BMP Manual 5.6.3.
   Considerations for credit:
    •   New tree plantings must be at least 6 feet in height and have at least
a 2 inch caliper trunk, and the quantity entered in Table 3
   •   New tree plantings must be native to Pennsylvania. Refer to http://
www.dcnr.pa.gov/Conservation/WildPlants/Pages/default.aspx
   •   Existing trees must have at least a 4” caliper trunk, and must be
located within 100 feet of impervious surfaces
   •   Measure existing tree canopy by determining the square foot area covered
within the drip line of the tree(s), and enter the area in Table 4
   •   Site runoff should be directed via sheet flow to the area(s) of trees
being used for volume control
TABLE 3: New Tree(s)
 
New Trees Volume Control Multiplier Tree Quantity Volume Controlled (CF)
Deciduous 6 CF                      2             12 CF

2. Minimize Soil Compaction and Revegetate (lawn or meadow seeding)
When soil is overly compacted during construction it can cause a drastic
reduction in the permeability of the soil and rarely is the soil profile
completely restored. Runoff from overly compacted vegetated areas can resemble
increased runoff from impervious areas. Minimizing soil compaction during the
construction process, or restoring and amending compacted soils and
revegetating them after construction can greatly increase natural infiltration
on a site. For more information refer to the PA DEP BMP Manual 5.6.2 and 5.6.3.
   Considerations for credit:
    •   Area(s) shall not be stripped of topsoil and areas shall be protected
from construction vehicles and lay down space with construction fencing or
mats. Enter square foot area in Table 5.
   •   Soil ripping and soil amendments can be used to restore the soils
   •   Vegetation should be used, especially native plants and meadow mixes as
an alternative to lawn

TOTAL (enter in Table 2)  137 CF
 
Step 5: Choosing and Sizing Structural BMPs
1.   Infiltration Trench
An infiltration trench is a linear stormwater management BMP consisting of a
continuously perforated pipe at a minimum slope in a stone-filled trench.
During small storm events, infiltration trenches can significantly reduce
volume and serve in the removal of fine sediments and pollutants. Runoff is
stored in the pipe and between the stones and infiltrates through the bottom of
the facility and into the surrounding soil matrix. Runoff should be pretreated
using vegetative buffer strips or swales to limit the amount of coarse sediment
entering the trench which can clog and render the trench ineffective. In all
cases, an infiltration trench should be designed with a positive overflow to a
stable outlet point. For more information refer to the PA DEP BMP Manual 6.4.4.
Design Considerations:
    •   Continuously perforated pipe (min 4” diameter) set at a minimum slope
(1%) in a stone filled, nearly level-bottomed trench on un-compacted soils.
   •   The trench width and depth can vary, but it is recommended that
infiltration trenches be no wider than four (4) feet, and a minimum of thirty
(30) inches and maximum six (6) feet in depth.
   •   Stone fill should be clean, angular stone, separated from soil layers by
four (4) inches of straw (top and bottom) or a nonwoven geotextile (top, sides,
and bottom).
   •   A minimum of 6” of topsoil can be placed over trench and vegetated.
   •   Cleanouts or inlets should be installed at both ends and at
intersections of the infiltration trench and at appropriate intervals to allow
access to the perforated pipe.
   •   The discharge or outlet from the infiltration trench should be safely
conveyed to a stable vegetated area, natural watercourse, the curb or gutter
line of roadway or existing storm collection/conveyance/control system as
applicable.
   •   Volume of facility = Depth x Width x Length x Void Space of the gravel
bed (assume 40%).
Maintenance:
   •   Cleanouts, catch basins and inlets should be inspected at least two
times a year and cleaned out as necessary to maintain function of the system.
   •   The vegetation along the surface of the infiltration trench should be
maintained in good condition and any bare spots should be re-vegetated as soon
as possible.
   •   Vehicles should not be parked or driven on the trench and care should be
taken to avoid soil compaction by lawn mowers.

2.   Rain Garden
A rain garden is a landscaped shallow depression that uses mulch, soil mix, and
deep rooted plants to capture, adsorb and infiltrate stormwater runoff from
roofs, and pavement. For more information refer to the PA DEP BMP Manual 6.4.5.
Design considerations:
    •   A rain garden should be located on nearly level to gently sloping
ground and no closer than 10 feet to a building foundation and 25 feet from
septic field or wellhead.
   •   A rain garden can vary in length, width and depth, but should have a
ponding depth of 6 to 12 inches, and a total surface depth of no greater than
18 inches.
   •   Side slopes within the garden should not exceed 3:1 horizontal to
vertical.
   •   The rain garden should be constructed in layers with a (min. 4”)
perforated underdrain in a clean angular stone envelope, separated from soil
layers by four (4) inches of straw (top and bottom) or a nonwoven geotextile
(top, sides, and bottom), covered with 12 inches to 36 inches of 50-30-20
topsoil-sand-compost mix or as approved by the municipality, and 3 inches of
shredded bark mulch or vegetated cover. Soil depth should be determined by
plant choices and control volume requirements.
   •   Vegetation should be deep rooted and tolerant of wet and dry conditions,
salts and environmental stress.
   •   An emergency overflow should be set in the rain garden such as a
vertical pipe or inlet box, with basket type grate set even with the ponding
depth, below the surrounding ground elevation and connected to the perforated
underdrain and an outlet pipe.
   •   The outlet from the rain garden should be safely conveyed to a stable
vegetated area, natural watercourse, the curb or gutter line of roadway or
existing storm collection/conveyance/control system as applicable.
Maintenance:
   •   Cleanouts, catch basins and inlets should be inspected at least two
times a year and cleaned out as necessary to maintain function of the system.
Detritus should be removed from the rain garden as necessary to prevent
clogging of the overflow outlet.
   •   The vegetation should be maintained in good condition and replaced as
necessary. Rain garden plants may need to be watered during dry spells.
   •   Rain garden should be weeded and shredded bark mulch should be amended
as necessary to prevent volunteer weeds.

3.   Dry Well/Seepage Pit
A dry well or seepage pit is a subsurface storage facility that temporarily
stores stormwater runoff from roofs and infiltrates it into the surrounding
soils. Roof downspouts connect directly to a dry well or seepage pit that is an
excavated pit filled with clean angular stone with an overflow pipe to ensure
the system will not be overwhelmed. Prefabricated chamber systems or perforated
pipe sections are commercially available for use as dry wells and should be
designed, constructed and maintained according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. For more information on dry wells and seepage pits refer to
the PA DEP BMP Manual 6.4.6.
Design considerations:
    •   A dry well/seepage pit should be located on nearly level to gently
sloping ground and no closer than 10 feet to a building foundation and 25 feet
from septic field or wellhead.
   •   A dry well/seepage pit can vary in length, width and depth, but should
be a minimum depth of 3 feet.
   •   A downspout should direct water to the surface, a system of perforated
pipes should distribute the water throughout the system with an inspection/
cleanout pipe to the surface, and an overflow pipe should outlet excess water
during intense storms.
   •   The storage system can be clean angular stone, separated from soil
layers by four (4) inches of straw (top and bottom) or a nonwoven geotextile
(top, sides, and bottom).
   •   The outlet from the dry well/seepage pit should be safely conveyed to a
stable vegetated area, natural watercourse, the curb or gutter line of roadway
or existing storm collection/conveyance/control system as applicable.
Maintenance:
   •   Drywells and seepage pits should be inspected at least 4 times a year,
and after each storm event exceeding 1 inch.
   •   Remove sediment, debris, detritus and any other waste material from the
system as necessary.
   •   Regularly clean out gutters and downspouts to ensure proper connections
and to maintain effectiveness of the system.
   •   Replace any filter screen or clean out any sump box that may intercept
roof runoff as necessary.

4.   Alternative BMP Capture and Re-Use (rain barrel/cistern)
Rain barrels and cisterns are above or below ground containers used for
temporary storage of rainwater, to be used for landscape irrigation and other
similar uses after the rain has ended. A rain barrel or cistern cannot be used
as a volume control because infiltration is not guaranteed after a storm event,
but they are viable alternative method to capture and reuse stormwater.
Considerations:
       •   Rain barrels and cisterns should be directly connected to a
downspout with a mosquito screen
      •   There should be a means to release the water after a storm event to
provide storm volume for the next event
      •   An overflow, near the top of the container should direct water to a
vegetated area away from any structures
      •   Barrels can be connected in series to provide more volume collection

recreation areas in the developer’s subdivision or land development plan:
      (1)   Site or sites should be easily and safely accessible from all areas
of the development to be served, handy to good ingress and egress, and have
access to a public road; however, no public road shall traverse the site or
sites;
      (2)   Site or sites should have suitable topography and soil conditions
for use and development as a recreation area;
      (3)   Size and shape for the site or sites should be suitable for
development as a particular type of park. Sites will be categorized by the
borough using the standards established by the National Recreation and Parks
Association (Publication No. 10005, latest edition);
      (4)   When designing and developing these recreation areas, it shall be
done according to the standards established by the National Recreation and
Parks Association, copies of which may be obtained from the Borough Office;
      (5)   Site or sites should, to the greatest extent practical, be easily
accessible to essential utilities, water, sewer and power;
      (6)   Site or sites should meet minimum size in respect to usable acreage
with respect to National Recreation and Parks Association standards, with 75%
of such area having a maximum slope of 7%; and
      (7)   Site or sites should be compatible with the objectives, guidelines
and recommendations as set forth in the Borough Comprehensive Plan.
   (E)   Dedication to borough.
      (1)   In a case where the developer does not wish to retain the required
recreation area, such area may be dedicated to the borough for public use.
      (2)   Such area dedicated to the borough for public use shall be suitable
for recreational purposes by reason of size, shape, location, topography and
access.
      (3)   The Planning Commission, after having conferred with the
Development Review Committee and the Recreation Commission, may find dedication
to be impractical because of the size, shape, location, access, topography,
drainage or other physical features of the land, and that such dedication would
adversely affect the subdivision of land development and its future residents
or occupants, or that there is no land area within the proposed subdivision
which is practical for dedication to the public because of size, access,
topography or other physical characteristics.
      (4)   If and when the Council deems it to be in the public interest to
accept dedicated land, such acceptance shall be by means of a signed resolution
to which the property description of the dedicated recreation area shall be
attached.
   (F)   Fee in lieu of dedication.
      (1)   Where the Borough Council agrees with the developer that, because
of the size, shape, location, access, topography or other physical features of
the land, it is impractical to dedicate land to the borough or set aside a
recreation area as required by this chapter, the Council shall require the
payment of a fee in lieu of dedication of such land, which shall be payable to
the borough prior to the approval of each final section of the overall plan by
the Council.
      (2)   The calculation of the recreation fee shall be as follows.
         (a)   Four hundred dollars shall be due per equivalent dwelling unit.
“Equivalent dwelling unit” shall utilize the same or similar definition used in
the Borough Sewage Ordinance (Chapter 51 of this code). Equivalent dwelling
unit applies to:
            1.   Residential equivalent dwelling units; and
            2.   Commercial or industrial equivalent dwelling units.
         (b)   Where there are no proposed dwelling units at the moment of the
subdivision approval, each subdivided parcel created shall be counted as one
unit, wherein $400 shall be required for each parcel. In the event dwelling
units are thereafter placed on said parcel, then $400 per equivalent dwelling
unit shall be due for each equivalent dwelling unit developed on each created
parcel, with credit for each parcel previously paid.
         (c)   All moneys must be used within three years from the date such
fee was paid. Any person who paid said fee under this section may receive a
refund of such fee plus interest accumulated thereon from the date of payment.
         (d)   All fees collected by the borough under this division (F) shall,
upon its receipt by the borough, be deposited in an interest-bearing account,
clearly identifying the specific recreational facilities for which the fee was
received. Interest earned on such accounts shall become funds of that account.
Funds from such an account shall be expended only in proper allocable portions
of the cost incurred to construct the specific recreational facilities for
which the funds were collected.
   (G)   Requirements for recreational plan approval. The plan for the
recreation areas must be shown on a drawing 24 inches by 36 inches, and a
reproducible tracing shall be furnished together with four prints. The plan
shall include the location and width of all proposed streets, alleys, rights-
of-way and easements, proposed lot lines with approximate dimensions, proposed
minimum setback lines for each street, locations of all proposed active and
passive recreation areas and development, to include types of equipment,
facilities and approximate dimensions of such facilities.

greater rate of runoff is permitted than that of the site in its natural
condition.
   (H)   Storm drainage systems shall be designed separately from any sanitary
sewer systems, and such storm systems shall be installed in accordance with
sound and established borough storm sewer specifications. Such storm systems
shall be designed to accommodate any storm discharges from the property being
subdivided and additional runoff which may occur from higher elevations within
the same watershed when it is fully developed. Such storm systems shall not
overload existing storm drainage systems or create flooding hazards.
   (I)   Facilities such as bridges, culverts, damns and other drainage

part, with a statement of reasons for any non-approval or rejection.
   (D)   The borough shall notify the subdivider in writing by certified or
registered mail of its action in relation to the improvements provided.
   (E)   If the Borough Council or the Borough Engineer fails to comply with
the above time limits, all improvements will be deemed to have been approved
and the subdivider shall be released from all liability pursuant to its
financial security.
   (F)   Any improvements not approved or rejected by the borough shall be
expeditiously completed by the subdivider and, upon completion, the same
notification procedure as above shall be followed.
   (G)   If any required improvement has not been installed, as required by
this chapter, by the approved final plan or by the executed development
agreement, then the borough shall enforce the financial security posted by
appropriate legal and equitable remedies. If the proceeds of such financial
security are insufficient to pay the cost of installing or making repairs or
corrections to the required improvements, the borough may, as its option,
install part of such improvements and may institute appropriate legal or
equitable action to recover the money necessary to complete the remainder.
   (H)   The borough, upon the recommendation of the selected engineer on
behalf of the borough, may refuse to accept the certification of completion
from the subdivider/developer. The estimate shall then be recalculated and
recertified by another professional engineer licensed as such in the
commonwealth and chosen mutually by the borough and the applicant developer/
subdivider. The financial security bond may be adjusted accordingly based upon
the mutually selected engineer’s recommendation.
   (I)   In the event acceptance of the development is made in part or in
whole, the borough may require financial security for maintenance for said
premises to be in place as per §
155.115 of this chapter.

§ 155.115 RELEASE FROM FINANCIAL SECURITY FOR MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   The financial security for maintenance shall remain in effect for a
period of 18 months after acceptance of dedication by the borough or other
appropriate agency. Said release shall be effected utilizing the same
notification procedures set forth in §
155.114 of this chapter.
   (B)   The borough may prescribe that the applicant developer/subdivider
shall reimburse the borough for reasonable and necessary expenses incurred for
the inspection of improvements. Such expense shall be reasonable and in
accordance with the ordinary and customary fees charged by the Borough Engineer
or consultant for work performed for similar services within the community.
   (C)   If any portion of said improvements shall not be approved or shall be
rejected by the Borough Council, the developer shall proceed to complete the
same and, upon completion, the same procedure of notification as outlined here
in this section and the previous section shall be followed.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 156.001 SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Oklahoma Borough Zoning
Ordinance.”
(Prior Code, § 27-101) (Ord. 196, passed 4-14-1986)
§ 156.002 PURPOSE.
   This chapter is deemed necessary by the Borough Council to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare; to conserve and stabilize property
values; to facilitate the economic provisions of streets, utilities and other
public services; to prevent the overcrowding or incompatible use or development
of land; and to preserve floodplains, steep hillsides and areas of poor
subsurface conditions from intense development.
(Prior Code, § 27-102) (Ord. 196, passed 4-14-1986)
§ 156.003 COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE.
   The arrangement of land use areas, the intensity of residential development
and the capacity and function of streets and public utilities were determined
in a master plan study of the borough that preceded the preparation of this
chapter. That plan is the basis for the description of the zoning districts of
this chapter and the regulations that apply in each district.
(Prior Code, § 27-103) (Ord. 196, passed 4-14-1986)
§ 156.004 INTERPRETATION.
   The provisions of this chapter shall be held to be the minimum requirements
for promotion of the public health, safety and welfare.
(Prior Code, § 27-104) (Ord. 196, passed 4-14-1986)
§ 156.005 CONFLICT.
   (A)   Where conflicts exist between this chapter and other regulations of
the borough or of a higher level of government, or with legal restrictive
covenants applied by landowners to the development of their property, the
ordinance, regulation or covenant establishing the higher standard shall
prevail.
   (B)   All ordinances or parts thereof in conflict with this chapter or
inconsistent with its provisions or less restrictive are hereby repealed to the
extent necessary to give this chapter full force and effect.
(Prior Code, § 27-105) (Ord. 196, passed 4-14-1986)
§ 156.006 MUNICIPAL LIABILITY.
   The grant of a zoning permit in any zone district shall not constitute a
representation, guarantee or warranty of any kind by the borough, or by any
official or employee, of the practicality or safety of the use, building or
structure covered by the permit and shall create no liability upon the borough,
its officials or employees.
(Prior Code, § 27-106) (Ord. 196, passed 4-14-1986)
§ 156.007 CONTINUITY.
   The provisions of this chapter, so far as they are common to those of zoning
regulations in force immediately prior to the enactment of this chapter, are
intended as a continuation of such prior regulations and not as new enactments.
Such parts of the prior regulations that are omitted from this chapter shall be
deemed as abrogated, and only the new or changed provisions included in this
chapter shall be deemed to be the law from the effective date of this chapter.
The adoption of this chapter does not make legitimate development activity in
the borough illegal under provisions of the prior regulations, nor does it
annul any litigation currently being pursued or that may be pursued in the
future against such illegal activity.
(Prior Code, § 27-107) (Ord. 196, passed 4-14-1986)
§ 156.008 DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   Words used in the present tense include the future tense; the
particular controls the general; the singular includes the plural and the
plural the singular; the words PERSON or DEVELOPER include a firm, association,
partnership, trust, company or corporation as well as an individual; the
masculine includes the feminine; the word SHALL is mandatory and the word MAY

decision on the correct location shall be rendered by the Zoning Officer, with
appeal from his or her decision made to the Zoning Hearing Board.
   (E)   In the event that the borough annexes additional land, such land shall
be placed initially in the R-1 Zone District until the Council, within 90 days
of annexation, determines the appropriate zone classification for the land
after receiving recommendations from the Planning Commission and holding a
public hearing.

accommodate the proposed development;
      (2)   The lot does not abut along a common side lot line property in the
same ownership; and
      (3)   If public sewer and water are not available, the Borough Sewage
Enforcement Officer certifies the lot as being acceptable for on-lot sewage
disposal and specifies the location and type of sewage disposal method that

permitted use shall be allowed on an undivided property, and only one dwelling
building shall be permitted on a lot, except in the case of a mobile home park,
a townhouse or apartment development, or a second use on a lot situated so that
if the property is later subdivided, both uses will occupy lots meeting all
area, setback and frontage requirements that apply in the zone district and
each will have separate access to a public street.
   (E)   Newly subdivided lots. All lots created by subdivision after the
effective date of this chapter shall be processed and approved by the County

present a plan of his or her proposal to the Planning Commission.
      (2)   The plan shall clearly show on a scaled drawing the location and
height of all buildings proposed and existing to remain relative to property
and street lines, number of dwelling or commercial units in each building,
access drives from adjacent streets, layout of parking areas showing the number
of spaces, location of public sanitary sewer and water lines and proposed
grading, including degree of slope and methods to control and dispose of storm
water.
      (3)   The Planning Commission shall review the plan at its next monthly
meeting after receipt, and shall render a decision to approve the plan as
submitted, approve it with specific modifications or conditions or reject it
not later than the second regular meeting after first reviewing the proposal.
Any conditions attached to approval shall be included on the zoning permit. If

benefit of an easement; or to cross a public street on the surface.
      (2)   In any townhouse, garden apartment or commercial development, the
application to the Borough Council shall be accompanied by a plan to indicate
how stormwater will be collected and removed from the property.
      (3)   The Council may require, where no subsurface storm drainage system
is available and/or where large areas are to be covered with structures and
paved surfaces, that developers provide storm retention vessels on their
properties of sufficient capacity to hold the flow from the 50-year storm of
record (4.7 inches in 24 hours) for release at the ten-year rate (3.8 inches in
24 hours). The Council may ask the Westmoreland County Conservation District
for assistance in determining the need for, and adequacy of, stormwater
management facilities.

      (1)   Areas identified as within the 100-year floodplain by the Federal
Insurance Administration’s flood insurance study for the borough shall not be
developed with structures whose lowest floor elevation is less than one and
one-half feet above the 100-year flood elevation at the proposed building site.
If the structure is for strictly commercial purposes, the lowest floor
elevation may be below that level as long as the building is floodproofed to
one and one-half feet above the 100-year flood elevation.
      (2)   Until definitive studies by the United States Army Corps of
Engineers have established specific flood levels, the preliminary report by the
Department of Housing and Urban Development and the highest known water level
at a particular location shall be used to establish the 100-year flood level.
      (3)   No new construction may encroach on any existing stream or
drainageway or constrict its natural flow characteristics.

use. Any such enlargement or expansion shall conform to the area, height and
yard requirements of the zoning district in which it is located unless a
variance is granted.
      (2)   No nonconforming use shall be moved, in whole or in part, to any
other portion of the lot occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this subchapter.
      (3)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of a
structure which was designed for such use at the time the use became

structure.
   (C)   Damage or destruction. Any nonconforming structure which has been
partially or completely damaged or destroyed by fire or other means may be
rebuilt or repaired on its existing foundation even though such foundation may
violate the setback requirements for the zoning district in which the structure
is located, provided that the repair or reconstruction and reoccupancy of the
structure occurs within 18 months of the date that the original structure was

§ 156.101 FUNCTIONS OF THE BOARD.

decide appeals where it is alleged by the appellant that the Zoning Officer has
failed to follow prescribed procedures or has misrepresented or misapplied any
provision of this chapter.

the applicant.
      (1)   The written application for a variance submitted to the Board
Secretary in advance of the hearing shall demonstrate, where relevant:
         (a)   That the property to be developed is of a peculiar shape or size
and/or contains unusual topographic or other conditions creating a hardship;
         (b)   That because of these circumstances and not the regulations of
this chapter, there is no possibility the property can be developed in strict
accordance with the regulations;
         (c)   That such hardship has not been created by the appellant; and
         (d)   That the requested variance, if granted, will not downgrade the
character of the neighborhood, nor impair the future development of adjacent
properties in conformance with this chapter, nor undermine the public welfare.
      (2)   If authorized, the variance shall represent the least deviation
from the regulations that will afford relief.
      (3)   In granting a variance, the Board may attach appropriate conditions
necessary to protect the intent of this chapter and the public health and

containing the property for which the variance is sought, or any use expressly
or by implication prohibited by the terms of this chapter in the zoning
district.

Board shall hear appeals for the right to develop uses not specifically listed
as permitted by right or conditionally in any zone district.

permit, and if denied, may appeal to the Board.
      (2)   The Board shall hear the appeal and shall determine in which zone
district the proposed use would be most appropriate, based on the permitted and
conditional uses listed for each zone classification. The Board may also find
that the proposed use is inappropriate in all zone districts of the borough.
      (3)   If the Board selects a zone classification, it need not necessarily
be the one governing the appellant’s property. The proposed use shall become a
conditional use in the zone classification selected, and the Board shall attach
appropriate guidelines for consideration of the conditional use.
      (4)   The appellant may then, provided he or she has property in the
selected zone classification, apply for conditional use approval as provided in
§§
156.035 to
156.039 of this chapter.

(Prior Code, § 27-901) (Ord. 196, passed 4-14-1986; Ord. 2015-04, passed 12-14-
2015)
§ 156.121 ZONING PERMITS.
   (A)   No building or structure, including a mobile home, shall be erected,
moved or enlarged unless a zoning permit for such action has been issued by the
Zoning Officer. Permits shall not be required for the repaving of existing
residential driveways, for painting, for repointing masonry or for altering
interior partitions or doorways when no structural changes are needed. Once a
permit has been issued by the Zoning Officer, anyone aggrieved by that action
may, within 30 days thereafter, appeal the action to the Zoning Hearing Board.
   (B)   An application for a zoning permit shall include the following in
duplicate on forms provided by the Zoning Officer. A site plan may be waived by
the Zoning Officer if the application includes no construction outside the
existing buildings on the lot:
      (1)   A site plan drawn to scale showing the location of the proposed new
construction on the property relative to property boundaries and abutting
streets, with distances indicated, the location of driveway entrances, signs
and off-street parking areas, noting the arrangement of spaces, and any grading
contemplated;
      (2)   A statement describing the proposed use of the new construction and
the length, width and height of its components;
      (3)   Approval from the State Department of Labor and Industry if an
enclosed structure other than a one-family detached or two-family dwelling is
proposed; and
      (4)   Affidavit of the applicant that all information provided is true
and correct to the best of his or her knowledge.
   (C)   If the application is satisfactory, the Zoning Officer shall inspect
the premises where the construction is proposed to occur. If new construction
is proposed, the Zoning Officer shall verify on the site the location of the
construction relative to adjacent property lines and may order the owner to
have stakes positioned by a registered surveyor to indicate the property line
and outline of the new construction. Upon completing his or her inspection and
finding the application and premises compatible, the Zoning Officer shall
collect the appropriate zoning permit fee (see §
156.125 of this chapter), approve the application and return one copy, together
with a signed zoning permit, authorizing the applicant to proceed. The
applicant shall post the permit prominently on the building site during
construction.
   (D)   If the application is not satisfactory, the Zoning Officer shall
return one copy of the application, together with a letter indicating the
specific reasons why the application cannot be approved and the changes needed
to make it acceptable.
   (E)   The Zoning Officer shall from time to time visit the property whereon
the approved construction is taking place in order to assure himself or herself
that the work is proceeding in accordance with the zoning permit. The Zoning
Officer shall not be denied access to the property during working hours in
order to inspect the construction in progress, and he or she may order the work
corrected to conform to the permit or halted pending appeal to the Zoning
Hearing Board.
   (F)   If an applicant wishes to amend the use, arrangement or construction
of his or her building from that shown on the permit after the permit is
approved, he or she shall file with the Zoning Officer an application for an
amended zoning permit.
   (G)   (1)   A zoning permit shall become void if, after six months from the
date of issue, construction has not commenced and been vigorously pursued. The
life of a zoning permit shall be one year from the date of issue. Permits may
be extended for not more than one additional year on large projects, or where
the applicant can prove to the Zoning Officer a hardship exists making it
impossible to complete the project in one year.
      (2)   Once a permit has become void, a replacement permit may be obtained
in the same manner as for the original permit.
   (H)   A permit shall be required for the removal of any building or part of
any building. The applicant shall be responsible for backfilling any excavation
created by the razing and for the removal of all debris on the lot within 60
days after the issuance of the permit.
   (I)   The Zoning Officer shall keep records of all applications either
approved or disapproved, including one copy of each permit issued, shall
maintain a journal of his or her activities and shall submit a monthly report
and an annual summation report to the Borough Council detailing building
activity in the borough during the preceding year.
(Prior Code, § 27-902) (Ord. 196, passed 4-14-1986)
§ 156.122 PERMISSION TO OCCUPY.
   (A)   Before the use of a property or structure can be changed, or a
property occupied without the need of a zoning permit, the owner shall secure
the approval of the Zoning Officer in writing. Such approval shall be required
also whenever a greater number of dwelling units are being installed in a
structure, a home occupation is introduced or changed or commercial premises
are converted to a second commercial use.
   (B)   The owner shall be responsible for the use of his or her property,
even though he or she leases it to others, and for securing the necessary
occupancy permission, if needed.
(Prior Code, § 27-903) (Ord. 196, passed 4-14-1986)
§ 156.123 ENFORCEMENT.

information:
      (1)   The name of the owner of record and any other person against whom
the municipality intends to take action;
      (2)   The location of the property in violation;
      (3)   The specific violation with a description of the requirements which

and the date before which the steps must be completed;
      (5)   That the recipient of the notice has the right to appeal to the
Zoning Hearing Board within a prescribed period of time in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this chapter. If the recipient of the notice of
violation appeals and sends notice to the Borough Zoning Hearing Board, he or
she shall be required to pay an appeal fee, the amount of which will be set by
a resolution of the Borough Council; and
      (6)   That failure to comply with the notice within the time specified,
unless extended by appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board, constitutes a violation,
with possible sanctions clearly described.
   (B)   Other remedies. In case any building, structure, landscaping or land
is, or is proposed to be, erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered,
converted, maintained or used in violation of this chapter, the Borough Council
or, with the approval of the Borough Council, an officer of the borough, in
addition to other remedies, may institute any appropriate action or proceeding
to prevent, restrain, correct or abate such building, structure, landscaping or
land to prevent, in or about such premises, any act, conduct, business or use
constituting a violation.

chapter invalid, it shall not be required to receive a curative amendment
during the period of the chapter review but shall, within 30 days of its
declaration, make a statement of the specific deficiencies it proposes to
correct, and shall, within 180 days thereafter, either adopt its curative
amendment after public hearing or reaffirm the validity of the chapter as it
was prior to the declaration. Such action by the Council may not again be taken
for at least three years after deciding on a previous municipal curative
amendment.

borough, pay a judgment of not more than $500 (subject to change via
resolution) plus all court costs, including reasonable attorney fees incurred
by the borough as a result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed,
levied or payable until the date of the determination of a violation by the
magisterial district justice. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals
the judgment, the borough may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable
Rules of Civil Procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute
a separate violation unless the magisterial district judge, determining that
there has been a violation, further determines that there was a good-faith
basis for the person, partnership or corporation violating this chapter to have
believed that there was no such violation, in which event, there shall be
deemed to have been only one such violation until the fifth day following the
date of the determination of a violation by the magisterial district judge, and
thereafter, each day reasonable attorney fees collected for the violation of
this chapter shall be paid over to the borough.
