(Res. 89-107, passed 8-16-1989)
§ 236.10 COST RECOVERY FOR RESPONSES TO PUBLIC DISTURBANCES.
   (a)   Findings; intent.
      (1)   The Board of Commissioners of the township find and determine the
following.
         A.   Certain properties within the township require a disproportionate
amount of police service with many calls requiring a response to maintain order
and public peace and to stop public disturbances so that there are fewer
personnel and resources available for other locations, emergencies and duties
in the township, and extraordinary police service at such properties puts a
disapropriate and unfair burden upon the citizens and taxpayers of the
township.
         B.   Owners, operators and/or rental agents in charge of such
properties derive a benefit from such police service.
         C.   Owners of such properties have a responsibility to manage their
properties to minimize required police service, to maintain order and public
peace, to stop public disturbances, to minimize the burden upon citizens and
taxpayers of the township and to promote the health, safety and welfare of the
public in general.
         D.   Owners of such properties can minimize required police service to
maintain order and public peace and to stop public disturbances by diligent and
strict management and regulation of their properties.
         E.   Assessment of costs as provided in this section is reasonable and
will have a deterrent effect and encourage more responsible management of such
properties.
      (2)   It is not the intent of this section to discourage or suppress
requests for police service, but rather to encourage and stimulate diligent and
strict management and regulation of occupants and invitees of property within
the township by owners.
   (b)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      OWNER. A person, corporation or other entity comprising the record owner
of any land or building, the operator of any land or building and the rental
agent in charge of any land or building, jointly and severally.
      POLICE SERVICE COSTS. An amount fixed by the Township Commissioners to
cover the estimated compensation of officers and civilian employees for the
amount of time normally spent in responding to a call or otherwise maintaining
order and public peace and stopping disturbances, appropriate administrative
costs allocable thereto, and medical treatment to injured officers and the cost
of repairing damaged township equipment or property. This amount shall be fixed
from time to time and shall be based upon an average cost for a typical police
response.
      PUBLIC DISTURBANCES. Any party, gathering, event or disturbance involving
disorderly conduct as described by the Pennsylvania Statutes.
   (c)   Payment of Police Service Costs required. Every owner of property
within the township is required to pay police service costs to maintain order
and public peace and to stop public disturbances at such property for each
response by the police in excess of one response per 365-day period in an
amount fixed by resolution of the Board of Commissioners. However, police
service in connection with crimes against residents, occupants, invitees and/or
property by persons not residing on the property or invited guests or otherwise
lawful occupants of the property shall not be considered responses for purposes
of this section. Further, police service in connection with spousal abuse or
abuse of children by parents or in connection with crimes classified as
misdemeanors or felonies under the Pennsylvania Crimes Code shall not be
considered responses for purposes of this section.
   (d)   Notice to owner, operator and/or rental agent. The Chief of Police or
other duly authorized agent of the township shall notify the owner of property
within the township that a response has been made to such property to maintain
order or public peace or to stop a public disturbance. Such notice shall be
given by regular mail to the last known address of such owner. However, an
owner shall be required to pay police service costs in accordance with
subsection (c) above whether or not such notice has been given.
   (e)   Billing. Police service costs due in accordance with subsection (c)
above shall be billed to the owner by the Township Manager of his or her duly
authorized agent and shall be due and payable within 30 days of such billing.
   (f)   Failure to pay. Unpaid police service costs may be collected by civil
action by the township against the owner, occupant and/or rental agent with
responsibility to manage property and/or may be imposed or assessed against
such property as a municipal claim under the Act of May 16,1923, P.L. 207, as
amended (53 P.S. § 7101). In either event, attorney fees and costs incurred in
the collection of this fee, in addition to a penalty of 10% and interest at the
rate of 10% per annum shall be added and collected as provided by law.

§ 282.03 CONTRIBUTIONS.
   (a)   Contributions by members.
      (1)   Members shall pay into the Fund at a rate of 4.85% of compensation

contributions by members shall be maintained, including all interest credited

discontinuance of his or her employment with the police force or within a
reasonable time (not more than 45 days after discontinuance).
      (2)   If such discontinuance is due to death, then such refund shall be
paid to his or her designated beneficiary or, in the absence thereof, to his or
her estate. If a retired member who is receiving a benefit by reason of
disability or retirement, dies, and is not survived by a spouse, then the
refund payable to the beneficiary shall be equal to the individual account
balance at the date of disability or retirement, less any pension payments made
to the member.
   (c)   Deposits. Contributions by members shall be remitted to the trustee
monthly.
   (d)   State aid. The portion of the payments made by the State Treasurer to
the township and designated by the Board to be allocated to the Police Pension
Fund from money received from taxes paid upon premiums by foreign casualty
insurance companies for purposes of pension retirement or disability benefits
for police officers shall be used as follows:
      (1)   To reduce the unfunded liability, or, after such liability has been
fully funded;
      (2)   To apply against the annual obligation of the township for future
service costs, or to the extent that the payment may be in excess of such
obligations; or
      (3)   To reduce member contributions pursuant to subsection (a) above.
   (e)   Township contributions. Subject to the provisions and limitations set
forth in other sections of this Plan, the township shall contribute the amounts
certified to be necessary by the Fund’s actuary to provide the benefits
provided by this Plan.
   (f)   Non-intervening military buy back.
      (1)   The Plan provides full service credit for each year of military
service or fraction thereof, not to exceed five years, to a member who was not
employed by the township prior to such military service, payable by the member.
The member shall pay the amount for the purchase of credit for military service
other than intervening military service shall be computed by applying the
average normal cost rate for the Plan as certified by the Public Employee
Retirement Study Commission, but not to exceed 10%, to the member’s average
annual rate of compensation over the first three years of service and
multiplying the result by the number of years and fractional part of a year of
creditable non-intervening military service being purchased, together with
interest at the rate of 4.75% compounded annually from the date of initial
entry into service to the date of payment.
      (2)   A member of the Plan shall be eligible to receive service credit
for intervening or non-intervening military service provided that he or she is
not entitled to receive, eligible to receive then or in the future, or is
receiving retirement benefits for such service under a retirement system
administered and wholly or partially paid for by any other governmental agency
with the exception of a member eligible to receive or is receiving military
retirement pay earned by a combination of active duty and non-active duty with
a reserve or national guard component of the armed forces which retirement pay
is payable only upon the attainment of a specified age and period of service
under 10 U.S.C. Ch 67 (relating to retired pay for non-regular service).
   (g)   Other contributions. The Fund shall be authorized to receive by gift,
grant, devise or bequest, any money or property, real, personal or mixed, in
trust for the benefit of the Fund. The trustee of the Fund shall be subject to
such directions not inconsistent with this Plan as the donors of such funds and
property may prescribe.
(Ord. 839, passed 5-17-2006; Ord. 903, passed 6-27-2012)
§ 282.04 RETIREMENT BENEFITS.
   (a)   Normal retirement.
      (1)   Each member may retire on or at any time after his or her normal
retirement date. Any member so retiring shall be entitled to receive a monthly
pension commencing as of the first day following his or her date of actual
retirement and ending with the payment made as of the first day of the month in
which his or her death occurs. The monthly pension to which such retired member
shall be entitled to under this Plan shall be equal to 50% of such member’s
average applicable compensation reduced by a percentage of the primary Social
Security benefit payment at age 65 or later.
      (2)   The percentage of the Social Security offset shall be determined
based upon the following dates of retirement:
Date of Retirement Social Security Offset
Date of Retirement          Social Security Offset
Retired prior to 1-1-1996   50%
1-1-1996 through 6-30-1997  0%
7-1-1997 through 12-31-1997 40%
1-1-1998 through 12-31-1998 30%
1-1-1999 through 12-31-2003 20%
1-1-2004 through 12-31-2006 5%
1-1-2007 and thereafter     0%
 
      (3)   In addition to the monthly retirement benefit described above, each
member who has completed 26 years of service shall receive an additional
monthly pension benefit equal to a maximum of $100 per month.
      (4)   Officers hired or after January 1, 2012: for each additional year
of service over 25 years, a police officer’s pension benefit shall be increased
by $100 per month, up to a maximum increase of $300 per month.
   (b)   Early retirement benefit. Each member may retire on or at any time
after his or her early retirement date. Upon termination, the member must file
with the Secretary of the township, a written notice of his or her intention to
elect an early retirement benefit. This benefit shall become effective as of
the date of the notice or the date designated in the notice, whichever is
later. The amount of the early retirement benefit shall be the actuarial
equivalent of a vested retirement benefit as computed in §
282.06(a). The actuarial equivalent of the vested retirement benefit shall be
determined by actuarially reducing the vested retirement benefit to reflect
that it will commence on the effective date of the early retirement rather than
on the member’s normal retirement date. The actuarial reduction shall be
calculated using the actuarial assumptions reported in the last actuarial
valuation report filed with the Public Employee Retirement Commission.
   (c)   Postponed retirement. An employee shall be allowed to continue as an
employee beyond his or her normal retirement date. In such case, the employee
shall remain a member of the plan until he or she actually retires or ceases to
be an employee. Any contributions required pursuant to §
282.03(a) shall continue.
   (d)   Disability benefit. If a member retires because of a total and
permanent disability, he or she shall be entitled to receive a pension benefit
equal to 75% of his or her salary at the time the disability was incurred,
offset by any Social Security disability benefits received by the member for
the same injury. The benefit will commence on the first day of the month
following the month in which he or she retires. In no event, however, shall the
member’s benefit exceed 100% of his or her salary including worker’s
compensation as received in 12-month period preceding retirement.
   (e)   Cost of living adjustment. There shall be a cost of living adjustment
provided to all members who retire provided however, that such cost of living
increase shall not exceed the percentage increase in the All Urban Consumers
CPI for the Philadelphia area from the year in which the police officer last
worked; provided further, that in no case shall the total police pension
benefits exceed 75% of the salary for computing retirement benefits; provided
further that the total cost of living increase shall not exceed 30%. No cost of
living increases(s) shall be granted which would impair the actuarial soundness
of the Plan. All adjustments shall be made in January and calculated on the 12-
month-percentage change in the consumer price index as of the previous October.

2016)
§ 282.05 DEATH BENEFITS.
   (a)   Death benefit if no surviving spouse nor dependent children. If a
member dies prior to the commencement of pension benefits, then his or her
designated beneficiary shall be entitled to a refund of his or her accumulated
member’s contributions with credited interest. If no beneficiary survives, then
the refund is payable to the member’s estate.
   (b)   Pension benefit to surviving spouse and dependent children.
      (1)   If a member dies survived by a spouse or dependent children, after
having become eligible to receive a pension benefit, (i.e., he or she was
eligible because: (a) he or she was already receiving a pension; and (b) he or
she met the age and service requirements, but he or she had not yet retired),
then a monthly pension benefit shall be provided.
      (2)   The amount of the monthly pension benefit shall be 50% of the
pension the member was receiving or would have been entitled to receive if he
or she had been retired at the time of his or her death.
      (3)   In the event a member dies after completing 12 or more years of
service but was not yet eligible for normal retirement or pre-retirement
survivor benefits, the surviving spouse shall act on behalf of the member in
selecting the alternative addressed in §
282.06(a). If a vested benefit is selected, the surviving spouse shall receive
50% of the member’s vested monthly benefit commencing on the first day of the
month following the member’s normal retirement date.
      (4)   In the event a member dies after completing 20 or more years of
service but was not yet eligible for normal retirement or pre-retirement
survivor benefits, the surviving spouse shall act on behalf of the member in
selecting the alternative addressed in §
282.04(b). If an early retirement benefit is selected, the surviving spouse
shall receive 50% of the member’s monthly early retirement benefit commencing
on the first day of the month following the election of this benefit.
      (5)   The monthly pension benefit is payable to the surviving spouse
until death or then to surviving dependent children under the age of 18 years
or if attending college, under or attaining the age of 23 years. Attending
college shall mean the eligible children are registered at an accredited
institution of higher learning and are carrying a minimum course load of seven
credit hours per semester. Dependent children shall include adopted children,
and any child conceived before the time of the member’s death and thereafter
born to the member’s spouse.
   (c)   Pre-retirement survivor benefit. In the event a member is killed in
service, the member’s family shall receive a pension calculated at 100% of the
member’s salary at the time of death. It is understood that FAMILY shall refer
to the surviving spouse and dependent children. The benefit is payable to the
surviving spouse until death, then to the surviving dependent children under
the age of 18 years, or if attending college, under or attaining the age of 23
years. The term dependent children and attending college shall be consistent
with that of subsection (b) above.
(Ord. 839, passed 5-17-2006; Ord. 903, passed 6-27-2012)
§ 282.06 SEVERANCE OF EMPLOYMENT.
   (a)   If a member leaves the employ of the township or ceases to be a member
whether by reason of his or her transfer, resignation or discharge, or by
reason of disability or retirement other than after becoming eligible for
benefits pursuant to §§
282.04 or
282.05, he or she shall be entitled to a refund of all contributions made by
him or her and then on deposit in the Fund, plus interest thereon, computed at
the rate described in §
282.03(a).
   (b)   However, a member who has completed 12 or more years of service may
elect either subsections (b)(1) or (b)(2) as described below.
      (1)   He or she may elect to leave his or her contributions, plus
interest in the Fund so as to receive a vested pension benefit to start at his
or her normal retirement date. He or she must file with the Secretary of the
township within 90 days of the date he or she ceases to be a full-time police
officer, a written notice of his or her intention to vest. The amount of the
vested pension benefit shall be (x) divided by (y) where (x) is the number of
years of service at the date of termination and (y) is the number of years of
service which the member would have had if he or she worked until normal
retirement date, multiplied by the benefits described in §
282.04(a). Years of service shall be measured in years and completed months.
      (2)   He or she may elect to receive a refund of all contributions made
by him or her and then on deposit in the Trust Fund, plus interest thereon,
computed at the rate described in §
282.03(a). If he or she elects to receive the refund of his or her
contributions plus interest, he or she would forfeit the pension benefit
outlined in subsection (b)(1) above.
(Ord. 839, passed 5-17-2006; Ord. 903, passed 6-27-2012)
§ 282.07 METHOD OF DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS.
   (a)   Refund benefits becoming distributable pursuant to §
282.06(a) and death benefits becoming distributable pursuant to the provision
of §
282.05(a) shall be paid in the form of a lump-sum distribution.
   (b)   The normal form of all benefits payable hereunder shall be a pension
for the life of the member commencing on the date specified and ending with a
payment made on the first day of the month in which the member dies, subject,
however, to the payment of a death benefit calculated pursuant to §
282.05(b).
(Ord. 839, passed 5-17-2006; Ord. 903, passed 6-27-2012)

beneficiaries, as provided in §§
282.04,
282.05 and
282.06, in accordance with the instructions received from the Board; provided,
however, that the duty of the Trustee to make such payments is wholly
contingent upon the sufficiency of the Fund for such purposes.
   (b)   The Board may employ an actuary, investment advisors, counsel or other
professional consultants from time to time in connection with the operation of
the Fund or of this Plan. Such persons or entities shall be compensated by the

Act of 1940, being 15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-1 et seq.;
         B.   A bank as defined in that Act; or
         C.   An insurance company qualified to manage, acquire or dispose of
any asset of the Plan under the laws of more than one state.
      (2)   Each investment manager shall acknowledge in writing that it is a
fiduciary with respect to the Plan. The Board shall enter into an agreement
with each investment manager specifying the duties and compensation of such
investment manager and other terms and conditions under which such investment
manager shall be retained. The Board shall not be liable for any act or
omission of any investment manager, and shall not be liable for following the
advise of any investment manager, with respect to any duties delegated to the
investment manager.
      (3)   The Board shall have the power to determine the amount of Fund
assets to be invested pursuant to the direction of a designated investment
manager and to set investment objectives and guidelines for the investment
manager.
   (d)   (1)   The Trustee shall make an annual determination of the fair
market value of the Fund as of the anniversary date and as of such additional
dates as the Board may direct.
      (2)   The fair market value of the Fund shall be reported to the actuary
who shall calculate the amount to be contributed to the Fund by the township
with respect to each plan year in accordance with the assumptions most recently
adopted by the Board for the purpose of such computations; provided, however,
that the liability of the township to make such contributions is subject to all
of the conditions and limitations set forth elsewhere in this Plan.
(Ord. 839, passed 5-17-2006; Ord. 903, passed 6-27-2012)
§ 282.09 THE POLICE PENSION BOARD.

adopt rules and regulations for the efficient administration of the Plan.
   (b)   The Board shall keep all data, records and documents pertaining to the
administration of the Plan and shall execute all documents necessary to carry

documents to the professionals whose services are employed pursuant to §
282.08(b).
   (c)   The Board shall construe the Plan, shall determine any questions or
fact arising under the Plan and shall make all decisions required of it under
the Plan. Decisions and actions taken thereon in good faith shall be final and
conclusive. It may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any
inconsistency in such manner and to such extent as it shall be the sole judge
of such expediency. The Board shall act uniformly with respect to matters
coming before it concerning employees in similar circumstances.
   (d)   The members of the Board, and each of them shall be free of all
liability for any act or omission except by willful misconduct or gross
negligence, and each of them shall be fully indemnified by the township against
all judgments not involving findings of their respective personal or collective
willful misconduct or gross negligence and against all cost, including counsel
fees, incurred in defense of actions brought against them.
   (e)   The Board shall make available to members, retired members and
terminated members and to their beneficiaries, for examination during business

employment and such other pertinent facts as the Board may require.

§ 282.10 PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE TOWNSHIP.
   (a)   It is the expectation of the township that it will continue this
Pension Plan indefinitely, and will, from time to time, contribute to the Fund
such amounts as may be needed to provide the benefits set forth in the Plan.
   (b)   The provisions of any ordinance establishing, amending or maintaining
the Plan shall not be a charge on any other Fund in the Treasury of the
township or under its control, save the Uniformed Employee’s Pension Fund
herein provided for.
   (c)   Nothing contained in the Plan shall be held or construed as a contract
or guarantee of employment nor to create any liability upon the township to
retain any person in its service. The township reserves the full right to
discontinue the service of any person without any liability except for salary
or wages that may be due and paid, whenever in its judgment its best interests
so require, and such discontinuance shall be without regard to this Plan.
(Ord. 839, passed 5-17-2006; Ord. 903, passed 6-27-2012)
§ 282.11 TERMINATION OR AMENDMENT OF PLAN.
   (a)   The township may amend this Plan from time to time as is necessary to
maintain its actuarial soundness and to incorporate changes in Plan benefits or
entitlements. However, no amendment shall be made which will, in any manner,
divert any part of the Fund to any purpose other than the exclusive benefit of
members or their beneficiaries (except that upon termination such diversion may
be made after all of the fixed and contingent liabilities to members and their
beneficiaries have been met); nor shall any amendment be made at any time which
will in any manner divest any benefit then vested in a member or reduce or
eliminate a benefit to which a member has been given an expectation by virtue
of pension ordinance or pension calculations for retiring officers who retired
during the members participation in this Plan.
   (b)   In the event of termination of this Plan, the Board shall allocate the
assets then remaining in the Fund as follows.
      (1)   Sufficient funds shall be maintained to provide the pension
benefits prescribed in §
282.04 for all members who have retired prior to termination or who are
eligible for retirement at the time of the termination of this Fund.
      (2)   Contributions with interest at a rate established by the Board as
provided in §
282.05 shall be refunded to any and all members who terminate service at the
time of the termination of the Fund.
      (3)   Of the remaining funds, those which can be identified as
municipality contributions or contributions other than from members or from the

§ 422.03 REMOVAL OF VEHICLE BY OR AT DIRECTION OF POLICE.
   (a)   Outside business and residence districts. When a police officer finds
a vehicle in violation of any of the provisions of 75 Pa.C.S. § 3551, relating
to stopping, standing and parking outside business and residence districts, the
officer may move the vehicle, or cause the vehicle to be moved, or require the
driver or other person in charge of the vehicle to move the vehicle, to a
position off the roadway where the vehicle will not interfere unduly with the
normal movement of traffic or constitute a safety hazard.
   (b)   Unattended vehicle obstructing traffic. A police officer may remove or
cause to be removed to a place of safety any unattended vehicle illegally left

vehicles and cargoes.
   (d)   Notice to owner prior to removal.
      (1)   Prior to removal of an abandoned vehicle bearing a registration
plate, certificate of inspection or vehicle identification number plate, by

warning the owner that unless the vehicle is removed or a hearing is demanded,
the owner shall be subject to the provisions of § 7306 of the Vehicle Code. If,
as a result of the hearing, it is determined that the vehicle will be removed,
the owner shall be given an additional 48 hours to remove the vehicle or have
it removed. The hearing shall be before a civilian officer or employee of the
municipality in which the vehicle is located.
      (3)   The provision for notice of this subsection (d) is applicable only
if the vehicle is abandoned upon a highway and is not in violation of
subsection (d)(2) above or §§ 3351(a) or 3353(a) and (b) of the Vehicle Code.
Notice under this subsection (d) is in addition to any other notice
requirements provided in the Vehicle Code.

information within his or her possession or that comes into his or her
possession, and for this purpose the Collector, or his or her authorized agent,

from the payment of the tax hereby imposed to convince the Collector of his or

consideration, to a trustee of an ordinary trust, where the transfer of the
same property would be exempt if the transfer were made directly from the
grantor to all of the possible beneficiaries, whether or not such beneficiaries

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 1043.01 SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the “Aston Township Watershed Stormwater
Management Ordinance”.
(Ord. 928, passed 6-18-2014)
§ 1043.02 STATEMENT OF FINDINGS.
   The governing body of the municipality finds the following.
   (a)   Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from
development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities,
contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of
existing streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public
facilities to convey and manage stormwater, undermines floodplain management
and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities, reduces
infiltration, and threatens public health and safety.
   (b)   Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from
land development throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources
by changing the natural hydrologic patterns, accelerating stream flows (which
increase scour and erosion of stream beds and stream banks, thereby elevating
sedimentation), destroying aquatic habitat, and elevating aquatic pollutant
concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy metals and
pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted through loss of recharge.
   (c)   A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
minimization of impacts of development, redevelopment, and activities causing
accelerated erosion and loss of natural infiltration, is fundamental to the
public health, safety, welfare and the protection of the people of the
municipality and all of the people of the commonwealth, their resources and the
environment.
   (d)   Stormwater can be an important water resource by providing
infiltration for water supplies and baseflow of streams, which also protects
and maintains surface water quality.
   (e)   Impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by using project
designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high water
quality, infiltration, stream baseflow, and aquatic ecosystems. The most cost-
effective and environmentally advantageous way to manage stormwater runoff is
through nonstructural project design that minimizes impervious surfaces and
sprawl, avoids sensitive areas (i.e., stream buffers, floodplains, steep
slopes), and considers topography and soils to maintain the natural hydrologic
regime.
   (f)   Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
   (g)   Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are required
to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer
systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).
   (h)   Nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems can
contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the municipality.
(Ord. 928, passed 6-18-2014)
§ 1043.03 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety and
welfare within the municipality by maintaining the natural hydrologic regime
and minimizing the impacts described in §
1043.02 through provisions designed to:
   (a)   Promote alternative project designs and layouts that minimize the
impacts on surface and groundwater;
   (b)   Promote nonstructural best management practices (BMPs);
   (c)   Minimize increases in runoff stormwater volume;
   (d)   Minimize impervious surfaces;
   (e)   Manage accelerated stormwater runoff and erosion and sedimentation
problems and stormwater runoff impacts at their source by regulating activities
that cause these problems;
   (f)   Provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management;
   (g)   Utilize and preserve existing natural drainage systems as much as
possible;
   (h)   Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, requiring a
minimum of structures and relying on natural processes;
   (i)   Focus on infiltration of stormwater to maintain base flow, to prevent
degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water
resources;
   (j)   Protect base flows and quality of streams and watercourses, where
possible;
   (k)   Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Ch. 93.4.a, requiring protection and maintenance of
“existing uses” and maintenance of the level of water quality to support those
uses in all streams, and the protection and maintenance of water quality in
“special protection” streams;
   (l)   Address the quality and quantity of stormwater discharges from the
development site;
   (m)   Provide standards to meet certain NPDES MS4 permit requirements;
   (n)   Implement an illicit discharge detection and elimination program that
addresses non-stormwater discharges into the municipality’s separate storm
sewer system (MS4);
   (o)   Preserve the flood-carrying capacity of streams;
   (p)   Prevent accelerated scour, erosion and sedimentation of stream
channels;
   (q)   Provide performance standards and design criteria based on watershed-
wide stormwater management planning; and
   (r)   Provide proper operation and maintenance of all permanent stormwater
management facilities and BMPs that are implemented within the municipality.
(Ord. 928, passed 6-18-2014)
§ 1043.04 STATUTORY AUTHORITY.
   The municipality is empowered or required to regulate land use activities
that affect runoff and surface and groundwater quality and quantity by the
authority of:
   (a)   Act of October 4, 1978, 32 P.S. §§ 680.1 et seq., P.L. 864 (Act 167),
as amended, the Stormwater Management Act, (hereinafter referred to as “the
Act”);
   (b)   53 P.S. § 67701; and
   (c)   Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, Pa. Mun. Plan. Code, Act 247,
as amended, being 53 P.S. §§ 10101 et seq.
(Ord. 928, passed 6-18-2014)
§ 1043.05 APPLICABILITY/REGULATED ACTIVITIES.
   (a)   All regulated activities and all activities that may affect stormwater
runoff, including but not limited to, land development, redevelopment and earth
disturbance activity located within the municipality, are subject to regulation
by this chapter.
   (b)   This chapter contains the stormwater management performance standards
and design criteria that are necessary from a watershed-wide perspective. Local
stormwater management design criteria (e.g., inlet spacing, inlet type,
collection system design and details, outlet structure design and the like)
shall continue to be regulated by the applicable municipal ordinances and
applicable state regulations.
(Ord. 928, passed 6-18-2014)
§ 1043.06 EXEMPTIONS.
   (a)   Generally. An exemption shall not relieve the applicant from
implementing the requirements of the municipal regulations or from implementing
such measures as are necessary to protect public health, safety and property.
An exemption shall not relieve the applicant from complying with the special
requirements for watersheds draining to identified high quality (HQ) or
exceptional value (EV) waters or any other current or future state or municipal
water quality protection requirements. If a drainage problem is documented or
known to exist downstream of, or is expected from the proposed activity, then
the municipality may withdraw exemptions listed in Table 1 and require the
applicant to comply with all requirements of this chapter. Even though the
applicant is exempt, he or she is not relieved from complying with other
municipal ordinances or regulations.
   (b)   General exemptions.
      (1)   Table 1 summarizes the exemptions from certain provisions of this
chapter. Exemptions are for the items noted in Table 1 only, and shall not
relieve the applicant from other applicable sections of this chapter.
      (2)   Any regulated activity that is exempt from some provisions of the
chapter is exempt only from those provisions. If development is to take place
in phases, the developer is responsible for implementing the requirements of
the chapter as the impervious cover/earth disturbance threshold is met. The
date of the municipal regulations adoption shall be the starting point from
which to consider tracts as “parent tracts” in which future subdivisions and
respective impervious area and earth disturbance computations shall be
cumulatively considered. Exemption shall not relieve the applicant from
implementing such measures as are necessary to protect health, safety and
property. For example:
 
If a property owner proposes a 150 square foot shed after adoption of the
municipal stormwater management chapter, that property owner would be exempted
from water quality and quantity requirements of the chapter as noted in Table 1
of the chapter. If, at a later date, the property owner proposes to construct a
499 square foot room addition, the applicant would be required to comply with
the requirements for the Simplified Method for the full 649 square feet of
impervious cover created since adoption of the municipal chapter. If an
additional 700 square foot swimming pool/patio is proposed later, the property
owner would be required to implement the full stormwater quantity and quality
control submission requirements of this chapter for the total 1,349 square feet
of additional impervious surface added to the original property since adoption
of the municipal regulations.

an integrated pest management (IPM) plan).
      (4)   While streets and highways (average daily traffic volume (ADT)
greater than 30,000 are not considered stormwater hotspots, it is important to
ensure that highway stormwater management facilities are designed to adequately
protect receiving streams and/or groundwater.
      (5)   The Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) NPDES stormwater
program requires some industrial sites to prepare and implement a stormwater
pollution prevention plan.
   (u)   (1)   The following standards for protection of downgradient

to development of other stormwater management site plan design elements:
         A.   Prepare an existing resource and site analysis map (ERSAM)
showing environmentally sensitive areas including, but not limited to, steep

(Ord. 928, passed 6-18-2014)
§ 1043.16 INFILTRATION VOLUME REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Providing for infiltration consistent with the natural hydrologic
regime is required. Design of the infiltration facilities shall consider
infiltration to compensate for the reduction in the recharge that occurs when
the ground surface is disturbed or impervious surface is created.
   (b)   (1)   If it cannot be physically accomplished, then the design
professional shall be responsible for demonstrating to the satisfaction of the
municipality that this cannot be physically accomplished on the site (e.g.,
shallow depth to bedrock or limiting zone, open voids, steep slopes and the
like versus a financial hardship as defined in §
1043.11). If it can be physically accomplished, the volume of runoff to be
infiltrated shall be determined from subsection (c)(2) below depending on
demonstrated site conditions, and shall be the greatest volume that can be
physically infiltrated.
      (2)   For example:
         A.   Any applicant (developer or redeveloper) shall first attempt to
infiltrate the volume required in subsection (c)(2)A. below;
         B.   If the subsection (c)(2)A. below requirement cannot be physically
accomplished, then the applicant is required to attempt to infiltrate the
volume required in (c)(2)B. below;
         C.   Finally, if the subsection (c)(2)B. below infiltration volume
cannot be physically accomplished, the applicant must, at a minimum, infiltrate
the volume required in subsection (c)(2)C. below.
   (c)   Infiltration BMPs shall meet the following minimum requirements.
      (1)   Infiltration BMPs intended to receive runoff from developed or
redeveloped areas shall be selected based on suitability of soils and site
conditions and shall be constructed on soils that have the following
characteristics:
         A.   A minimum depth of 24 inches between the bottom of the BMP and
the top of the limiting zone;
         B.   An infiltration rate sufficient to accept the additional
stormwater volume and dewater completely as determined by field tests conducted
by the applicant’s design professional; and
         C.   The infiltration facility shall be capable of completely draining
the retention (infiltration) volume (Rev) within three days (72 hours) from the
end of the design storm.
      (2)   The size of the infiltration facility and Rev shall be based upon
the following volume criteria.
         A.   Modified Control Guideline One (MCG-1) of the Pennsylvania
Stormwater Best Management Practices (PA BMP) Manual. The retention
(infiltration) volume (Rev) to be captured and infiltrated shall be the net
two-year 24-hour volume. The net volume is the difference between the post-
development runoff volume and the pre-development runoff volume. The post-
development total runoff volume for all storms equal to or less than the two-
year 24-hour duration precipitation shall not be increased. For modeling
purposes, existing (pre-development) non-forested pervious areas must be
considered meadow in good condition or its equivalent, and 20% of existing
impervious area, when present, shall be considered meadow in good condition.
         B.   1.   Infiltrating the entire Rev volume in subsection (c)(2)A.
(above) may not be feasible on every site due to site-specific limitations such
as shallow depth to bedrock or the water table. If it cannot be physically
accomplished, then the following criteria from Modified Control Guideline Two
(MCG-2) of the PA BMP Manual must be satisfied.
            2.   At least the first one-inch of runoff from new or replacement
impervious surfaces shall be infiltrated.
 
Rev= 1 (inch) * impervious area (square feet) + 12 (inches) = cubic feet (cf)
An asterisk (*) in equations denotes multiplication.
 
         C.   1.   Only if infiltrating the entire Rev volume in subsection (c)
(2)B. above cannot be physically accomplished, then the following minimum
criteria from Modified Control Guideline Two (MCG-2) of the PA BMP Manual must
be satisfied:
            2.   a.   Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be
designed to accommodate infiltration of the entire water quality volume (WQv)
(§
1043.17(a)); however, in all cases at least the first one-half inch of the WQv
shall be infiltrated. The minimum infiltration volume (Rev) required would,
therefore, be computed as:
 
Rev= I * impervious area (square feet) + 12 (inches) = cubic feet (cf)
An asterisk (*) in equations denotes multiplication.
Where:
   I= The maximum equivalent infiltration amount (inches) that the site can
physically accept or 0.50 inch, whichever is greater.
 
               b.   The retention volume values derived from the methods in
subsections (c)(2)A., (c)(2)B. or (c)(2)C. above is the minimum volume the
applicant must control through an infiltration BMP facility. If site conditions
preclude capture of runoff from portions of the impervious area, the
infiltration volume for the remaining area should be increased an equivalent
amount to offset the loss.
               c.   Only if the minimum of one-half inch of infiltration
requirement cannot be physically accomplished, a waiver from this section is
required from the municipality.
   (d)   Soils: a detailed soils evaluation of the project site shall be
required to determine the suitability of infiltration facilities. The
evaluation shall be performed by a qualified design professional and at minimum
address soil permeability, depth to bedrock and subgrade stability. The general
process for designing the infiltration BMP shall be:
      (1)   Analyze hydrologic soil groups as well as natural and human-made
features within the site to determine general areas of suitability for
infiltration practices. In areas where development on fill material is under
consideration, conduct geotechnical investigations of sub-grade stability;
infiltration may not be ruled out without conducting these tests;
      (2)   Provide field tests such as double ring infiltrometer or hydraulic
conductivity tests (at the level of the proposed infiltration surface) to
determine the appropriate hydraulic conductivity rate. Percolation tests are
not recommended for design purposes;
      (3)   Design the infiltration structure for the required retention (Rev)
volume based on field determined capacity at the level of the proposed
infiltration surface; and
      (4)   If on-lot infiltration structures are proposed by the applicant’s
design professional, it must be demonstrated to the municipality that the soils
are conducive to infiltrate on the lots identified.
   (e)   Infiltration facilities should, to the greatest extent practicable, be
located to avoid introducing contaminants via groundwater, and be in
conformance with an approved source water protection assessment or source water
protection plan.
   (f)   Roadway drainage systems should provide an opportunity to capture
accidental spills. Road de-icing material storage facilities shall be designed
to avoid salt and chloride runoff from entering waterways and infiltration
facilities. The qualified design professional shall evaluate the possibility of
groundwater contamination from the proposed infiltration facility and perform a
hydrogeologic justification study if necessary.
   (g)   The antidegredation analysis found in Pa. Code Ch. 93.4 et seq. shall
be applied in HQ or EV streams.
   (h)   An impermeable liner will be required in detention basins where the
possibility of groundwater contamination exists. The municipality may require a
detailed hydrogeologic investigation.
   (i)   The applicant should provide safeguards against groundwater
contamination for land uses that may cause groundwater contamination should
there be a mishap or spill.
(Ord. 928, passed 6-18-2014)
§ 1043.17 WATER QUALITY VOLUME REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   (1)   The applicant shall comply with the following water quality
requirements of this subchapter.
      (2)   A.   To control post-construction stormwater impacts from regulated
activities and conform to state water quality requirements, BMPs which
replicate pre-development stormwater infiltration and runoff conditions must be
provided in the site design such that post-construction stormwater discharges
do not degrade the physical, chemical or biological characteristics of the
receiving waters.
         B.   This may be achieved by the following:
            1.   Infiltration: replication of pre-construction stormwater
infiltration conditions;
            2.   Treatment: use of water quality treatment BMPs to provide
filtering of chemical and physical pollutants from the stormwater runoff; and
            3.   Stream bank and stream bed protection: management of volume
and rate of post-construction stormwater discharges to prevent physical
degradation of receiving waters (e.g., from scouring).
      (3)   A.   Developed areas shall provide adequate storage and treatment
facilities necessary to capture and treat stormwater runoff. The infiltration
volume computed under §
1043.16 may be a component of the water quality volume if the applicant chooses
to manage both components in a single facility. If the calculated water quality
volume (WQv) is greater than the volume required to be infiltrated as described
in §
1043.16(c)(2), then the difference between the two volumes shall be treated for
water quality by an acceptable stormwater management practice(s). The required
water quality volume (WQv) is the storage capacity needed to capture and treat
a portion of stormwater runoff from the developed areas of the site.
         B.   To achieve this requirement, the following criterion is
established:
            1.   From Control Guideline (CG-I) in the PA BMP Manual, the water
quality volume shall be the net two-year 24-hour volume. The net volume is the
difference between the post-development runoff volume and the pre-development
runoff volume. The post-development total runoff volume for all storms equal to
or less than the two-year 24-hour duration precipitation shall not be
increased. For modeling purposes, existing (pre-development) non-forested
pervious areas must be considered meadow in good condition or its equivalent,
and 20% of existing impervious area, when present, shall be considered meadow
in good condition.
            2.   This volume requirement can be managed by the permanent volume
of a wet basin or the detained volume from other BMPs. Where appropriate, wet
basins shall be utilized for water quality control and shall follow the
guidelines of the PA BMP manual referenced in
Appendix H.
            3.   Release of water can begin at the start of the storm (i.e.,
the invert of the water quality orifice is at the invert of the facility). The
design of the facility shall provide for protection from clogging and unwanted
sedimentation.
   (b)   The temperature of receiving waters shall be protected through the use
of BMPs that moderate temperature.
   (c)   If a perennial or intermittent stream passes through, or a waterbody
(i.e., lake, pond, wetland) is present on the site, the applicant shall create
a riparian buffer extending a minimum of 50 feet, subject to federal and state
buffer policies and regulation, to either side of the top-of-bank of the
channel, lake or wetland. The buffer area shall be planted with native
vegetation and maintained in a vegetated state (Refer to
Appendix B, Pennsylvania Native Plant List, contained in the PA BMP Manual.)
      (1)   The following provisions also apply to riparian buffers on lots in
existence at the time of adoption of this chapter:
         A.   If the applicable rear or side yard setback is less than 50 feet,
the buffer width may be reduced to 25% of the setback or ten feet, whichever is
greater.
         B.   If a stream traverses a site in a manner that significantly
reduces the use of the site, the buffer may be either:
            1.   Reduced to 25 feet on either side, with municipal approval; or
            2.   Reduced to ten feet with municipal waiver.
      (2)   Permitted uses within the buffer include the following, subject to
municipal approval and provided that they comply with all federal, state and
local regulations:
         A.   Recreational trails; (See
Appendix G Riparian Buffer Trail Guidelines.)
         B.   Utility rights-of-way;
         C.   Bridges; and
         D.   Other uses subject to municipal approval.
      (3)   If an existing buffer is legally prescribed (i.e., deed, covenant,
easement and the like) and it exceeds the requirements of this chapter, the
existing buffer shall be maintained.

§ 1043.18 STREAM BANK EROSION REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   In addition to controlling the water quality volume (in order to
minimize the impact of stormwater runoff on downstream stream bank erosion),
the primary requirement to control stream bank erosion is to design a BMP to
detain the proposed conditions two-year, 24-hour design storm to the existing
conditions one-year flow using the SCS Type II distribution. Additionally,
provisions shall be made (such as adding a small orifice at the bottom of the
outlet structure) to release the proposed conditions one-year storm for a
minimum of 24 hours from a point in time when the maximum volume of water from
the one-year storm is stored in a proposed BMP (i.e., the maximum water surface
elevation is achieved in the facility). Release of water can begin at the start
of the storm (i.e., the invert of the water quality orifice is at the invert of
the facility).
   (b)   The minimum orifice size in the outlet structure to the BMP shall be
three inches in diameter where possible, and a trash rack shall be installed to
prevent clogging. On sites with small drainage areas contributing to this BMP
that do not provide enough runoff volume to allow a 24-hour attenuation with
the three-inch orifice, the calculations shall be submitted showing this
condition. When the calculated orifice size is below three inches, gravel
filters (or other methods) are recommended to discharge low-flow rates subject
to the Municipal Engineer’s satisfaction. When filters are utilized,
maintenance provisions shall be provided to ensure filters meet the design
function. All facilities shall make use of measures to extend the flow path and
increase the travel time of flows in the facility.
(Ord. 928, passed 6-18-2014)
§ 1043.19 STORMWATER PEAK RATE CONTROL.
   (a)   Division into districts. Each watershed has been divided into either
stormwater management districts or release rate districts as shown on the
respective management district or release rate maps in
Appendix A.
      (1)   In addition to the watershed-specific requirements specified in
Table 2 and 3 for each of the watersheds below, the erosion and sedimentation
control (§
1043.14), the nonstructural project design (§
1043.15), the infiltration (§
1043.16), the water quality (§
1043.17) and the stream bank erosion (§
1043.18) requirements shall be implemented.
      (2)   Standards for managing runoff from each subarea in a watershed for
the two-, five-, ten-, 25-, 50- and 100-year design storms are shown in Tables
2 and 3. Development sites located in each of the management/release rate
districts must control proposed conditions runoff rates to existing conditions
runoff rates for the design storms in accordance with the tables.
   (b)   General. Proposed conditions rates of runoff from any regulated
activity shall not exceed the peak release rates of runoff from existing
conditions for the design storms specified on the stormwater management
district watershed map (
Appendix A) and this section.
   (c)   District boundaries. The boundaries of the stormwater management
districts are shown on an official map that is available for inspection at the
municipal and County Planning offices. A copy of the official map at a reduced
scale is included in
Appendix A. The exact location of the stormwater management district boundaries
as they apply to a given development site shall be determined by mapping the
boundaries using the two-foot topographic contours (or most accurate data
required) provided as part of the SWM site plan.
   (d)   Sites located in more than one district or watershed. For a proposed
development site located within two or more stormwater management district
subareas, the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall meet the management
district criteria for which the discharge is located. The natural hydrology of
each respective subarea shall be maintained, and drainage shall not be
redirected from one subarea to another. Under circumstances where the applicant
shows this cannot be accomplished, a waiver is required by the municipality.

   (e)   Off-site areas. Off-site areas that drain through a proposed
development site are not subject to release rate criteria when determining
allowable peak runoff rates. On-site drainage facilities shall be designed to
safely convey off-site flows through the development site.
   (f)   Site areas. Where the site area to be impacted by a proposed
development activity differs significantly from the total site area, only the
proposed impact area utilizing stormwater management measures shall be subject
to the peak rate control standards noted above. Unimpacted areas for which the
discharge point has not changed are not subject to the peak rate control
standards.
   (g)   Downstream hydraulic capacity analysis. Any downstream capacity
hydraulic analysis conducted in accordance with this chapter shall use the
following criteria for determining adequacy for accepting increased peak flow
rates:
      (1)   Natural or human-made channels or swales must be able to convey the
increased runoff associated with a two-year storm event within their banks at
velocities consistent with protection of the channels from erosion. Velocities
shall be based upon criteria and methodologies acceptable to the municipality.
      (2)   Natural or human-made channels or swales must be able to convey
increased 25-year storm event runoff without creating any increased hazard to
persons or property.
      (3)   Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other hydraulic facilities
which must pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in
accordance with 25 Pa. Code Ch. 105 (if applicable) and, at a minimum, pass the
increased 25-year storm event runoff.
      (4)   Water quality requirements defined in §
1043.17 must be met.
      (5)   Post construction peak rates shall not exceed the existing peak
rates for the respective subarea.
   (h)   Alternate criteria for redevelopment sites. For redevelopment sites,
one of the following minimum design parameters shall be accomplished, whichever
is most appropriate for the given site conditions as determined by the
municipality:
      (1)   Meet the full requirements specified by Tables 2 and 3 and
subsections (a) through (g) above; or
      (2)   Reduce the total impervious surface on the site by at least 20%,
based upon a comparison of existing impervious surface to proposed impervious
surface. In this case, calculations must be provided that show the peak rate
has not increased.

§ 1043.20 CALCULATION METHODOLOGY.
   (a)   Stormwater runoff from all development sites with a drainage area of
greater than five acres shall be calculated using a generally accepted
calculation technique that is based on the NRCS Soil Cover Complex Method.
Table 4 summarizes acceptable computation methods. The method selected by the
design professional shall be based on the individual limitations and
suitability of each method for a particular site. The use of the Rational

condition”. Portions of a site having more than one viable tree measuring a
diameter at breast height (DBH) of six inches or greater per 1,500 square feet
shall be considered wooded where such trees existed within three years of
application.
         B.   The undeveloped portion of the site including agriculture, bare
earth and fallow ground shall be considered as “meadow in good condition”,
unless the natural ground cover generates a lower curve (CN) number or Rational
V value (i.e., woods) as listed in Tables D-1 or D-2 in
Appendix D of this chapter.
      (2)   For redevelopment sites, the ground cover used in determining the
existing conditions flow rates for the developed portion of the site shall be
based upon actual land cover conditions.
   (d)   All calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall
intensities consistent with appropriate times-of-concentration (duration) and
storm events with rainfall intensities obtained from NOAA Atlas 14 partial
duration series estimates, or the latest version of the PennDOT Drainage Manual
(PDM Publication 584), whichever is greater. Times of concentration shall be
calculated based on the methodology recommended in the respective model used.
Times of concentration for channel and pipe flow shall be computed using
Manning’s equation.
   (e)   Runoff curve numbers (CN) for both existing and proposed conditions to
be used in the Soil Cover Complex Method shall be obtained from Table D-1 in
Appendix D of this chapter.
   (f)   Runoff coefficients (c) for both existing and proposed conditions for
use in the Rational Method shall be obtained from Table D-2 in
Appendix D of this chapter.
   (g)   Hydraulic computations to determine the capacity of pipes, culverts

APPENDIX B: SIMPLIFIED APPROACH TO STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FOR
SMALL PROJECTS
Applicability: Stormwater management procedures for projects with between 500
square feet and 999 square feet of proposed impervious area.
   SIMPLIFIED APPROACH TO STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FOR SMALL PROJECTS
Introduction
The following procedures have been developed to allow homeowners to comply with
stormwater management criteria for new projects to meet the requirements of the
Act 167 Stormwater Management ordinance of the municipality including sizing,
designing, locating and installing on-lot measures, referred to herein as “Best
Management Practices” (BMPs). Pennsylvania Act 167 was authorized on October 4,
1978 (32 P.S. §§ 680.1 et seq.) and gave Pennsylvania municipalities the power
to regulate activities that affect stormwater runoff and surface and
groundwater quantity and quality.
Individual home construction projects on single-family lots which result in
between 500 square feet and 999 square feet of impervious area (including the
building footprint, driveway, sidewalks and parking areas) are not required to
submit formal drainage plans to the municipality or county; however, they are
still required to address water quality and infiltration goals as outlined in
this Simplified Approach document. If the guidelines presented in this brochure
are followed, the individual homeowner will not require professional services
to comply with these water quality and infiltration goals.
Section B.1 describes requirements and a simplified method for designing a
suitable BMP, and a description of what needs to be included on the simple
sketch plan. Section B.2 presents definitions of key terms. Section B.3
presents options of BMPs that can be considered for on-lot stormwater
management. An example of how to obtain the size and dimensions of a BMP is
explained in Section B.4. Section B.5 describes the requirements to be met for
the modified Operation, Maintenance and Inspection Plan.
The Simplified Approach requires:
•    The first one inch of rainfall runoff from new impervious surfaces to be
captured (see definition in Section B.2).
The purpose of this is to help reduce stormwater runoff in the community, to
maintain groundwater recharge, to prevent degradation of surface and
groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources and public safety.
What needs to be sent to the municipality?
Even though a formal drainage plan is not required for individual lot owners,
the Simplified Method worksheet found in Table B-4 and a simple sketch plan
containing the features described in Step 5 of Section B.1 needs to be
submitted to the municipality, and if applicable, the contractor prior to
construction. The Operation and Maintenance Agreement found in Section B.5
needs to be signed and submitted with the simple sketch plan to the
municipality for approval.
B.1 Determination of Simplified Approach Volume Requirements
All proposed impervious areas must be included in the determination of the
amount of new impervious areas and the size of proposed BMPs needed to control
stormwater. Proposed impervious areas on an individual residential lot include:
roof area; pavement; sidewalks; driveways; patios; porches; permanent pools; or
parking areas. Sidewalks, driveways or patios that are constructed with gravel
or pervious pavers that will not be converted to an impervious surface in the
future need not be included in this calculation. Therefore, the amount of
proposed impervious area can be reduced for proposed driveways, patios and
sidewalks through the use of gravel, pervious pavement and turf pavers. All
proposed impervious areas must be constructed so that runoff is conveyed to a
BMP; no runoff can be directed to storm sewers, inlets or other impervious
areas (i.e., street).
In addition, the use of low impact development is recommended to further
minimize the effect of the new construction on water, land and air. Low impact
development is a method of development that incorporates design techniques that
include: minimizing the amount of land disturbance; reducing impervious cover;
disconnecting gutters and directing runoff to vegetated areas to infiltrate;
and redirecting the flow of runoff from impervious driveways to vegetated areas
instead of to the street or gutter.
Below are the steps that must be undertaken to meet the chapter requirements.
The results obtained for each step must be included in the Simplified Method
Worksheet found in Table B-4:
STEP 1 - Determine the total area of all proposed impervious surfaces that will
need to drain to one or more BMPs. Determine locations where BMPs need to be
placed so that runoff from all of the proposed impervious surfaces can be
captured. Select the BMPs to be used and determine the requirements of each
from Section B.3. For instance, the back half of a garage may drain 200 square
feet of roof to a rain barrel, and the front half of a garage may drain 200
square feet of roof and 540 square feet of driveway to a bioretention area.
Then, obtain the required storage volume and surface area needed for each of
the proposed BMPs from the appropriate heading below.
For Rain Barrels/Cisterns
STEP 2 - Select the proposed impervious area value in Column 1 of Table B-
1 that is closest to, but not less than, the determined value.
STEP 3 - Determine the volume that needs to be provided in cubic feet and
gallons to satisfy the volume requirements using Columns 2 and 3 in Table B-1.

For Rain Gardens/Bioretention or Dry Well #1:
STEP 2 - Select the proposed impervious area value in Column 1 of Table B-
2 that is closest to, but not less than, the determined value.
STEP 3 - Determine the volume that needs to be provided in cubic feet to
satisfy the volume requirements using Column 2 in Table B-2.
STEP 4 - Using the value from Column 2 determined above, select the depth (D)
of the proposed BMP, and then simply determine the surface area needed for that
depth from Column 3 of Table B-2.
Note: The arrows under Column 3 in Table B-2 indicate which range of depths is
appropriate for each BMP. To determine the depth based on the area, select an
area that corresponds to the required volume that is closest to, but not more
than the area to be used. To determine the area based on the depth, select a
depth that is closest to, but not less than, the depth that is to be used.

For Infiltration Trench or Dry Well #2:
STEP 2 - Select the proposed impervious area value in Column 1 of Table B-
3 that is closest to, but not less than, the determined value.
STEP 3 - Determine the volume that needs to be provided in cubic feet to
satisfy the volume requirements using Column 2 in Table B-3.
STEP 4 - Using the value from Column 2 determined above, select the depth (D)
of the proposed BMP, and then simply determine the surface area needed from
Column 3 of Table B-3.
Note: The arrows under Column 3 in Table B-3 indicate which range of depths is
appropriate for each BMP. To determine the depth based on the area, select an
area that corresponds to the required volume that is closest to, but not less
than, the area to be used. To determine the area based on the depth, select a
depth that is closest to, but not less than, the depth that is to be used.
STEP 5 - Sketch a simple site plan as shown in Figure B-1 that includes:
•   Name and address of the owner of the property, and or name and address of
the individual preparing the plan, along with the date of submission;
•   Location of proposed structures, driveways or other paved areas with
approximate size in square feet;
•   Location, orientation and dimensions of all proposed BMPs. For all rain
gardens/bioretention, infiltration trenches, and dry wells, the length, width
and depth must be included on the plan. For rain barrels or cisterns the volume
must be included;
•   Location of any existing or proposed on-site septic system and/or potable
water wells showing rough proximity to infiltration facilities.
•   Location of any existing waterbodies such as streams, lakes, ponds,
wetlands or other waters of the commonwealth within 50 feet of the project
site, and the distance to the project site and/or BMPs. The project or BMPs
cannot be located less than 50 feet away from a perennial or intermittent
stream. If an existing buffer is legally prescribed (i.e., deed, convenant,
easement and the like) and it exceeds the requirements of this chapter, the
existing buffer shall be maintained.
•   Location of all existing structures including buildings, driveways and
roads within 50 feet of the project site.
Fill in the simplified method worksheet found in Table B-4, then submit the
worksheet and the simple site sketch to the municipality. Additionally, the
operation and maintenance agreement found in Section B.5 must be signed and
submitted to the municipality.

B.2 Definitions
Best Management Practice (BMP) - Activities, facilities, designs, measures, or
procedures used to manage stormwater impacts from land development, to protect
and maintain water quality and groundwater recharge and to otherwise meet the
purposes of this Chapter 1043, including but not limited to infiltration
trenches, dry wells, bioretention, rain gardens, permeable paving, rain barrels
and cisterns.
Capture - Collecting runoff to be stored for reuse or allowed to slowly
infiltrate into the ground.
Geotextile - A fabric manufactured from synthetic fiber that is used to achieve
specific objectives, including infiltration, separation between different types
of media (i.e., between soil and stone), or filtration.
Hotspot - Areas where land use or activities generate highly contaminated
runoff, with concentrations of pollutants that are higher than those that are
typically found in stormwater (e.g., vehicle salvage yards and recycling
facilities, vehicle fueling stations, fleet storage areas, vehicle equipment
and cleaning facilities, and vehicle service and maintenance facilities).
Impervious Surface - A surface that prevents the infiltration of water into the
ground. Impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, streets,

plant roots, evaporated into the atmosphere or percolated downward to recharge
groundwater.
Low Impact Development - A land development and construction approach that uses
various land planning, design practices and technologies to simultaneously
conserve and protect natural resource systems, and reduce infrastructure costs.
Pervious Surface - Any surface that is not impervious.
Runoff - Any part of precipitation that flows over the land surface.
Stormwater - Drainage runoff from the surface of the land resulting from
precipitation or snow or ice melt.
Void Ratio - The ratio of the volume of void space to the volume of solid
substance in any material.
B.3 Description of BMPs
The following is a description of several types of BMPs that could be
implemented. The requirements of each BMP as described below are taken directly
from the PA BMP Manual. Refer to the PA BMP Manual which can be found on the PA
Department of Environmental Protection’s website.
Rain Barrels/Cisterns
Rain barrels are large containers that collect drainage from roof leaders and
temporarily store water to be released to lawns, gardens and other landscaped
areas after the rainfall has ended. Rain barrels are typically between 50 and
200 gallons in size. The stored water can also be used as a non-potable water
supply. Cisterns are larger than rain barrels having volumes of 200 gallons or
more, and can be placed on the surface or underground. Figures B-2 and B-3 show
examples of rain barrels and cisterns, respectively, that could be used. Rain
barrels and cisterns are manufactured in a variety of shapes and sizes. All of
these facilities must make provisions for the following items.
   •   There must be a means to release the water stored between storm events
in order for the necessary storage volume to be available for the next storm.
   •   Stormwater must be kept from entering other potable systems, and pipes
and storage units must be clearly marked “Do Not Drink”.
   •   An overflow outlet should be placed a few inches below the top with an
overflow pipe to divert flow away from structures.
   •   Use screens to filter debris, and covers (lids) to prevent mosquitoes.
   •   Make sure cisterns are water-tight and do not leak.
   •   Rain barrels are typically assumed to be 25% full to calculate volume
since they are not always emptied before each storm.*

   *This 25% has already been taken into account in Table 3.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2761.png]
 
Infiltration Trench
An infiltration trench is a long, narrow, rock-filled trench with or without a
perforated pipe that receives stormwater runoff and has no outlet. Runoff is
stored in the void space between the stones and in the pipe and infiltrates
through the bottom and into the underlying soil matrix. Infiltration trenches
perform well for removal of fine sediment and associated pollutants. Figure B-
4 shows a typical infiltration trench configuration. Infiltration trenches
shall incorporate or make provisions for the following elements.
   •   Perforated pipe is to be set level.
   •   The width is limited to between three and eight feet, and the depth
ranges from two to six feet.
   •   Trench should be wrapped in nonwoven geotextile (see definition in
Section B.2) on the top, sides and bottom.
   •   There should be a positive overflow that allows stormwater that cannot
be stored or infiltrated to be discharged into a nearby vegetated area.
   •   Roof downspouts may be connected to infiltration trenches, but should
contain a cleanout to collect sediment and debris before entering the
infiltration area.
   •   Infiltration testing is recommended to ensure that the soil is capable
of infiltrating stormwater. A description of how an infiltration test is
performed is found in Appendix C of the PA BMP Manual.
   •   It is recommended that there be a two-foot clearance above the regularly
occurring seasonal high water table and a minimum depth to bedrock of two feet.
   •   The infiltration trench should be at least 50 feet from individual water
supply wells, 100 feet from community or municipal water supply wells, and 50
feet from any septic system component. It should not be located near hotspots
(see definition in Section B.2).
   •   The infiltration trench should be located so that it presents no threat
to sub-surface structures such as building foundations and basements.
   •   Protect infiltration areas from compaction.
   •   The ratio of the collected area to the footprint of the facility should
be as small as possible with a ratio of less than 5:1 preferred.
   Figure B-4: Typical Infiltration Trench

IMAGES/0-0-0-2763.png]
 
Rain Garden/Bioretention Area
A rain garden (bioretention area) is an excavated depression area on the
surface of the land in which native vegetation is planted to filter and use
stormwater runoff. Runoff ponds on top of the surface of the rain garden and
then infiltrates into an enhanced soil below the surface where plants can use
the water to grow. Bioretention also improves water quality, vegetation filters
the water, and the root systems encourage or promote infiltration. Figure B-
5 shows a typical rain garden. Key elements of a rain garden include:
   •   Ponding depths of one foot or less (recommended);
   •   Native vegetation that can tolerate dry and wet weather;
   •   An overflow area where, if the bioretention area were to overflow, the
water would flow over pervious area (i.e., grass, meadow), and would not cause
harm to property; or
      *   An overflow such as a domed riser to allow excess flow from large
storms to travel to other substantial infiltration areas or pervious areas.
   •   Typical side slopes of 3:1 are recommended, with 2:1 being the maximum;
and
   •   The soil/planting mix depth should be between 1.5 feet and 6 feet deep.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2765.png]
 
Dry Wells
A dry well, also referred to as a seepage pit is a subsurface storage facility
that temporarily stores and infiltrates runoff from the roofs of buildings or
other impervious surfaces. A dry well can be either a structural prefabricated
chamber (Dry Well #1) or an excavated pit filled with stone fill (Dry Well #2).
Dry wells discharge the stored runoff via infiltration into the surrounding or
underlying soils. Figure B-6 shows a typical prefabricated dry well and a
typical dry well configuration with stone fill. The following elements shall be
incorporated into all dry well designs.
   •   These facilities should be located a minimum of ten feet from the
building foundation to avoid foundation seepage problems and are not
recommended if their installation would create a risk for basement flooding.
   •   Construction of a dry well should be performed after surface soils in
all other areas of the site are stabilized to avoid clogging.
   •   During construction, compaction of the subgrade soil in the bottom of
the dry well should be avoided, and construction should be performed only with
light machinery.
   •   Depth of a dry well should be between one and one-half feet and four
feet. Gravel fill should consist of stone of an average of one and one-half to
three inches in diameter with the gravel fill wrapped in a nonwoven geotextile
that separates the stone fill from the surrounding soil.
   •   At least one foot of soil needs to be placed over the top of the dry
well.
   •   Dry wells should be inspected at least four times annually as well as
after large storm events.
   •   Dry wells should have overflow pipes to allow high volumes of runoff to
connect to other on-site substantial infiltration areas or pervious areas.
   •   Every dry well needs to have at least one monitoring well.
   •   Infiltration testing is recommended to ensure that the underlying soil
is capable of infiltrating the needed volume of stormwater.

B.4 Example
Simplified Approach Volume Determination:
Joe Homeowner wants to build a 400 square foot two car garage, and a 540 square
foot (30 ft. long x 18 ft. wide) impervious driveway that is graded so that the
stormwater runoff drains to the grassy area along one edge of the driveway. (A
duplicate of Table B-1 is provided below in Table B-5, a duplicate of Table B-
3 is provided below in Table B-6 and outlines the steps of this example) a
duplicate of Figure B-1 (Figure B-7) and a duplicate of Table B-4 are provided
in Table B-7.
STEP 1 - Determine the total area of all proposed impervious surfaces to drain
to each BMP:
 
Garage Roof (Front)               10 ft. x 20 ft. = 200 sq. ft
Garage Roof (Rear)                10 ft. x 20 ft. = 200 sq. ft.
Driveway (Front)                  30 ft. x 18 ft. = 540 sq. ft.
                                                   -------------------
Total Proposed Impervious Surface                   940 sq. ft.
 
Note: If the driveway used pervious pavement (i.e., paving blocks), then the
total impervious area would only be 400 square feet, and no stormwater
management practices would need to control runoff from the driveway.
Select a BMP or combination of BMPs from Section B.3 to be used to satisfy the
volume requirement. Determine the length, width, depth and other requirements
for the BMPs in Section B.3. A BMP needs to be placed to catch runoff from the
back of the garage, and a BMP needs to be placed to capture runoff from the
front of the garage and the driveway. Figure B-7 shows the direction the runoff
flows and the locations where the BMPs are to be placed.
Joe Homeowner would like to use a rain barrel (BMP #1) to capture the runoff
from the rear of the garage and an infiltration trench (BMP #2) to capture
runoff from the front of the garage and the driveway.
STEP 2 and 3 for BMP #1 (Rain Barrel/Cistern)
STEP 2 - Select the proposed impervious area value for BMP #1, the rain barrel
or cistern, in Column 1 that is closest to, but not less than 200 in Table B-5:
The value in Column 1 that is closest to but is not less than 200 is 200.
STEP 3 - Determine the volume that BMP #1 must be to satisfy the volume
requirements using Columns 2 and 3 in Table B-5:
The volume in gallons of the rain barrel/cistern to be used as BMP #1, assuming
the rain barrel/cistern is 25% full, is determined by finding the row in Column
3 that corresponds to the impervious area value determined in Step 1.
Therefore, the volume of BMP #1, the rain barrel/cistern must be 166 gallons. A
combination of rain barrels could be used in succession as shown in Figure B-2,
or a cistern could be used.
   Table B-5: Example - Calculating Storage Volume for Rain Barrel/Cistern

IMAGES/0-0-0-2769.png]
 
STEPS 2 through 4 for BMP #2 (Infiltration Trench)
STEP 2 - Select the proposed impervious area value for BMP #2, the infiltration
trench, using Column 1 in Table B-6:
Find the row in Column 1 that is closest to but not less than 740 (200 from the
front of the garage + 540 from the driveway). Therefore, the value selected is
750.
STEP 3 - Determine the volume that BMP #2, the infiltration trench must be to
satisfy the volume requirements using Column 2 in Table B-6:
The volume of the infiltration trench to be used as BMP #2, assuming a void
ratio of 40%, is determined by finding the row in Column 2 that is in the same
row as 750 square feet from Step 2. Therefore, the volume of BMP #2 must be 156
cubic feet.
STEP 4 - Utilizing the value from Column 2 determined above, and the surface
area that the proposed BMP will occupy, identify the proposed depth and
corresponding surface area needed using Column 3 in Table B-6:
Joe Homeowner would like to place the infiltration trench along the edge of the
driveway that the runoff drains to, so it would have a length of 20 feet. The
smallest width that can be used, as stated in the infiltration trench
requirements in Section B.3, is three feet. Therefore, the area of the
infiltration trench is:
20 * 3 = 60 square feet
To find the minimum depth of the trench, move toward the right side of the
table from 156 cubic feet in Column 2 to Column 3, and find the column with a
value of as close to but not more than 60 square feet, which is 52 square feet.
Then obtain the minimum depth of the facility by reading the depth from the
column heading at the top of the table. Therefore, the depth of the trench
would need to be three feet.
Selected BMPs: Rain barrel(s) 166 gallons and a 20 ft. long by 3 ft. wide by 3
ft. deep infiltration trench
STEP 5 - Make a sketch of the site plan as shown in Figure B-7, and fill in the
simplified method worksheet found as shown in Table B-7.

   WHEREAS, for the purposes of this agreement, the following definition shall
apply:
   •   BMP - “Best Management Practice”; activities, facilities, designs,
measures or procedures used to manage stormwater impacts from land development,
to protect and maintain water quality and groundwater recharge, and to
otherwise meet the purposes of the Municipal Stormwater Management Ordinance,
including, but not limited to, infiltration trenches, dry wells, bioretention,
rain gardens, permeable paving, rain barrels, and cisterns.
   WHEREAS, it is required that the BMP or BMPs as shown on the simple sketch
plan further referred to as the “Plan” and in accordance with the sizing
calculations found on the simplified method worksheet further referred to as
the “Calculation Worksheet” be constructed and maintained by the Landowner, its
administrators, executors, successors, heirs or assigns.
   WHEREAS, the Municipality requires that stormwater management BMPs be
constructed and adequately operated and maintained by the Landowner, its
administrators, executors, successors, heirs, or assigns, in accordance with
the following maintenance requirements.
   •   Vegetation along the surface of an infiltration trench should be
maintained in good condition, and any bare spots should be revegetated as soon
as possible.
   •   Vehicles shouldn’t be parked or driven on an infiltration trench, and
care should be taken to avoid excessive compaction by mowers.
   •   Any debris such as leaves blocking flow from reaching an infiltration
trench or bioretention/rain garden should be routinely removed.
   •   While vegetation is being established, pruning and weeding may be
required for a bioretention/rain garden.
   •   Mulch in a bioretention/rain garden needs to be re-spread when erosion
is evident. Once every two to three years or after major storms the entire area
may require mulch replacement.
   •   At least twice a year the landowner needs to inspect the bioretention/
rain garden for sediment buildup and vegetative conditions.
   •   During periods of extended drought, the bioretention/rain garden
requires watering. Trees and shrubs in a bioretention/rain garden need to be
inspected at least twice per year by the landowner to evaluate their health. If
they are in poor health, they need to be replaced.
   •   Dry wells need to be inspected by the landowner at least four times a
year and after significant rainfalls, and debris/trash, sediment and any other
waste material need to be removed and disposed of at suitable disposal/
recycling sites and in compliance with local, state and federal waste
regulations.
   •   For dry wells, gutters need to be regularly cleaned out, and proper
connections must be maintained to facilitate the effectiveness of the dry well.
   •   The filter screen for the dry well that intercepts roof runoff must be
replaced as necessary.
   •   Dry wells that are damaged need to be fixed or replaced within two weeks

APPENDIX C: LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT (LID) PRACTICES
LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT (LID) PRACTICES
ALTERNATIVE APPROACH FOR
MANAGING STORMWATER RUNOFF
Natural hydrologic conditions can be altered radically by poorly planned
development practices such as introducing unnecessary impervious surfaces,
destroying existing drainage swales, constructing unnecessary storm sewers and
changing local topography. A traditional drainage approach of development has
been to remove runoff from a site as quickly as possible and capture it in a
detention basin. This approach leads ultimately to the degradation of water
quality as well as expenditure of additional resources for detaining and
managing concentrated runoff at some downstream location.
The recommended alternative approach is to promote practices that will minimize
proposed conditions runoff rates and volumes, which will minimize needs for
artificial conveyance and storage facilities. To simulate pre-development
hydrologic conditions, infiltration is often necessary to offset the loss of
infiltration by creation of impervious surfaces. The ability of the ground to
infiltrate depends upon the soil types and its conditions.
Preserving natural hydrologic conditions requires careful alternative site
design considerations. Site design practices include preserving natural
drainage features, minimizing impervious surface area, reducing the hydraulic
connectivity of impervious surfaces, and protecting natural depression storage.
A well-designed site will contain a mix of all of those features. The following
describes various techniques to achieve the alternative approach:
   •   Preserving Natural Drainage Features. Protecting natural drainage
features, particularly vegetated drainage swales and channels, is desirable
because of their ability to infiltrate and attenuate flows and to filter
pollutants. However, this objective is often not accomplished in land
development. In fact, commonly held drainage philosophy encourages just the
opposite pattern - streets and adjacent storm sewers are typically located in
the natural headwater valleys and swales, thereby replacing natural drainage
functions with a completely impervious system. As a result, runoff and
pollutants generated from impervious surfaces flow directly into storm sewers
with no opportunity for attenuation, infiltration, or filtration. Developments
designed to fit site topography also minimize the amount of grading on site.
   •   Protecting Natural Depression Storage Areas. Depressional storage areas
either have no surface outlet or drain very slowly following a storm event.
They can be commonly seen as ponded areas in farm fields during the wet season
or after large runoff events. Traditional development practices eliminate these
depressions by filling or draining, thereby obliterating their ability to
reduce surface runoff volumes and trap pollutants. The volume and release rate
characteristics of depressions should be protected in the design of the
development site. The depressions can be protected by simply avoiding the
depression or by incorporating its storage as additional capacity in required
detention facilities.
   •   Avoiding Introduction of Impervious Areas. Careful site planning should
consider reducing impervious coverage to the maximum extent possible. Building
footprints, sidewalks, driveways and other features producing impervious
surfaces should be evaluated to minimize impacts on runoff.
   •   Reducing the Hydraulic Connectivity of Impervious Surfaces. Impervious
surfaces are significantly less of a problem if they are not directly connected
to an impervious conveyance system (such as a storm sewer). Two basic ways to
reduce hydraulic connectivity are routing of roof runoff over lawns and
reducing the use of storm sewers. Site grading should promote increasing travel
time of stormwater runoff and should help reduce concentration of runoff to a
single point in the development.
   •   Routing Roof Runoff Over Lawns. Roof runoff can be easily routed over
lawns in most site designs. The practice discourages direct connection of
downspouts to storm sewers or parking lots. The practice also discourages
sloping driveways and parking lots to the street. By routing roof drains and
crowning the driveway to run off to the lawn, the lawn is essentially used as a
filter strip.
   •   Reducing the Use of Storm Sewers. By reducing use of storm sewers for
draining streets, parking lots and back yards, the potential for accelerating
runoff from the development can be greatly reduced. The practice requires
greater use of swales and may not be practical for some development sites,
especially if there are concerns for areas that do not drain in a “reasonable”
time. The practice requires educating local citizens and public works officials
who expect runoff to disappear shortly after a rainfall event.
   •   Reducing Street Widths. Street widths can be reduced by either
eliminating on-street parking or by reducing roadway widths. Municipal planners
and traffic designers should encourage narrower neighborhood streets which
ultimately could lower maintenance.
   •   Limiting Sidewalks to One Side of the Street. A sidewalk on one side of
the street may suffice in low-traffic neighborhoods. The lost sidewalk could be
replaced with bicycle/recreational trails that follow back-of-lot lines. Where
appropriate, backyard trails should be constructed using pervious materials.
   •   Using Permeable Paving Materials. These materials include permeable
interlocking concrete paving blocks or porous bituminous concrete. Such
materials should be considered as alternatives to conventional pavement
surfaces, especially for low use surfaces such as driveways, overflow parking
lots and emergency access roads.
   •   Reducing Building Setbacks. Reducing building setbacks reduces
impervious cover associated with driveway and entry walks and is most readily
accomplished along low-traffic streets where traffic noise is not a problem.
   •   Constructing Cluster Developments. Cluster developments can also reduce
the amount of impervious area for a given number of lots. The biggest savings
occurs with street length, which also will reduce costs of the development.
Cluster development groups the construction activity in less-sensitive areas
without substantially affecting the gross density of development.
In summary, a careful consideration of the existing topography and
implementation of a combination of the above mentioned techniques may avoid
construction of costly stormwater control measures. Benefits include reduced
potential for downstream flooding and water quality degradation of receiving
streams/water bodies, enhancement of aesthetics and reduction of development
costs. Other benefits include more stable baseflows in receiving streams,
improved infiltration, reduced flood flows, reduced pollutant loads and reduced
costs for conveyance and storage.

APPENDIX E: WEST NILE VIRUS GUIDANCE
WEST NILE VIRUS GUIDANCE
(This source is from the Monroe County, PA Conservation District that
researched the potential of West Nile Virus problems from BMPs due to a number
of calls they were receiving.)
   Monroe County Conservation District Guidance:
   Stormwater Management and West Nile Virus
   Source: Brodhead McMichaels Creeks Watershed Act 167 Stormwater Management
   Ordinance Final Draft 2-23-2004
   The Monroe County Conservation District recognizes the need to address the
problem of nonpoint source pollution impacts caused by runoff from impervious
surfaces. The new stormwater policy being integrated into Act 167 stormwater
management regulations by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection (PennDEP) will make nonpoint pollution controls an important
component of all future plans and updates to existing plans. In addition, to
meet post-construction anti-degradation standards under the state National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting program, applicants
will be required to employ Best Management Practices (BMPs) to address nonpoint
pollution concerns.
   Studies conducted throughout the United States have shown that wet basins
and in particular constructed wetlands are effective in traditional stormwater
management areas such as channel stability and flood control and are one of the
most effective ways to remove stormwater pollutants (United States
Environmental Protection Agency 1991, Center for Watershed Protection 2000).
From Maryland to Oregon, studies have shown that as urbanization and impervious
surfaces increase in a watershed, the streams in those watersheds become
degraded (CWP 2000). Although there is debate over the threshold of impervious
cover when degradation becomes apparent (some studies show as little as 6%
while others show closer to 20%), there is agreement that impervious surfaces
cause nonpoint pollution in urban and urbanizing watersheds and that
degradation is ensured if stormwater BMPs are not implemented.
   Although constructed wetlands and ponds are desirable from a water quality
perspective, there may be concerns about the possibility of these stormwater
management structures becoming breeding grounds for mosquitoes. The
Conservation District feels that although it may be a valid concern,
municipalities should not adopt ordinance provisions prohibiting wet basins for
stormwater management.
Mosquitoes
   The questions surrounding mosquito production in wetlands and ponds have
intensified in recent years by the outbreak of the mosquito-borne West Nile
Virus. As is the case with all vector-borne maladies, the life cycle of West
Nile Virus is complicated, traveling from mosquito to bird, back to mosquito,
and then to other animals including humans. Culex pipiens was identified as the
vector species in the first documented cases from New York in 1999. This
species is still considered the primary transmitter of the disease across its
range. Today there are some 60 species of mosquitoes that inhabit Pennsylvania.
Along with C. pipiens, three other species have been identified as vectors of
West Nile Virus while four more have been identified as potential vectors.
   The four known vectors in Northeastern Pennsylvania are Culex pipiens, C.
restuans, C. salinarius and Ochlerotatus japonicus. All four of these species
prefer, and almost exclusively use, artificial containers (old tires, rain
gutters, birdbaths and the like) as larval habitats. In the case of C. pipiens,
the most notorious of the vector mosquitoes, the dirtier the water, the better
they like it. The important factor is that these species do not thrive in
functioning wetlands where competition for resources and predation by larger
aquatic and terrestrial organisms is high.
   The remaining four species, Aedes vexans, Ochlerotatus Canadensis, O.
triseriatus, and O. trivittatus, are currently considered potential vectors due
to laboratory tests (except the O. trivittatus, which did have one confirmed
vector pool for West Nile Virus in PA during 2002). All four of these species
prefer vernal habitats and ponded woodland areas following heavy summer rains.
These species may be the greatest threat of disease transmission around
stormwater basins that pond water for more than four days. This can be
mitigated, however, by establishing ecologically functioning wetlands.
Stormwater Facilities
   If a stormwater wetland or pond is constructed properly and a diverse
ecological community develops, mosquitoes should not become a problem. Wet
basins and wetlands constructed as stormwater management facilities should be
designed to attract a diverse wildlife community. If a wetland is planned,
proper hydrologic soil conditions and the establishment of hydrophytic
vegetation will promote the population of the wetland by amphibians and other
mosquito predators. In natural wetlands, predatory insects and amphibians are
effective at keeping mosquito populations in check during the larval stage of
development while birds and bats prey on adult mosquitoes.
   The design of a stormwater wetland must include the selection of hydrophytic
plant species for their pollutant uptake capabilities and for not contributing
to the potential for vector mosquito breeding. In particular, species of
emergent vegetation with little submerged growth are preferable. By limiting
the vegetation growing below the water surface, larvae lose protective cover,
and there is less chance of anaerobic conditions occurring in the water.
   Stormwater ponds can be designed for multiple purposes. When incorporated
into an open space design, a pond can serve as a stormwater management facility
and a community amenity. Aeration fountains and stocked fish should be added to
keep larval mosquito populations in check.
   Publications from the Pennsylvania Department of Health and the Penn State
Cooperative Extension concerning West Nile Virus identify aggressive public
education about the risks posed by standing water in artificial containers
(tires, trash cans, rain gutters, bird baths) as the most effective method to
control vector mosquitoes.
Conclusion
   The Conservation District understands the pressure faced by municipalities
when dealing with multifaceted issues such as stormwater management and
encourages the incorporation of water quality management techniques into
stormwater designs. As Monroe County continues to grow, conservation design,
infiltration and constructed wetlands and ponds should be among the preferred
design options to reduce the impacts of increases in impervious surfaces. When
designed and constructed appropriately, the runoff mitigation benefits to the
community from these design options will far outweigh their potential to become
breeding grounds for mosquitoes.

APPENDIX G: RIPARIAN BUFFER TRAIL GUIDELINES
   Riparian Buffer Trail Guidelines
Introduction
Riparian buffers are used as non-structural best management practices (BMPs)
for protecting and enhancing water quality. Depending on their size, location
and design, riparian buffers often supply additional environmental, economic,
aesthetic and recreational value. Passive recreational trails can be a
compatible use within riparian buffers if the trails are sized and placed
appropriately. The trail guidelines below are meant to supplement §
1043.17, Water Quality Requirements, and do not alter or modify the regulations
set forth in §
1043.12, General Requirements. All other applicable rules and requirements
should be followed, including all federal, state, permitting, and local
stormwater and floodplain ordinances.
Installing a trail does not relieve a developer or municipality of the minimum
buffer and vegetation requirements described in §
1043.17(c), or infiltration and peak rate controls in §§
1043.16 and
1043.19. Effort shall be made to mitigate water quality and peak rate adjacent
the trail structure to avoid collecting runoff in a large facility and creating
a point discharge. This can be accomplished by trail-side stone filtration
trenches, vegetative filter strips, small bio-retention facilities and other
mechanisms subject to site constraints and Municipal Engineer approval. See
Figure G-1. In situations where site constraints negate the feasibility of
trail-side mitigation methods, effort shall be made to collect runoff in
multiple stormwater facilities for segmented portions of the trail, in place of
detaining stormwater in one large facility. Level spreaders shall be
constructed at facility outlets to decrease point-source discharges.
As with all trails, adequate land acquisition, easements and/or landowner
permission should be obtained in advance of any trail placement. Care should be
given when designing and installing trails so as not to compromise the buffer’s
ability to protect water quality. Many factors such as slope, vegetation and
soil type will determine the type, size and placement of the trail within the
riparian buffer. Heavily used trails and trails with wide impervious surfaces
should be set back farther from the stream edge to help mitigate the effects of
any associated increase in runoff. Note: failure to comply with these
guidelines (installing a trail with inadequate setback from the stream bank)
could result in increased stormwater runoff, decreased water quality, stream
bank degradation and damage to the buffer or trail.
Trail Recommendations
Location, Size, and Orientation
   All trails should be a reasonable width appropriate for the site conditions.
It is not recommended that the width of any paved trail exceed 25% of the total
buffer width. All trail designs and specifications are subject to approval by
the municipality.
Natural vegetation must be present throughout the buffer as described in §
1043.17 of the chapter. Grassy areas should be managed as meadows or be
reforested and should not be mowed as lawn in any part of the buffer. Where
existing vegetation is insufficient to protect water quality, additional native
species should be planted to enhance the buffer.
Paved trails, if appropriate to the site, are permitted and must be located at
least 25 feet from the top of the stream bank. In limited instances, paved
trails be placed closer to a stream due to topography, or in order to
accommodate passive educational and recreational activities, but must always be
at least ten feet from the top of the stream bank. Although this can be
achieved by diverting the entire trail closer to the stream, more conservative
methods should be considered, such as smaller spur trails or loop trails. These
smaller trails provide access to the stream, but reduce the total traffic along
the sensitive stream bank.
In rare instances where the buffer width is reduced due to zoning setback or
geographical constraints, the municipality should strongly consider whether the
benefits of a trail outweigh the benefits of a wider buffer.
Signage
The installation of interpretive and educational signage is strongly encouraged
along the trail. Signs should point out local natural resources and educate the
public on how riparian buffers protect the watershed. There should be minimum
disturbance in the vegetated buffer between the trail and the stream.
Therefore, all appurtenances (e.g., benches, educational signs, kiosks,
fountains and the like). should be installed on the landward side of the trail,
if possible. All appurtenances shall be installed in compliance with federal,
state, local, stormwater, floodplain and other regulations and permitting
requirements (e.g., anchoring and the like).
Parking Areas
New trailheads and trail parking areas shall meet all the infiltration, rate
control and minimum setback requirements of this chapter. Every effort should
be made to coordinate trail access with existing parking areas. Any new parking
areas and trailhead clearings should not encroach on the riparian buffer in any
way.
Trail Maintenance
The installation and maintenance of all trails should be performed in a manner
that minimizes site disturbance and prevents runoff and erosion. Soil
disturbance should be avoided if possible. The removal of native trees and
other native vegetation should also be kept to a minimum. If large or heavy
equipment is required for trail installation, special care should be given not
to damage existing trees and tree roots.

§ 1050.04 APPLICATION FOR A RIGHT-OF-WAY PERMIT FOR NON-PUC REGULATED PERSONS.
   (a)   A right-of-way permit for non-PUC regulated persons shall only be
granted after an applicant has completed an application in the form that has
been prescribed by the township, which form may be revised from time to time.
Upon request, an applicant shall be provided with a copy of the then current
application for a right-of-way permit. The application shall request
information regarding the applicant’s proposed or actual physical use and
occupation of the rights-of-way. The applicant shall provide specific
information regarding the equipment it proposes to place or currently maintains
in the rights-of-way. If the completed application does not fully provide such
requested information, the township may request such additional information as
is necessary to enable it to make a determination regarding the physical use
and occupation of the rights-of-way by the applicant. For purposes of
determining the commencement of the township’s review process, the application
shall be deemed to have been filed on the day all information requested by the
township has been received by the township.
   (b)   Upon the filing of a fully completed application to the township and
the accompanying fee, the township shall review the application as follows.
This fee will be refunded in the event the application is denied. If the
application is granted, the application fee will apply to the full term of the
right-of-way permit of one year. The township shall grant or deny such
applications within 45 days of its filing. If the township denies the
application, it shall provide a written response to the applicant explaining
the basis for denial. If the township fails to grant or reject such application
within the time period specified above, the application shall be deemed
approved. In each case, the township shall review the application to determine
whether such use would have a detrimental effect on public safety as it relates
to the rights-of-way or would place an undue physical burden on the rights-of-
way.
   (c)   In considering an application, the township may use such experts as it
deems appropriate to make an informed decision. In the event the township deems
it necessary to employ an outside expert or experts to advise the township with
respect to a particular application, the reasonable costs of such expert or
experts shall be borne by the applicant.
   (d)   A person shall have no recourse whatsoever against the township for
any loss, cost, expense or damage arising out of the failure to grant a permit.
By applying for a permit, the applicant acknowledges that it has not been
induced to apply for or accept a permit by any understanding or promise or
other statement, whether verbal or written, by or on behalf of the township or
by any other third person concerning any term or condition of a permit not
expressed in this chapter.
(Ord. 985, passed 11-20-2018)
§ 1050.05 DURATION OF RIGHT-OF-WAY PERMIT.

   (a)   (1)   Except in the case of an emergency, before commencing any
construction in the rights-of-way, a person shall apply for and obtain a

applicant has completed an application in the form that has been prescribed by
the township, which form may be revised from time to time. Upon request, an
applicant shall be provided with a copy of the current application for a
construction permit. Such application shall request detailed plans of the
proposed construction activity.
      (2)   Such plans shall describe:
         A.   The type of construction activity;

         C.   The specific locations of the construction activity; and
         D.   The scheduled beginning and ending dates of all planned
construction.
      (3)   For purposes of determining the commencement of the township’s
review process, the application shall be deemed to have been filed on the day
all information requested by the township has been received by the township.
   (b)   Upon the filing of a fully completed application and the accompanying
fee, the township shall review such information and either grant or deny a
construction permit within 45 days. If the township denies the construction
permit, the township will provide a written response to the applicant
explaining the basis of the denial. If the township fails to grant or deny the
construction permit within the time period specified above, the application
shall be deemed granted. In each case, the township shall review the
application to determine whether such construction would have a detrimental
impact on public safety as it relates to the rights-of-way. The township may
impose conditions on the construction permit regulating the times, locations,
and manner of construction to preserve effective traffic flow, prevent
hazardous road conditions and/or minimize noise impacts.
(Ord. 985, passed 11-20-2018)
§ 1050.07 FEES AND EXPENSES.
   (a)   (1)   Each person with equipment in the right-of-way permit shall pay
an annual right-of-way management fee to compensate the township for its costs
incurred in connection with the ongoing use and occupancy of the right-of-way.

authorized by resolution of the Township Board of Commissioners.
      (2)   A.   This fee is directly related to the township’s costs in
reviewing the application and managing the rights-of-way with respect to each
permit holder.

limited to:
            1.   Costs of maintaining the rights-of-way;

application an application fee in the amount of $500. This fee is directly
related to the township’s costs in reviewing the application and determining
time, place and manner restrictions on the construction activity. If the
application for a construction permit is denied, this fee shall not be
refunded. If the application is granted, then the applicant shall also pay,
within 30 days of the presentation of a statement, the township’s actual costs
directly related to the applicant’s construction activity based on the hourly
rate established by resolution of the Township Board of Commissioners. Such
actual costs include, but are not limited to, costs of disruption and rerouting
of traffic, inspection costs and administrative costs.
   (c)   Extraordinary expenses: in addition to the fees set forth above, a
person shall pay, within 30 days of the presentation of a statement, any
extraordinary or unusual expenses reasonably incurred by the township as a
result of the person’s use of the rights-of-way, provided that the township
notifies the person of the expected expenses prior to them being incurred and
provides such person with an opportunity to mitigate such expenses. Examples of
extraordinary or unusual costs include, but are not limited to, the cost of
obtaining and operating a backhoe, dump truck or other heavy equipment used to
repair the right-of-way, overtime or special pay for public safety and/or
public works personnel and/or the cost of hazardous waste cleanup or other
emergency services. The statement of such expenses presented to the person
shall be directly related to the township’s actual costs.

not subject to additional fees; and
      (3)   Persons using the same line to provide cable television service and
to provide telecommunications services shall be subject to a cable television
franchise fee, but not a right-of-way management fee. Such persons shall be
subject to all other fees set by this chapter.
   (e)   In the event that payment of any of the fees identified above is not
made upon submission of the application or by the date due, the person shall
pay a late payment penalty of 2% per month of the total amount past due. Such
penalty shall be in lieu of any other monetary penalty.

§ 1050.08 MANAGEMENT OF THE RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
   (a)   The township shall have the right to limit the placement of new or
additional equipment in the right-of-way if there is insufficient space to
reasonably accommodate all requests to occupy and use the rights-of-way in a
manner that is consistent with public safety. The township shall consider
requests for occupying and using the rights-of-way in the order of receipt of
fully completed applications for right-of-way permits. The township shall
strive, to the extent possible, to accommodate all requests, but shall be
guided by the physical condition of the right-of-way and whether such use would
have a detrimental effect on public safety as it relates to the right-of-way.
   (b)   Any telecommunications systems and the equipment related thereto
located in the rights-of-way shall not interfere with any wired or wireless
telecommunications system being operated or managed by the township.

   (a)   Whenever a person or any of its subcontractors shall disturb any
pavement, sidewalk or other public property in order to perform any underground
activities, such person will fully comply by registering with the state’s “One
Call” system pursuant to 73 P.S. §§ 176 et seq. Such person shall provide the

person shall either replace the tree with a tree of similar quality or fully
compensate the property owner for any damage to such tree.
   (c)   The telecommunications system shall not endanger or interfere with the
safety of persons or property within the township. All operating, maintenance,

claims for personal injury, including death, and property damage to public or
private property arising out of the person’s use or occupancy of the rights-of-
way. Such person shall defend any actions or proceedings against the township
in which it is claimed that personal injury, including death, or property
damage was caused by the person’s use or occupancy of the rights-of-way. The
obligation to indemnify, hold harmless and defend shall include, but not be
limited to, the obligation to pay judgments, injuries, liabilities, damages,
reasonable attorney fees, reasonable expert fees, court costs and all other
costs of indemnification.

liability insurance policies for which defense will be provided as to all such
coverages. All required insurance coverage shall provide for 30 days’ notice to
the township in the event of material alteration or cancellation of such
coverage prior to the effective date of such material alteration or
cancellation. Such person shall provide appropriate insurance certificates to
the township within 30 days after the execution of a permit and annually with

§ 1060.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ASHES. The residue from the burning of wood, coal, coke and other
combustible materials for the purposes of heating and cooking. It does not
include the cinders produced in steam generating plants.
   GARBAGE. The animal and vegetable waste resulting from the handling,
preparation, cooking and consumption of foods. It does not include more than a
minimum amount of free liquids. It does not include food processing waste from
canneries, packing plants or similar industries or large quantities of
condemned food products.
   RUBBISH. All waste materials not included in garbage and ashes, except
building rubbish from building construction or reconstruction, street refuse,
industrial refuse, dead animals, abandoned machinery or vehicles or parts
thereof or such other waste materials as are not commonly produced in homes,
stores and institutions, for which exceptions there shall be no collection by
the township.
   REFUSE. Garbage, ashes and rubbish as herein defined.
   SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING. Any household or family dwelling when said dwelling
does not exceed two living units in number. SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING does not
include garden apartments, condominiums, townhouses, buildings or groups or
buildings having common ownership containing or comprising multiple-family
dwelling units of more than two units in number.
(Ord. 336, passed 12-18-1968; Ord. 652, passed 6-21-1989)
§ 1060.02 SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLINGS; COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES.
   (a)   All ashes, rubbish and garbage accumulated in any single-family
dwelling in the Township shall be collected, conveyed and disposed of by the
township, and the cost of such service shall be paid for as provided in the
schedule of fees set forth in §
1060.05 by the person owning the building from where the ashes, rubbish and
garbage came.
   (b)   No person shall collect and dispose of any refuse within the township
except as provided in this chapter.
   (c)   Because of the great amount of refuse being accumulated by shopping
centers, supermarkets, manufacturing plants, stores and restaurants, the
collection of which would unduly burden the facilities of the township, all
shopping centers, supermarkets, manufacturing plants, stores and restaurants
shall dispose of their own refuse, in water-tight vehicles provided with tight
covers, and so operated as to prevent offensive odors escaping therefrom and
refuse being blown, dropped or spilled.
   (d)   No person owning or operating a shopping center, supermarket, store or
restaurant, or the agent or employee of such person, shall dispose of any such
refuse within the township.
(Ord. 336, passed 12-18-1968; Res. 309-A, passed 12-30-1970)
§ 1060.03 PRECOLLECTION PRACTICES.
   (a)   Garbage shall be wrapped in paper and placed in the same container
with the trash. Unwrapped garbage shall not be collected. Wrapping facilitates
the handling of the garbage and assures a more complete combustion at the
incinerator plant. All refuse shall be placed in a closed container or securely
packaged. Loose trash and overfilled open containers shall not be collected and
the owner shall be subject to a fine for littering.
   (b)   Refuse shall be collected by the township from private residences
only. Business establishments and other nonresidential occupants shall provide
for their own refuse collection.
   (c)   Refuse shall be placed along the edge of a paved street.
   (d)   No container shall be larger than or weigh over 40 pounds gross
weight. Containers in excess of this weight limitation or larger than 40
gallons shall not be collected. All refuse shall be securely packaged to
prevent littering. Closed metal or plastic containers are recommended (no
cardboard containers). Paper bags are permitted for recycling of newspaper
only, no glass, metal, wood, sharp objects or perishables in plastic bags
allowed. The Public Works Department Road Foreman has the right to refuse the
collection of containers or items he or she feels would be detrimental or
harmful to the Public Works Department employees
   (e)   Nails and other sharp objects in boards shall be removed or safely
covered.
   (f)   No item over four feet in length shall be collected.
   (g)   Subject to the provisions of §
1060.04(b)(2), no earth, washer, dryer, refrigerator, stove, sofa, bed, metal
pipe over four feet in length or other large item of household furniture shall
be collected.
   (h)   No person shall place any refuse in any street, highway, alley or
other public place, or upon any private property, whether owned by such person
or not, within the township, unless such refuse is placed in receptacles as
above described, for collection, or under an express approval granted by the
Board of Township Commissioners. No person shall throw or deposit any refuse in
any stream or body of water.
   (i)   Any unauthorized accumulation of refuse on any premises is hereby
deemed to be a nuisance and is prohibited. Failure to remove any existing
accumulation of refuse within 30 days after the effective date of this chapter
(Ord. 336, passed December 18, 1968) shall be deemed a violation of the
provisions hereof.
   (j)   No person, other than the occupants of the premises upon which the
refuse receptacles are stored, or the collector, shall remove the covers or any
of the contents of refuse receptacles.
   (k)   Refuse receptacles shall be placed for collection at ground level on
the property, within the right-of-way of a street, highway or alley, but not on
the paved cartway, and accessible to, and not more than ten feet from, the side
of the highway, street or alley from which collection is made, provided that
receptacles may be placed for collection at other than ground level, and at a
distance of more than ten feet, when approved by the Road Master.
   (l)   No trash, rubbish or garbage to be collected by the township under
this chapter shall be put out at the curb for collection more than 24 hours
prior to the scheduled collection and pick-up of said trash, rubbish or
garbage. Refuse containers must be collected from the curb the same day as
collection.
(Ord. 336, passed 12-18-1968; Ord. 652, passed 6-21-1989; Ord. 827, passed 6-
15-2005; Ord. 892, passed 6-15-2011)
§ 1060.04 COLLECTION PRACTICES.
   (a)   Frequency of collection. Refuse shall be collected at least once a
week. Shopping centers, supermarkets, manufacturing plants, stores and
restaurants which are required to dispose of their refuse shall dispose of the
same at least once a week, and where necessary to protect the public health and
safety, the Board of Health of the township may require that more frequent
collections be made.
   (b)   Limitation on quantity.
      (1)   It is the intention of this chapter that a reasonable accumulation
of refuse for each family for the collection period shall be collected for the
standard charge. The township may refuse to collect unreasonable accumulations
of refuse, or, at its discretion, may make an additional charge for such
additional amounts.
      (2)   Large trash items shall be collected not less frequently than six
times per year. Large trash items, within the meaning of this section, shall
consist of all household items such as furniture, rugs, radios, television
sets, toys and items too large for regular trash pick-up. Large trash items
shall not include washers, dryers, refrigerators or stoves, otherwise known as
“white metal appliances”. Any playground equipment, such as swings, seesaws and
the like, shall be completely dismantled before it is placed for collection to
be removed from the premises. The collection of large trash items, or big trash
pick-up, shall be accomplished during the first full week of the month, unless
the Monday beginning the first full week of the month falls on a holiday, in
which event the big trash pick-ups shall be accomplished during the second week
of the month.
      (3)   It is the intention of this chapter that shopping centers,
supermarkets, manufacturing plants, stores and restaurants shall privately
contract for collection and have their accumulation of refuse collected at
reasonable times so that there shall not be an undue or unreasonable amount
accumulated prior to collection.
      (4)   “White metal appliances”, as defined in subsection (b)(2) above,
shall be picked up at the curb once a month on a call-in basis only. Fees for
the pick-up of white metal appliances shall be paid in advance. The service of
white metal appliance pick-up shall be limited to residents of the township.
   (c)   Special refuse problems.
      (1)   Contagious disease refuse. The removal of wearing apparel, bedding
or other refuse from homes or other places where highly infectious or
contagious diseases have prevailed, shall be performed under the supervision
and direction of the Board of Health. Such refuse shall not be placed in
containers for regular collection.
      (2)   Inflammable or explosive refuse. Highly inflammable or explosive
material shall not be placed in containers for regular collection but shall be
disposed of as directed by the Board of Health, at the expense of the owner or
possessor thereof.

law.

(Ord. 360, passed 9-19-1990; Ord. 764, passed 10-15-1997)
§ 1224.07 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   The applicant, in any activity requiring a permit, and which involves
ten or less single-family residences, after commencing initial operation, shall
request, in writing, inspection by the Township Engineer:
      (1)   Upon completion of stripping, the stockpiling of topsoil and
disposal of all unsuitable material, but prior to beginning any other
preparation of the ground;
      (2)   Upon completion of preparation of ground to receive fill, but prior
to beginning any placement;
      (3)   Upon completion of rough grading, but prior to placing topsoil,
permanent drainage or other site development improvements and ground covers;
      (4)   Upon completion of final grading, permanent drainage and erosion
control facilities, including established ground covers and planting, and all
other work of the permit; and
      (5)   Prior to construction of the foundation, the Township Engineer
shall confirm the proposed first floor elevation by field inspection. If the
proposed elevation is determined to be inappropriate, or if it would result in
poor drainage of the property, the Township Engineer may order changes in the
proposed elevation. Additionally, the Township Engineer may also order grading
field changes to improve the drainage prior to the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy.
   (b)   The applicant, in all other cases other than that referred to in
subsection (a) above, after commencing initial operations, shall request, in
writing, inspections by the Township Engineer, at the following stages in the
development of the site, or of each subdivision thereof:
      (1)   Prior to commencement of grading operations to determine
suitability of all proposed fill materials;
      (2)   Upon completion of stripping, the stockpiling of topsoil and
disposal of all unsuitable material, but prior to beginning or any other
preparation of the ground;
      (3)   Upon completion of the preparation of an area to receive fill and
prior to the beginning of placement, an inspection of the proof rolling
procedure; and
      (4)   Upon completion of structural fill placement such that the
following earthfill procedures are assured.
         A.   Prior to placing fill in any area, grading should be performed as
required to provide for drainage. Ditching or filling around the area should be
performed to intercept or divert all surface water. Within the area on which
fill is to be placed, the ground should be graded so as to provide for
unobstructed drainage from every point to some disposal point.
         B.   The area should be closely examined to determine whether
excessive wetness, springs or other seepage of water can be observed. If such
conditions exist, drainage must be provided before placement of fill is
undertaken.
         C.   When the fill area has been prepared as specified, the existing
ground surface should be compacted by the specified method for compacting fill.
         D.   Fill should begin at the lowest section of the area. Fill should
be spread in six-inch layers prior to compaction. Each layer should be
approximately horizontal, but small slopes can be permitted in order to provide
for surface runoff.
         E.   Each layer of fill should be inspected prior to compaction. All
roots, vegetation or debris should be removed. Stones larger than six inches in
diameter should be removed or broken. The moisture content of each layer should
be determined to be suitable for compaction.
         F.   The compaction of the fill should be done with a sheepsfoot
roller, rubber tired roller or a vibratory roller. Other compaction equipment
should be used only after it has demonstrated that satisfactory results can be
obtained with it.
         G.   Each layer of compacted fill should be tested to determine its
dry density as per ASTM D 1556. The density of each layer should be not less
than 95% of maximum dry density as determined by ASTM D 1557. The moisture
content of the compacted layer should be not more than 4% less or 2% greater
than the optimum moisture as determined by ASTM D 1557.
         H.   Only when the compacted layer has been shown to be as specified,
should other layers of fill be placed above it.
         I.   Visual inspection of borrow materials should be made periodically
to assure that no variation in the fill material has occurred.

§ 1224.08 COST OF INSPECTIONS.
   All applicants shall bear all costs of inspections required hereunder, and
shall deposit with the Township Treasurer such sums as the Township Board of
Commissioners shall determine, to guarantee payment of the costs of such
inspections. The cost of inspections shall be at the rate charged to the
township by the Township Engineer.

unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   APPLICATION FOR IMPROVEMENT OF LAND. Every application for land development
as detailed below, whether preliminary or final, required to be filed and
approved prior to the start of construction or development, including, but not
limited to, an application for the approval of a subdivision plot or plan, for
the approval of a land development plat or plan, or for the approval of a
development plan.
   DEVELOPMENT PLAN. Provisions for land development, including a plot of a
subdivision, all covenants relating to use, location and bulk of buildings and
other structures, intensity of use or density of development, streets, ways and
parking facilities, common open space and public facilities. The phrase
“provisions of the development plan”, when used herein, shall mean the written
and graphic materials referred to in this definition.
   LAND DEVELOPMENT. Any of the following activities:
      (1)   The improvement of one lot or two or more contiguous lots, tracts
or parcels of land for any purpose involving:
         A.   A group of six or more residential or nonresidential buildings,
whether proposed initially or cumulatively; or
         B.   The division or allocation of land or space, whether initially or
cumulatively, between or among six or more existing or prospective occupants by
means of, or for the purpose of, streets, common areas, leaseholds,
condominiums, building groups or other features.
      (2)   A subdivision of land involving six or more residential buildings

provided, however, that the subdivision by lease of land for agricultural
purposes into parcels of more than ten acres, not involving any new street or
easement of access or residential dwellings, shall be exempted.
(Ord. 657, passed 10-18-1989)
§ 1226.02 PROVISIONS FOR PARK AND RECREATIONAL SITES REQUIRED.
   Each application for improvement of land shall make provision for park and
recreational sites and land to serve the proposed improvement of land and the
future residents, occupants and users thereof, or in lieu thereof the applicant
shall make payment of a sum of money to be used for the acquisition and
development of such sites and land.
(Ord. 657, passed 10-18-1989)
§ 1226.03 SET ASIDE FOR LAND OR MONEY REQUIRED; USE OF MONEYS.
   (a)   Each application for improvement of land of a residential development,
PRD excluded, shall set aside 2,000 square feet of land for each residential
dwelling unit in the proposed development for park and recreational use, and
each application for improvement of land of a commercial or industrial
development shall set aside 5% of the land in the tract proposed to be
developed for park and recreational use.
   (b)   In lieu of setting aside land for park and recreational use, the
applicant for improvement of land shall pay to the township an amount
calculated as follows: an amount equal to the average fair market value per
acre of the undeveloped land as part of an approved improvement of land,
multiplied by the amount of land required to be reserved for park and
recreational use as set forth in subsection (a) above. Payment shall be due and
payable upon approval of the application for improvement of land and/or the
execution by the applicant of any required development agreement. The average
fair market value shall be as determined between the township and the
applicant, and absent such an agreement the average fair market value shall be
determined by common law arbitration with the parties agreeing on a single
arbitrator. If the parties are unable to agree upon a single arbitrator, the
parties shall petition the Presiding Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of the
county for designation of a single arbitrator. The cost of the arbitration and
the cost of petitioning the Presiding Judge shall be equally divided between
the township and the applicant. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final
and binding upon the parties. Upon the selection of the arbitrator, the
applicant shall deposit with the township financial security equal to the
payment due as determined by the township.
   (c)   All moneys paid and authorized under this chapter shall be placed by
the township and deposited in an interest-bearing account clearly identifying
the recreational facilities for which the fee was received. Interest earned on
such account shall become funds of that account. Funds from such account shall
be expended only in properly allocable portions of the cost incurred to
construct the specific recreation facilities for which the funds were
collected.
   (d)   Upon the request of any person who paid any fee under this chapter,
the municipality shall refund such fee, plus interest accumulated thereon from
the date of payment, if the township has failed to utilize the fees paid for
the purposes set forth in this section within three years from the date such
fees were paid.
(Ord. 657, passed 10-18-1989)
§ 1226.04 DETERMINATION OF TYPE OF SET ASIDE.
   (a)   The Board of Commissioners, upon its own initiative or at the request
of the applicant, giving consideration to the side, share and location of the
location of the land in the proposed development proposal for park and
recreational use and giving consideration to the availability of other park and
recreational sites in the general area, shall determine whether land in the
proposed development shall be set aside for park and recreational use or
whether the applicant shall be required to make payment of sum of money in lieu
thereof to be used for the acquisition and development of other such sites and
land.
   (b)   (1)   In the event the Board approves the reservation of land for park
and recreational purposes as provided in §
1226.03(a), the following provisions must be observed. The areas to be reserved
as recreational land shall be conveyed to the township upon approval of the
application for improvement of land and/or the execution by the applicant of
any required development agreement, unless the Board determines that the land
is of such location and nature that its use is limited to local residents or
that it cannot reasonably be maintained by the township. If public dedication
of the land is rejected by the township, the land may alternatively be conveyed
to a legally constituted homeowner’s association or retained by and managed by
such private ownership as the Board may approve, so long as its use remains
open to the residents of the proposed development. In the event that the
recreational land is to be privately owned, adequate provision must be made for
its maintenance.
      (2)   The Board or its designate shall determine if the land is
acceptable for dedication or use for park and recreational purposes based on
the following criteria.
         A.   The dedicated land must be readily accessible to all residents or
expected users of the development. For larger pieces of dedicated land, this
should be by virtue of at least one side of each site abutting a public street
for a minimum distance of 50 feet. If public easements are the sole access,
they shall be wide enough to accommodate two-way traffic of maintenance
equipment.
         B.   The park and recreational land shall be located, to the extent
possible, so that it equally serves all residents or expected users of the
improvement of land.
         C.   The shape shall be suitable to accommodate those park and
recreational activities appropriate to the location and needs of the residents
or expected users of the development. The exact shape is variable, but the
property shall be easily adaptable to a wide variety of activities.
         D.   Soil shall be suitable for the intended park and recreational
uses.
         E.   It is desirable for the intended park and recreational land to be
in several well placed and adequately sized areas so that it can accommodate
the anticipated uses, rather than to have numerous useless smaller pieces.
         F.   Such land shall not have an average slope exceeding 7% and shall
have no more than 30% of the land contained within the boundaries of a
floodplain.
   (c)   The developer of high density housing shall receive a credit for any
land reserved for park and recreational purposes and accepted by the township
under this chapter towards any provision of the Township Zoning Code requiring
recreational facilities.
   (d)   If the Board determines that usable park and recreation land is
available in a particular improvement of land, but is inadequate in size (i.e.,
less than the standard established in subsection (b) above), the Board may
require a combination of money and the land reservation. In such cases, the
money shall be applied only to the number of lots or units which are not
“covered” by the land reservation under the standards that are here set forth.

   (d)   Within ten working days of receipt of an application for a demolition
permit, the township shall publish notice of the application in a daily or
weekly newspaper of substantial circulation in the township. The Building

historical structure; and
      (2)   Unless written objection is filed with the Building Inspector
within ten days of the publication of the notice, the demolition permit will be
issued after the expiration of such ten-day period.
   (e)   If within ten days after the publication of the notice no written
objection to the issuance of the permit is filed and remains open with the
Building Inspector, then the demolition permit shall be issued to the
applicant.
   (f)   If within ten days after the publication of the notice an objection is

application and objections thereof and make a decision whether to approve or
deny the application for issuance of the demolition permit. The person applying

required fee for such special hearing as provided for in the township fee
schedule. The Board shall make a decision on the application within 60 days

demolition permit, the Board shall consider the following factors, among other
factors deemed appropriate by the Board, before reaching its decision on the
application:
      (1)   The purposes of this chapter;
      (2)   The historical, architectural or aesthetic significance of the

which it is or may be reasonably adapted. To that end, the owner must
demonstrate that the sale of the property is impracticable; that rental cannot
provide a reasonable rate of return; and that other potential uses of the
property are not feasible or available. The objector must also provide his, her
or its recommendation for the continued use of the building in question; and
      (5)   Where an application for demolition is based on economic hardship,
the Board may lessen its requirement in order to account for the economic
situation involved.
   (k)   Every decision of the Board shall be in writing and shall state the
reasons for the decision. The decision shall contain the findings of fact that
constitute the basis of the decision. The Board shall furnish the applicant and

the Board deems necessary. In no case will the applicant be forced to spend
more than an additional amount set forth by the Board of Commissioners in the
fee resolution on this survey. Any additional expenses will be borne by the
objecting party.
      (3)   In the case of a demonstrated economic hardship, the Board may
prescribe a less stringent form of documentation.

§ 1228.05 PERFORMANCE OF ORDINARY MAINTENANCE.
   This chapter shall not be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or
repair of any building or structure, where such work does not require a permit
by law, and where the purpose and effect of such work is to correct any
deterioration or decay of, or damage to, a building or structure and to restore
the same to its condition prior to the occurrence of such deterioration, decay
or damage.
(Ord. 829, passed 9-21-2005)
§ 1228.06 REVIEW.

rather than cross them.
      (4)   Generally, the depth of residential lots shall be not less than one
nor more than three times their width.
      (5)   If remnants of land remain after subdividing, they shall be either:
         A.   Incorporated into existing or proposed lots; or
         B.   Legally dedicated to public use, if acceptable to the township.
      (6)   Flag lots are permitted provided the minimum width of the narrow
strip of land which provides access to the street is not less than 25 feet. The
access strip shall be in addition to the minimum lot area requirements as
prescribed in the Township Zoning Code.
   (b)   Lot frontage.
      (1)   Reverse or double frontage lots shall be avoided except where
required to provide separation of residential development from arterial streets
or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography or orientation.
      (2)   All residential reverse frontage lots shall have a minimum rear
yard depth of 75 feet with a planted visual screen immediately adjacent to the
street right-of-way. No vehicular access shall be permitted through the rear
yard to the street adjacent to the rear yard.

   (a)   General standards.
      (1)   The location and width of all streets shall be in accordance with
road and highway plans of the state and county. Streets shall be designed to
provide adequate vehicular access to all lots or parcels with regard to
topographic conditions, projected volumes of traffic and further subdivision
possibilities in the area.
      (2)   The street system of a proposed subdivision or land development
shall be designed to create a hierarchy of street functions.
      (3)   Local streets shall be designed so as to discourage through traffic
and excessive speed.
      (4)   If lots resulting from the proposed subdivision are large enough to
allow for resubdivision or, if a portion of the tract is not subdivided,
adequate street rights-of-way to permit further subdivision shall be provided
as necessary, and located so as to allow proper development of surrounding
properties.
      (5)   Where a subdivision or land development abuts or contains an
existing street right-of-way of improper width or alignment, the Planning
Commission may require the dedication or reservation of additional land
(ultimate right-of-way) sufficient to widen the street or correct the
alignment. Where an additional dedication or reservation is required, all
building setback lines will be measured from such dedicated or reserved right-
of-way lines.
      (6)   All streets shall be graded and improved to conform to township
construction standards and specifications.
      (7)   Road designs and specifications shall be approved by the Township
Engineer, in accordance with the construction plans required for final plan
review.

(Ord. 668, passed 10-17-1990)
§ 1238.02 SITE DESIGN.
   (a)   In compliance with the requirements of the Township Zoning Code, the
size, shape and orientation of tracts/lots shall be appropriate for the type of
development and use contemplated.
   (b)   The site design shall be such that there will be no foreseeable
difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in locating the
various types of dwelling units and providing common pedestrian and motor
vehicle ways, usable open space, parking areas and service facilities. Such
site configuration and building locations shall be designed and reviewed in
accordance with Chapter 1232.

single architectural and landscaping scheme having the following
characteristics:
      (1)   An efficient and visually coherent arrangement of structures and
improvements;
      (2)   A relationship appropriate to the size and shape of the tract
developed and the adjacent land uses;
      (3)   A relationship appropriate to the natural setting of the tract, the
topography, vegetative cover, view, water bodies, sunlight, prevailing winds,
and adjoining public spaces; and
      (4)   An efficient layout of pedestrian and motor vehicle ways to provide
for the occupants’ safety and convenience in routing access and internal
circulation activities and for efficient performance of such auxiliary
operations as solid waste collection, snow removal, repairs and deliveries, and
firefighting.
(Ord. 668, passed 10-17-1990)
§ 1238.03 BUILDING LOCATION.
   (a)   The location of buildings in general, and more specifically, the
distance at the closest point between two buildings or groups of buildings,
shall be sufficient to guarantee adequate sunlight, outdoor functional areas
and privacy for the occupants of these buildings.
   (b)   Buildings should be placed so that one window does not directly face
another.
   (c)   Buildings should vary in length and placement to avoid monotony.
   (d)   Any building erected on the same frontage as other buildings shall be
visibly offset from the adjoining buildings.
   (e)   No more than two consecutive townhouse units shall have the same front
yard setback.
   (f)   Townhouses shall be designed in groups of four to six attached units.
   (g)   Where the rear yards of a group of townhouses do not abut common open
space, there shall be a pedestrian access easement of five feet along the full
width of each yard.
   (h)   Townhouses shall not have direct, individual driveway access to a
collector or arterial street.
   (i)   When possible, for energy conservation, buildings should be oriented
towards the southwest.
(Ord. 668, passed 10-17-1990)
§ 1238.04 PEDESTRIAN ACCESS.
   (a)   Street sidewalks and on-site walkways shall be provided for convenient
and safe access to all living units from streets, driveways, parking areas or
garages and for convenient circulation and access to all project facilities.
   (b)   A circulation plan for sidewalks and walkways shall be included in the
preliminary subdivision and land development plan for any newly proposed
developments.
   (c)   Design standards shall be as follows.
      (1)   Sidewalks and on-site walkways should be functionally organized and
follow the natural path of circulation.
      (2)   Walking distance from car parking areas to dwelling units should
not exceed 100 feet. Any exception to this standard should be reasonably
justified by compensating advantages, such as desirable views and site
preservation through adaptation to topography.
      (3)   Walkways shall be wide enough to accommodate two-way traffic. The
minimum width shall be four feet.
      (4)   Sidewalks adjacent to angle parking areas shall be set back so as
to prevent car overhang from restricting pedestrian movement along the
sidewalk.
      (5)   Sidewalks shall not exceed 8% grade. Steps or a combination of
steps and ramps shall be utilized to maintain the maximum grades, where
necessary. Where sidewalk grades exceed 5%, a non-slip surface texture shall be
used.
      (6)   Pedestrian ramps will be required from parking areas to sidewalk
ways to ensure adequate circulation in development design to accommodate the
handicapped and elderly.
(Ord. 668, passed 10-17-1990)
§ 1238.05 VEHICULAR CIRCULATION.
   (a)   Generally. The overall circulation system should be designed to create
a functional circulation pattern for safe and convenient access not only for
pedestrians but for vehicles as well. The primary concern should be as follows:
      (1)   To minimize auto intrusion into the neighborhood unit;
      (2)   To separate roads carrying higher volumes at higher speeds from
residential units; and
      (3)   To maximize convenience and auto access to each dwelling unit.
   (b)   Access. The access to townhouse and multi-family developments may be a
hierarchy of roads or a single point of access. The hierarchical classification
system may consist of the following types.
      (1)   Driveway. The primary purpose of the driveway is to conduct traffic
to and from parking areas and local or collector streets. The driveway is
usually dead-end, with no through traffic.
      (2)   Local road. A local road is a short street or cul-de-sac. The
primary purpose of the local road is to conduct traffic to other streets within
the township hierarchy of streets.
   (c)   Street intersections and driveways.
      (1)   Driveways onto local or collector streets should be located a
minimum of 50 feet and 70 feet, respectively, from the closest intersecting
street.
      (2)   Driveways entering opposite sides of any street should be laid out
either directly opposite one another or with a minimum offset of 150 feet
between their centerlines.
      (3)   Driveways shall be a minimum of 24 feet in width and provide an
adequate turnaround for emergency vehicles.
      (4)   Driveways shall not intersect any street opposite a through street.
      (5)   For driveway intersections, at a point 15 feet from the curb line
there shall be a clear sight distance in both directions of 75 feet for local
streets and 200 feet for collector streets measured from the point of
intersection. No object greater than two and one-half feet in height and no
other object that would obscure the vision of the motorist shall be permitted
within this sight triangle.
      (6)   Multiple intersections involving the junction of more than two
streets or driveways shall be avoided.
      (7)   Driveways and streets shall be laid out to intersect as nearly as
possible at right angles.
   (d)   Right-of-way and cartway widths.
      (1)   Right-of-way widths for streets serving townhouse and multi-family
developments should be adequate to provide required street pavements. As
needed, additional width may be provided to accommodate sidewalks, utilities,
drainage facilities, landscaping, street furniture and grading.
      (2)   Where street rights-of-way are required, their design shall conform
to the standards in §
1236.03.
      (3)   All townhouse and multi-family developments with more than 30 units
shall provide two points of access.
      (4)   See §
1236.03(g) for provisions relating to culs-de-sac.
   (e)   Parking area.
      (1)   Parking facilities shall be provided in accordance with Chapter
1284 of the Township Zoning Code.
      (2)   Parking areas shall be designed with careful regard to orderly
arrangement, topography, amenity of view, ease of access and as an integral
part of the overall site design.
      (3)   Parking areas shall be varied in width and direction to fit unusual
spaces, to match the arrangement of clusters, and to improve their visual
image.
      (4)   The parking spaces provided for the various types of residential
development may be, but need not be, limited to the form of a garage, car port,
or parking area.
      (5)   When parking spaces are provided in front of buildings, there shall
be no more than 16 spaces in a row without a landscape interruption.
      (6)   Parking areas with 20 or more cars should be designed according to
Chapter 1284 of the Township Zoning Code.
      (7)   The design standards listed in Table 3 below shall be required for
all off-street parking facilities. The minimum dimensions of stalls and aisles
shall be as follows:

      (8)   Parking areas shall be designed to permit each motor vehicle to
proceed to and from the parking space provided for it without requiring the
moving of any other motor vehicles.
      (9)   All parking spaces shall be marked so as to provide for orderly and
safe parking.
      (10)   All dead-end parking areas shall be designed to provide sufficient
back-up area for the end stalls of the parking area.
      (11)   No less than a five-foot radius of curvature should be permitted
for all curblines in parking areas.
      (12)   The maximum grade of parking areas shall not exceed 6%.

(Ord. 951, passed 9-21-2016)
§ 1244.06 BUILDING ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (a)   The architectural design standards are intended to ensure that the
size, proportions and design of new or substantially improved buildings create
a pedestrian-friendly environment, that is highly articulated as described
herein.
   (b)   The visual mass of all buildings shall be de-emphasized through the
use of architectural elements including building form, architectural features
and materials, in order to reduce their apparent bulk and volume, to enhance
visual quality and contribute to human scale development in accordance with the
following.
      (1)   Unified and coordinated architectural theme. All structures
proposed under the same land development application shall consist of a unified
and coordinated architectural theme.
      (2)   Exterior building materials.
         A.   The predominant material of all facades facing public streets
shall be brick, stone, highly textured masonry block, curtain wall, metal panel
systems with concealed fasteners, glazed panels, cement-board siding or wood.
Stucco or dryvit may be utilized provided it is no more than 20% of non-window
facades at the street floor level and no more than 50% of non-window facades
above the street floor level.
         B.   All sides of a building shall be architecturally designed to be
consistent with regard to style, materials, colors and details. The
architectural treatment of the front facade shall be continuous in its major
features around all visibly exposed sides of a building with the exception of
parking structures or that portion of a building containing a parking
structure. Blank walls or service area treatment of side and/or rear elevations
visible from public view shall be prohibited.
      (3)   Vertical articulation. Buildings are required to provide
articulation on the exterior of any wall surface in order to provide
architectural interest and variety to the massing of a building and to relieve
the effect of a single, long monotonous wall or roof. Blank facades, without
windows or architectural elements to create interest, are prohibited.
         A.   The massing of any one building wall shall not exceed 50 feet
(horizontal dimension) without a vertical articulation along its entire height.
Vertical articulation may include a change of building facade plane or
material. The depth of change in facade plane for vertical wall articulation
shall be a minimum of two feet. Such articulation may consist of building wall
offsets, recesses and projections such as bays, balconies, canopies, awnings,
pilasters, columns and other similar features.
         B.   Building corners located at the intersections of public streets
shall incorporate the following. Building corners shall be chamfered at least
ten feet from the corner setback. The chamfer shall extend from the ground to
the top of the building unless the following features are incorporated.
Building corner chamfers may be limited to the street level story only if the
portion of building corners above the street level story is visually emphasized
through design features, such as step backs, fenestration patterns, balconies,
towers, building entries, bays or similar features.
      (4)   Horizontal articulation. Horizontal articulation of the building
facade, including changes to the horizontal building plane and/or materials,
shall be used to break up the scale of the building facade. Such horizontal
articulation may be provided by roof terraces, setbacks or other devices.
Horizontal articulation shall emphasize the building base, body and roof/
parapet edge.
         A.   Buildings greater than 40 feet in height shall be designed
utilizing a definition of the base, body and roof or parapet edge (or similar
designations) as the primary method of defining and relating buildings to one
another.
         B.   The base shall generally be considered the first story of the
facade facing a public street, but can vary depending on the overall building
height and range from ground plane to the floor line of the third floor in
buildings of at least four stories in height. The design of the base should be
emphasized through the design, quality and durability of its materials to
create visual interest. The transition from the base of a building to the body
may be expressed either horizontally, through a shift in the horizontal plane
and/or through a change in building materials.
         C.   The top of a building greater than 40 feet in height shall be
architecturally distinguished by providing a visual termination to the facade
and interest at the skyline by incorporation of highly detailed architectural
elements that are visible from street level.
         D.   Any building measuring taller than 40 feet in height shall
provide an expression line on the wall plane, continuing around all sides of a
building above the first or second floor. The expression line may consist of a
projecting element, a minimum four inches in depth, such as a belt course or
cornice as well as a terrace that sets back the walls of the building above the
expression line.
      (5)   Roofs.
         A.   Rooflines shall be articulated vertically with a change in roof
line every 50 feet. This requirement does not apply to flat roofs.
         B.   On buildings with flat roofs, all visibly exposed walls shall
have an articulated cornice that projects a minimum of four inches horizontally
from the top of the vertical building wall.
         C.   Fixed or retractable canvas/fabric awnings are permitted at
street floor level and on upper levels where appropriate, if they complement a
building’s architectural features. On buildings with multiple storefronts, or
on adjacent buildings on the same lot, compatible awnings shall be used as a
means of unifying the structures. Metal or internally lit non-fabric awnings
are prohibited.
         D.   All roof-top mechanical equipment, including antennas, shall be
visually and acoustically screened from view of both the public right-of-way
and adjacent properties. Screening may be accomplished by using parapets, walls
or roof elements. Such screening shall be integral to the architectural design
of the building.
         E.   Vegetated roofs are encouraged and may be used for stormwater
mitigation based on conformance with applicable stormwater regulations.
      (6)   Proportions of walls to openings for street level facades.
         A.   A STREET LEVEL FACADE is the building wall or walls where there
are primary and secondary customer entrances and where they are the prominent
facades as viewed from streets or parking areas.
         B.   A wall to clear window/door ratio of between two to one and four
to one is required. For street floor level commercial and retail uses, a wall
to clear window ratio between one to one and two to one is required.
         C.   The maximum length of a blank wall between clear window/door
openings shall be 16 feet.
         D.   Elements such as pent eaves, pediments, or sills and lintels
above and below windows and doors are required.
      (7)   Windows.
         A.   For retail and commercial uses, smoked, reflective, tinted or
black glass in windows at street level is prohibited. Glazing shall have a
minimum visible transmittance of 0.75 and also meet energy code compliance.
         B.   Any street level facades with less than 50% of clear windows
shall be articulated by two or more of the following:
            1.   Articulation of building facade plane and/or changes in
materials; and/or
            2.   If the building is occupied by a commercial use at street
level, recessed or projecting display window cases or simulated windows.
      (8)   Outdoor trash storage area screening. Outdoor trash storage area
screening shall be provided as required by the MU Mixed Use Zoning Overlay
regulations. Screen design shall consist of a unified and coordinated
architectural theme and durable materials that are compatible with the design
of the buildings that they serve.
      (9)   Parking structures. The following shall apply to parking
structures.
         A.   Architectural elevations shall be provided to demonstrate that
front facades of parking structures sufficiently screen vehicles in the parking
garage from view of the street and shall demonstrate that parking structures
are architecturally compatible with the character of surrounding buildings and
meet the architectural design guidelines for mixed use districts.
         B.   If the front facade of the parking structure is within the
minimum or maximum front yard setback, at least 75% of first (ground) floor of
the structure shall contain other permitted uses.
         C.   Other architectural design standards for parking structures are
as follows.
            1.   Horizontal facade articulation of the parking structure,
including changes in building plane and materials, shall be used. The depth of
such articulation shall be a minimum of two feet, and occur at a maximum
horizontal 50-foot interval.
            2.   Vertical architectural features of the parking structure
facade, including changes in building materials, shall be used. The change in
architectural articulation shall occur at a maximum of every 20 feet of height.

§ 1254.07 STANDARDS FOR ZONING HEARING BOARD ACTION.
   In any instance where the Zoning Hearing Board is required to consider a
variance or special exception, the Board shall, among other things, consider
the following standards.
   (a)   Planning Code criteria for variances.
      (1)   The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged
that the provisions of this title inflict unnecessary hardship on the
applicant.
      (2)   A variance from the terms of this title shall not be granted by the
Board unless and until a written application for a variance is submitted by the
applicant who shall have the burden of establishing:
         A.   There are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including
irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property,
and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions, and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of this title
in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located;
         B.   Because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no
possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of this title and that the authorization of the variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property;
         C.   Such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the applicant;
         D.   The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare; and
         E.   The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance
that will afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of
the regulation in issue.
      (3)   In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of
the Planning Code and Zoning Code.
   (b)   Standards for review of special exceptions.
      (1)   In any instance where the Board is required to consider a request
for a special exception, the Board shall consider the following factors where
appropriate:
         A.   The proposed use is appropriate for the site in question in terms
of size, topography, natural features, drainage, sewage disposal, water supply,
accessibility and availability of public services, and that adequate provisions
will be made to protect sensitive environmental features such as streams,
lakes, wetlands, slopes and mature trees;
         B.   The proposed use is compatible with the character of the
surrounding neighborhood and will not interfere with or detract from legitimate
uses and adjacent properties, and that adequate measures will be provided
through building design, site layout, landscaping, planting and operational
controls to minimize any adverse impacts caused by noise, lights, glare, odors,
smoke, fumes, traffic, parking, loading and signage;
         C.   The proposed special exception will serve the best interest of
the township, and convenience of the community, and the public health, safety
and welfare;
         D.   The proposed use is consistent with the most recently adopted
Township Comprehensive Plan;
         E.   The proposed use promotes orderly development, proper population
density and the provision of adequate community facilities and services,
including police and fire protection;
         F.   The proposed use is suitable in terms of its effect on highway
safety and traffic circulation, and that access, on-site circulation and
parking are adequate in view of anticipated traffic; and
         G.   The proposed use will provide for adequate off-street parking, as
required in
Chapter 1284.
      (2)   In cases where uses permitted by special exception are not
accompanied by standards for such uses, the regulations in §
1290.03 shall apply.
      (3)   Financial hardship shall not be construed as a basis for granting
special exceptions.
      (4)   In granting any special exception, the Board may attach reasonable
conditions and safeguards in addition to those expressed in this title as it
may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this title, which conditions
and safeguards may relate to, but not be limited to, screening, lighting,
noise, safety, aesthetics and the minimization of noxious, offensive or
hazardous elements. Such special exception shall be clearly authorized by a
provision in this title and shall comply with the more specific standards
relating to such special exception contained in sections of this title relating
to uses by special exception.
(Ord. 896, passed 12-21-2011)
§ 1254.08 STANDARDS OF PROOF.
   (a)   For variances. An applicant for a variance shall have the burden of
establishing both:
      (1)   That a literal enforcement of the provisions of this Zoning Code
will result in unnecessary hardship, as that term is defined by law, including
court decisions; and
      (2)   The allowance of the variance will not be contrary to the public
interest.
   (b)   For special exceptions. An applicant for a special exception shall
have the burden of establishing both:
      (1)   His or her application falls within the provisions of the Zoning
Code which affords to the applicant the right to seek a special exception; and
      (2)   The allowance of a special exception will not be contrary to the
public interest.
   (c)   Evaluation of the impact of an application on the public interest. In
determining whether the allowance of a special exception or variance is
contrary to the public interest, the Board shall consider whether the
application, if granted, will:
      (1)   Adversely affect the public health, safety and welfare due to
changes in traffic conditions, drainage, air quality, noise levels,
neighborhood property values, natural features and neighborhood aesthetic
characteristics;
      (2)   Be in accordance with the most recently adopted Township
Comprehensive Plan;
      (3)   Provide required parking in accordance with
Chapter 1284;
      (4)   Adversely affect the logical, efficient and economical extension or
provision of public services and facilities such as public water, sewers,
refuse collection, police, fire protection and public schools; and
      (5)   Otherwise adversely affect the public health, safety or welfare.

development.
   (a)   General design standards.
      (1)   All housing and other areas shall be planned, designed,
constructed, and made maximally usable, operable and habitable with regard to
the topography and natural features of the tract. The effects of prevailing
winds and solar orientation on the physical layout and form of the proposed
buildings and other structures shall be reflected in the development plan.
      (2)   Variations in location of buildings and other structures shall be
provided where necessary to create architectural interest and/or preserve areas
of environmental concern and to further amenities of light and air, recreation
and visual enjoyment. All dwelling units shall be based on a common
architectural theme.
      (3)   Every building and other structure shall be located and situated to
promote pedestrian and visual access to common open space to the extent
possible.
      (4)   All utilities shall be placed underground unless such placement is
deemed not feasible by the Board of Commissioners.
      (5)   Fire hydrants shall be installed by the developer to meet the
requirements of the Middle Atlantic Fire Underwriters Association and the
Township Fire Marshal.
      (6)   Refuse stations to serve residential and recreational areas shall
be designed with suitable screening and located so as to be convenient for
trash removal and not offensive to nearby residential areas.
   (b)   Buildings.
      (1)   No building shall be placed less than 75 feet from the perimeter
property line of the PRD, except for signs and structures associated with
ingress and egress.
      (2)   No building shall be less than 50 feet from the street line of the
exterior road except for signs, street trees, ingress and egress structures,
and other like structure typically located in such setback area such as
lighting standards, sidewalks, benches and the like.
      (3)   No building shall be less than 30 feet from access roads or parking
areas.
      (4)   No principal building shall be less than 35 feet from any other
principal building.
      (5)   No building shall exceed the length of 125 feet in any single
direction.
      (6)   Development near the perimeter of the property shall be designed to
be harmonious with neighboring areas and shall be screened from such areas with
landscaping approved by the township.
      (7)   Single-family attached dwellings shall be designed and arranged in
staggered groups and not in long rows parallel to street lines. The arrangement
of such units shall create a physical and visual distinction in the lines of
the facades and the roofs. Such distinction can be achieved through the use of
varied floor plans for adjoining units, alternating two-story and one-story
structures within an attached group, the projections and angles of exterior
walls and roofs, exterior fencing and other diversified space articulating
techniques.
      (8)   Individual residential driveways shall not have direct access to
the exterior street.
      (9)   Buildings in a PRD shall not exceed 35 feet or two stories in
height.
   (c)   Tree conservation and landscaping.
      (1)   Existing trees shall be preserved wherever possible. The protection
of trees 12 inches or more in caliper (measured at a height of four and one-
half feet above the original grade) shall be a factor in determining the
location of common open space, structures, underground utilities, walks and
paved areas. Areas in which trees are to be preserved shall remain at original
grade level and in an undisturbed condition.
      (2)   Where extensive natural tree cover and vegetation does not exist
and cannot be preserved on the PRD site, landscaping shall be regarded as an
essential feature of the PRD. In these cases extensive landscaping shall be
undertaken in order to enhance the appearance of the PRD; aid in erosion
control; provide protection from wind and sun; screen streets and parking
areas; and enhance the privacy of the dwelling units in accordance with §
1292.19 relating to landscaping.
      (3)   Street trees shall be provided along all internal streets. Not less
than two four-inch caliper trees shall be provided for each 50 foot increment
of street, wherein one tree shall be placed on each side of the said street
increment.
      (4)   A planted buffer of not less than 20 feet in width shall be
provided along all perimeter property lines except at points of vehicular
ingress and egress and on pedestrian accessways.
      (5)   Screening and landscaping requirements for parking areas shall
comply with §
1284.08.
   (d)   Stormwater control.
      (1)   The storm drainage system for a PRD shall be designed and
constructed so as to minimize erosion and flooding, using as necessary drainage
easements, swales, catchment basins, silt traps and the design of cartways so
as to minimize runoff.
      (2)   Where existing storm sewers are deemed by the Board of
Commissioners to be accessible, the Commissioners may require that the proposed
development connect therewith.
      (3)   All stormwater management design standards shall be in accordance
with the latest adopted township subdivision regulations, as may be amended
from time to time, and Chapter 1043 of this code of ordinances.
      (4)   Storm sewer systems for the development shall be designed,
constructed and shall operate and be readily capable of being maintained to
prevent concentration of stormwater runoff on adjacent developed or undeveloped
properties and streets.
      (5)   The design and construction of all storm drainage facilities and
stormwater systems shall be subject to the approval of the Township Engineer.
   (e)   Soil erosion and sedimentation control. Plans submitted for any PRD
development shall conform to the guidelines for minimizing erosion and
sedimentation as set forth in the Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Manual
of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, prepared by the
State Conservation Commission and Bureau of Water Quality Management and the
U.S.D.A. Soil Conservation service, as amended.
   (f)   Streets and walkways.
      (1)   The street system of the PRD shall be designed so as to relate
harmoniously with land uses within and adjacent to the development through the
establishment of a hierarchy of roadway functions, which includes internal
collector and local streets, to create a separation of automobile and
pedestrian traffic through the coordinated design of streets, dwelling units,
common open space areas and pedestrian walkways, to create efficient and safe
connections with the existing road system of the municipality in order to
ensure proper ingress and egress to and from the PRD and to minimize through
traffic in residential areas.
      (2)   In order to separate automobile and pedestrian circulation and to
increase accessibility to common open space areas, pedestrian walkways shall be
provided, unless the Board of Commissioners determines that they are not
necessary.
      (3)   The design and construction of streets must conform to the
standards set forth in the latest adopted township subdivision regulations
relative to paving specifications, cartway design, horizontal and vertical
alignment, site distances and the like.
   (g)   Lighting.
      (1)   All streets, parking areas and areas of intensive pedestrian use
shall be adequately lighted. All such lighting shall be designed and located so
as to direct light away from adjacent residences.
      (2)   Appropriate lighting fixtures shall be provided for walkways and to
identify steps, ramps and signs.
   (h)   Parking. Parking shall be in accordance with
Chapter 1284 and with the latest adopted township subdivision regulations.
(Ord. 896, passed 12-21-2011)
§ 1270.12 COMMON OPEN SPACE.
   In this section relating to common open space, the term OPEN SPACE shall be
construed to mean common open space as defined in §
1250.07.
   (a)   General regulations.
      (1)   Areas agreed by the developer and the township to be set aside for
common open space shall be suitable for that purpose and consistent with the
township policy and plan for future land use.
      (2)   Open space areas shall contain no major structures other than those
related to the purpose of the open space.
      (3)   Open space areas shall be arranged and located to serve the
residents of the development adequately and conveniently, taking into
consideration the characteristics of the site, and to preserve and enhance
desirable natural features.
      (4)   Any land designated as common open space shall be restricted to
continue as such by an appropriate method approved by the Township
Commissioners.
   (b)   Common open space design standards.
      (1)   A minimum of 40% of the gross tract area of the tract shall be
devoted to common open space.
      (2)   Not less than 60% of the total common open space areas shall be
outside the floodplain areas and areas with slopes of 25% or more.
      (3)   Open space areas shall be not less than 70 feet wide and not less
than 15,000 square feet of contiguous area, except when part of a trail system
or pathway network or tot lot.
      (4)   Open space areas shall be undivided by any road crossings, except
where necessary for proper traffic circulation, and then only upon
recommendation of the Township Engineer and Planning Commission.
      (5)   Such areas shall be suitably landscaped by retaining existing
natural cover and wooded areas and/or by a landscaping plan which is consistent
with the purposes of this section and which minimizes maintenance costs.
   (c)   Performance bond.
      (1)   Designated planting and recreation facilities within the open space
area shall be provided by the developer. A performance bond or other security
shall be required to cover costs of installation.
      (2)   An appropriate portion of the performance bond or other security
will be forfeited by the developer should he or she fail to install the
planting or recreational facilities.
   (d)   Ownership and maintenance of common open space.
      (1)   An essential element of the tentative plan is a written description
and plan for the disposition of ownership of common open space land designating
those areas to be offered for dedication or to be owned by the specific form of
organization proposed.
      (2)   The Board of Commissioners may, at any time and from time to time,
accept the dedication of designated land and/or any interest therein for public
use and maintenance, but the Board need not require as a condition of the
approval of a PRD that land proposed to be set aside for common open space be
dedicated or made available to public use.
      (3)   A.   In the event that common open space is not dedicated or made
available to public use, the landowner shall provide for and establish an
organization for the ownership and maintenance of the common open space, and
such organization shall not be dissolved nor shall it dispose of the common
open space, by sale or otherwise (except to an organization conceived and
established to own and maintain the common open space), except by dedication of
the same to the public. Such agreements shall be subject to the approval of the
Board and contain provisions respecting the right to lien property owners for
maintenance charges incurred by the township in event of default. In any case,
the organization provided for the ownership of open space land not dedicated
for public use shall be constituted of the property owners within the PRD.
         B.   The plan may provide that the property owners association may
lease back open space lands to the developer, his or her heirs or assigns, or
to any other qualified person or corporation for operation and maintenance of
open space lands, but such a lease agreement shall provide that:
            1.   The residents of the PRD shall at all times have access to the
open space lands contained therein;
            2.   The common open space to be leased shall be maintained for the
purpose set forth in this Zoning Code; and
            3.   The operation of open space facilities may be for the benefit
of the residents only, or may be open to the general public in accordance with
prior commitments to the Board.
      (4)   The form of the lease shall be subject to the approval of the
Board, and any transfer or assignment of the lease shall be further subject to
the approval of the Board. Lease agreements shall be recited in the deed and
shall be recorded with the Recorder of Deeds of the county within 30 days of
their execution, and a copy of the recorded lease shall be filed with the
Secretary of the township.
      (5)   The plan to provide for the ownership and maintenance of common
open space shall include:
         A.   A complete description of the organization to be established for
the ownership of open space, if any, and the methods by which this organization
shall be established and maintained; and
         B.   A method reasonably designed to give adequate notice to property
owners within the PRD in the event of the sale or other disposition of common
open space lands and in the event of assumption of the maintenance of common
open space lands by the township as hereinafter provided.
      (6)   In the event that the organization established to own and maintain
common open space, or any successor organization, shall at any time after
establishment of the PRD fail to maintain the common open space in reasonable
order and conditions in accordance with the development plan, the Board may
proceed as provided in the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code to demand
that deficiencies of maintenance be corrected or the Township will enter upon
and maintain common open space. Notice to the affected property owners in
accordance with the provisions of the Master Plan shall be deemed to be
adequate notice by the township. The cost of such maintenance by the township
shall be assessed ratably against the properties within the PRD that have a
right of enjoyment of the common open space, and shall become a lien on said
properties. The township, at the time of entering upon said common open space
for the purpose of maintenance, shall file a notice of lien in the office of
the prothonotary of the county upon the properties affected by the lien within
the planned residential development.
(Ord. 896, passed 12-21-2011)

removed and streams kept in free-flowing condition; and
         C.   Recreation area. An area designated for a specific recreational
use, including, but not limited to, tennis, swimming, shuffleboard, playfields
and tot lots. Such areas shall be located and maintained in such a manner as
not to create a hazard or nuisance and shall perpetuate the proposed use.
   (d)   The record and subsequent stages are completed consistent with the
tentatively approved plan and are of such size and location, including a
sufficient degree of completion of the road network and other infrastructure,
that they constitute economically sound units of development. In no event shall
such stages contain less than 15% of the dwelling units receiving tentative
approval.
   (e)   Each stage shall include common open space in amounts and at locations
deemed acceptable by the Board of Commissioners to meet, at minimum, the open
space needs generated by that stage.
   (f)   All improvements within the particular stage shall be completed
contemporaneously with the completion of the dwellings of that stage.
   (g)   Gross residential density may be varied from stage to stage, provided
that final approval shall not be given to any stage if the gross residential
density of the area, which includes stages already finally approved and the
stage for which final approval is being sought, exceeds by more than 20% the
gross residential density allowed for the entire PRD in the tentatively
approved plan.

included in the development plan as submitted; or
         C.   Deny tentative approval to the development plan.
      (2)   Failure to do so within said period shall be deemed to be a grant
of tentative approval of the development plan as submitted. In the event,
however, that tentative approval is granted subject to conditions, the
applicant may, within 30 days after receiving a copy of the official written
communication from the Board of Commissioners, notify the Board of
Commissioners of his or her refusal to accept all said conditions, in which
case, the Board of Commissioners shall be deemed to have denied tentative
approval of the development plan. In the event the applicant does not, within
said period, notify the Board of Commissioners of his or her refusal to accept
all said conditions, tentative approval of the development plan, with all said
conditions, shall stand as granted.
   (b)   The grant or denial of tentative approval by official written
communication shall include not only conclusions but also findings of fact
related to the specific proposal and shall set forth the reasons for the grant,
with or without conditions, or for the denial, and said communication shall set
forth with particularity in what respects the development plan would or would
not be in the public interest, including, but not limited to, findings of fact
and conclusions on the following:
      (1)   Those respects in which the development is or is not consistent
with the Multi-Municipal Comprehensive Plan for Aston, Upper Chichester and
Lower Chichester Townships and the development of the township;
      (2)   The extent to which the development plan departs from zoning and
subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the subject property,
including, but not limited to, density, bulk and use, and the reasons why such
departures are or are not deemed to be in the public interest;
      (3)   The purpose, location and amount of the common open space in the
development, the reliability of the proposals for maintenance and conservation
of the common open space, and the adequacy or inadequacy of the amount and
purpose of the common open space as related to the proposed density and type of
residential development;
      (4)   The proposed systems for sanitary sewers, water supply, stormwater
control and soil erosion and sedimentation control, and the manner in which
said proposals adequately or inadequately address the construction, operation
and maintenance of such systems;
      (5)   The physical design of the development plan and the manner in which
said design does or does not make adequate provision for public services,
provide adequate control over vehicular and pedestrian traffic, and further the
amenities of light and air, recreation and visual enjoyment;
      (6)   The relationship, beneficial or adverse, of the proposed
development to the neighborhood in which it is proposed to be established; and
      (7)   In the case of a development plan which proposes development over a
period of years, the sufficiency of the terms and conditions intended to
protect the interests of the public and of the residents of the development in
the integrity of the development plan.

of the development plan shall be filed or, in the case of a development plan
which provides for development over a period of years, the periods of time
within which applications for final approval of each part thereof shall be
filed. Except upon the consent of the Board of Commissioners, the time so
established between the grant of tentative approval and application for final
approval shall be not less than three months nor more than one year and, in the

development or further development shall take place on the property included in

§ 1275.01 PURPOSE.
   (a)   Rockdale Arts District is located in the historic section of Aston
Township known as Rockdale, which was once a thriving industrial center in the
18th and 19th centuries, as described in the book "Rockdale: The Growth of an
American Village in the Early Industrial Revolution" by Anthony F.C. Wallace.
   (b)   During that period, Mount Road was the main street of Rockdale and it
was lined with store fronts, a newspaper press, a funeral home, movie theater,
churches, bars and restaurants, and residences; all of which served the workers
of the nearby textile mills along Chester Creek. Everything the workers needed
was within walking distance built into the rolling hills and valley around the
creek.
   (c)   The goal of Rockdale Arts District is to support the growth of a
vibrant, welcoming, creative community in the old mill town of Rockdale along
Chester Creek in Aston Township.
   (d)   The visual, performing and cultural arts in the Township of Aston
include a valuable inventory of museums, galleries, performing arts venues,
activities for families and children, special events and programs. These assets
have contributed significantly to the township's economic base, overall quality
of life, and growing reputation as a home for artists and art facilities.
   (e)   The purpose of the Rockdale Arts Overlay District (hereafter referred
as RAOD) is to encourage a mix of small-scale, creative home business uses and
arts related businesses in commercial spaces oriented toward or supporting the
visual, performing, and cultural arts, while maintaining the residential
character of the underlying residential neighborhood. This overlay district
establishes enclaves predominantly within single family residential
neighborhoods where artists may live, create work, and market their art.
Regulations are established to promote and achieve optimal conditions for
artist functions, while maintaining adequate protection for the adjacent
properties.

(Ord. 896, passed 12-21-2011)
§ 1279.08 FUTURE USE OF INSTITUTIONAL LANDS.
   (a)   Because of the unique character of institutional land, it is not
necessarily true that land zoned so as to permit one institutional use by right
or by condition may be suitable to permit another use of a different character,
even though that use may also be permitted as a use by right or by condition in
the Institutional District.
   (b)   It is the intent of this section that provision be made to ensure a
reasonable choice of appropriate uses for a property presently zoned for
institutional use. In the event of the non-use, abandonment or change in the
current use of any institutionally zoned land, the Planning Commission, on its
own motion or upon petition for rezoning, shall review the specific site and
make a recommendation to the Board of Township Commissioners concerning the
most appropriate use for the site and shall recommend a zoning district
classification for the zoning map to accommodate such use.

   The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the type and dimensions of signs
in the various zoning districts of the township; to recognize the commercial
communication requirements of all sectors of the business community; to protect
the public from damage or injury caused or attributable to distractions and
obstructions caused by improperly designed or located signs; to safeguard
property values; and to assure that signs are consistent and harmonious in
relation to the buildings and areas where they are placed.
(Ord. 896, passed 12-21-2011)
§ 1282.02 SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY.
   (a)   Any sign hereafter erected or maintained shall conform with the
provisions of this chapter and any other ordinance or regulations of the
township relating thereto. Any sign not specifically authorized by the
provisions of this chapter shall not be erected or maintained in the township.
   (b)   It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, corporation or individual
to erect and maintain signs, ground signboards, roof signboards, wall
bulletins, projecting signs, marquees and marquee signs without first obtaining
a permit from the township, except those listed specifically in §
1282.06.
   (c)   No sign shall hereafter be erected or attached to, suspended from or
supported on a building or structure, and no display sign shall hereafter be
altered, rebuilt, enlarged, extended or relocated until a permit for the same

1282.06.
   (d)   Application for such permits shall be made in writing to the township
in accordance with §
1282.08 and shall present full particulars as to size, shape, material,
supports, location and height above the sidewalk or ground, together with the
written consent of the owner of the property on which the sign is to be
located. All applications shall be accompanied by a plan drawn to scale,
showing the sign, its size, and its location with respect to the building and
to the boundaries of the lot upon which it is situated.
   (e)   Signs and their respective illumination existing at the time of the
passage of this Zoning Code and which do not conform to the requirements of
this chapter shall be considered nonconforming signs and once discontinued for
60 days, or damaged more than 50% of its market value, or removed for any
reason, shall be replaced with conforming signs. Nonconforming signs may be
painted, repaired (including lighting), and altered in their wording, provided
such modifications do not exceed the dimensions of the existing signs.
   (f)   No person shall maintain or permit to be maintained on any premises
owned or controlled by him or her, a sign which has been abandoned. An
ABANDONED SIGN, for the purpose of this chapter is a sign erected on and/or
related to the use of a property which becomes vacant and unoccupied for a
period of 60 days or more; or any sign which was erected for a prior occupant
or business; or any sign which relates to a time or event or purpose which is
past. Any such abandoned sign shall be removed by the landowner or person
controlling the property within ten days of the abandonment as described above.
   (g)   The Building Inspector is hereby authorized and empowered to revoke
any permit issued by the township, upon failure of the holder thereof to comply
with any provision of this chapter.
   (h)   The provisions of this chapter shall not apply where signage is
erected and maintained by the township for township purposes, provided that all
other required governmental permits are obtained by the township prior to such
township use.

§ 1282.03 DETERMINATION OF SIZE OF SIGNS.
   The size of any sign shall be determined in accordance with the provisions
of this chapter and the following.
   (a)   When a sign consists of letters, numbers and/or logos and not a
lettered board and such sign is erected on or attached to a building wall or
other similar surface, the size of such sign shall be measured by the geometric
shape formed by the extreme outside edge of the largest letters, numbers or
logos contained in the sign.
   (b)   When a sign consists of a lettered board and such sign is erected on
or attached to a building wall or other similar surface, the size of such sign
shall be determined by calculating the area of the lettered board.
   (c)   When a sign is a freestanding sign or ground sign, the size of such
sign shall be determined by calculating the area of the lettered board or the
area of the combinations of letters, numbers and/or logos without a lettered
board.

§ 1284.04 GENERAL REGULATIONS FOR OFF-STREET PARKING.
   (a)   Where a use is not specifically listed in this Zoning Code, the Code
Enforcement Officer (CEO) shall apply the standards of the most similar use
listed to determine the number of parking spaces required.
   (b)   If the computation of the parking ratios listed in §
1284.03 results in a fraction, an additional parking space shall be required.
   (c)   All parking areas, loading areas and driveways shall be graded and
surfaced with asphalt or other suitable materials to prevent dust and erosion.
Such areas shall also be drained in conformance with township standards to
prevent excessive water flow onto streets or adjoining properties.
   (d)   In parking areas with five or more spaces, each space shall be clearly
line-striped and maintained.
   (e)   Freestanding establishments located adjacent to shopping centers or
strip plazas shall have adequate parking as required in §
1284.03 and will not rely on any common parking to meet the aforementioned
requirements.
   (f)   All parking areas with five or more spaces shall be adequately lighted
so as to assist in the safe maneuvering of motor vehicles and to provide
security for users of the lot. All lighting shall be arranged to avoid glare on
adjacent properties.
   (g)   No commercial motor vehicle with more than single rear wheels may be
stored on a lot in a residential district, unless such vehicle is stored in a
private garage. Only one such commercial vehicle may be stored on a lot in a
residential district.

trucks, boats or other vehicles shall be permitted on a lot for a continuous
period of not more than seven days.
   (i)   Parking of any vehicle in the front yard of all residential districts
is prohibited except for emergency parking that will be allowed for a period
not to exceed 48 hours for times such as holidays.

   (b)   The size of a standard parking space shall be nine feet wide and 18
feet long, an area of 162 square feet.
   (c)   Parking spaces for the handicapped shall be eight feet wide by 18 feet

driveway.
   (h)   Every parking lot or area with ten or more off-street spaces shall be

§ 1284.06 COMMON PARKING.
   (a)   Two or more nonresidential uses may provide for required parking in a
common parking area provided such area is on or adjacent to such uses. The
number of spaces required in such a common parking area may be reduced below
the sum of the total requirements if it can be demonstrated to the Code
Enforcement Officer that the hours or days of peak parking demand for the uses
are so different that a lower overall total of parking spaces will adequately
provide for the uses to be served. In such case sufficient parking shall be
provided to meet the minimum needs of the use which requires the greater
parking area.
   (b)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent collective
provision of off-street parking facilities for two or more nonresidential
buildings or uses, provided that the total of such off-street parking
facilities provided collectively shall be not less than the sum of requirements
for the various uses compiled separately.
   (c)   (1)   Uses within the Institutional District (Chapter 1279) may
satisfy parking requirements by adding parking spaces to other nearby
institutional uses, so long as no net decrease in parking results.
      (2)   The applicant must evidence compliance with this provision by
submitting a site plan that shows:
         A.   The parking requirements of the proposed use;
         B.   The parking provided on-site of the proposed use; and
         C.   The specific location at a nearby institutional use where the
remaining required parking will be located.

problems; to replenish the groundwater table; and to provide for a more
attractive setting.
      (2)   The interior of each parking lot shall have at least one three-inch
caliper deciduous shade tree for every ten parking spaces if there are no
existing shade trees to satisfy this requirement. Shrubs and other plant
materials are encouraged to be used to complement the trees but shall not be
the sole contribution to the landscaping. These trees shall be in addition to
those required as an effective screen. Trees selected for landscaping in
parking areas shall be of a species proven to be salt and dust resistant.
      (3)   Landscaped areas at least five feet wide shall be provided around
the periphery of parking areas. Such areas shall, at a minimum, extend the full

(Ord. 896, passed 12-21-2011)
§ 1290.02 GENERAL STANDARDS FOR CONDITIONAL USES.
   (a)   In any instance where the Board of Commissioners is required to
consider a request for a conditional use, the Board shall consider the
following factors where appropriate:
      (1)   The proposed use is appropriate for the site in question in terms
of size, topography, natural features, drainage, sewage disposal, water supply,
accessibility and availability of public services, and that adequate provisions
will be made to protect sensitive environmental features such as streams,
lakes, wetlands, slopes and mature trees;
      (2)   The proposed use, if compatible with the character of the
surrounding neighborhood, will not interfere with or detract from legitimate
uses and adjacent properties, and that adequate measures will be provided
through building design, site layout, landscaping, planting and operational
controls to minimize any adverse impacts caused by noise, lights, glare, odors,
smoke, fumes, traffic, parking, loading and signage;
      (3)   The proposed conditional use will serve the best interest of the
township, convenience of the community, and the public health, safety and
welfare;
      (4)   The proposed use is consistent with the Multi-Municipal
Comprehensive Plan for Aston, Lower Chichester and Upper Chichester Townships,
2005;
      (5)   The proposed use promotes orderly development, proper population
density and the provision of adequate community facilities and services,
including police and fire protection;
      (6)   The proposed use is suitable in terms of its effect on highway
safety and traffic circulation, and that access, on-site circulation and
parking are adequate in view of anticipated traffic; and
      (7)   The proposed use will provide for adequate off-street parking, as
required in Chapter 1284.
         A.   In allowing a conditional use, the Board of Commissioners may
attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to those
expressed in this Zoning Code, as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes of this Zoning Code and those of the Planning Code.
         B.   Financial hardship shall not be construed as a basis for granting
a conditional use.

standards for uses permitted by special exception or conditional use, the
following general dimensional standards will be applied by the Zoning Hearing
Board (ZHB) or the Board of Commissioners.
   (a)   In residential districts, the area, bulk and any other applicable
requirements shall be not less than those for single-family dwellings in that
district or in the next more restrictive district in which single-family
dwellings are permitted.
   (b)   In nonresidential districts, the area, bulk and any other applicable
requirements shall be not less than those for the use which requires the
greatest dimensions in the applicable nonresidential district.
   (c)   The governing body or the ZHB, whichever has jurisdiction, may require
additional, reasonable, but more stringent requirements than those required in
subsections (a) or (b) above, provided that the Board of Commissioners or the
Zoning Hearing Board makes one or more of the following determinations. That
the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) above are clearly:
      (1)   Insufficient to accommodate the proposed building, facility or use,
and that larger dimensional requirements would substantially alleviate that
condition;
      (2)   Insufficient to provide adequate area for parking and loading, as
required by Chapter 1284, and that larger dimensional requirements would
substantially alleviate that condition; and
      (3)   Insufficient to provide for lot areas and dimensions necessary to
protect the adjacent area from the potential adverse impacts of the proposed
use, such as noise, vibration, air pollution, and similar impacts, and that
larger dimensional requirements would substantially alleviate that condition.
   (d)   All parking requirements of Chapter 1284 must be followed.

considers safety issues around the airport; regulates and restricts the heights
of constructed structures and objects of natural growth; creates appropriate
zones, establishing the boundaries thereof and providing for changes in the
restrictions and boundaries of such zones; creates the permitting process for
use within said zones; and provides for enforcement, assessment of violation
penalties, an appeals process and judicial review.
(Ord. 896, passed 12-21-2011)
§ 1296.02 RELATION TO OTHER ZONING DISTRICTS.
   The Airport District Overlay shall not modify the boundaries of any
underlying zoning district. Where identified, the Airport District Overlay
shall impose certain requirements on land use and construction in addition to
those contained in the underlying zoning district.
(Ord. 896, passed 12-21-2011)
§ 1296.03 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   AIRPORT ELEVATION. The highest point of an airport’s useable landing area
measured in feet above sea level. The AIRPORT ELEVATION of the airport is 36.1
feet.
   AIRPORT HAZARD. Any structure or object, natural or human-made, or use of
land which obstructs the airspace required for flight or aircraft in landing or
taking off at an airport or is otherwise hazardous as defined in 14 C.F.R. part
77 and 74 Pa.C.S. § 5102.
   AIRPORT HAZARD AREA. Any area of land or water upon which an airport hazard
might be established if not prevented as provided for in this chapter and the
Aviation Code, being 74 Pa.C.S. §§ 5101 et seq.
   APPROACH SURFACE (ZONE). An imaginary surface longitudinally centered on the
extended runway centerline and extending outward and upward from each end of
the primary surface. An APPROACH SURFACE is applied to each end of the runway
based on the planned approach. The inner edge of the APPROACH SURFACE is the
same width as the primary surface and expands uniformly depending on the
planned approach. The APPROACH SURFACE ZONE is derived from the approach
surface.
   CONICAL SURFACE (ZONE). An imaginary surface extending outward and upward
from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of 20 feet horizontally
to one foot vertically for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. The CONICAL
SURFACE ZONE is based on the CONICAL SURFACE.
   DEPARTMENT. Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.
   FAA. Federal Aviation Administration of the United States Department of
Transportation.
   HEIGHT. For the purpose of determining the height limits in all zones set
forth in this chapter and shown on the zoning map, the datum shall be mean sea
level elevation unless otherwise specified.
   HORIZONTAL SURFACE (ZONE). An imaginary plane 150 feet above the established
airport elevation that is constructed by swinging arcs of various radii from
the center of the end of the primary surface and then connecting the adjacent
arc by tangent lines. The radius of each arc is based on the planned approach.
The HORIZONTAL SURFACE ZONE is derived from the HORIZONTAL SURFACE.
   LARGER THAN UTILITY RUNWAY. A runway that is constructed for and intended to
be used by propeller driven aircraft of greater than 12,500 pounds maximum
gross weight and jet powered aircraft.
   NONCONFORMING USE. Any pre-existing structure, object of natural growth, or
use of land which is inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter or an
amendment thereto.
   NON-PRECISION INSTRUMENT RUNWAY. A runway having an existing instrument
approach procedure utilizing air navigation facilities, with only horizontal
guidance, or area type navigation equipment, for which a straight-in non-
precision instrument approach procedure has been approved or planned.
   OBSTRUCTION. Any structure, growth or other object, including a mobile
object, which exceeds a limiting height set forth by this chapter.
   PRECISION INSTRUMENT RUNWAY. A runway having an existing instrument approach
procedure utilizing an instrument landing system (ILS) or a precisions approach
radar (PAR). It also means a runway for which a precision approach system is
planned and is so indicated on an approved airport layout plan or any other
planning document.
   PRIMARY SURFACE (ZONE). An imaginary surface longitudinally centered on the
runway, extending 200 feet beyond the end of paved runways or ending at each
end of turf runways. The elevation of any point on the primary surface is the
same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline. The
PRIMARY SURFACE ZONE is derived from the PRIMARY SURFACE.
   RUNWAY. A defined area of an airport prepared for landing and takeoff of
aircraft along its length.
   STRUCTURE. An object, including a mobile object, constructed or installed by
humans, including but without limitation, buildings, towers, cranes,
smokestacks, earth formation and overhead transmission lines.
   TRANSITIONAL SURFACE (ZONE). An imaginary surface that extends outward and
upward from the edge of the primary surface to the horizontal surface at a
slope of seven feet horizontally to one foot vertically (7:1). The TRANSITIONAL
SURFACE ZONE is derived from the TRANSITIONAL SURFACE.
   TREE. Any object of natural growth.
   UTILITY RUNWAY. A runway that is constructed for and intended to be used by
propeller driven aircraft of 12,500 pounds maximum gross weight or less.

§ 1296.04 ESTABLISHMENT OF AIRPORT ZONES.
   There are hereby created and established certain zones within this chapter,
defined in §
1296.03 and illustrated on the airport hazard area map, hereby adopted as part
of this chapter, which include:
   (a)   Approach surface zone;
   (b)   Conical surface zone;
   (c)   Horizontal surface zone;
   (d)   Primary surface zone; and
   (e)   Transitional surface zone.
(Ord. 896, passed 12-21-2011)
§ 1296.05 PERMIT APPLICATIONS.
   (a)   As regulated by the Aviation Code, being Pa.C.S. §§ 5101 et seq. and
defined by 14 C.F.R. part 77.13(a) (as amended or replaced), any person who
plans to erect a new structure, to add to an existing structure, or to erect
and maintain any object (natural or human-made), in the vicinity of the
airport, shall first notify the Department’s Bureau of Aviation (BOA) by
submitting PENNDOT Form AV-57 to obtain an obstruction review of the proposal
at least 30 days prior to commencement thereof. Any new structure with a
proposed height of 200 feet or less shall be exempt from the foregoing. The
Department’s BOA response must be included with this permit application for it
to be considered complete. If the Department’s BOA returns a determination of
no penetration of airspace, the permit request should be considered in
compliance with the intent of this overlay chapter. If the Department’s BOA
returns a determination of a penetration of airspace, the permit shall be
denied, and the project sponsor may seek a variance from such regulations as
outlined in §
1296.06.
   (b)   No permit is required to make maintenance repairs to or to replace
parts of existing structures which do not enlarge or increase the height of an
existing structure.
(Ord. 896, passed 12-21-2011)
§ 1296.06 VARIANCE.
   (a)   Any request for a variance shall include documentation in compliance
with 14 C.F.R. part 77, subpart B (FAA Form 74601 as amended or replaced).
Determinations of whether to grant a variance will depend on the determinations
made by the FAA and the Department’s BOA as to the effect of the proposal on
the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of
navigable air space. In particular, the request for a variance shall consider
which of the following categories the FAA has placed the proposed construction
in:
      (1)   No objection. The subject construction is determined not to exceed
obstruction standards and marking/lighting is not required to mitigate
potential hazard. Under this determination a variance shall be granted;
      (2)   Conditional determination. The proposed construction/alteration is
determined to create some level of encroachment into an airport hazard area
which can be effectively mitigated. Under this determination, a variance shall
be granted contingent upon implementation of mitigating measures as described
in §
1296.09; and
      (3)   Objectionable. The proposed construction/alteration is determined
to be a hazard and is thus objectionable. A variance shall be denied and the
reasons for this determination shall be outlined to the applicant.
   (b)   Such requests for variances shall be granted where it is duly found
that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in
unnecessary hardship and that relief granted will not be contrary to the public
interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial
justice, and will be in accordance with the intent of this chapter.
(Ord. 896, passed 12-21-2011)
§ 1296.07 USE RESTRICTIONS.
   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no use shall be made
of land or water within the Airport District Overlay in such a manner as to
create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio
communications between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots
to distinguish between airport lights and others, impair visibility in the
vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards, or otherwise endanger or
interfere with the landing, takeoff or maneuvering of aircraft utilizing the
Airport.
(Ord. 896, passed 12-21-2011)
§ 1296.08 PRE-EXISTING NONCONFORMING USES.
   The regulations prescribed by this chapter shall not be construed to require
the removal, lowering or other change or alteration of any structure or tree
not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of this chapter, or
otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use. No
nonconforming use shall be structurally altered or permitted to grow higher, so
as to increase the nonconformity, and a nonconforming use, once substantially
abated (subject to the underlying zoning ordinance), may only be reestablished
consistent with the provisions herein.
(Ord. 896, passed 12-21-2011)
§ 1296.09 OBSTRUCTION MARKING AND LIGHTING.
   Any permit or variance granted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter
may be conditioned according to the process described in §
1296.06 to require the owner of the structure or object of natural growth in
question to permit the municipality, at its own expense, or require the person
requesting the permit or variance, to install, operate and maintain such
marking or lighting as deemed necessary to assure both ground and air safety.
(Ord. 896, passed 12-21-2011)
§ 1296.10 CONFLICTING REGULATIONS.
   Where there exists a conflict between any of the regulations or limitations
prescribed in this chapter and any other regulation applicable to the same
area, the more stringent limitation or requirement shall govern and prevail.
(Ord. 896, passed 12-21-2011)
§ 1296.11 SEVERABILITY.
   If any of the provisions of this Overlay District or the application thereof
to any person or circumstance are held invalid, such invalidity shall not
affect other provisions or applications of this Overlay District which can be
given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end, the
provisions of this Overlay District are declared to be severable.

Section

1298.03   Special exceptions, uses permit process
1298.04   Right of inspection of premises

§ 1298.01 FINDINGS, PURPOSE, INTENT.
   (a)   It is hereby determined that adult entertainment uses, as defined in
this chapter, tend to bring with them secondary concerns that affect the
health, safety and general welfare of the township. These associated concerns
include difficulties for law enforcement, municipal maintenance, trash,
deleterious effects on business and residential property values, and increased
crime, particularly the corruption of the morals of minors and prostitution. In
addition, such uses encourage residents and businesses to move elsewhere.
   (b)   With these concerns in mind, the township is amending this Zoning Code
to establish restrictions and limitations on the location of said activities
within the township. The township has concluded that a permit and/or license
requirement is a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure
that the operators of adult entertainment uses comply with reasonable
regulations and do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as
places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation. The township does not intend
by this chapter to affect or suppress any activities protected by the First
Amendment of the United States Constitution, but only to address the secondary
concerns referred to above.
(Ord. 896, passed 12-21-2011)

   (b)   Permit process. The Zoning Officer upon submission to the township of
an application shall present the applicant with a building permit for an adult
entertainment business, as follows.
      (1)   In LI Districts, a permit shall be issued only if the applicant is

ordinances, and the location of the use is demonstrated to comply with
subsection (a) above.
      (2)   The application for a permit to operate an adult entertainment
business must be made on the form provided by the Zoning Officer. The
application must be accompanied by a sketch or diagram showing the
configuration of the premises, including a statement of the total floor space

if work on the operation ceases for a continuous period of 60 days, provided
that such stoppage is not caused by circumstances beyond the builder’s control,
as certified to by the Building Inspector. Where the permit covers more than
one building, commencement of work on one of them shall be considered as
compliance with the foregoing provision. After issuance of the permit, no
transfer of the same to another party may be made, unless authorized by the
Building Inspector. The permit must be posted in a conspicuous position at the
operation and must so remain until the work is completed.
   (h)   Private garages. The Building Inspector shall not issue a permit for
the erection of a private garage unless such private garage will be accessory

Building Inspector, subject to regulations of the State Department of
Transportation, where applicable.

adjacent highway which in its width is classified as an alley. The fees for
this highway occupancy permit shall in full revert to the township treasury.
      (3)   No materials are to be piled on a street or highway to a greater
distance than ten feet out from the adjacent curb line, and in no case is the
entire roadway to be diminished to such an extent as to prevent the full and
unobstructed passage of one-way traffic between the piles of materials and the
opposite curb line. An unobstructed gutter 16 inches wide must be maintained at
all times at the curb line adjacent to the property under improvement.
      (4)   From sunset to sunrise there shall be displayed sufficient red or
amber lights and at all other times sufficient other safeguards or danger
signals on all materials to warn pedestrians or vehicular traffic of the
danger. Subject to other provisions of this chapter, the footway passing the

      (1)   Certificate required.
         A.   No commercial or residential unit shall be used or occupied for
any purpose until after final inspection by the Building Inspector and issuance

includes any building, or part of a building, which is used as a dwelling for
one or more persons, and COMMERCIAL UNIT means and includes any building, or
part of a building, which is used for any purpose, except as a residential
unit.
      (2)   Inspections. Prior to issuance of any certificate of occupancy, it
shall be the responsibility of the Building Inspector to inspect the building
for reasonable compliance with all township ordinances related to health and
safety and to inspect such building for compliance with the specific
requirements set forth below. This shall include the payment of all pertinent
fees.
      (3)   New construction; residential and commercial.

furnish a plot plan showing the actual placement of the building, with the
dimensions of the front setback and the side and rear yard setbacks.
         B.   Permanent boundary markers must be placed prior to issuance of
the certificate.
         C.   All grading, seeding, sidewalks, streets, paving lights, hydrants
and the like must be installed prior to issuance of the certificate.
         D.   A temporary certificate may be issued, at the discretion of the
Building Inspector, if the premises are deemed habitable. However, such
temporary certificate may be cancelled by the Building Inspector upon
reasonable extension of time to correct and supplement the necessary items set
forth in subsections (m)(3)A., (a)(3)B. and (m)(3)C. above.
      (4)   Transfer and/or resale of all residential or commercial buildings.
         A.   Every agreement of sale of land with a building thereon erected
shall be immediately reported to the Building Inspector by the seller and
buyer. Failure to report the agreement or otherwise comply with the terms of
this section will subject both parties to penalties, including fines and
possible eviction proceedings.

occupancy of the premises will result in the imposition of a fine of up to $100
per day and possible eviction proceedings.
      (5)   Fees. All fees shall be paid at the time the application is made
and shall be the responsibility of the seller, with respect to new
construction, and the applicant for the certificate in all other cases. The fee
shall be established by the Board of Township Commissioners from time to time
by resolution.
      (6)   Water supply. If a commercial or residential unit is not serviced
by public water, the applicant shall, before the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy, provide the Building Inspector with a certificate from a certified
laboratory that the water supply is potable and not detrimental to the health
of any person.

construction or development occurring in any of the Floodplain Districts
designated in the Township Zoning Code.
(Ord. 529, passed 7-15-1981)
§ 1442.02 ELEVATIONS FOR RESIDENTIAL AND NONRESIDENTIAL STRUCTURES IN
FLOODPLAIN DISTRICTS.
   (a)   Residential structures. Within any designated Floodway (FW), Flood-
Fringe (FF) or General Floodplain (FA) District, the lowest floor (including
the basement) of any new or improved residential structure shall be at least
one and one-half feet above the 100-year flood elevation.
   (b)   Nonresidential structures.
      (1)   Within any designated Floodway (FW), Flood-Fringe (FF) or General
Floodplain (FA) District, the lowest floor (including the basement) of any new
or new or improved nonresidential structure shall be at least one and one-half
feet above the 100-year flood elevation or be designed and constructed so that
the space enclosed by such structure shall remain either completely or
essentially dry during any flood up to that height.
      (2)   Any structure, or part thereof, which will not be completely or
adequately elevated, shall be designed and constructed to be completely or
essentially dry in accordance with the standards contained in the publication
entitled Floodproofing Regulations, or some other equivalent standard, for that
type of construction.
(Ord. 529, passed 7-15-1981)
§ 1442.03 DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   (a)   Drainage facilities. Storm drainage facilities shall be designed to
convey the flow of stormwater run-off in a safe and efficient manner. The

drainage away from buildings. The system shall also be designed to prevent the
discharge of excess run-off onto adjacent properties.
   (b)   Sanitary sewer facilities. All new or replacement sanitary sewer
facilities, and private package sewage treatment plants (including all pumping
stations and collector systems), shall be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems
into the flood waters. In addition, they should be located and constructed to
minimize or eliminate flood damage and impairment.
   (c)   Water facilities. All new or replacement water facilities shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system
and be located and constructed to minimize flood damage.

points;
      (2)   Consist of soil or small rock materials only; sanitary landfills
shall not be permitted;
      (3)   Be compacted to provide the necessary permeability and resistance
to erosion, scouring or settling;
      (4)   Be not steeper than one vertical to two horizontal, unless
substantiated data justifying steeper slopes are submitted to and approved by
the Township Engineer; and
      (5)   Be used to the extent to which it does not adversely affect
adjacent properties.
   (g)   Placement of buildings and structures. All buildings and structures
shall be constructed and placed on the lot so as to offer the minimum
obstruction to the flow of water. In so doing, consideration shall be given to
their effect upon the flow and height of flood waters.
   (h)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All buildings and structures shall be firmly anchored in accordance
with accepted engineering practices to prevent flotation, collapse or other
movement, thus reducing the threat to life and property and decreasing the
possibility of the blockage of bridge openings and other restricted sections of
watercourses.
      (2)   All air ducts, large pipes and storage tanks located at or below
the regulatory flood elevation shall be firmly anchored in accordance with
accepted engineering practices to prevent flotation.
   (I)   Floors, walls and ceilings. Where located at or below the regulatory
flood elevation:
      (1)   Wood flooring shall be installed to accommodate a lateral expansion
of the flooring, perpendicular to the flooring grain, without incurring
structural damage to the building;
      (2)   Plywood shall be of any “exterior” or “marine” grade and of a
water-resistant or waterproof variety;
      (3)   Walls and ceilings in nonresidential structures shall have
sufficient wet strength and be so installed as to survive inundation; and
      (4)   Window frames, door frames, door jambs and other components shall
be made of metal or other water-resistant material.

      (1)   All electric water heaters, electric furnaces, electric air
conditioning and ventilating systems and other electrical equipment or
apparatus shall be permitted only at elevations above the regulatory flood
elevation.
      (2)   No electrical distribution panel shall be allowed at an elevation
less than three feet above the level of the 100-year flood elevation.
      (3)   Separate electrical circuits shall serve lower levels and shall be
dropped from above.
   (k)   Plumbing.
      (1)   Water heaters, furnaces and other mechanical equipment or apparatus
shall be permitted only at elevations above the regulatory flood elevation.
      (2)   No part of any on-site sewage disposal system shall be constructed
within any designated Floodplain District.
      (3)   Water supply systems and sanitary sewerage systems shall be
designed to preclude infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into flood waters.
      (4)   All gas and oil supply systems shall be designed to preclude the
infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems
into flood waters. Additional provisions shall be made for the drainage of
these systems in the event that flood water infiltration occurs.
   (l)   Paints and adhesives. Where located at or below the regulatory flood
elevation:
      (1)   Adhesives shall have a bonding strength that is unaffected by
inundation (i.e., “marine” or water-resistant quality);
      (2)   All wooden components (doors, trim, cabinets and the like) shall be
sealed with a “marine” or water-resistant quality adhesive or similar product;
and
      (3)   Paints or other finishes shall be capable of surviving inundation
(i.e., “marine” or water-resistant quality).
   (m)   Storage. No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive or, in
time of flooding, could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be
stored below the regulatory flood elevation.
(Ord. 529, passed 7-15-1981)
§ 1442.04 SPECIAL FLOOD DAMAGE CONTROL PROVISIONS FOR MANUFACTURED HOMES AND
MANUFACTURED HOME PARKS IN THE DESIGNATED FLOODPLAIN DISTRICTS.
   (a)   All manufactured homes and any additions thereto shall be anchored to
resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement by providing over-the-top and
frame ties to ground anchors in accordance with the American National Standards
Institute and National Fire Protection Association Standards as specified in
Pa. Flood Plain Management Act, 1978, Act 176 and the National Flood Insurance
Program, or other appropriate standards, such as the following.
      (1)   Over-the-top ties shall be provided at each of the four corners of
the manufactured home, with two additional ties per side at intermediate
locations for units 50 feet or more in length, and one additional tie per side
for units less than 50 feet in length.
      (2)   Frame ties shall be provided at each corner of the manufactured
home, with five additional ties per side at intermediate locations for units 50
feet or more in length, and four additional ties per side for units less than
50 feet in length.
      (3)   All components of the anchoring system shall be capable of carrying
a force of 4,800 pounds per square inch.
   (b)   All manufactured homes and any additions thereto shall also be
elevated and on a permanent foundation in accordance with the following
requirements.
      (1)   The stands or lots shall be elevated on compacted fill or on

§ 1442.05 EXISTING STRUCTURES IN DESIGNATED FLOODPLAIN DISTRICTS.
   Structures existing in any designated Floodplain District prior to the
enactment of this chapter (Ord. 529, passed July 15, 1981), but which are not
in compliance with this chapter, may continue to remain, subject to the
following provisions.
   (a)   Existing structures located in a designated Floodway District or area
shall not be expanded or enlarged unless the effect of the proposed expansion
or enlargement on flood heights is fully offset by accompanying improvements.
   (b)   Any modification, alteration, reconstruction or improvement of any
kind to an existing structure, to an extent or amount of less than 50% of its
market value, shall be elevated and/or floodproofed to the greatest extent

developer or landowner, the township may, upon request, grant relief from the
strict application of the requirements of this chapter.
   (b)   Requests for variances from the strict application of the provisions
of this chapter may be granted by the township in accordance with the following
procedures and criteria.
      (1)   No variance shall be granted for any construction, development, use
or activity within any designated Floodway (FW) District that would cause any
increase in the 100-year elevation.
      (2)   If granted, a variance shall involve only the least modification
necessary to provide relief.
      (3)   In granting any variance, the township may attach whatever
reasonable conditions and safeguards it considers necessary in order to protect
the public health, safety and welfare and to achieve the objectives of this
chapter.
      (4)   Whenever a variance is granted, the township shall notify the
applicant in writing that:
         A.   The granting of the variance may result in increased premium
rates for flood insurance; and
         B.   Such variance may increase the risks to life and property.
      (5)   In reviewing any request for a variance, the township shall
consider, inter alia, the following:
         A.   There is good and sufficient cause;
         B.   Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant; and
         C.   The granting of the variance will not result in any unacceptable
or prohibited increase in flood heights, additional threats to public safety or
extraordinary public expense, or create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public or conflict with any other applicable local or
state law or regulation.
      (6)   A complete record of all variance requests and related actions
shall be maintained by the township. In addition, a report of all variances
granted during the year shall be included in the annual report to the Federal
Insurance Administration.

or her personally, sent by registered mail to his or her last known address or
posted in a conspicuous place in or about the dwelling affected by the notice,
or if he or she is served with such notice by any other method authorized or
required under the laws of the state.

finding as to whether the provisions of this Housing Code and of the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant thereto have been complied with, the Board shall

   (b)   Every operating license shall be effective for one year from its date
of issuance, unless sooner revoked, and may be renewed for successive periods
of not more than one year.
   (c)   The BCO-CEO is hereby authorized, upon application therefor, to issue
new operating licenses and renewals thereof, in the names of applicant owners
or operators of multiple dwellings and rooming houses. No such license shall be

connection with which the license is sought, is found, after inspection, to
meet all requirements of this chapter and of applicable rules and regulations
issued pursuant hereto.
   (d)   No operating license shall be issued or renewed unless the applicant
owner or operator has first made application therefor on an application form
provided by the BCO-CEO. The BCO-CEO shall develop such forms and make them
available to the public.
   (e)   No operating license shall be issued or renewed unless the applicant
owner or operator agrees in his or her application to such inspections,
pursuant to §
1461.01, as the BCO-CEO may require to determine whether or not the multiple
dwelling or rooming house in connection with which such license is sought is in
compliance with this chapter and with applicable rules and regulations issued

name of his or her agent for the receipt of service of notices of violation of
this chapter and for service of process pursuant to this chapter.
   (h)   No operating license shall be issued or renewed for a resident
applicant, unless such applicant has first designated an agent for the receipt
of service of notices of violation of this chapter and for service of process
pursuant to this chapter when such applicant is absent from the township for 30
or more days. Such a designation shall be made in writing and shall accompany
each application form. The applicant may designate any person resident in the

result of inspections by the BCO-CEO. Such record shall be made available to
the BCO-CEO by the owner or operator when requested. Every owner or operator
subject to this section shall be notified that such record may be used in
administrative or judicial proceedings pursuant to this chapter. The BCO-CEO
shall, upon the issuance of a license as required in this section, advise the
licensee of the necessity for such records and the manner in which such records
shall be kept.
   (l)   Whenever, upon inspection of the licensed multiple dwelling, rental
dwelling or rooming house, or of the records required to be kept by subsection
(k) above, the BCO-CEO finds that conditions or practices exist which are in
violation of this chapter or of any applicable rules and regulations issued
pursuant hereto, he or she shall serve the owner or operator with notice of
such violation in the manner hereinafter provided. Such notice shall state that
unless the violations cited are corrected within a reasonable time, the
operating license may be suspended.
   (m)   At the end of the time the BCO-CEO has allowed for correction of any
violation cited, the BCO- CEO shall reinspect the multiple dwelling, rental
dwelling or rooming house, and if he or she determines that such conditions
have not been corrected, he or she may issue an order suspending the operating
license.

of suspension, the license shall be revoked. However, prior to revocation, any
person whose license has been suspended may request a reinspection upon a
showing that the violations cited in the notice have been corrected.

rental dwelling or rooming house in connection with which the notice was issued
is now in compliance with this chapter and with applicable rules and
regulations issued pursuant hereto, he or she shall reinstate the license. A
request for a reinspection shall not extend the suspension period, unless the
BCO-CEO grants such request.
   (p)   Any rented single-family dwelling owner whose tenant has six police
complaints against the tenant or property will have its operating license and
its use and occupancy license suspended. After three complaints, the owner will
be notified, via certified mail, that there have been three complaints against
their tenant or property and after an additional three complaints the operating
license and/or use and occupancy license will be withdrawn for one year.
   (q)   Any owner who has been notified that there have been six complaints
and his or her use and occupancy license and his or her operating license have
been withdrawn. Once notified of the six complaints the owner shall have seven
days to start eviction proceedings and show proof and court date to the
township. If proof is not shown in seven days, a citation shall be issued on a
weekly basis until proof is shown of eviction proceedings. After the tenant is
evicted, the one year suspension will commence.

dwelling unit or rooming unit described in the notice, or by causing such
notice to be published in a newspaper of general circulation for a period of
three consecutive days.

alleged violation, the BCO- CEO shall reinspect the rental dwelling, multiple
dwelling unit or rooming unit described in the notice.
   (c)   If, upon reinspection, the alleged violations are determined by the
BCO-CEO not to have been corrected, he or she shall issue a second notice of
violation which shall constitute an order requiring that the then existing
failures meet the requirements of this chapter, or of applicable existing rules
or regulations issued pursuant hereto, and shall be corrected within a
reasonable time allowed, if the person served with such notice does not request
a reconsideration or petition for a hearing on the matter in the manner
hereinafter provided.
   (d)   The BCO-CEO shall cause a copy of the second notice to be posted in a
conspicuous place in or about the dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit where
the violations are alleged to exist, and shall serve it in the manner provided
in subsections (a) through (c) above.
   (e)   The BCO-CEO, after the expiration of time granted the person served
with such second notice to seek reconsideration or a hearing in the manner

second notice to be recorded in the office of the County Recorder of Deeds.
   (f)   All subsequent transferees of the dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming
unit in connection with which a second notice has been so recorded shall be
deemed to have notice of the continuing existence of the violations alleged,
and shall be liable to all penalties and procedures provided by this chapter
and by applicable rules and regulations issued pursuant hereto to the same
degree as was the transferor.

Township Commissioners. Any person affected by any notice which has been issued
in connection with the enforcement of this chapter or of any rule or regulation

matter before the Board, provided that such person files, in the office of the
New Construction Committee, a written petition requesting such hearing and
setting forth a brief statement of the grounds therefor within 14 days after

set a time and place of such hearing and shall give the petitioner written
notice thereof. At such hearing the petitioner shall be given an opportunity to
be heard and to show why such notice should be modified or withdrawn. The
hearing shall be commenced not later than ten days after the day on which the
petition was filed. However, upon application of the petitioner, the BCO-CEO
may postpone the date of the hearing for a reasonable time beyond such ten-day
period if, in his or her judgment, the petitioner has submitted sufficient
reason for such postponement. After the hearing, the Board may sustain, modify
or withdraw the notice of the violation on the basis of the findings of the
hearing and shall give the petitioner written notice thereof. Such proceedings
shall be summarized in writing and shall become a matter of public record in
the office of the BCO-CEO. Such record shall also include a copy of every
notice or order issued in connection with the matter. Any person aggrieved by
the decision of the Board may seek relief therefrom in any court of competent
jurisdiction, as provided by the laws of the state.

the following shall apply:
      (1)   With respect to maintaining premises in a clean and sanitary
condition:
         A.   For a single nonresidential unit, the occupant is responsible for
that part of the premises which he or she occupies and controls, and the owner
is responsible for any other area; and
         B.   For a building containing two or more nonresidential or
institutional units, the owner shall be responsible for shared or public areas
of the premises.
      (2)   With respect to structural repairs, maintenance and painting of the
exterior of the building and the parking lot, sidewalk and curb repairs, common
lawn and landscaped area maintenance and other requirements of §
1462.04, other than those provided for in subsection (a)(1)A. above, the owner
shall be responsible.
   (b)   No owner shall be relieved of the responsibility for compliance with
this chapter, or be entitled to defend against any charge of violation thereof,
by reason of the fact that he or she has contracted with an agent to be
responsible therefor or by reason of the fact that the owner’s agent or the
occupant is also jointly responsible therefor and in violation thereof.

§ 1462.07 NOTICES OF VIOLATION.
   A notice of violation of any of the provisions of this chapter or an order
to abate an illegal or unsafe condition hereunder shall be sent by certified
mail, return receipt requested, to the owner of the property. In the event of
multiple occupancy of the property, such notice shall be sent to both the owner
of the property and the occupant. Hand delivery of such notice to an adult
individual in charge of the property shall satisfy, and may be a substitute
for, the requirement of mail delivery of such written notice. No penalty may be
enforced against an owner or occupant unless such owner or occupant has failed
to comply with the terms of such written notice and has been given at least
five days to do so. The number of days granted for compliance shall be computed
by excluding the date of receipt and counting the last day, whether or not the
same falls on a weekend or holiday. Delivery of such written notice is not
required, however, in the event of an emergency situation where there is
imminent danger of substantial harm to property or threat to human life. In
such a situation, personal notice to the owner or occupant shall constitute the
necessary notice required to invoke the penalty provisions of this chapter.

may refuse to approve future applications under this chapter to a person who
violates any of the provisions of this chapter, until such violation is
corrected. The township may also proceed in a court of equity to specifically
enforce the provisions of this chapter and to seek equitable relief to prohibit
a continuing violation of any of the provisions of this chapter.

Secretary of the township an amount from the insurance proceeds sufficient to
pay said sums prior to making payment to the named insured, subject to the
provisions of subsection (c) below.
   (c)   When all municipal claims and municipal expenses have been paid
pursuant to subsection (b) above or when the Township Treasurer has issued a
certificate described in subsection (b)(2) above indicating that there are no
municipal claims or municipal expenses against the property, the insurer shall
pay the claim of the named insured; provided, however, that if the loss agreed

engineering, legal or administrative costs incurred by the township in
connection with such removal, repair or securing or any proceedings related
thereto;
         B.   Mail to the named insured at the address received from the
insurer a notice that the proceeds have been received by the township and that
the procedures under this subsection (c)(2) shall be followed;

a contractor’s signed estimate of the cost of removing, repairing or securing
the building or other structure, in which event the Township Secretary shall,
if such estimates deemed by the Township Secretary to be reasonable, return to
the insured the amount of the funds transferred to the township in excess of
that amount required to pay the municipal expenses; provided, however, that the
township has not commenced to remove, repair or secure the building or other
structure in which case the township will complete the work;
         D.   Pay to the Secretary of the township for reimbursement to the
Township General Fund, the amount of the municipal expenses paid by the

of the township to recover any deficiency in the amount of municipal claims or
municipal expenses recovered pursuant to this chapter, or to insurance
proceeds, by an action at law or in equity to enforce the township codes or to
enter into an agreement with the named insured with regard to such other

sale. This section shall not apply where a seller, by providing the health
record of the dog in accordance with §

§ 1820.06 PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES FOR TATTOO ESTABLISHMENT.
   (a)   Instrument cleaning, sterilization, storage, handling and
construction.
      (1)   Cleaning and preparation of instruments for sterilization. After
each tattooing operation, the tubes and needle bars shall be placed in an
ultrasonic-type machine to remove any foreign material. A high quality
detergent material which shall be changed daily and is suitable for an
ultrasonic machine is to be used. Ultrasonic cleaners must be operated with the
lids on to prevent contamination of adjacent surfaces. When this process is
completed, the tubes and needle bars are to be rinsed in accordance with the
manufacturers’ directions and shall be placed in a self-sealing autoclavable
bag which is dated with an expiration date not to exceed six months, and sealed
in preparation for autoclaving.
      (2)   Autoclave. Each tattoo establishment is to be equipped with an
autoclave which is a design, style or model that has received clearance by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration for conformance with § 510(k) of the Federal
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, being 21 U.S.C. §§ 301 et seq. Alternate
sterilizing equipment may only be used when specifically approved in writing by
the township. After each use and before use on another customer, all needle
bars, grips, and other tubes and needles shall be processed by the following
procedure: cleaned, packaged in a self-sealing autoclave bag which is dated
with an expiration date not to exceed six months, and arranged in an autoclave
which is operated in strict accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
As the operation time of the autoclave may vary with the type of instrument,
the packaging of that item and the arrangement of items in the autoclave, it is
critical that the manufacturer’s operation manual be followed. This will assure
that each item placed in the autoclave achieves the proper temperature for
sterilization. Temperature sensitive autoclave tape, autoclave bags with a
chemical color indicator on the bag or any other temperature sensitive medium
approved for autoclaves by the township must be applied to each load every time
the autoclave is used. To further confirm that the autoclave is operated in a
manner to assure sterility of the processed instruments, it must be tested
monthly using a biological indicator such as spore strips or spore suspensions
which are processed by a laboratory. Records documenting such testing must be
maintained by the operator for three years. A copy of the manufacturer’s
recommended procedures for the operation of the autoclave is to be available
for inspection by the township.
      (3)   Storage. Sterile instruments must be stored in a condition so as to
maintain their sterility, All sterile and ready to use needles and instruments
in their autoclaved bag or container, or in the manufacturer’s original
packaging shall be kept in an easily cleanable, dry enclosed glass, plastic or
metal case, cabinet or drawer while not in use. Such enclosure shall be
maintained in a sanitary manner at all times. Sterile instruments may not be
used if the package has been breached or after the expiration date without
first repackaging and resterilizing.
      (4)   Handling. The needles and instruments shall be used, handled and
temporarily placed during tattooing so that they are not contaminated.
      (5)   Construction. Solder used for the attachment of needles to the
needle bars for use in a tattoo machine shall be lead free.
      (6)   Cleaning of other instruments and articles. Articles that do not
penetrate the skin, but are used on customers, including containers used for
storage of items and the collection of dirty instruments, must be thoroughly
cleaned before and after each use. These are to be cleaned by rinsing in warm
water, thoroughly washing with hot water and soap or detergent, rinsing in
water at a temperature of 160°F, allowed to air dry and stored in a clean,
enclosed container or manner to prevent recontamination. Instruments which can
be damaged by water, such as the electrical handpiece, are to be thoroughly
wiped with clean cotton wool or a cotton pad saturated with 70% isopropyl
alcohol, allowed to air dry and stored in a clean, enclosed container or manner
to prevent recontamination.

      (1)   Stencils shall be single use disposable carbon or thermal spirit
master units.
      (2)   Petroleum based jellies, soaps and other products used for the
application of stencils shall be dispensed and applied on the area to prevent
contamination of the original container and its contents. If used, the gauze
shall be used only once and then discarded.
   (c)   Use of dyes, inks and pigments.

recommended by the manufacturer.
      (2)   Immediately before applying a tattoo, the quantity of dye, ink or
pigment to be used for the tattoo shall be transferred from the supply bottles
and placed into sterile, single use paper cups or plastic caps. Upon completion
of the tattoo, these single use cups or caps and their contents shall be
discarded.
      (3)   Excess dye, ink or pigment shall be removed from the skin with a
single service wiping tissue or sterile gauze which shall be discarded after
use on each customer. Enough wipes to be used on one customer should be kept in
the working area and any not used should be immediately discarded.
   (d)   Inspection, shaving and preparation of the skin.
      (1)   No tattooing shall be done on skin surfaces which have any rash,
pimples, boils, infections or any other evidence of any unhealthy condition. No
tattoo operator shall remove any tattoo marks.
      (2)   If the skin is to be shaved, it must first be washed with soap and
warm water. Safety razors with single service blades for each patron shall be
used for the preparation of the areas to be tattooed. The blade shall be
discarded after each use and the blade holder, if reused, shall be autoclaved
after each use.
      (3)   After shaving, the area to be tattooed shall be prepared by washing
with soap and warm water and gently scrubbed with a sterile gauze pad soaked in
a germicidal preparation that is registered with the Environmental Protection
Agency.

check the flow of blood is prohibited.
   (e)   Concluding procedure. After completing work on any person, the
tattooed area shall be washed with a sterile gauze saturated with an approved
antiseptic solution or a 70% alcohol solution. The tattooed area shall be
allowed to air dry and an antibacterial cream or lotion from a single-use
dispenser is to be applied using sterile gauze. A dressing shall then be
affixed over the tattooed area using either a non-stick bandage (telfa) or a
sterile gauze attached with adhesive tape. Where adhesive tape is used, the
client is to be advised as to the procedure for its removal.
   (f)   Linens. If reusable cloth items are used in the care and treatment of
the client, they shall be changed after each use. The used linens shall be
placed in a closed or covered container and laundered on a weekly basis or more
frequently depending upon storage capacity and degree of contamination of the
linen. Used linens shall be laundered either by a commercial laundering or by a
noncommercial laundering process which includes immersion in laundry detergent
and chlorine bleach water or immersion in water at 160°F for not less than 15
minutes during the washing and rinsing operation. The laundered linens shall be
stored in a clean, enclosed storage area until needed for immediate use.

necessary for safe travel. Hedges shall not be permitted to grow to a height of
over three feet for a distance of 50 feet from the point of intersection of any
street or lot. Where the height of the land is such that the combined height

within 15 feet of the edge of the paving. The area must be kept mowed as
mentioned above. If large trees exist within the 15-foot space, the growth
around them shall be kept mowed and the limbs trimmed so that they do not
present an obstacle to the free flow of traffic.
   (j)   In areas where the township or state maintains guardrails, the owner
shall not be required to mow between the guardrail and the paving of the street
or road.
