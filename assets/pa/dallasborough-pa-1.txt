Preliminary Provisions
§ 1-101.   Short Title.
   The short title of this Code of Ordinances prepared and published for the
Borough of Dallas shall be the “Borough of Dallas Code of Ordinances.”
(A.O.)
§ 1-102.   Citation of Code of Ordinances.
   The Borough of Dallas Code of Ordinances may be cited by Section number. The
approved short form is “Code.” Thus, “Code, § 27-101" refers to § 101 of
Chapter 27 of this Code of Ordinances.
(A.O.)
§ 1-103.   Arrangement of Code.
   1.   This Code is divided into Chapters which are subdivided as follows:
   A.   Subchapters, identified by capital letters, beginning with a Chapter
title and number.
   B.   Parts, identified by Arabic numerals, beginning with a Part title and
number.
   C.   Subparts, identified by Arabic numerals, beginning with a title.
   2.   The Sections of the Code are subdivided as follows:
   A.   Subsections, identified by Arabic numerals.
   B.   Paragraphs, identified by capital letters.
   C.   Subparagraphs, identified by Arabic numerals enclosed within
parentheses.
   D.   Clauses, identified by lower case letters enclosed within parentheses.
   E.   Subclauses, identified by Arabic numerals followed by a parenthesis.
   F.   Items, identified by lower case letters followed by a parenthesis.
   G.   Subitems, identified by small Roman numerals.
(A.O.)
§ 1-104.   Headings.
   Chapter, Subchapter, Part, Subpart, Section, Subsection, Paragraph,
Subparagraph, Clause, and Subclause headings contained in the Code may not be
deemed to govern, limit, modify or affect the scope, meaning or intent of the
Code. The headings of Sections, Subsections or other divisions of this Code are
intended as mere captions to indicate the contents of the Section, Subsection
or other division and shall not be deemed to be taken as titles of such
Section, Subsection or other division, nor as any part of said Section,
Subsection or other division unless expressly so provided.
(A.O.)
§ 1-105.   Tenses, Gender and Number.
   Except as may be otherwise stated in any provision of this Code, the present
tense includes the past and future tenses, and the future the present; the
masculine gender includes the feminine and neuter, the feminine includes the
masculine and neuter, and the neuter includes the masculine and feminine; and
the singular includes the plural, and the plural the singular.
(A.O.)
§ 1-106.   Construction.
   1.   Except as may be otherwise specifically provided by any provision of
this Code, the Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 1501 et seq.,
shall be applied in construing this Code.
   2.   Effect of Repeal or Expiration of Code Section.
   A.   The repeal of a Code Section or ordinance, or its expiration by virtue
of any provision contained therein, shall not affect any right accrued or any
offense committed, any penalty or punishment incurred, or any proceeding
commenced before the repeal took effect or the ordinance expired.
   B.   When any ordinance repealing a former Code Section, ordinance, clause
or provision shall itself be repealed, such repeal shall not be construed to
revive such former Code Section, ordinance, clause or provision, unless it
shall be expressly so provided.
   3.   Saving Clause. The provisions of this Code, so far as they are the same
as those ordinances and regulations in force immediately prior to the adoption
of this Code, are intended as a continuation of such ordinances, resolutions
and regulations and not as a new enactment. The provisions of this Code shall
not affect any suit or prosecution pending or to be instituted to enforce any
of the prior ordinances or regulations. Except as specifically stated in this
Code or in the ordinance adopting this consolidation, codification and revision
of the ordinances and regulations, it is the intention of the Borough Council
that no ordinance or regulation of the Borough be amended, revised or repealed
by implication.
   4.   Resolutions. The provisions of this Code of Ordinances may contain
resolutions, that is, actions of the Borough Council (in written form and
designated "resolution”) which did not require prior public notice in
accordance with the provisions of the Borough Code, 53 P.S. §§ 45101 et seq.,
at the time of their passage by the Borough Council. Such "resolutions” are
included herein for ease of reference and the Borough Council does not intend
by their inclusion herein to require prior public notice before amending,
revising or repealing such resolution or resolutions as may have been included
herein in the future. It is the intention of the Borough Council that such
actions of the Borough Council that may be included in this Code and
specifically cited and designated as a resolution shall not become an ordinance
(requiring prior public notice before amendment, revision or repeal) by the
simple fact of inclusion in this Code.
(A.O.)
§ 1-107.   Normal Numbering.
   1.   Chapters. Chapters are numbered sequentially in Arabic throughout this
Code.
   2.   Parts. Parts are numbered sequentially in Arabic throughout this Code.
   3.   Whenever other divisions are necessary, Chapters shall be divided into
Subchapters, Parts into Subparts and designated with the Chapter or Part number
followed by a capital letter. For instance, Chapter 1 may be divided into
Subchapters 1A and 1B.
   4.   Sections. Sections are numbered sequentially throughout a Chapter and a
Part such that the first number or numbers is the Chapter number, followed by a
hyphen, followed by the Part number, followed by the Section number within the
Part. For example, "§ 1-101" designates Chapter 1, Part 1, Section 1.
Similarly, “§ 27-305" designates Chapter 27, Part 3, Section 5.
   5.   Internal Divisions of Sections. Whenever internal divisions are
necessary, Sections shall be divided into Subsections, Subsections into
Paragraphs, Paragraphs into Subparagraphs, Subparagraphs into Clauses, and
Clauses into Subclauses, and Subclauses into Items, designated as follows:
   1.   Subsection.
   A.   Paragraph.
   (1)   Subparagraph.
   (a)   Clause.
   1)   Subclause.
   a)   Item.
   i.   Subitem.
(A.O.)
§ 1-108.   Special Numbering Problems.
   1.   Addition of New Units Between Existing Units. If it becomes necessary
to introduce a new Chapter, Part or Section between existing Chapters, Parts or
Sections, the new Chapter, Part or Section shall be designated by the addition
of a capital letter suffix to the preceding Chapter, Part or Section number.
Thus, a Chapter introduced between Chapters 5 and 6 would be Chapter 5A and
Sections in that Chapter would be numbered, for instance, “§ 5A-101.” If it
becomes necessary to introduce a Part between existing Parts 5 and 6 the new
Part would be Part 5A and Sections in that Part would be numbered, for
instance, “§ 5-5A01.” A new Section introduced between existing Sections 5 and
6 would be “§ 5-105A.” When a number of new Parts or Sections have been
introduced the Chapter or Part shall be renumbered.
   2.   If it becomes necessary to introduce a Subsection between Subsections,
for instance, Subsections .5 and .6, the new Subsection would be numbered
Subsection .5-A.
   3.   If it becomes necessary to introduce a unit smaller than a Subsection
between existing units, the entire Subsection shall be revised and renumbered.
   4.   Vacated Numbers. Whenever a number is vacated by a revocation or
repeal, the remaining elements in the overall unit shall retain their old
numbers until the overall unit is completely revised. Prior to revision, the
vacated number may be marked: “[Reserved].”
(A.O.)
§ 1-109.   Amending Code.
   1.   All ordinances passed subsequent to the adoption of this Code which
amend, repeal or in any way affect this Code shall be numbered in accordance
with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion herein. In the
case of repealed Chapters, Parts, Sections, Paragraphs, Clauses or other part
or provision hereof, by subsequent ordinance, such repealed portions may be
excluded from this Code by omission from reprinted pages affected thereby. The
subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed, or omitted in the case of
repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such
time as this Code and subsequent ordinances omitted are readopted as a new Code
by the Borough Council.
   2.   Amendment to any provision of this Code shall be made by specific
reference to the Chapter, Part, Section and/or Subsection number of this Code
in the following language:
   A.   Amendment or Revision. "Chapter        , Part        , Section        ,
Subsection        , is hereby amended (revised) to read as follows . . . .” The
amended or revised provisions may then be set out in full as desired.
   B.   Addition. "Chapter        , Part        , Section        , Subsection
       , is hereby amended by the addition of the following . . . .” The new
provision shall then be set out in full as desired.
   C.   Repeal. "Chapter        , Part       , Section        , Subsection
       , is hereby repealed in its entirety.”
   3.   It is the intention of the Borough Council that the numbering scheme of
this Code be adhered to in enacting future ordinances. In the event that any
ordinance or other enactment be adopted which does not conform to the numbering
system of this Code, it is the intention of the Borough Council that such
enactment be renumbered in the process of supplementing, revising or updating
this Code to conform to the numbering scheme of this Code. The Borough Council
hereby acknowledges and confirms that the numbering scheme herein is for ease
of reference and that the renumbering of any enactment when added to this Code
shall not in any manner affect the validity of said enactment.
(A.O.)
§ 1-110. Altering Code.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to change or amend by addition or
deletion any part or portion of this Code, or to insert or delete pages or
portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner
whatsoever, except by ordinance or resolution or other official act of the
Borough Council.
(A.O.)
§ 1-111.   Penalties.
   1.   Penalty Where No Penalty Provided. Whenever in this Code or in any
ordinance of the Borough any act is prohibited or is declared to be unlawful,
or whenever in this Code or other ordinance the doing of any act is declared to
be unlawful, and no specific penalty is provided therefor:
   A.   Violations of Health, Safety and Welfare Provisions. For violations of
ordinances adopting building, housing, property maintenance, health, fire or
public safety codes; and for ordinances regulating water services, water
pollution, air pollution and noise, the following penalty shall be provided:
   (1)   Any person, firm or corporation who shall violate any provision of
this Part, upon conviction thereof in an action brought before a magisterial
district judge in the manner provided for the enforcement of summary offenses
under the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, shall be sentenced to pay a
fine of not more than $1,000 plus costs together with reasonable attorney fees
and, in default of payment of said fine and costs, to a term of imprisonment
not to exceed 90 days. Each day that a violation of this Part continues or each
Section of this Part which shall be found to have been violated shall
constitute a separate offense.
   B.   Other Violations. All other penalties, except for penalties in
Chapter 15, “Motor Vehicles and Traffic” (based on the Vehicle Code, 75
Pa.C.S.A. §§ 101 et seq.), penalties and ordinances adopted under the authority
of the Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §§ 10101 et seq., earned income
tax ordinances adopted under the Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. § 6913, and
ordinances adopted under authority of the Sewage Facilities Act, 35 P.S. §§
750.1 et seq., should provide, generally:
   (1)   Any person, partnership, or corporation who or which has violated or
permitted the violation of the provisions of this Part, upon being found liable
therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the Borough, shall pay
a judgment of not more than $600 plus all court costs and reasonable attorney
fees. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or payable until the
date of the determination of a violation by a magisterial district judge. If
the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the Borough may
enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each
day that a violation continues or each Section of this Part which shall be
found to have been violated shall constitute a separate violation.
   2.   The imposition of a penalty under the provisions of this Code shall not
prevent the revocation of any permit or license or the taking of other punitive
or remedial action where called for or permitted under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the United States of America. In addition, the
Borough may institute injunctive, mandamus or any other appropriate action or
proceeding at law or in equity for the enforcement of this Code. Any court of
competent jurisdiction shall have the right to issue restraining orders,
temporary or permanent injunctions, mandamus, or other appropriate forms of
remedy or relief.

Open Records Policy
§ 1-601.   Purpose.
   The purpose of this policy is to assure compliance with Act 3 of 2008, the
Pennsylvania Right-to-Know Law, as amended; to provide access to public records
of the Borough; to preserve the integrity of the Borough’s records; and to
minimize the financial impact to the residents of the Borough regarding the
resources utilized in the receipt and processing of public record requests and
the retrieval and copying of public records.
(Ord. 2008-4, 12/17/2008, § 1)
§ 1-602.   Designated Open Records Officer.
   It is the policy of the Borough to require the presence of a designated
employee when public records are examined and inspected and to charge
reasonable fees for duplication of public records of the Borough. The Borough
designates the Borough Manager as the Open Records Officer, responsible for
assuring compliance with the Pennsylvania Right-to-Know Law, in accordance with
the following guidelines:
   A.   The Borough Manager may designate certain employee(s) or process public
record requests.
   B.   The Borough Manager is responsible for minimizing, where possible, the
financial impact to the Borough regarding the resources utilized in the receipt
and processing of public record requests and the retrieval and copying of
public records.
   C.   All requests for public records of the Borough under this policy shall
be specific in identifying and describing each public record requested. In no
case shall the Borough be required to create a public record which does not
exist or to compile, maintain, format or organize a public record in a manner
in which the Borough does not currently compile, maintain, format or organize
the public record. All requests for public records shall be submitted in
writing and include the date of the request; requestor’s name, address, and
telephone number or request to remain anonymous with contact provisions;
certification of United States residency; signature of requestor; and if
duplication is requested, appropriate payment.
   D.   The designated employee shall make a good faith effort to determine
whether each record requested is a public record.
   E.   The Borough shall facilitate a reasonable response to a request for the
Borough’s public records. In no case is the Borough expected to provide
extraordinary staff to respond to the request, but will respond in a manner
consistent with the Borough’s administrative responsibilities and consistent
with the requirements of the Pennsylvania Right-to-Know Law.
   F.   The designated employee shall respond to the requestor within 5
business days from the date of request of the written request. If the Borough
does not respond within 5 business days of receipt thereof, the request is
deemed denied.
   G.   The response provided by the Borough shall consist of:
   (1)   Approval for access to the public records;
   (2)   Review of the request by the designated employee; or
   (3)   Denial of access to the record requested.
   H.   If access to the public record requested is approved, the public record
shall be available for access during the regular business hours of the Borough.
The designated employee shall cooperate fully with the requestor, while also
taking reasonable measures to protect Borough public records from the
possibility of theft and/or alteration. The presence of a designated employee
is required when public records are examined and inspected.
   I.   Fees for duplication of public records shall be as established by the
Commonwealth’s Office of Public Records. The Borough may at its discretion
waive fees.
   J.   In the event the estimated cost of fulfilling a request submitted under
the policy is expected to exceed $100, the designated employee(s) shall obtain
the expected cost in advance of fulfilling the request to avoid unwarranted
expense of Borough resources.
   K.   If the request is being reviewed, the notice provided by the Borough
shall be in writing and include the reason for the review and the expected
response date, which shall be within 30 days of the notice of review. If the
Borough does not respond within 30 days thereof, the request is deemed denied.
Review of the request is limited to situations where:
   (1)   The record requested contains information which is subject to access,
as well as information which is not subject to access, that must be redacted
prior to a grant of access. The redacted information is considered a denial as
to that information.
(2)   The record requires retrieval from a remote location.
   (3)   A timely response cannot be accomplished due to staffing limitations.
   (4)   A legal review is necessary to determine whether the record requested
is a public record.
   (5)   The requestor has failed to comply with the Borough’s policy and
procedures for requests.
   (6)   The requestor refuses to pay the applicable fees.
   (7)   The extent or nature of the request precludes a response within the
required time period.
   Upon a determination that one of the factors listed above applies, the
Borough shall send written notice to the requestor within 5 business days of
receipt of the request for access. The notice shall include a statement
notifying the requestor that the request for access is being reviewed, the
reason for the review, a reasonable date that a response is expected to be
provided and an estimate of applicable fees owed when the record becomes
available. If the date that a response is expected to be provided is in excess
of 30 days, following the 5 business days allowed for, the request for access
shall be deemed denied unless the requestor has agreed in writing to an
extension to the date specified in the notice. If the requestor agrees to the
extension, the request shall be deemed denied on the day following the date
specified in the notice if the agency has not provided a response by that date.
   L.   If access to the record requested is denied, the notice provided by the
Borough shall be in writing as indicated on the form attached hereto entitled
“Denial of Request to Review and/or Duplicate Dallas Borough Records.”
   M.   If the request is denied or deemed denied, the requestor may file an
appeal with the Commonwealth’s Office of Open Records within 15 business days
of the mailing date of the Borough’s notice of denial, or within 15 days of a
deemed denial. The appeal shall state the grounds upon which the requestor
asserts that the record is a public record and shall address any grounds stated
by the agency for delaying or denying the request.
   N.   Within 30 days of the mailing date of the final determination of the
appeals officer, the requestor or Borough may file a petition for review or
other document as required by rule of court with the Court of Common Pleas for
Luzerne County. The decision of the court shall contain findings of fact and
conclusions of law based upon the evidence as a whole. The decision shall
clearly and concisely explain the rationale for the decision. A petition for
review under this section shall stay the release of documents until a decision
is issued.
   O.   This policy shall be available for review at the Borough Office.

Obscene Films, Publications and Devices; Massage Parlors

exploitation of explicit sexual conduct through the public exhibition of
obscene films and the sale of obscene publications and devices, and the use of
so-called massage parlors and model studios for the purpose of lewdness,

offensive to the senses and to public morals and interferes with the
comfortable enjoyment of life and property, in that such interferes with the
interest of the public in the quality of life and total community environment,
the tone of commerce in the Borough property values, and the public safety; and
that the continued operation of such activities is detrimental to the best
health, safety, convenience, good morals and general welfare of the Borough,

Accordingly, the Borough hereby declares such activities to be illegal as
hereinafter set forth, and further, that such activities are, and are hereby

(Ord. 2012-7, 10/17/2012, § 4.01)
§ 8-302.   Description and Special Requirements of Identified Floodplain Areas.
   The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific
areas:
   A.   Floodway Area.
   (1)   Description. The area identified as Floodway in the FIS which
represents the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must
be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively
increasing the water surface elevation by more than 1 foot at any point.
   This term shall also include floodway areas which have been identified in
other available studies or sources of information for those special floodplain
areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS.
   (2)   Special Requirements.
   (a)   Any encroachment that would cause any increase in flood heights shall
be prohibited.
   (b)   No new construction or development shall be allowed, unless a permit
is obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection Regional Office.
   B.   Special Floodplain Area.
   (1)   Description. The areas identified as Zones AE and A1-30 in the FIS
which are subject to inundation by the 1 percent annual chance flood event
determined by detailed methods and have base flood elevations (BFEs) shown.
   (2)   Special Requirements.
   (a)   No new construction or development shall be located within the area
measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse, unless a
permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection Regional
Office.
   (b)   In special floodplain areas without a designated floodway, no new
development shall be permitted unless it can be demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of all past and projected development will not increase the
BFE by more than 1 foot.
   C.   Approximate Floodplain Area.
   (1)   Description. The areas identified as Zone A in the FIS which are
subject to inundation by the 1 percent annual chance flood event determined
using approximate methodologies. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not
been performed, no BFEs or flood depths are shown.
   (2)   Special Requirements.
   (a)   No new construction or development shall be located within the area
measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse, unless a
permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection Regional
Office.
   (b)   When available, information from other Federal, State, and other
acceptable sources shall be used to determine the BFE, as well as a floodway
area, if possible. When no other information is available, the BFE shall be
determined by using a point on the boundary of the identified floodplain area
which is nearest the construction site in question.
   In lieu of the above, the Borough may require the applicant to determine the
elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others
of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods
used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies,
analyses, computations and the like shall be submitted in sufficient detail to
allow a thorough technical review by the Borough.
   D.   Shallow Flooding Area.
   (1)   Description. The areas identified as Zones AO and AH in the FIS. These
areas are subject to inundation by 1 percent annual chance shallow flooding
where average depths are between 1 and 3 feet.

Economic Development, shall be notified prior to any alteration or relocation
of any watercourse.
   2.   Technical or scientific data shall be submitted, by the applicant, to
FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR) as soon as practicable but within 6
months of any new construction, development, or other activity resulting in
changes in the BFE. The situations when a LOMR or a conditional letter of map
revision (CLOMR) are required are:
   A.   Any development that causes a rise in the base flood elevations within
the floodway.
   B.   Any development occurring in Zones A1-30 and Zone AE without a
designated floodway, which will cause a rise of more than 1 foot in the base
flood elevation.
   C.   Alteration or relocation of a stream (including, but not limited to,
installing culverts and bridges).

FIRM as Zone A, AO, Al-A30, AE, A99, or, AH.
   Start of construction–includes substantial improvement and other proposed
new development and means the date the permit was issued, provided the actual
start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days from the date of the permit
and shall be completed within 12 months after the date of issuance of the
permit unless a time extension is granted, in writing, by the Floodplain
Administrator. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufacture home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first,
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   Structure–a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage
tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
   Subdivision–the division or redivision of a lot, tract, or parcel of land by
any means into two or more lots, tracts, parcels or other divisions of land
including changes in existing lot lines for the purpose, whether immediate or
future, of lease, partition by the court for distribution to heirs, or
devisees, transfer of ownership or building or lot development: provided,
however, that the subdivision by lease of land for agricultural purposes into
parcels of more than 10 acres, not involving any new street or easement of
access or any residential dwelling, shall be exempted.
   Substantial damage–damage from any cause sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50 percent or more of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
   Substantial improvement–any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction”
of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred
“substantial damage” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to
correct existing violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
   A.   Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would
constitute a substantial improvement as defined in this Chapter, must comply
with all ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific ordinance
requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of
Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic places must be obtained from
the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any
exemption from ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
   Uniform Construction Code (UCC)–the statewide building code adopted by the
Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1999 applicable to new construction in all
municipalities whether administered by the Borough, a third party or the
Department of Labor and Industry. Applicable to residential and commercial
buildings, the Code adopted the International Residential Code (IRC) and the
International Building Code (IBC), by reference, as the construction standard
applicable with the State floodplain construction. For coordination purposes,
references to the above are made specifically to various sections of the IRC
and the IBC.
   Violation–the failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in § 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)
(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time
as that documentation is provided.

   B.   Within 30 days of the date of the extraordinary or dangerous occurrence
giving rise to the extraordinary service, the affected department shall submit

Borough Manager for his review. At such time as all costs, fees, charges and
expenses related to extraordinary service have been collected and reviewed by
the Borough Manager, but in any case not later than 60 days from the date of
determining the cost of rendering of the extraordinary services, the Borough
Manager shall send a bill for such costs, fees, charges and expenses, to the
property owner, agent or manager with a demand that a full remittance be made
within 30 days of receipt of any bills. In the unusual circumstances that the
Borough Manager is not able to determine all the costs associated with the
incident within a reasonable time, a partial billing may be made. Interest at
the rate of 6 percent per annum will be charged on all unpaid balances past due
over 30 days. At the discretion of the Department Head, materials used by the

limited to, cleanup costs, fees or expenses) related to an extraordinary or
dangerous occurrence. The Borough Manager shall, if possible, include any and
all such costs or fees in the consolidated bill sent to the property owner. The
Borough shall not, however, waive any right to collect such local, State or
Federal costs if they are not charged to the property owner or his agent within
the consolidated billing 60 days period. In this regard, the Borough Manager
shall expect reimbursement of all local, State or Federal costs within 30 days
of the owners (or his agents) receipt of the bill for these particular costs,
fees and charges and expenses.
   D.   In cases of hardship, or where circumstances are such that a full
remittance cannot be made to the Borough within the 30-day period, the Borough
Council shall hereby authorize the Borough Solicitor to enter into negotiations
with the property owner or his agent for an extended payback period of time not
to exceed 6 months.
   E.   All monies received under the provisions of this Section shall be
placed in the General Fund for those actual costs and expenses necessary to
furnish fire, police and other emergency or public safety services or

(Ord. 2010-5, 8/18/2010, § 4)
§ 10-205.   Emergency Services Not to Be Refused for Nonpayment.
   Nothing in this Section shall authorize any Borough department or any
Borough staff member or bureau or department personnel to refuse or delay any
emergency service to any person, firm, organization or corporation that has not
reimbursed the Borough for a municipal service, or that owes the Borough any
money whatsoever. Furthermore, nothing in this Part shall be construed to
demand reimbursement, to the Borough, for those municipal services that are
normally provided to Borough residents and others as a matter of the Borough’s
general operating procedure, and for which the levying of taxes, or the demand
for reimbursement is normally made.

§ 15-409.   Residential Permit Parking.
   1.   Findings and Purpose. The Borough finds that:
   A.   Certain residential areas in the Borough are subjected to commuter
vehicle parking, therefore depriving the residents of those areas of spaces in
which to park their own vehicles.
   B.   Those residential streets are also subjected to a high degree of
commuter traffic which substantially reduces the quality of the ambient air
level.
   C.   The establishment of a parking permit program for certain affected
areas should facilitate efficient movement of traffic by providing for parking
preference during certain hours of the day and days of the week. Therefore, the
Borough considers it to be in the interest of the people of the Borough to
provide for the establishment of a residential permit parking program to insure
primary access to available parking spaces by neighborhood residents and also
to provide a cleaner ambient air level.
   2.   Definitions. For the purpose of this Section, words and terms listed in
this subsection, as follows, shall have the following meanings:
   Commuter Vehicle - a motor vehicle parked in a residential area by a person
not a resident of that residential area.
   Proprietor - a person who owns or leases real estate within a residential
area of which he is not a resident, but who owns or manages a business
enterprise or professional office maintained at that address. For the purpose
of this Section, a proprietor shall be entitled to one parking permit for that
business or professional office address.
   Resident - a person who owns or leases real property within a residential
area and who maintains either a voting residence or bona fide occupancy, or
both, at that address.
   Residential Area - a contiguous area containing public highways or parts of
public highways primarily abutted by residential property or residential and
nonbusiness property (such as schools, parks, places of worship, hospitals and
nursing homes).
   3.   Criteria. The residential areas designated in subsection .4 of this
Section are those deemed impacted and hence eligible for residential parking on
the basis of the following criteria:
   A.   During any period between the hours of 7 a.m. and 6:30 p.m., Monday
through Saturday, except legal holidays, the number of vehicles parked (or
standing), legally or illegally, on the streets in the area is equal to 70
percent or more of the legal, on-street parking capacity of the area. for the
purpose of this criterion, a legal parking space shall be 20 linear feet.
   B.   During the same period as specified in paragraph .A, 10 percent or more
of the vehicles parked (or standing) on the streets in the area are not
registered in the name of a person residing in the area. for the purpose of
this criterion, the latest available information from the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation regarding registration of motor vehicles shall be
used.
   Provided: in determining that a specific area identified as impacted and
eligible for residential permit parking is designated as a residential permit
parking area, the following factors are taken into consideration:
   (1)   The local and metropolitan needs with respect to clean air and
environment.
   (2)   The possibility of a reduction in total vehicle miles driven in the
Borough.
   (3)   The likelihood of alleviating traffic congestion, illegal parking and
related health and safety hazards.
   (4)   The proximity of public transportation to the residential area.
   (5)   The desire and need of the residents for residential permit parking
and their willingness to bear the administrative costs in connection with it.
   (6)   The need for parking in excess of the residential permit parking
program in proximity to establishments located in the residential permit
parking area and used by the general public for religious, health or educa
tional purposes.
   4.   Designation of Residential Permit Parking Areas. The following are
designated as residential permit parking areas:
 
Area Bounded By and Including
   [Reserved]
 
   Signs shall be erected along the streets in each residential permit parking
area, indicating the days, hours, locations and conditions under which parking
shall be by permit only.
   5.   Application for Permit. Application for a residential parking permit
shall be made to the Chief of Police by the person desiring the permit, who
shall be only the owner or the driver of a motor vehicle who resides on or is a
proprietor of property immediately adjacent to a street or other location
within a residential parking permit area. A separate application shall be
required for each motor vehicle, and each application shall be accompanied by a
permit fee, in an amount as established by resolution of the Borough, which
shall be for the use of the Borough, to be applied to the cost of administering
the residential permit parking program. Each application shall contain the
following information: the name of the owner or the driver, as the case may be,
of the motor vehicle; the address of the resident or the proprietor, as the
case may be; the make, model and registration number of the motor vehicle; and
the driver number as taken from the applicant’s current driver’s license. At
the discretion of the Chief of Police, the applicant shall be required, at the
time of making application, to present his driver’s license and the vehicle
registration card.
   6.   Issuance of Permit. Upon receipt of the application and the permit fee,
and determination by him that the information upon the application shows that
the applicant is entitled to a residential parking permit, the Chief of Police
shall issue to the applicant a residential parking permit, which shall be valid
for the remainder of the calendar year. The permit shall display the serial and
registration numbers of the motor vehicles, the residential parking area number
and the expiration date. The permit shall be renewable annually before the
expiration date, upon making application for renewal and payment of the permit
fee. It shall be unlawful and a violation of this Section for any person to
display other than the current and valid permit while standing or parking in a
residential permit parking area at any time when those permits are to be
displayed.
   7.   Temporary and Exemption Parking Permits. Temporary parking permits may
be issued by the Chief of Police, upon payment of a fee in an amount as
established by resolution of the Borough Council, to bona fide visitors of
residents of a designated residential permit parking area, and exemption
parking permits may be issued, without payment of a fee, to handicapped
persons.
   8.   Responsibility of Permit Holder.
   A.   Notwithstanding any provision of this Section to the contrary, the
holder of a residential parking permit shall be permitted to stand or park a
motor vehicle operated by him in any designated residential parking area during
those times when parking of motor vehicles is permitted in that area. While a
vehicle for which a residential parking permit has been issued is so parked,
that permit shall be displayed so as to be clearly visible through the
windshield of the vehicle. A residential parking permit shall not guarantee or
reserve to the holder a parking space within a designated residential permit
parking area.
   B.   A residential parking permit shall not authorize its holder to stand or
park a motor vehicle in any place where or at any time when stopping, standing
or parking of motor vehicles is prohibited or set aside for other specified
types of vehicles, nor shall the permit exempt its holder from the observance
of any traffic or parking regulation other than residential permit parking
regulation or restriction.
   C.   No person other than the permit holder whose name appears on the permit
shall use a residential parking permit or display it on a vehicle operated; any
such use or display by a person other than the permit holder shall constitute a
violation of this Section by the permit holder and by the person who so used or
displayed the parking permit.
   D.   It shall constitute a violation of this Section for any person falsely
to represent himself as eligible for a residential parking permit or to furnish
false information in an application to the Chief of Police in order to obtain a
residential parking permit.
   9.   Revocation of Permits. The Chief of Police shall have authority to
revoke the residential parking permit of any permit holder found to be in
violation of any provision of this Section. Upon written notification to the
present holder of the revocation, the permit holder shall surrender the permit
to the Chief of Police. Failure to do so, when so requested, shall constitute a
violation of this Section. Provided, any person receiving such a notice may,
within 10 days after the date of the notice, appeal to the Borough for a
hearing on the revocation, and the decision of the Borough shall be final.
(A.O.)
§ 15-410.   Parking Prohibited on Portions of Certain Highways During Street

Director in compliance with applicable State or Federal regulations.
   (14)   Any substance which causes a hazard to human life or creates a public
nuisance.
   C.   When a local limit has been developed to implement any of the above
prohibited waste standards, compliance with the local limit shall be deemed
compliance with the prohibited waste standard unless the user has reason to
know that the discharge, notwithstanding the local limit, has a reasonable
potential to cause interference or pass through.
   2.   National Categorical Limits Override. Upon the promulgation of national
categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial category or
subcategory, the national standards, if more stringent than limitations imposed
under this Part 1B for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede
the limitations imposed under this Part 1B. The Executive Director shall notify
all affected users of the applicable reporting requirements under 40 C.F.R. §
403.12. However, failure to notify a categorical user of the applicable
regulations shall not act to excuse any such user from its duty to comply with
applicable law.
   3.   Prohibition on Pass Through and Interference. No user shall contribute
or cause to be contributed any discharge which by nature shall cause an upset
in the performance of the WVSA’s treatment system or pass through or
interference such that the WVSA will violate or will be in danger of violating
any provision of its NPDES permit or applicable State or Federal regulations.
   4.   Local Limits and Local Equivalent Categorical Limits.
   A.   The WVSA will develop local limits as set forth in 40 C.F.R., Part
403.5, and such other local limits as it deems advisable for the safe,
efficient and reliable operation of the sewer system and the WVSA facilities.
Local limits shall be applicable to such users as WVSA shall designate,
including, but not limited to, all industrial users.
   B.   WVSA may develop equivalent mass limits or equivalent concentration
limits to implement categorical pretreatment standards when requested by a
categorical industrial user, pursuant to the provisions at 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(c)
(5) and (6).
   5.   State Requirements. State requirements and limitations on wastewater
indirect discharge shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than
Federal and/or local requirements and limitations, or those in this Part 1B.
   6.   Borough’s Right of Revision. The Borough reserves the right to
establish more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the sewer
system if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in §
18-111 of this Part 1B.
   7.   Excessive Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process
water or, in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete
substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations
contained in the national categorical pretreatment standards, or in any
pollutant-specific limitations developed by the WVSA or the Commonwealth.
Provided, however, that dilution may be an acceptable means of complying with
certain of the prohibitions set forth in subsection .1, e.g., the pH and
temperature prohibitions, if such dilution is authorized by an industrial
wastewater discharge permit.
   8.   Prohibition on Discharge of Stormwater and Cooling Water. No user shall
discharge any stormwater, including, but not limited to, basement or foundation
drainage, or any uncontaminated cooling water into the sanitary sewer system,
provided that such discharges are allowable into those portions of the sewer
system (if any) that are designated combined sewers by the Borough. When, upon
application to do so, the direct discharge of uncontaminated. Cooling water has
been prohibited by the PADEP, the Borough and WVSA may permit such a discharge
into the sanitary sewer system upon application by the user to do so.

   7.   Classifications of Dischargers.
   A.   Following review of a report submitted under subsection .3 of this
Section, each non-domestic user shall be placed into the appropriate
classification of discharger. Said classifications are defined as follows:
   (1)   A significant industrial user shall be a Class I user.
   (2)   A Class II user shall include non-significant categorical industrial
users and any non-domestic user that discharges any wastes other than domestic
sewage to the sanitary sewer system in amounts that on a routine basis are
determined by the WVSA not to have a significant impact on the treatment
system, but may present a potential to impact on the treatment system, such as,
but not limited to, users with oil and grease or settleable solids discharges
that may present a potential to cause sewer obstructions, and those that have
the potential to have slug discharges or chemical spills.
   (3)   A Class III user shall be any non-domestic user who discharges only
domestic sewage or has a dry process, or is considered to have insignificant
impact on the treatment system.
   (4)   A Class IV or commercial user shall be any non-domestic user who
discharges industrial wastewater of the nature produced by facilities such as
vehicle wash facilities, vehicle maintenance shops, fluid change facilities,
steam cleaning facilities, restaurants, lounges and the like.
   B.   For the purpose of the permit process all Class I users shall be
required to obtain an industrial wastewater discharge permit from the WVSA,
Class II, Class III and Class IV users may be required to obtain a permit, as
determined by the WVSA.
   C.   Whether a user is required to obtain a permit or not, it may be
required to install such facilities as the WVSA or Borough deems necessary to
comply with the provisions of this Part 1B.
   8.   Grease and Sediment Traps for Class II and IV Users. Class II and IV
users that discharge or have the potential to discharge significant quantities
of oil and grease or sediment, as determined by the WVSA, shall install and
properly operate and maintain a grease trap or sediment trap (or both when
necessary) satisfactory to the WVSA as required by its rules and regulations.
Proper operation and maintenance of grease and sediment traps includes, but is
not limited to, removal of accumulated grease or sediment on a routine basis
and maintenance of documentation of such activity pursuant to subsection .14.
Failure to timely install, or to properly operate or maintain a grease or
sediment trap required by this Part 1B shall be a violation of this Part 1B and
may result in the rescission or suspension of the right to discharge wastewater
to the sewer system, whether or not a permit has been issued by the WVSA.
   9.   Standard Designs. Users required or choosing to install grease traps or
sediment traps shall apply to the WVSA for a list of standard construction
design criteria as prepared by and available through the WVSA’s Engineering
Department in accordance with current pretreatment design requirements. Users
may deviate from standard construction design criteria only with permission of
the Executive Director.
   10.   Inspection. The Borough and the WVSA may inspect the facilities of any
non- domestic user to ascertain whether the purpose of this Part 1B is being
met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of
premises where wastewater other than domestic sewage is created or discharged
shall allow representatives of the Borough and WVSA ready access at all
reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, records examination and/or copying, or in the performance of any of
their duties. The Borough, WVSA, PADEP and/or the EPA shall have the right to
set up on the non-domestic user’s property such devices as are necessary to
conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations.
Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security personnel so that upon
presentation of suitable identification, representatives of the Borough, WVSA,
PADEP and/or the EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the
purposes of performing their specific responsibilities.
   11.   Operation and Maintenance of Pretreatment Facilities.
   A.   It shall be the responsibility of the industrial user to maintain its
pretreatment facility in a working order to provide consistent compliance with
the limitations set forth in the industrial wastewater discharge permit and/or
the rules and regulations of the WVSA. Operation of the pretreatment system
shall be undertaken by the user according to the prescribed methods of the
manufacturer as approved by the WVSA, to provide consistent compliance with the
limitations set forth in this Part 1B, the industrial wastewater discharge
permit and the rules and regulations of the WVSA. The user shall be required to
maintain documentation reflecting operations and maintenance of all
pretreatment facilities.
   B.   If required by the WVSA, a user shall develop and implement a slug
control plan containing the elements itemized at 40 C.F.R. § 403.8(f)(2)(vi).
The slug control plan shall be submitted to the WVSA for review and approval
before implementation.
   C.   Any user required to install and operate a grease trap or sediment trap
shall maintain the equipment in working order to provide consistent compliance
with the limitations set forth in any permit issued by the WVSA and/or the
rules and regulations of the WVSA. Operation of the trap shall be undertaken by
the user according to the prescribed methods of the manufacturer as approved by
the WVSA, to provide consistent compliance with the limitations set forth in
this Part 1B, any permit and the rules and regulations of the WVSA. The user
shall be required to maintain documentation reflecting operations and
maintenance of all grease and sediment traps for a period of 3 years or for
such period of time as may be required by any permit.
   12.   Flow Measurement. The volume of flow used in computing loadings or
surcharges shall be based on the total water consumption data as obtained from
the permittee or the records of the local water utility. If a user has a
substantial portion of the metered water that does not reach the sanitary sewer
system the user may, at its own expense, and with approval from the Executive
Director, install a separate flow metering device to measure the actual
discharge into the sanitary system. If the actual flow to the sanitary system
is measured, the equipment used for the measurement of the flow must be
maintained in proper working order at all times. A separate written record of
calibration and maintenance must be kept for the flow metering device and made
readily available for inspection by the WVSA.
   13.   WVSA Monitoring. The WVSA may conduct periodic monitoring of the
following types:
   A.   Scheduled or unscheduled sampling and inspections of the user’s
facilities and records shall be conducted at all Class I users at least once
each year.
   B.   Additional sampling or inspections may be conducted whenever the WVSA
determines a need to investigate the discharges of a user.
   C.   Demand sampling and inspections may be performed in response to a
complaint or an unusual or emergency situation, such as when the WVSA
determines a change in the normal discharge characteristics of the user’s
wastewater flow, if a violation was detected during sampling or self-monitoring
under subsection .13, if problems that may be attributable to the user’s
discharge occur in the sewer system or WVSA facilities, or if a complaint or
report of noncompliance is received by the Borough or WVSA.
   D.   If the WVSA performs routine compliance sampling of a user in lieu of
the self-monitoring provisions of subsection .14, the WVSA shall be subject to
the repeat sampling requirement of subsection .14.B in the case that a
violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement is detected.
   E.   All discharge sampling and analyses conducted by WVSA shall be in
accordance with the sampling and analysis requirements for user self-monitoring
in subsection .14.
   14.   User Self-Monitoring.
   A.   Users subject to an industrial wastewater discharge permit may be
required, at the user’s expense, to conduct sampling and analyses of their
wastewater on a periodic schedule as established by the permit. Should the
results of said analyses indicate a violation of any provision of the user’s
permit, the user must:
   (1)   Report the violation to the WVSA within 24 hours of becoming aware of
the violation.
   (2)   Repeat the sampling and analysis within 30 days of becoming aware of
the violation and report the results to the WVSA.
   (3)   The resampling is not required if:
   (a)   The WVSA conducts monthly sampling.
   (b)   The WVSA conducted compliance sampling between the time when the
initial sample was collected and when the laboratory results were received.
   B.   All wastewater sampling shall be representative of the indirect
discharge. Unless otherwise specified in the wastewater discharge permit (and
documented in the WVSA files), all samples shall be collected as flow-
proportional composite samples over a 24-hour period, except for samples for
pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic
compounds which shall be obtained as grab samples. Grab samples for cyanide,
total phenols and sulfides may be obtained as multiple grab samples and
composited in the field or the laboratory before analysis; grab samples for oil
and grease and volatile organic compounds may be obtained as multiple grab
samples and composited in the laboratory before analysis. For constituents
required to be collected as grab samples, the permit shall specify the number
of grab samples required for each representative analysis.
   C.   Unless otherwise specified in a permit all sampling, sample
preservation, and laboratory analyses shall be according to the requirements in
40 C.F.R., Part 136.
   15.   User Reporting and Recordkeeping.
   A.   All users subject to an industrial wastewater discharge permit shall be
required to submit such reports as required by 40 C.F.R. § 403.12 or the
industrial wastewater discharge permit. Said reports include:
   (1)   Baseline monitoring reports for all categorical industrial users, as
provided by 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b); sampling shall be as provided at 40 C.F.R. §
403.12(g)(4), and shall include a minimum of four grab samples for pH, cyanide,
total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds for
facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist, and a number as
established by WVSA for facilities for which historical sampling data are
available.
   (2)   Compliance schedule reports as required by 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b)(7)

provided by 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(d); sampling shall be as provided at 40 C.F.R. §
403.12(g)(4), and shall include a minimum of four grab samples for pH, cyanide,
total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds for
facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist, and a number as
established by WVSA for facilities for which historical sampling data are
available.
   (4)   Periodic reports on continued compliance as scheduled in accordance
with the user’s industrial wastewater discharge permit and subsection .14 of
this Section.
   (5)   Immediate notice to the WVSA of any discharge that constitutes a slug
discharge.
   (6)   Immediate notice to the WVSA of any change in the user’s facility that
could affect the potential to have a slug discharge.
   (7)   Notification of any planned changes or modifications to the volume or
character of the industrial wastewater discharge, including any changes to
listed or characteristic hazardous waste discharges reported under subsection
.16 of this Section.
   (8)   Sampling results and resampling reports as required by subsection .14
of this Section.
   B.   Every significant industrial user and any non-domestic user which is
required, by permit or by request of the WVSA, to institute any monitoring,
BMP, sampling, grease or sediment removal, or any other activity which will
produce a record (such as flow meter or pH recorder charts, laboratory results,
or hauled waste records) shall retain all such records for a period of at least
3 years. All sampling records of significant industrial users shall include the
information as set forth at 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(o).
   C.   All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be
made available to officials of the approval authority upon request. The reports
and other documents required to be submitted or maintained under this Section
may be subject to the provisions of § 309(c)(4) of the Clean Water Act, as
amended, and 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 4904, as amended, governing false statements,
representations, or certifications.
   16.   Reporting of Hazardous Waste Discharge.
   A.   All industrial users shall be required, in accordance with 40 C.F.R. §
403.12(p), to report the discharge into the sanitary sewer system of any
substance, which if otherwise disposed of, would be a listed or characteristic
hazardous waste under 40 C.F.R., Part 261. Said notification shall be in
writing to the WVSA, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and
the PADEP hazardous waste authorities, and shall include the name of the
hazardous waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R., Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste
number, and the type of discharge (batch, continuous, or other).
   B.   If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per
calendar month to the WVSA, the notification shall also contain the following:
   (1)   An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes.
   (2)   An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in
the wastestream to be discharged in that calendar month.
   (3)   An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in
the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months.
   C.   All notifications must take place within 180 days of the first
discharge of said hazardous waste. Any notification under this Section needs to
be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged, provided that any
planned change in the volume or character of the hazardous waste discharge must
be reported as provided in subsection .14 of this Section. The notification
requirement does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-
monitoring requirements of this Part 1B.
   D.   In the case of any notification made under this Section, the user shall
certify that it has in place a program to reduce the volume and toxicity of
hazardous wastes generated.
   17.   Signatory Responsibility.
   A.   All required reports submitted by a user must be signed by an
authorized representative, as defined by 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(l) to be:
   (1)   A principal executive officer of at least the level of vice president
if the user is a corporation.
   (2)   A manager of one or more manufacturing, production or operating
facilities, provided that the manager is authorized to make management
decisions which govern the operation of the manufacturing facility and where
authority to sign documents has been assigned or delegated to the manager in
accordance with corporate procedure.
   (3)   A general partner or proprietor if the user is a partnership or sole
proprietorship respectively.
   (4)   A duly authorized representative of the individual designated in
subparagraphs (1), (2), or (3) above, if the authorization is made in writing
by the person designated in subparagraphs (1), (2) or (3), the authorization
specifies either the individual or a position having responsibility for the
overall operation of the facility from which the discharge originates; and the
authorization is submitted to the WVSA.
   B.   Any person who knowingly makes any false statements, representation or
certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed
or required to be maintained pursuant to Federal pretreatment regulations and/
or this Part 1B, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders
inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under Federal pretreatment
regulations or this Part 1B, shall be subject to the civil and criminal
penalties as set forth at 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(n) governing false statements,
representations or certifications in reports required under the Act, as well as
18 Pa.C.S.A. § 4904, as amended, and other applicable State law.
   18.   Monitoring Location.
   A.   The WVSA may require to be provided and operated at the user’s own
expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow
measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems from which a
discharge flows into the sewer system. The monitoring facility should normally
be situated on the user’s premises, but the Borough may, upon application by
the user and when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship
on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or
sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or
parked vehicles.
   B.   There shall be ample room in or near such monitoring facility to allow
accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The monitoring
facility shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition at the expense of the user.
   C.   Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring
facilities shall be provided in accordance with the WVSA’s requirements and all
applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall
be completed within 90 days following written notification of approval of the
plans by the WVSA or within such other time as may be authorized by WVSA.
   19.   Classified Information.
   A.   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires,
permit applications, permits, monitoring programs and inspections shall be
available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless
the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction
of the WVSA that the release of such information would divulge information,
processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of
the user.
   B.   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written
request to governmental agencies for uses related to this Part 1B, the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit, and the pretreatment
program; provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available
for use by the State or any State agency in judicial review or enforcement
proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents
and characteristic shall not be recognized as confidential information.
   C.   Information accepted by the WVSA as confidential shall not be
transmitted to the general public by the WVSA until and unless a 10-day
notification is given to the user. Information accepted as confidential by the
WVSA shall be made available to governmental agencies. If requested by the
user, the EPA and PADER will treat the submitted information as confidential to
the extent provided in 40 C.F.R., Part 2.
   20.   Accidental Discharges.
   A.   Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this Part 1B. Facilities
to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials and to mitigate,
reduce, and contain any such discharge shall be provided and maintained at the
user’s expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to
provide this protection shall be submitted to the WVSA for review, and shall be
approved by the WVSA before construction of the facility. No user who commences
discharge of industrial wastewater to the sanitary sewer system after the
effective date of this Part 1B shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into
the system until accidental discharge protection, containment and
countermeasure procedures have been approved by the WVSA. Review and approval
of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the user from the
responsibility to modify the user’s facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this Part 1B.
   B.   In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the
user to immediately telephone and notify the WVSA of the incident. The
notification shall include location of the discharge, type of waste,
concentration and volume, and corrective actions being taken.
   C.   Within 5 days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit
to the Executive Director a detailed report describing the cause of the
discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future
occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss,
damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
WVSA, its facilities, or any other person or property; nor shall notification
relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be
imposed by this Part 1B or other applicable law. Failure to notify the
Executive Director of an accidental discharge shall constitute a separate and
distinct violation of this Part 1B.
   D.   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of an
accidental discharge. Employers shall insure that all employees who may be
present in an area where an accidental discharge may occur are advised of the
emergency notification procedure as well as the containment and countermeasures
developed by the user to mitigate and control any such discharge.
   21.   Emergency Discharges. In the case of a non-domestic user that, for
reasons of emergency maintenance, equipment failure, or other similar
unforeseen event beyond the user’s reasonable control, must discharge
prohibited, high strength, or other wastewater of unusual strength, character
or volume, the user may apply to the Executive Director for an emergency
discharge permit. The Executive Director may issue such a permit, on terms and
conditions as he deems appropriate, upon his review of the information provided
and in his sole discretion. No discharge of the unusual wastewater may be made
until and unless an emergency discharge permit has been issued. An emergency
discharge permit shall not be issued for longer than 30 days and may be renewed
only after a new application has been made.
(Ord. 2012-3, 4/18/2012, § 4)
§ 18-115.   Violations and Enforcement.
   1.   Notification of Violation. Whenever the WVSA finds that any non-
domestic user has violated or is violating this Part 1B, the rules and
regulations of the WVSA, its industrial wastewater discharge permit, or any
prohibition, limitation or requirements contained herein, the WVSA may serve
upon such person a written notice of violation stating the nature of the
violation. Within 30 days of the date of the notice, or within such other
reasonable time as the Executive Director shall state, a plan for the
satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the WVSA by the user.
   2.   Show Cause Hearing.
   A.   The WVSA may notify any user who is in violation of this Part 1B, an
industrial wastewater discharge permit, or the rules and regulations of the
WVSA, to show cause before the WVSA Board of Directors (or such other
adjudicative body as the WVSA shall select) why a proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. The notice shall be served on the user specifying the time
and place of a hearing to be held by the WVSA regarding the violation, the
reasons why the action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and
directing the user to show cause before the WVSA why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served
personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at
least 10 days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer
of a corporation.
   B.   A show cause hearing is not subject to the requirements of the Local
Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 551 et seq., but may be conducted as provided in
that statute at the discretion of the WVSA Board or adjudicative body.
   C.   Within a reasonable time after the conclusion of a show cause hearing,
the Board of Directors (or adjudicative body) shall issue an opinion regarding
the alleged violation and any enforcement action which it believes is
appropriate. The WVSA may then proceed to undertake the recommended enforcement
action, if any.
   3.   Other Legal Action.
   A.   If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastewater or other wastes
into the sanitary sewer system contrary to the provisions of this Part 1B,
Federal or State pretreatment requirements, the WVSA rules and regulations, or
any permit issued by the WVSA, the Borough Solicitor may commence an action for
appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the courts. When the WVSA
determines the need for legal action, said action shall be undertaken by the
Borough within 30 days of notification by the WVSA.
   B.   In the alternative, for purposes of enforcement of this Part 1B and the
pretreatment program, the Borough hereby appoints the Wyoming Valley Sanitary
Authority as its agent and authorizes the WVSA or its duly appointed agents and
employees, to undertake any legal action in the name of the Borough, including,
but not limited to, the filing of a civil complaint in the Court of Common
Pleas of Luzeme County. In the case that WVSA acts in the name of Borough,
Borough shall cooperate with and support the WVSA in the prosecution of any
civil action as may be necessary.
   4.   Revocation or Suspension of Permit.
   A.   Any user who violates the following conditions of this Part 1B,
applicable State or Federal regulations, or an industrial wastewater discharge
permit is subject to having its industrial wastewater discharge permit revoked
or suspended in accordance with the procedures of this Section:
   (1)   Failure of a user to factually and accurately report the wastewater
constituents and characteristics of its discharge.
   (2)   Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations, or
changes in industrial wastewater constituents and characteristics, including,
but not limited to, changes in facilities related to the control of slug
discharges as required by §
18-114.
   (3)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose of
inspection or monitoring.
   (4)   Violation of any condition of the industrial wastewater discharge
permit.
   B.   Upon notice of suspension or revocation of an industrial wastewater
discharge permit the user shall immediately cease the discharge of industrial
wastewater to the sewer system. Any discharge of industrial wastewater to the
sewer system after notice of revocation or suspension shall be a violation of
this Part 1B and subject to the penalties provided herein. In the case of a
suspension, the permit shall be reinstated upon a showing that the user has
corrected the condition for which the suspension was imposed. In the case of a
revocation, the user may only receive a new permit by going through the
application process as stated in §
18-114.5 of this Part 1B.
   5.   Suspension of Sewer Service.
   A.   The Borough and/or the WVSA may suspend the wastewater treatment
service when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the WVSA, in order
to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to
the environment, causes interference or pass through at the WVSA’s treatment
plant or causes the WVSA or Borough to violate or be in danger of violating any
condition of an NPDES permit or State-issued water quality management permit.
   B.   Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service
shall immediately stop or eliminate the discharge. In the event of a failure of
the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Borough may,
and the WVSA is authorized to, take such steps as deemed necessary including
immediate severance or obstruction of the sewer connection from the user’s
property, to prevent or minimize damage to the sewer system or the WVSA
facilities or endangerment to any individuals. The WVSA or the Borough shall
reinstate the wastewater treatment service only upon satisfactory proof of
elimination of the noncomplying discharge. All costs associated with the
severance and/or reconnection of a sewer shall be incurred by the user.
   6.   Civil Penalties.
   A.   Any user who is found to have violated any provision of this Part 1B,
the rules and regulations of the WVSA, as amended, or any regulations or
permits issued by the WVSA or the Borough shall be subject to a civil penalty
of not less than $100 nor more than $1,000 per each violation. Each day on
which a violation shall occur or continue to occur shall be deemed a separate
and distinct violation.
   B.   Borough recognizes that the WVSA has independent civil penalty
authority under the provisions of the Publicly-Owned Treatment Works Penalty
Law, Act 9 of 1992, 35 P.S. §§ 752.l et seq. Any violation of this Part 1B
shall constitute a violation of the WVSA’s EPA-approved industrial pretreatment
program and subject an industrial user to the penalties provided thereunder.
Should WVSA choose to assess a civil penalty under its independent authority
against a user who violates any provision of this Part 1B, Borough shall
cooperate to the extent necessary to aid WVSA in such an action.
   C.   In addition to the civil penalties provided herein, the Borough and/or
the WVSA may recover reasonable attorney’s fees, court costs, court reporters’
fees and other expenses of litigation by appropriate suit at law against the
person found to have violated this Part 1B, the WVSA rules and regulations, or
any permit issued hereunder.
   7.   Right of Appeal. Any user subject to an enforcement action or issuance
or denial of an industrial wastewater discharge permit under this Part 1B may
file an appeal with the WVSA within 15 days of receipt of the notice of the
enforcement action or permit issuance, revision, or denial. Said appeal shall
be conducted by the WVSA as provided in the Local Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S.A. §§
551 et seq.
   8.   Public Notification. The WVSA shall annually publish in a local
newspaper of general circulation, a list of the significant industrial users
which were in significant noncompliance with the pretreatment standards and
requirements contained herein at least once during the previous calendar year.
Significant noncompliance shall include any of the following:
   A.   Chronic violations, defined as those in which 66 percent or more of all
measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a 6-month period are
in excess of an applicable numeric pretreatment standard or requirement,
including instantaneous maximum limits.
   B.   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined as those in which
33 percent or more of all measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter
during a 6-month period equal or exceed the product of the numeric pretreatment
standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits multiplied by the
applicable TRC. TRC is 1.4 for BOD, TSS, oil and grease, and l.2 for all other
pollutants except pH.
   C.   Any other violations of a pretreatment standard or requirement,
including a narrative standard, which the WVSA determines has caused or
contributed to interference or pass through.
   D.   Any discharge that has caused imminent endangerment to human health and
safety or the environment, or has resulted in the WVSA’s exercise of its
authority to halt or prevent such a discharge under subsections .4 or .5 of
this Section.
   E.   Failure to meet a compliance schedule milestone within 90 days of the
schedule date.
   F.   Failure to provide within 45 days after the due date, required reports
as itemized in §

worksite described in said application and shall constitute a permit.
   3.   Alternate Permit Procedure. Notification by telephone to the Borough
office must be made a minimum of 15 minutes in advance of excavation and not
more than 24 hours in advance of excavation. An entry in the pave cut log (the
record of notification of the Borough), together with a completed application
for pave cut permit, shall constitute a permit. The completion of an
application form alone shall not constitute a permit. An application form,
properly completed and including a location sketch, shall be collected from the
utility on a monthly basis by the Borough. Permit fees shall be billed on a
monthly basis by the Borough and shall be payable to the Treasurer of the
Borough. Application forms shall be provided by the Borough.
   4.   Emergency Permit Procedures. In the case where an emergency repair, as
hereinbefore defined, is found, the utility shall notify the Borough Zoning
Officer and inform him that an emergency existed and the day, time and location
of the pave cut. Emergency pave cuts shall be recorded in the pave cut log at
the start of the next business day following the emergency.
   5.   Nonfee Permits. Pave cuts necessitated by Borough-sponsored public
improvements will be on a nonfee basis but limited to a specific contract area.
A list noting exact locations and dimensions of all such cuts shall be
submitted to the Borough office at the completion of work. Notification will be
required for any pave cuts made in State highways located within the Borough
for which a highway occupancy permit has been issued. 1
   6.   Penalty for Failure to Obtain a Permit. All work done without a permit
shall be subject to a penalty plus regular fees.
   7.   Insurance Protection.
   A.   The applicant shall protect, defend, indemnify and save harmless the
Borough, its officers and/or agents thereof from all claims, suits, actions and
proceedings of every nature and description which may be thereof for or on
account of any injuries or damages to persons or public or private property,
because of any materials or appliances used in the work or by or on account of
improper materials or workmanship or for or on account of any accident of any
other acts, negligence or omissions of said applicant or his agents, servants
or employees; and the Borough shall not in any way be liable therefor, during
the period of the work progress and the 1-1/2-year guaranty period following
the completion of the work. Minimum insurance shall be:
   (1)   Five hundred thousand dollars of liability per individual, with a
limit of $500,000 for each occurrence for bodily injury.
   (2)   Five hundred thousand dollars of liability for property damage.
   B.   Evidence of insurance in the form of a certificate or letter executed
by a duly authorized representative of the applicant’s insurance carrier shall
be submitted to the Borough Engineer each January 15. Said evidence of
insurance must include the provision that the Borough shall be given proper
advance notice of at least 30 days of cancellation or any material alteration
in the applicant’s policy.
   8.   Safety Precautions. During the progress of work, the applicant shall
provide and maintain such barricades, warning signs and flagpersons as may be
deemed necessary by the Borough to prevent accidents to the public and/or
adjoining tenants. Minimum precautions must include but should not be limited
to advance-warning signs on all approaches to the work, safe crossing for
pedestrians each 300 feet and barricades with flashers on each exposed side at
50-foot intervals. All precautions shall be in accordance with the Manual of
Uniform Traffic Control Devices as adopted by the United States Department of
Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, 1971, Part IV, “Traffic
Controls for Street and Highway Construction and Maintenance Operations.”
   9.   Road Closing. No street in the Borough of Dallas may be completely
closed to traffic at any time. One lane of traffic must be able to pass
unobstructed at all times. Flagpersons must be posted at the limits of work at
all times to direct traffic through the work area, and all established traffic
patterns must be maintained at all times. If all other means of traffic control
have been exhausted, the Borough may permit a road to be completely closed
temporarily only with the consent of the Chief of Police and the Fire Chief.
When an emergency exists, the Police and Fire Departments shall be notified. An
application form for a permit to close a street will be available from the
Borough office. The completed application bearing the signatures of the before-
mentioned officers shall be returned to the applicant and shall constitute a
permit. A penalty shall be imposed for failure to notify the Police Chief and
Fire Chief. (See Fee Schedule. 2 )
   10.   Time Periods. For small-area pave cuts, the utility or contractor
shall be required to complete the temporary restoration within 48 consecutive
hours of the initial cut during the normal working week, excluding holidays and
weekends. Extension time may be allowed upon appeal to the Borough Zoning
Officer, provided that the contractor substantiates sufficient reasons for the
extension required. Work on long cuts, those over 25 feet in length, shall
proceed in a continuous manner. Permits for long cuts or capital improvements
will not be granted during the months of November through March except by
written permission from the Borough Zoning Officer. The utility or contractor
shall coordinate planned cuts in the Borough streets with the paving program of
the Borough. A construction schedule comprising planned cuts shall be submitted
to the Borough Zoning Officer as they become available. The Borough will
provide a paving program for a 1-year period to the utilities prior to April 1.
Changes in the utilities schedule of planned cuts shall require confirmation
from the Borough Zoning Officer. Changes in the municipal paving program shall
be submitted to all utilities at the earliest possible date to permit the
utilities to adjust their respective schedules.
   11.   Scheduling. All excavations shall be commenced and completed by the
use of a reasonable work force. In congested areas and the Central Business
District, the Borough may limit work to other than normal daytime working
hours. At the cessation of work, adequate steel plates or wooden planking shall
be placed over the excavation while it is not being worked to ensure full
traffic flow. The maximum length of any opening in the roadway shall be 200
feet unless otherwise permitted, in writing, by the Borough Zoning Officer.
   12.   Excavated Materials. In peak traffic areas, all excavated material
shall be removed daily at the cessation of work. All gutters and drainage
devices shall be kept clean of all debris and excavated material. Fire hydrants
adjacent to the work shall at all times be readily accessible to fire
apparatus, and no material or obstruction shall be placed within 15 feet of any
hydrant.
   13.   Suitability of Materials. The suitability of material to be used as
backfill shall be determined by the Borough Zoning Officer. All materials not
conforming to the requirements of this Part whether in place or not, shall be
rejected. Such material shall be removed promptly from the worksite.
   14.   Waste Material. Material which is unsuitable and any surplus of
excavated material shall be considered waste and shall be disposed of by the
utility or contractor beyond the project limits. In no case shall waste
material be left at the worksite.
   15.   Wet Material. Material containing moisture in excess of that
percentage which will ensure satisfactory compaction shall not be used as
backfill materials.
   16.   Dry Material. Material containing insufficient moisture to obtain
satisfactory compaction shall be moistened before compaction.
   17.   Opening of a Street. Power-driven concrete saws or air hammers shall
be used on all cuts. The cuts must be of sufficient depth to provide a smooth
edge. Opening in brick- or Belgian-block-based streets shall be of sufficient
width to expose one-half row of undisturbed interlocking stone. No pavement
busters, such as drop hammers, hoe rams and the like, shall be used without the
written permission of the Borough Road Superintendent.
   18.   Location of Shutoff Valves. All shutoff valves for water mains and gas
mains and branches may be installed within the limits of the highway right-of-
way lines. All shutoff valves on service lines and other pipes shall be
installed outside the highway right-of-way lines.
   19.   Responsibility for Damages. In the event that a cut is made, and upon
inspection, damage to another utility’s underground facilities is discovered,
it shall be the responsibility of the party making the cut to contact the
Borough Zoning Officer and all concerned pertinent utilities to instruct them
(it) to have representatives inspect the condition before any backfilling is

§ 21-103.   Preparation of Streets for Paving, Repair or Reconstruction.
   The Borough Council provides by this Part for the laying, renewing and
repairing of all gas, water, steam or other pipes or conduits, in any street,
before the paving, repaving or repairing of the same and for making the
necessary house connections with said pipes and also for the necessary house
connections and branches with and leading into main or lateral sewers;
provided, that in no case, except as a sanitary measure of which the Council
shall be the judge, shall the Council require such house connections to be
extended further from such sewers or from such gas, water or other pipes or
conduits than to the inner line of the curbstone of such street. The Council
may, after notice to all companies, corporations, persons and owners affected
and in default of compliance therewith, cause said pipes to be laid, renewed or
repaired and said connections made and collect the cost of paving and repairing
all pipes and pipe connections from the companies, corporations or persons
owning or operating said gas, water and other pipes or conduits, with interest.
The cost of the sewer connections shall be a first lien against the land for
whose benefit such connections are made. A separate lien may be filed therefor,
or such sewer connection costs may be included in any lien for the costs of
such street improvement and the lien and the proceedings thereon shall be as in
the case of other municipal liens.
   A.   Restoration. Prior to the placement of the base course, the existing
base and surface must be exposed 6 inches on each side of any failures that may
have developed. Restoration of flexible base pavements shall consist of binder
for the full depth of 4 inches. The wearing course ID2 shall be placed at a
minimum depth of 2 inches and rolled to conform with the existing road, and the
edges sealed. Surface treatments, such as sand or chip seals, are prohibited.
On long cuts surface finishing must be rolled with not less than a 6-ton
roller. Small cuts may be finished with a mechanical tamper or vibrator. All
openings regardless of size must be permanently restored.
   B.   Special Restoration. The permanent restoration of special-type
pavements, such as concrete, brick, Belgian block, cobblestone gutters or
tiles, shall consist of relaying the original wearing course in accordance with
the original installation specifications in such a manner as to prevent
settlement or other deterioration.
   C.   Testing and Inspection. The Borough Zoning Officer may inspect all cuts
having an area of 5 square yards or more, and an inspection fee shall be
charged. Such inspection fees shall constitute acceptance and approval of work
performed by the utility or its contractor, but it is understood that such
acceptance and approval does not relieve the utility of any responsibility
under this Part throughout the guaranty period. Inspection of small cuts having
an area of 5 square yards or less shall not require visual observation when the
work is in progress, but may be approved or rejected through subsequent
examinations and/or testing.
   D.   Repaving and Reconstruction. Upon notification from the office of the
Borough Zoning Officer of a planned street resurfacing or reconstruction, all
utilities will be required to test their lines and services and to schedule
necessary capital improvements and service connections prior to resurfacing or
reconstruction. Thereafter cuts will be permitted in the new pavement only in
an emergency. Pave cuts made in new pavement shall be subject to a penalty.
(See Fee Schedule 3 ) Essential services for a new building construction shall
not include the addition of an alternate or secondary source of fuel, water,
heat or other service not included in the original construction or regarded as
essential to the original construction. Pavement shall be considered new for a
period of 5 years, from the date of placement.
   E.   Limestone and Monuments. No limestone or monument in the Borough may be
removed, altered or buried at any time. When pave cuts or road construction
require the temporary removal of a limestone or monument, it must be preserved
at the site and reset at the direction of the Borough Engineer. All costs
incident thereto, including surveys, shall be charged to the utility or
contractor. A penalty shall be imposed for failure to report the removal or
alteration of a limestone or monument. Burial or paving over a limestone or
monument shall carry a penalty for each stone or monument covered. In addition,
all costs incidental to exposing and/or resetting a limestone or monument shall
be charged to the utility or contractor.
   F.   Test Borings. All test holes and borings shall require restoration-
Restoration of bore holes shall follow immediately after testing with the
application of asphalt or other water-resistant plugs. A penalty will be
charged for each test hole found unplugged. (See Fee Schedule.2)
   G.   Replacement of Pavement Marking. The utility and/or its contractor must
replace in kind all pavement markings damaged or removed by pave cuts and work
incident thereto. All markings must be replaced within 5 days after permanent
restoration. The Borough shall contract to have the necessary repairs made and
bill the utility.
   H.   Backfilling. The Borough Zoning Officer’s office must be notified in
advance of all backfilling. Backfilling will be done in such manner as to
obtain compaction throughout the entire length of backfill not less than that
which exists adjacent to the excavation. Type 2A modified subbase material
shall be used in all excavations. The method of backfill shall be consistent
with good engineering practice, i.e., the material shall be placed in layers
not to exceed 6 inches, properly tamped using a mechanical tamper or a
mechanical vibrator up to the bottom elevation of the pavement structure.
   I.   Temporary Restorations. All restoration made with cold patch shall be
considered temporary. The permittee is responsible for all costs and expenses
of making and maintaining temporary and permanent restorations of disturbed
areas. Temporary restoration consists of a minimum of 3 inches of bituminous
material and is maintained in place until permanent restoration can be made.
   J.   Permanent Restoration. Only utilities or their contractors will be
permitted to make permanent restorations of openings in pavements. The restored
pavements shall be guaranteed from failure from the date of completion through
two winters. Permanent restoration must be completed within 30 days of the
initial cut. Any cuts made in the months of November through March shall be
permanently restored within 30 days after hot asphalt becomes available. Any
failure of restoration will be reported to the pertinent utility, and repairs
by the utility will be begun within 24 hours after notification. Upon failure
of the utility to repair the cut in a satisfactory manner, the borough shall
have the option to do the work or to contract to complete the work and bill the
utility.
   K.   Replacement of Electronic Traffic Control Devices and Ancillary
Equipment. Electronic traffic control devices and ancillary equipment damaged
or removed because of pavement excavations or work incident thereto must be
replaced by the utility or its contractor in kind, in whole or in part as
required by the Borough Zoning Officer. The Borough shall contract to have the
necessary repairs made and bill the utility.
   L.   Determination of Lines and Grades by the Engineer. The Borough Engineer
shall have the final decision for the determination of lines and grades for
street construction. This decision shall be based on good engineering practice
and municipal standards.
   M.   Utility-Corridor Vertical Assignments for New Street Construction. The
following depths for pipes and conduits are assigned to the utilities operating
under this Part:
   (1)   Gas lines shall be a minimum of 30 inches below subgrade.
   (2)   Waterlines shall be a minimum of 36 inches below subgrade; a water
main shall be a minimum of 5 feet below subgrade.
   (3)   Electric lines and conduits shall be a minimum of 24 inches below
subgrade.
   (4)   Telecommunication lines and conduits shall be a minimum of 36 inches
below subgrade.
   N.   Horizontal and Aerial Utility Corridors. Aerial installations of
electric power transmissions and telecommunications lines suspended from
supporting poles having their base and/or support wires within the public
right-of-way and interfering with a roadway construction, reconstruction or
repair project shall be located upon written order from the Borough Zoning
Officer to a point specified therein. The Borough Engineer may require the
utility to place its aerial facilities underground where it is deemed necessary
or desirable. Hereafter, aerial installations shall be placed subject to
approval by the Borough Engineer. The Borough Engineer shall assign horizontal
corridors on a case-by-case basis for all new construction. All gate boxes,
shutoff valves and other regulating devices underground for individual
customers for gas, water, steam, electric and telecommunications lines shall be
located inside the inner line of the curbstone or, in the case where no curbing
exists, to a point specified by the Engineer or his agent.
   O.   Determination of Reimbursement. The Borough may participate in the
actual costs, less betterments, of utility relocation when an existing utility
right-of- way is owned by the utility and interferes with a municipal
construction project.
   R.   Commencement of Utility Relocation Activities.
   (1)   Upon receipt of a letter from the Borough Engineer authorizing the
start of physical work, the utility shall commence work within 30 days unless
otherwise stated by the Borough Engineer with reasonable cause shown in order
to clear the construction area. The utility shall perform the relocation work
in accordance with the approval plan of the Borough Engineer.
   (2)   Utility relocation shall be accomplished by the utility to assure its
completion prior to the commencement of roadway construction. Areas of utility
relocation work which cannot be accomplished prior to the start of construction
but can be accomplished simultaneously without restricting the roadway project
contractor may be done concurrently with the contractor’s operations when
approved by the Borough Engineer and the contractor.
   (3)   It is acknowledged that field conditions occasionally necessitate
revision of the utility relocation plan. It shall be the responsibility of the
utility to report and justify such revisions to correct any data on file with
the Borough Engineer. The utilities are required to obtain the contractor’s
concurrence prior to such revisions within the right-of-way of the project
under construction. Minor modifications of the relocation plan may be made
without prior approval of the Borough Engineer. All such changes shall be
brought to the attention of the project engineer and shall be noted in the
daily inspection report.

General Provisions
§ 23-101.   Short Title.
   This Chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Dallas Borough’s
Stormwater Management Ordinance.”
(Ord. 2011-2, 3/16/2011, § 101)
§ 23-102.   Statement of Findings.
   The Borough Council of the Borough finds that:
   A.   Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flows and velocities,
contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of
streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public facilities to
carry and control stormwater, undermines floodplain management and flood
control efforts in downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge,
threatens public health and safety, and increases nonpoint source pollution of
water resources.
   B.   A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including reasonable
regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff, is
fundamental to the public health, safety, and welfare and the protection of
people of the Commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
   C.   Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides groundwater
recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams, which also protects and
maintains surface water quality.
   D.   Federal and State regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are required
to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer
systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).
(Ord. 2011-2, 3/16/2011, § 102)
§ 23-103.   Purpose.
   The purpose of this Chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
the Borough and its watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing the
benefits described in §
23-102 of this Chapter, through provisions designed to:
   A.   Meet legal water quality requirements under State law, including
regulations at 25 Pa.Code, Chapter 93, to protect, maintain, reclaim, and
restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of this Commonwealth.
   B.   Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.
   C.   Manage stormwater runoff close to the source.
   D.   Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater planning
and management.
   E.   Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and
groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources.
   F.   Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
   G.   Provide proper operation and maintenance of all permanent SWM BMPs that
are implemented within the Borough.
   H.   Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.
(Ord. 2011-2, 3/16/2011, § 103)
§ 23-104.   Statutory Authority.

   Best management practice (BMP)–activities, facilities, designs, measures, or
procedures used to manage stormwater impacts from regulated activities, to meet
State water quality requirements, to promote groundwater recharge, and to
otherwise meet the purposes of this Chapter. Stormwater BMPs are commonly
grouped into one of two broad categories or measures: “structural” or
“nonstructural.” In this Chapter, nonstructural BMPs or measures refer to
operational and/or behavior-related practices that attempt to minimize the
contact of pollutants with stormwater runoff whereas structural BMPs or
measures are those that consist of a physical device or practice that is
installed to capture and treat stormwater runoff. Structural BMPs include, but
are not limited to, a wide variety of practices and devices, from large-scale
retention ponds and constructed wetlands, to small-scale underground treatment
systems, infiltration facilities, filter strips, low impact design,
bioretention, wet ponds, permeable paving, grassed swales, riparian or forested
buffers, sand filters, detention basins, and manufactured devices. Structural
stormwater BMPs are permanent appurtenances to the project site.
   Borough–Dallas Borough, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.
   Capture–the process of collecting runoff to be managed by a stormwater BMP.

the Luzerne Conservation District unless otherwise noted.
   Design storm–the magnitude and temporal distribution of precipitation from a
storm event measured in probability of occurrence (e.g., a 5-year storm) and
duration (e.g., 24 hours) used in the design and evaluation of stormwater
management systems. Also see “return period.”
   Detention volume–the volume of runoff that is captured and released into the
waters of this Commonwealth at a controlled rate.
   DEP–the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.

estate, whether public or private, including, but not limited to, land
development, construction, installation, or expansion of a building or other
structure, land division, street construction, drilling, and site alteration
such as embankments, dredging, grubbing, grading, paving, parking or storage
facilities, excavation, filling, stockpiling, or clearing.
   Disconnected impervious area (DIA)–an impervious or impermeable surface that
is disconnected from any stormwater drainage or conveyance system and is
redirected or directed to a pervious area, which allows for infiltration,
filtration, and increased time of concentration as specified in Appendix 23-B,
“Disconnected Impervious Area.”
   Disturbed area–an unstabilized land area where an earth disturbance activity
is occurring or has occurred.
   Earth disturbance activity–a construction or other human activity which
disturbs the surface of the land, including, but not limited to: clearing and

Officers (as amended or replaced from time to time by DEP).
   Floodway–the channel of the watercourse and those portions of the adjoining
floodplains that are reasonably required to carry and discharge the 100-year
flood. Unless otherwise specified, the boundary of the floodway is as indicated
on maps and flood insurance studies provided by FEMA. In an area where no FEMA
maps or studies have defined the boundary of the 100-year floodway, it is
assumed, absent evidence to the contrary, that the floodway extends from the
stream to 50 feet from the top of the bank of the stream.
   Forest management/timber operations–planning and activities necessary for
the management of forestland. These include conducting a timber inventory,

runoff, with concentrations of pollutants that are higher than those that are
typically found in stormwater (e.g., vehicle salvage yards and recycling
facilities, vehicle fueling stations, fleet storage areas, vehicle equipment
and cleaning facilities, and vehicle service and maintenance facilities).
   Hydrologic soil group (HSG)–infiltration rates of soils vary widely and are
affected by subsurface permeability as well as surface intake rates. Soils are
classified into four HSGs (A, B, C, and D) according to their minimum
infiltration rate, which is obtained for bare soil after prolonged wetting. The
NRCS defines the four groups and provides a list of most of the soils in the
United States and their group classification. The soils in the area of the
development site may be identified from a soil survey report that can be
obtained from local NRCS offices or conservation district offices. Soils become
less pervious as the HSG varies from A to D (NRCS 34).
   Impervious surface (impervious area)–a surface that prevents the
infiltration of water into the ground. Impervious surfaces include, but are not
limited to, streets, sidewalks, pavements, parking lots, driveways, roofs,
stone patios. See definition of “gravel (crushed stone)” for when gravel
classifies as impervious area.
   Infiltration–movement of surface water into the soil, where it is absorbed
by plant roots, evaporated into the atmosphere, or percolated downward to
recharge groundwater.
   Karst–a type of topography or landscape characterized by surface
depressions, sinkholes, rock pinnacles/uneven bedrock surface, underground
drainage, and caves. Karst is formed on carbonate rocks, such as limestone or
dolomite.

   Peak discharge–the maximum rate of stormwater runoff from a specific storm
event.
   Pervious area–any area not defined as impervious.
   Project site–the specific area of land where any regulated activities in the
Borough are planned, conducted, or maintained.
   Qualified professional–any person licensed by the Pennsylvania Department of
State or otherwise qualified by law to perform the work required by this
Chapter.
   Redevelopment–any development that requires demolition or removal of
existing structures or impervious surfaces at a site and replacement with new
impervious surfaces. Maintenance activities such as top-layer grinding and re-
paving are not considered to be redevelopment. Interior remodeling projects and
tenant improvements are also not considered to be redevelopment.
   Regulated activities–any earth disturbance activities or any activities that
involve the alteration or development of land in a manner that may affect
stormwater runoff.
   Regulated earth disturbance activity–activity involving earth disturbance
subject to regulation under 25 Pa.Code, Chapter 92, 25 Pa.Code, Chapter 102, or
the Clean Streams Law, 35 P.S. §§ 691.1 et seq.

not released directly into the surface waters of this Commonwealth during or
after a storm event.
   Return period–the average interval, in years, within which a storm event of
a given magnitude can be expected to occur one time. For example, the 25-year
return period rainfall would be expected to occur on average once every 25
years; or stated in another way, the probability of a 25-year storm occurring
in any one year is 0.04 (i.e., a 4 percent chance).
   Runoff–any part of precipitation that flows over the land.
   Sediment–soils or other materials transported by surface water as a product
of erosion.

Stormwater Management Standards
§ 23-301.   General Requirements.
   1.   For all regulated activities, submission of the Stormwater Management
Permit
Application provided in Appendix 23-B is required.
   2.   For all regulated activities, unless preparation of a SWM site plan is
specifically exempted in §
23-302:
   A.   Preparation and implementation of an approved SWM site plan is
required.
   B.   No regulated activities shall commence until the Borough issues written
approval of a SWM site plan, which demonstrates compliance with the
requirements of this Chapter.
   3.   SWM site plans approved by the Borough, in accordance with §
23-406, shall be on site throughout the duration of the regulated activity.
   4.   The Borough may, after consultation with DEP, approve measures for
meeting the State water quality requirements other than those in this Chapter;
provided, that
they meet the minimum requirements of, and do not conflict with, State law
including, but not limited to, the Clean Streams Law, 35 P.S. §§ 691.1 et seq.
   5.   For all regulated earth disturbance activities, erosion and sediment
control BMPs shall be designed, implemented, operated, and maintained during
the regulated earth disturbance activities (e.g., during construction) to meet
the purposes and requirements of this Chapter and to meet all requirements
under 25 Pa.Code and the Clean Streams Law, 35 P.S. §§ 691.1 et seq. Various
BMPs and their design standards are listed in the Erosion and Sediment
Pollution Control Program Manual (E&S Manual),2 No. 363-2134-008 (April 15,
2000), as amended and updated.
   6.   For all regulated activities, implementation of the volume controls in
§
23-303 is required, unless otherwise exempted by §
23-302.
   7.   Impervious Areas.
   A.   The measurement of impervious areas shall include all of the impervious
areas in the total proposed development even if development is to take place in
stages.
   B.   For development taking place in stages, the entire development plan
must be used in determining conformance with this Chapter.
   C.   For projects that add impervious area to a parcel, only the proposed
impervious area on the parcel must be considered and summed to determine the
plan preparation and approval requirements of this Chapter.
   D.   For redevelopment projects in which the existing site is disturbed, the
entire proposed site is subject to the plan preparation and approval
requirements of this Chapter. Existing conditions are considered to be the
existing site prior to disturbance, and 20 percent of the existing impervious
area must be considered as meadow in good condition for all stormwater
calculations. For redevelopment projects in which the existing site is already
controlled by a stormwater management facility, the requirement to consider 20
percent of existing impervious area as meadow is waived, provided the existing
facility meets the water quality, volume, and peak rate standards and criteria
of this Chapter.
   8.   Stormwater flows onto adjacent property shall not be created,
increased, decreased, relocated, or otherwise altered without written
notification of the adjacent property owner(s). Such stormwater flows shall be
subject to the requirements of this Chapter.
   9.   All regulated activities shall include measures to:
   A.   Protect health, safety, and property.
   B.   Meet the water quality goals of this Chapter by implementing measures
outlined in the Pennsylvania Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual (BMP
Manual)1 to:
   (1)   Minimize disturbance to floodplains, wetlands, and wooded areas.
   (2)   Maintain or extend riparian buffers.
   (3)   Avoid erosive flow conditions in natural flow pathways.
   (4)   Minimize thermal impacts to waters of this Commonwealth.
   (5)   Disconnect impervious surfaces by directing runoff to pervious areas,
wherever possible.
   C.   To the maximum extent practicable, incorporate the techniques for low
impact development practices described in the BMP Manual.1
   10.   The design of all facilities over karst and mined areas shall include
an evaluation of measures to minimize adverse effects.
   11.   Infiltration BMPs should be spread out, made as shallow as
practicable, and located to maximize use of natural on-site infiltration
features while still meeting the other requirements of this Chapter.
   12.   Storage facilities, to the greatest extent possible and at the
discretion of the Borough Engineer, shall completely drain both the volume
control and rate control capacities over a period of time not less than 24
hours and not more than 72 hours from the end of the design storm.
   13.   Storage facilities shall incorporate features to maximize the length
of the flow path and increase the travel time through the facility.
   14.   The design storm volumes to be used in the analysis of peak rates of
discharge should be obtained from the Precipitation-Frequency Atlas of the
United States, Atlas 14, Volume 2, Version 3.0, U.S. Department of Commerce,
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAH), National Weather
Service, Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center, Silver Spring, Maryland.
NOAA’s Atlas 14 can be accessed at: http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/.5
   15.   For all regulated activities, SWM BMPs shall be designed, implemented,
operated, and maintained to meet the purposes and requirements of this Chapter
and to meet all requirements under 25 Pa.Code, the Clean Streams Law, 35 P.S.
§§ 691.1 et seq., and the Storm Water Management Act, 32 P.S. §§ 680.1 et seq.
   16.   Various BMPs and their design standards are listed in the BMP Manual.1
(Ord. 2011-2, 3/16/2011, § 301)
§ 23-302.   Exemptions.
   1.   Regulated activities that create impervious areas or earth disturbance
shall adhere to
Table 23-302.1 to meet the requirements of this Chapter. The larger of the two
areas determines the applicable requirements of this Chapter (i.e., if only 500
square feet of impervious area is proposed, but 15,000 square feet of earth
disturbance, the requirements follow row 3 of
Table 23-302.1).

   4.   Exemptions frm any provisions of this Chapter shall not relieve the
applicant from the requirements in §
23-301.1 through .16.
   5.   Projects creating less than 1,000 square feet of impervious cover and/
or less than 5,000 square feet of earth disturbance shall be exempt from the
requirements of this Chapter, except as noted in subsection .4.
(Ord. 2011-2, 3/16/2011, § 302)
§ 23-303.   Volume Controls.
   The low impact development practices provided in the BMP Manual1 shall be
utilized for all regulated activities to the maximum extent practicable. Water
volume controls shall be implemented using the Design Storm Method in paragraph
.A or the Simplified Method in paragraph .B, below. For all regulated
activities that require submission of a formal SWM site plan, both the Design
Storm Method and the Simplified Method shall be calculated; the larger control
volume based on the two calculations shall be controlled. Paragraph .C below
provides requirements for mined, karst, or other geologically limiting areas
where infiltration shall not occur.
   A.   The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual1) is applicable to any
size of regulated activity. This method requires detailed modeling based on
site conditions.
   (1)   Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the 2-year 24-hour duration precipitation.
   (2)   For modeling purposes:
   (a)   Existing (predevelopment) non-forested pervious areas must be
considered meadow or its equivalent.
   (b)   Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present, shall be
considered meadow in the model for existing conditions.
   B.   When Design Storm Method CG-1 guidelines are not used, the Simplified
Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual1) has been modified to accommodate 2 inches of
permanently removed runoff volume. This method (provided below) is independent
of site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm Method is not
followed. For new impervious surfaces:
   (1)   The first 2 inches of runoff from new impervious surfaces shall be
permanently removed from the runoff flow (i.e., it shall not be released into
the surface waters of this Commonwealth). Removal options include reuse,
evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration.
   (2)   Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed runoff; however, in
all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the permanently removed runoff should
be infiltrated.
   (3)   Facilities, to the greatest extent possible and subject to the Borough
Engineer’s discretion, shall be designed to drain the permanently removed
runoff volume in a period no less than 24 hours and no greater than 72 hours.
   (4)   Runoff volume in excess of 2 inches shall be safely conveyed to
existing stormwater collection systems or streams, in the direction of the
existing drainage course.
   (5)   This method is exempt from the requirements of §
23-304, “Rate Controls.”
   C.   Before infiltration is proposed on a site, site conditions shall be
evaluated by a qualified design professional through subsurface investigation
and testing to determine if site conditions are suitable to support proposed
infiltration facilities to manage runoff. If it is determined that infiltration
is not feasible due to physical constraints of the site or will adversely
impact the environment as demonstrated by the presence of acid mine drainage,
sinkhole formation, or other serious environmental issues, then the above
volume controls must be achieved through surface BMP mitigation. Reference the
BMP Manual1 for alternative mitigation measures that do not require
infiltration.
(Ord. 2011-2, 3/16/2011, § 303)
§ 23-304.   Rate Controls.
   1.   Areas Not Covered by a Stormwater Management District Map Contained in
Appendix 23-F.1 of this Chapter. Post-development discharge rates shall not
exceed the predevelopment discharge rates for the 1- through 100-year, 24-hour
storms. If it is shown that the peak rates of discharge indicated by the post-
development analysis are less than or equal to the peak rates of discharge
indicated by the predevelopment analysis for 1- through 100-year, 24-hour
storms, then the requirements of this Section have been met. Otherwise, the
applicant shall provide additional controls as necessary to satisfy the peak
rate of discharge requirement.
   2.   Areas Covered by a Stormwater Management District Map Contained in
Appendix 23-F.1 of this Chapter. For the 1- through 100-year storms, the post-
development peak discharge rates will follow the applicable approved Stormwater
Management District Maps. For any areas not shown on the Stormwater Management
District Maps, the post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the
predevelopment discharge rates.
   3.   Areas Designated as District B-2.
   A.   If a mine reclamation project is proposed, the post-development
discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment discharge rates for the 1-,
2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year storms. Predevelopment land cover
conditions shall be considered forest in good condition.
   B.   Proposed land development projects shall apply the 60 percent release
rate criterion for the 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year storms. This
applies to all sites including those that have been previously reclaimed.
Predevelopment land cover conditions shall be considered forest in good
condition.

Operation and Maintenance
§ 23-501.   Responsibilities of Developers and Landowners.
   1.   The Borough shall make the final determination on the continuing
maintenance responsibilities prior to final approval of the SWM site plan. The
Borough may require a dedication of such facilities as part of the requirements
for approval of the SWM site plan. Such a requirement is not an indication that
the Borough will accept the facilities. The Borough reserves the right to
accept or reject the ownership and operating responsibility for any portion of
the stormwater management controls. If the facility is rejected by the Borough,
provisions shall be made to identify the legal owner.
   2.   Three options exist for perpetual ownership and responsibility of
stormwater management facilities:
   A.   The developer retains ownership.
   B.   A homeowners association assumes ownership and responsibility.
   C.   The facility is dedicated to, and accepted by, the Borough.
   3.   Facilities, areas, or structures used as Stormwater Management BMPs
shall be enumerated as permanent real estate appurtenances and recorded as deed
restrictions or conservation easements that run with the land.
   4.   The O&M plan shall be recorded as a restrictive deed covenant that runs
with the land.
   5.   The Borough may take enforcement actions against an owner for any
failure to satisfy the provisions of this Part.

APPENDIX B: STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PERMIT APPLICATION
 
Anyone performing a regulated activity must complete the accompanying
Stormwater Management Permit Application, and submit to the Borough. A
regulated activity is defined by this Ordinance as:
Regulated Activity - Any earth disturbance activities or any activities that
involve the alteration or development of land in a manner that may affect
stormwater runoff.
This includes but is not limited to: the clearing of wooded areas, grading and
excavating, placement of pavement (driveways, parking areas, roads),
construction of buildings and other structures (homes, sheds, garages,
commercial and industrial buildings), and other activities which alter the way
stormwater runs off of the landscape. Impervious area is defined by this
Ordinance as:
Impervious Surface (Impervious Area) - A surface that prevents the infiltration
of water into the ground. Impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to,
streets, sidewalks, pavements, parking lots, driveways, roofs, stone patios.
See definition of “Gravel (Crushed Stone)” for when gravel classifies as
impervious area.
Gravel (Crushed Stone) - Considered to be impervious when the intended use of
the stone is for transportation purposes, parking areas, construction areas,
trails, or if the gravel is compacted at any time during or after its
placement; landscaping stone is not considered as impervious area.
Depending on the amount of impervious area placed and the amount of earth
disturbance to the project site, this Ordinance requires different levels of
stormwater management, and correspondingly different levels of design and
review.
Level 1: Proposed impervious area is less than 1,000 sq. ft. and total earth
disturbance is less than 5,000 sq. ft.
Stormwater Management Controls: Ensure that adverse downstream impacts do not
occur due to redirecting stormwater flows towards nearby structures.
Submission: Submit the Stormwater Management Permit Application and Project
Sketch; the easiest mechanism is to include the application with Building
Permits. Review: Reviewing the application will not likely require a qualified
professional.
Level 2: Proposed impervious area is between 1,000 sq. ft. and 5,000 sq. ft. or
total earth disturbance is between 5.000 sq. ft. and 10,000 sq. ft.
Stormwater Management Controls: Utilize Disconnected Impervious Area (DIA) for
stormwater controls as outlined in Ordinance Appendix C.l; if DIA cannot be
achieved, utilize stormwater management controls for small projects as outlined
in Ordinance Appendix E.
Submission: Submit the Stormwater Management Permit Application and
computations for DIA; the worksheet in this Ordinance Appendix C.l may be used
and submitted as is, or may be modified as the Borough sees fit. If DIA cannot
be achieved, submit computations for Stormwater Management for Small Projects;
the worksheet in this Ordinance Appendix E may be used and submitted as is, or
may be modified as the Borough sees fit; the easiest mechanism is to include
the application with Building Permits.
Review: Reviewing the application and computations may require a qualified
professional if the person responsible for issuing Building Permits is not
comfortable with performing the review.
Level 3: Proposed impervious area is between 5,000 sq. ft. and 10,000 sq. ft.
or total earth disturbance is between 10.000 sq. ft. and 20,000 sq. ft.
Stormwater Management Controls: Capture and permanently remove the first 2
inches of runoff over all proposed impervious areas; infiltrate at least the
first 0.5 inches.
Submission: Submit the Stormwater Management Permit Application and
computations for permanently removing the first 2 inches of runoff over all
proposed impervious areas; the worksheet in this Ordinance Appendix D may be
used and submitted as is, or may be modified as the Borough sees fit.
Review: Reviewing the application and computations will most likely require a
qualified professional.
Level 4: Proposed impervious area is greater than 10,000 sq. ft. or total earth
disturbance is greater than 20,000 sq. ft.
Stormwater Management Controls: All requirements of this Ordinance are
applicable, including water quality and volume controls as found in Part 3, §
23-303 and peak rate controls as found in Part 3, §
23-304.
Submission: Submit the Stormwater Management Permit Application and Stormwater
Management (SWM) Site Plan as in Article IV of this Ordinance.
Review: Reviewing the application and SWM Site Plan requires a qualified
professional.
Following the Stormwater Management Permit Application and accompanying sketch
sheet are examples of common smaller projects which do not require the review
by a qualified professional (review by a qualified professional is optional).
An Alternative Stormwater Management Permit Application is also provided
following the examples. Both forms may be modified by the Borough before one is
selected.

APPENDIX C.1
DISCONNECTED IMPERVIOUS AREA (DIA) AND WORKSHEET
 
When a regulated activity creates impervious areas between 1,000 sq. ft. and
5,000 sq. ft., or total earth disturbance between 5,000 and 10,000 sq. ft., the
stormwater management requirements follow Appendix C.1 - Disconnected
Impervious Areas (DIAs), of this Chapter. If site conditions prevent the
requirements of Appendix C.1 from being met, then the first 1 inch of runoff
shall be captured and controlled in a manner consistent with Appendix E -
Stormwater Management for Small Projects, of this Chapter.
When rooftop or pavement runoff is directed to a pervious area that allows for
infiltration, filtration, and increased time of concentration, the contributing
rooftop or pavement area may qualify as a Disconnected Impervious Area (DIA). A
rooftop or pavement area is considered to be a DIA if it meets the requirements
listed below:
•   The soil, in proximity of the discharge area, is not designated as
hydrologic soil group “D” or equivalent (see Appendix F.2. Hydrologic Soil
Group Map);
•   The overland flow path (pervious area serving as BMP) from discharge area
has a positive slope of 10% or less;
•   The length of overland flow path (pervious area serving as BMP) is greater
than or equal to the contributing rooftop or pavement length;
•   The length of overland flow path (pervious area serving as BMP) is greater
than 25 feet.
If the discharge is concentrated at one or more discrete points, no more than
1,000 square feet of impervious area may discharge to any one point. In
addition, a gravel strip or other spreading device is required for concentrated
discharges. For non-concentrated discharges along the edge of the pavement,
this requirement is waived; however, there must be a provision for the
establishment of vegetation along the pavement edge and temporary stabilization
of the area until vegetation becomes stabilized.
If rainspouts are discharged underground to provide infiltration, the portion
of the impervious area draining to those rainspouts is waived from the DIA
discharge requirements. Rainspouts discharged underground which are directly

APPENDIX C.2
RAINSPOUT DISCONNECTION FROM SANITARY SEWER SYSTEMS REQUIREMENT FOR
MUNICIPALITIES
 
When roofs are being replaced, the Borough may require that rainspouts must be
disconnected from sanitary sewer systems. The following guidance is provided
should a Borough choose to enforce this requirement as part of this
Chapter 23, and is subject to the municipal engineer’s discretion. When
rainspouts are disconnected from sanitary sewer systems, it must be shown that
adverse stormwater impacts are not created downstream. If the Borough opts to
enforce this requirement, delete what is highlighted in gray on this page.

PROJECTS MEETING REQUIREMENTS IN §
23-303B.
 
When a regulated activity creates impervious areas between 5,000 sq. ft. and
10,000 sq. ft., or total earth disturbance between 10,000 and 20,000 sq. ft.,
the stormwater management requirements follow §
23-303B. of this Chapter.
Section 23-303, Paragraph B. is duplicated below:
   B.   When design storm method CG-1 guidelines are not used, the Simplified
Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual1) has been modified to accommodate 2 inches of
permanently removed runoff volume. This method (provided below) is independent
of site conditions and should be used if the design storm method is not
followed. For new impervious surfaces:
   (1)   The first 2 inches of runoff from new impervious surfaces shall be
permanently removed from the runoff flow (i.e., it shall not be released into
the surface waters of this Commonwealth). Removal options include reuse,
evaporation, transpiration and infiltration.
   (2)   Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed runoff; however, in
all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the permanently removed runoff should
be infiltrated.
   (3)   Facilities, to the greatest extent possible and subject to the
Township Engineer’s discretion, shall be designed to drain the permanently
removed runoff volume in a period no less than 24 hours and no greater than 72
hours.
   (4)   Runoff volume in excess of two inches shall be safely conveyed to
existing stormwater collection systems or streams, in the direction of the
existing drainage course.
   (5)   This method is exempt from the requirements of §
23-304, Rate Controls.
Computations for all stormwater facilities must be submitted to the Borough.
This worksheet is provided as an example, or may be used for the computations.

APPENDIX E
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FOR SMALL PROJECTS
 
Applicability: Stormwater management procedures for projects between 1,000 sq.
ft. and 5,000 sq. ft. of proposed impervious area or total earth disturbance
between 5,000 sq. ft. and 10,000 sq. ft. for which site conditions prevent the
use of
Chapter 23, Appendix C.1 - Disconnected Impervious Area (DIA) as a BMP.
Note: This small projects document is not to be used to plan for multiple lots
without obtaining prior written approval from the Borough. Approvals and
actions associated with this document do not relieve the applicant of the
responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for activities regulated
by any other code, law or ordinance.
   E.1 Introduction
These methods have been developed to allow homeowners to comply with stormwater
management criteria for new projects to meet the requirements of the Act 167
Stormwater Management Ordinance of the Borough including sizing, designing,
locating, and installing on-lot measures, referred to herein as “Best
Management Practices” (BMPs). Pennsylvania Act 167 was authorized on October 4,
1978 (32 P.S., P.L. 864) and gave Pennsylvania municipalities the power to
regulate activities that affect stormwater runoff and surface and groundwater
quantity and quality.
Individual home construction projects on single-family lots which result in
1,000 sq. ft. to 5,000 sq. ft. of proposed impervious area (including the
building footprint, driveway, sidewalks, and parking areas) are not required to
submit formal stormwater management (SWM) site plans to the Township or county;
however, they must address water quality and infiltration goals, and submit the
worksheet as outlined in this small projects document. If the guidelines
presented in this brochure are followed, the individual homeowner will not
require professional services to comply with these water quality and
infiltration goals.
Appendix E.2 presents options of BMPs that can be considered for on-lot
stormwater management. Appendix E.3 describes requirements and outlines the
method for designing a suitable BMP, and a description of what needs to be
included on the simple sketch plan, and the Small Projects Worksheet in
Table E.4. Appendix E.4 contains an example of how to obtain the size and
dimensions of the BMPs, complete the site sketch, and prepare the Small Project
Worksheet.
The stormwater management method for small projects requires:
   •   The first one inch of rainfall runoff from proposed impervious surfaces
to be captured (see definition of captured in Part 2 of
Chapter 23).
The purpose of this small projects document is to help reduce stormwater runoff
in the community, to maintain groundwater recharge, to prevent degradation of
surface and groundwater quality, and to otherwise protect water resources and
public safety.
What needs to be sent to the Borough?
Stormwater computations and a sketch plan must be submitted to the Borough. The
small projects worksheet found in
Table E.4 and a simple sketch plan containing the features described in Step 5
of Appendix E.3 is provided as an example, or may be used for submission to the
Borough, and if applicable, the contractor prior to construction.
   E.2 Description of BMPs
The following is a description of several types of BMPs that could be
implemented. Refer to Chapter 6 of the PA BMP Manual which can be found on the
PA Department of Environmental Protection’s website for specifications and
steps for construction for the following BMPs. A list of routine maintenance
for each of the BMPs described below is also included at the end of this
Section.
Rain Barrels/Cisterns
   •   Rain barrels and cisterns are large containers that collect drainage
from roof leaders and temporarily store water to be released to lawns, gardens,
and other landscaped areas; rain barrels are typically less than 50 gallons in
size, and cisterns typically have volumes of up to 1,000 gallons or more, and

Rain Garden/Bioretention Area
   •   A rain garden/bioretention area is an excavated depression area on the
surface of the land in which native vegetation is planted to filter and use
stormwater runoff; depths of 1.0 foot or less are recommended. Planting species
should be native to Pennsylvania.

Dry Wells
•   A dry well, also referred to as a seepage pit is a subsurface storage
facility that temporarily stores and infiltrates runoff from the roofs of
buildings or other impervious surfaces; recommended depth of dry well is
between 1.0 and 4.0 feet.
•   Dry Well #1 - structural prefabricated chamber; no stone fill.
•   Dry Well #2 - excavated pit filled with stone fill.
   Figure E.4. Dry Well #1 - Structural Prefabricated Chamber.

Infiltration Trench
   •   An infiltration trench is a long, narrow, rock-filled trench with or
without a perforated pipe that receives stormwater runoff and has no outlet.
   •   Runoff is stored in the void space between the stones and in the pipe
and infiltrates through the bottom and into the underlying soil matrix.
   •   The width is limited to between three and eight feet, and the depth
ranges from two to five feet.

   Source: Pennsylvania Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual.
Routine Maintenance for BMPs
   •   Vegetation along the surface of an infiltration trench should be
maintained in good condition, and any bare spots should be revegetated as soon
as possible.
   •   Vehicles shouldn’t be parked or driven on an infiltration trench, and
care should be taken to avoid excessive compaction by mowers.
   •   Any debris such as leaves blocking flow from reaching an infiltration
trench or bioretention/rain garden should be routinely removed.
   •   While vegetation is being established, pruning and weeding may be
required for a bioretention/rain garden.
   •   Mulch in a bioretention/rain garden needs to be re-spread when erosion
is evident. Once every two to three years or after major storms the entire area
may require mulch replacement.
   •   At least twice a year the landowner needs to inspect the bioretention/
rain garden for sediment buildup and vegetative conditions.
   •   During periods of extended drought, the bioretention/rain garden
requires watering.
   •   Trees and shrubs in a bioretention/rain garden need to be inspected at
least twice per year by the landowner to evaluate their health. If they are in
poor health, they need to be replaced.
   •   Dry wells need to be inspected by the landowner at least four times a
year and after significant rainfalls, and debris/trash, sediment, and any other
waste material need to be removed and disposed of at suitable disposal/
recycling sites and in compliance with local, state, and federal waste
regulations.
   •   For dry wells, gutters need to be regularly cleaned out, and proper
connections must be maintained to facilitate the effectiveness of the dry well.
   •   The filter screen for the dry well that intercepts roof runoff must be
replaced as necessary.
   •   Dry wells that are damaged need to be fixed or replaced immediately.
   •   If an intermediate sump box exists in conjunction with a dry well, it
must be cleaned out at least once per year.
   •   Rain barrels and cisterns need to be cleared of debris routinely at
least every three months and after significant storms to allow stormwater from
gutters to enter them.
   •   Gutters that directly convey rain water to dry wells, rain barrels, and
cisterns need to be routinely cleared of trash and debris at least every three
months and after significant storms.
   •   Rain barrels and cisterns must be kept covered.
   •   Rain barrels and cisterns should be routinely emptied so that they are
only one-fourth of the way full to allow for storage of additional rainwater.
   •   Overflow outlets from rain barrels and cisterns must be kept free and
clear of debris.
   •   Rain barrels and cisterns that are damaged need to be fixed or replaced
immediately.
E.3. Determination of BMPs and Volume Requirements
All proposed impervious areas must be included in the determination of the
amount of new impervious areas and the size of proposed BMPs needed to control
stormwater.
Proposed impervious areas on an individual residential lot include:
   • Roof area
   • Pavement
   • Sidewalks
   • Driveways
   • Patios
   • Porches
   • Permanent pools
   • Parking areas
Sidewalks, driveways, or patios that are constructed with gravel or pervious
pavers that will not be converted to an impervious surface in the future need
not be included in this calculation. Therefore, the amount of proposed
impervious area can be reduced for proposed driveways, patios, and sidewalks
through the use of gravel, pervious pavement, and turf pavers. All proposed
impervious areas must be constructed so that runoff is conveyed to a BMP; no
runoff can be directed to storm sewers, inlets, or other impervious areas
(i.e., street).
All new construction should incorporate design techniques that include:
minimizing the amount of land disturbance, reducing impervious cover,
disconnecting gutters and directing runoff to vegetated areas to infiltrate,
and redirecting the flow of runoff from impervious driveways to vegetated areas
instead of to the street or gutter.
Below are the steps that must be undertaken to meet the Chapter requirements.
The results obtained for each step must be included in the Small Projects
Worksheet found in Table E.4:
STEP 1 - Determine the total area of all proposed impervious surfaces (square
feet) that will need to drain to one or more BMPs.
STEP 2 - Determine locations where BMPs need to be placed, and the contributing
impervious area “1" (square feet) to each.
STEP 3 - Select the BMPs to be used and determine the requirements of each from
Section E.3.
STEP 4 - Obtain the required storage volume “V” (cubic feet) and surface area
“A” (square feet) needed for each of the proposed BMPs from the appropriate
heading below.
Note: all calculations are based on 1 inch of rainfall.
For Rain Barrels/Cisterns
   •   The typical volume of a rain barrel is less than 50 gallons; if a
greater volume is required, more than one rain barrel will be needed or a
cistern may be used.
   •   For calculations, assume the rain barrel is already 25 percent full.
   •   Calculate volume in Cubic Feet:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/b125867c50628fa3261ae1efcf0488ef4b44aaba/

IMAGES/0-0-0-1118.png]
For Rain Gardens/Bioretention or Dry Well #1:
   •   Rain gardens and bioretention areas are only used for depths less than
or equal to 1.0 feet; a dry well #1 is used for depths between 1.0 and 4.0
feet.
   •   Select the depth “D” (feet) for the facility.
   •   For calculations, assume the facility is empty (zero percent full).
   •   Calculate volume in Cubic Feet:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/b125867c50628fa3261ae1efcf0488ef4b44aaba/

   •   Calculate surface area of the facility in Square Feet:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/b125867c50628fa3261ae1efcf0488ef4b44aaba/
IMAGES/0-0-0-1122.png]
For Dry Well #2 or Infiltration Trench:
   •   A dry well #2 is used for depths between 1.5 feet and 4.0 feet; an
infiltration trench is used for depths between 2.0 and 5.0 feet.
   •   Select the depth “D” (feet) for the facility.
   •   For calculations, assume the void ratio of the stone is 40 percent.
   •   Calculate volume in Cubic Feet:

   •   Determine the dimensions of the facility based on “A” calculated.
STEP 5 - Sketch a simple site plan that includes:
   •   Name and address of the owner of the property, and or name and address
of the individual preparing the plan, along with the date of submission.
   •   Location of proposed structures, driveways, or other paved areas with
approximate size in square feet.
   •   Location, orientation, and dimensions of all proposed BMPs. For all rain
gardens/bioretention, infiltration trenches, and dry wells, the length, width,
and depth must be included on the plan. For rain barrels or cisterns the volume
must be included.
   •   Location of any existing or proposed on-site septic system and/or
potable water wells showing rough proximity to infiltration facilities.
   •   Location of any existing waterbodies such as; streams, lakes, ponds,
wetlands, or other waters of the Commonwealth within 100 feet of the project
site, and the distance to the project site and/or BMPs. It is recommended that
the project or BMPs be located at least than fifty (50) feet away from a
perennial or intermittent stream. If an existing buffer is legally prescribed
(i.e., deed, covenant, easement and the like), the existing buffer shall be
maintained.
   •   Location of all existing structures including buildings, driveways, and
roads within fifty (50) feet of the project site.
Fill in the small projects worksheet found in Table E.4, then submit the
worksheet and the simple site sketch (or equivalent) to the Borough.

E.4. Example
Joe Homeowner wants to build an 800 sq. ft. two car garage, and a 700 sq. ft.
impervious driveway. Site conditions in the urban setting prevent the use of
Disconnected Impervious Area (DIA) as a BMP.
STEP 1 - Determine the total area of all proposed impervious surfaces that will
need to drain to one or more BMPs.
   •   Garage roof: 20 ft. x 40 ft. = 800 sq. ft.
   •   Driveway: 50 ft. x 14 ft. = 700 sq. ft.
   •   Total proposed impervious surface = 800 + 700 = 1,500 sq. ft.
STEP 2 - Determine locations where BMPs need to be placed, and the contributing
impervious area “I” to each.
   •   Use BMP #1 to capture runoff from the garage ( I1 = 800 sq. ft.)
   •   Use BMP #2 to capture runoff from the driveway ( I2 = 700 sq. ft.).
STEP 3 - Select the BMPs to be used and determine the requirements of each from
Section E.3.
   •   BMP #1 - rain barrel/cistern
   •   BMP #2 - infiltration trench
STEP 4 - Obtain the required storage volume “V” and surface area “A” needed for
each of the proposed BMPs from the appropriate heading below.
For Rain Barrel/Cistern (BMP #1)
   •   Calculate volume in cubic feet:
         Vcf   = (1 inch x 1/12 x I1/0.75
            = (1 inch x 1/12 x 800)/0.75
            = 88.89 cubic feet
   •   Convert to gallons:
         Vgal   = Vcf x 7.48
            = 88.89 x 7.48
            = 664.8 gallons round up to 665 gallons
For Infiltration Trench (BMP #2)
   •   Select depth “D” for the facility of 2 feet (between 2.0 feet and 5.0
feet).
   •   Calculate volume in cubic feet:
         Vcf   = (1 inch x 1/12 x I2) / 0.4
            = (1 inch x 1/12 x 700)/0.4
            = 145.8 cubic feet round up to 150 cubic feet
   •   Calculate surface area of the facility in square feet:
         Asf    = Vcf/D
            = 150/2
            = 75 square feet
   •   The driveway is 50 feet long, so using the upper 30 feet of the driveway
as length of the infiltration trench, the width of the trench =
         75 square feet/30 feet = 2.5 feet
   •   Use a 2.5 ft. wide x 30 ft. long x 2 ft. deep infiltration trench.
STEP 5 - Prepare a simple site sketch (Figure E.7) and complete Small Projects
Worksheet (Table E.4) to send to Borough.

which the tax is levied is exempt from the payment of the tax for that calendar
year. In addition, the following persons are exempt from payment of the tax:
   A.   Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which the
United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or released under
honorable circumstances from active service if, as a result of military
service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double or quadruple amputee or
has a service- connected disability declared by the United States Veterans’
Administration or its successor to be a total 100 percent disability.

States Marine Corps Reserve, United States Coast Guard Reserve, United States
Air Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the Pennsylvania Air

   2.   Procedure to Claim Exemption.
   A.   A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
shall annually file an exemption certificate with the Borough and with the
person’s employer affirming that the person reasonably expects to receive
earned income and net profits from all sources within the Borough of less than
$12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is filed. In
the event the Borough utilizes a tax collection officer, it shall provide a
copy of the exemption certificate to that officer. The exemption certificate
shall have attached to it a copy of all the employee’s last pay stubs or W-
2 forms from employment within the Borough for the year prior to the fiscal
year for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax. Upon
receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise instructed by the
Borough or except as required by paragraph .2.B below, the employer shall not
withhold the tax from the person during the calendar year or the remainder of
the calendar year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall
ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to employees
at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a form at the time of
hiring.
   B.   With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar
year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the person or by the
Borough that the person has received earned income and net profits from all
sources within the Borough equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar
year or that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer’s payment to the person of earned income
within the Borough in an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that
calendar year, an employer shall withhold the local services tax from the
person under paragraph .2.C below.
   C.   If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year from the
tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under paragraph .2.B
above, the employer shall withhold the tax for the remainder of that calendar
year. The employer shall withhold from the person, for the first payroll period
after receipt of the notification under paragraph .2.B above, a lump sum equal
to the amount of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection .2.C, plus the per payroll amount
due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld per payroll
period for the remaining payroll periods in that calendar year shall be the
same amount withheld for other employees. In the event the employment of a
person subject to withholding of the tax under this paragraph is subsequently
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any outstanding
balance of tax due, and the Borough may pursue collection under this act.
   D.   Except as provided in paragraph .2.B above, it is the intent of this
subsection .2.D that employers shall not be responsible for investigating
exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or exempting any
employee from a local services tax.
   3.   Refunds. The Borough Manager, in consultation with the Collector and
DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims for any
tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which procedures shall be
in accord with provisions of the general municipal law relating to refunds of
overpayments and interest on overpayments. 1  Refunds made within 75 days of a
refund request or 75 days after the last day the employer is required to remit
the tax for the last quarter of the calendar year, whichever is later, shall
not be subject to interest. No refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a
calendar year that do not exceed $1. The Borough Manager or the Collector shall
determine eligibility for refunds to exempt persons and provide refunds.

§ 24-205.   Duty of Employers to Collect.
   1.   Each employer within the Borough, as well as those employers situated
outside the Borough but who engage in business within the Borough is hereby
charged with the duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged
by him or performing for him within the Borough and making a return and payment
thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby authorized to deduct
this tax from each employee in his or her employ, whether said employee is paid
by salary, wage or commission and whether or not all such services are
performed within the Borough.
   2.   A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro
rata share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person for a
payroll period shall be determined by dividing the combined rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods established by
the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of determining the pro rata
share, an employer shall round down the amount of the tax collected each
payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of a dollar. Collection of the tax shall be
made on a payroll period basis for each payroll period in which the person is
engaging in an occupation, except as provided in subsection .4 of this Section.
For purposes of this subsection .2, “combined rate” shall mean the aggregate
annual rate of the tax levied by the school district and the Borough.
   3.   No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
   4.   In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement from a
principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the length of the
payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a statement from the
employee that the pay statement is from the employee’s principal employer and
the employee will notify other employers of a change in principal place of
employment within 2 weeks of its occurrence. The employee’s statement shall be
provided on the form approved by DCED.
   5.   The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The Borough shall provide a taxpayer a receipt of
payment upon request by the taxpayer.
   6.   No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for
the payment of the withheld tax money to the Borough if the failure to withhold
taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the employee as to the
employee’s place or places of employment, the employee’s principal office or
where the employee is principally employed. Further, an employer shall not be
liable for payment of the local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount
withheld by the employer if the employer complies with the provisions of §
24-204.2 of this part and this Section and remits the amount so withheld in
accordance with this Part.
   7.   Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.

§ 24-206.   Returns.
   Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her to
an employee, except as provided hereafter in this Part, the employer shall be
responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had been
originally levied against the employer.
(Ord. 2007-2, 12/19/2007, § 58A-6)
§ 24-207.   Dates for Determining Tax Liability and Payment.

determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted and paid
over to the Collector on or before the 30th day following the end of each
calendar quarter of each such tax year.
(Ord. 2007-2, 12/19/2007, § 58A-7)
§ 24-208.   Self-Employed Individuals.
   Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind or
engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of employment
within the Borough shall be required to comply with this Part and pay the pro
rata portion of the tax due to the Collector on or before the 30th day
following the end of each quarter.
(Ord. 2007-2, 12/19/2007, § 58A-8)
§ 24-209.   Individuals Engaged in More than One Occupation or Employed in More
than One Political Subdivision.
   The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the 1st day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the event a
person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is, concurrent employment,
or an occupation which requires the person working in more than one political
subdivision during a payroll period, the priority of claim to collect the local
services tax shall be in the following order:
   A.   First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or her
principal office or is principally employed.
   B.   Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and works
if the tax is levied by that political subdivision.
   C.   Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person’s home. In case of
dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar year declaring
that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes prima facie certification
of payment to all other political subdivisions.
(Ord. 2007-2, 12/19/2007, § 58A-9)
§ 24-210.   Nonresidents Subject to Tax.

of business outside of the Borough but who perform services of any type or kind
or engage in any occupation or profession within the Borough of do, by virtue
thereof, agree to be bound by and subject themselves to the provisions,
penalties and regulations promulgated under this part with the same force and
effect as though they were residents of the Borough. Further, any individual
engaged in an occupation within the Borough of and an employee of a
nonresidential employer may, for the purpose of this Part, be considered a
self-employed person, and in the event his or her tax is not paid, the Borough
shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer or employee for
the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.

aggrieved by any decision of the Collector shall have the right to appeal to
the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County as in other cases provided.
   3.   The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return made by
an employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax due. Each employer
is hereby directed and required to give the Collector the means, facilities and
opportunity for such examination.
(Ord. 2007-2, 12/19/2007, § 58A-11)

after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for the recovery of
any such tax due or unpaid under this Part, together with interest and penalty.
   2.   If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of

date of the tax and a penalty of 5 percent shall be added to the flat rate of
such tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery of this
tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable therefor
shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of collection.
(Ord. 2007-2, 12/19/2007, § 58A-12)
§ 24-213.   Violations and Penalties.

Part, or whoever refuses inspection of the books, records or accounts in his or
her custody and control setting forth the number of employees subject to this
tax who are in his or her employment, or whoever fails or refuses to file any
return required by this Part, upon being found liable therefor in a civil

Pennsylvania as to any individual, the decision of the court shall not affect
or impair the right to impose or collect said tax or the validity of the tax so
imposed on other persons or individuals as herein provided.

of this Chapter as a whole, or any other Part, Section, subsection, provision,
regulation, limitation, restriction, sentence, clause, phrase, word or
remaining portion of this Chapter. The Council of Dallas Borough, Luzerne
County, Pennsylvania, hereby declares that it would have adopted this Chapter
and each Part, Section, subsection, provision, regulation, limitation,
restriction, sentence, clause, phrase, and word thereof, irrespective of the
fact that any one or more of the Sections, subsections, provisions,
regulations, limitations, restrictions, sentences, clauses, phrases, or words
may be declared illegal, unconstitutional or invalid.

   2.   General Provisions.
   A.   Unless otherwise specifically noted elsewhere, whenever and wherever
the requirements of this Section are at variance with the standards and
requirements of any other Part or Section of this Chapter or the Luzerne County
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance, those standards and regulations set
forth in this Section shall govern development.
   B.   The Luzerne County Subdivision and Land Development shall govern the
procedures respecting applications, hearings and preliminary and final
approvals for subdivision and land developments within this zoning district.
   C.   All applications for development shall be subject to review by the
“design review committee” in accordance with the standards set forth in any
such ordinance creating such committee, assuming such committee has been
established by the Borough Council.
   D.   Development within this Traditional Downtown Area District shall be
composed of three subareas with the following purpose statements:
   (1)   Urban Residential Subarea (URS) Purpose. This subarea is generally
comprised of those areas along the Eastside of Lake Street and the area between
Foster and Mill Streets which typically possess certain unique housing and
development characteristics including larger, multi-story, traditionally
designed single-family detached homes with front porches on larger and wider
lots. This zoning subarea provides for similar compatible reuse and infill
development. The zoning subarea seeks to promote and protect these important
low and moderate intensity residential areas in close proximity to the both the
Mixed Use Neighborhood and Downtown Commercial Subarea of the Borough.
   (a)   Mixed Use Neighborhood Subarea (MUNS) Purpose. This subarea is
generally comprised of those areas along the west side of Lake Street and
Machell Avenue. This subarea provides for a combination of a wider variety of
moderate to more intensive residential dwelling types including single and
multi-unit housing along with some compatible neighborhood, pedestrian-oriented
public and business related services. This subarea is generally adjacent to and
serves as a transition between the less intense urban residential and more
intense downtown commercial subareas where adaptive reuse of existing and
former residential structures and compatible infill development may occur in a
manner that protects and enhances the existing pattern of traditional
residential areas and promotes complimentary and supporting business and public
uses to serve those and surrounding neighborhoods and Misericordia University.
   (b)   Downtown Commercial Subarea (DCS) Purpose. This subarea is comprised
of the area of Dallas Borough traditionally recognized as the central business
district (or downtown), around the “5-point intersection.” This subarea is
primarily intended to become the Borough’s and surrounding region’s new
traditional downtown and focal point of the community. The subarea is intended
to accommodate a wide range of pedestrian-oriented and pedestrian-dependent
business, public and upper floor residential uses in proximity to one another.
The subarea helps to ensure the mixture of compatible and pedestrian-friendly
retail, service, office, public, residential and other appropriate uses within
buildings are appropriately scaled, designed and/or adaptively reused to create
distinct storefront character and pleasant gathering, shopping, business and
living environments for residents, business owners and visitors. Building forms
and types in this subarea cultivate a new traditional “downtown” character
including buildings that are generally two to three stories, oriented to and
abutting the sidewalk, and include a mixture of pedestrian-oriented retail and
other appropriate businesses on the lower floors with upper floors used for
office, service and residential purposes. Desirable and appropriate accessory
uses/structures specifically include outdoor dining/seating, parking provided
on-street and in shared off-street lots located behind buildings and
pedestrian-oriented signs.
   (2)   Standards for each subarea are given below herein this Section.
   E.   The general and specific lot, building and development design standards
set forth in this Section shall govern the following:
   (1)   Residential, nonresidential and mixed uses (housing, businesses, civic
and recreation), including principal and accessory.
   (2)   Buildings/structures (principal and accessory) and lots.
   (3)   Lot access/parking/loading.
   (4)   Lighting.
   (5)   Screening/buffering.
   (6)   Signs.
   (7)   Sidewalks/curbs/gutters.
   (8)   Landscaping/street trees.
   (9)   Other important development design features and characteristics.
   F.   The Borough of Dallas Design Guidelines, developed as part of the
Dallas Borough Downtown Master Plan, shall also serve as the manual of written
and graphic design guidelines for development in accordance with § 708-A of the
MPC, 53 P.S. § 10708-A. Proposals for development and uses are strongly
encouraged to be planned, designed, reviewed and undertaken in a manner that is
consistent and compatible. The Borough of Dallas Design Guidelines to help
implement the Dallas Borough Downtown Master Plan.

10101 et seq., and as already established as districts by approval of the
Council of Dallas Borough, is to achieve the following:
   A.   To ensure that the provisions of this Chapter which are concerned with
the uniform treatment of dwelling type, bulk, density and open space within
each zoning district, shall not be applied to the improvement of land by other
than lot- by-lot development in a manner which would distort the objectives of
this Chapter.
   B.   To encourage innovations in residential development and renewal so that
the growing demand for housing may be met by greater variety in type, design
and layout of dwellings and by the conservation and more efficient use of open
space ancillary to said dwellings.
   C.   To provide greater opportunities for better housing and recreation for
all who are or will be residents of the Borough.
   D.   To encourage a more efficient use of land and public services and to
reflect changes in the technology of land development so that the economies so
secured may endure to the benefit of those who need homes.
   E.   To encourage more flexible land development which will respect and
conserve natural resources such as streams, floodplains, ground water, wooded
areas, steeply-sloping areas of unusual attractiveness in the natural
environment; and in aid of these purposes.
   F.   To provide a procedure which can relate the type, design and layout of
residential development to the particular site and the particular demand for
housing existing at the time of development in a manner consistent with the
preservation of the property values within existing residential areas, and to
assure that the increased flexibility of regulations over land development
established hereby is carried out pursuant to sound, expeditious and fair
administrative standards and procedures.
   2.   Permitted Uses and Regulations. Existing planned residential
developments in Dallas Borough shall abide by the plans for such development
that were approved by the Council. All new planned residential developments
shall be permitted in the districts where they are allowed as conditional uses
and shall be developed according to the requirements for planned residential
developments as provided for in Part 7 of this Chapter and the applicable
sections of the MPC, 53 P.S. §§ 10101 et seq., regulating the said planned

§ 27-704.   Planned Residential Developments (C District).
   1.   Purpose. The purpose of this Section, as stated in the MPC, 53 P.S. §§
10101 et seq., and as intended by the residents of Dallas Borough, is to
achieve the following (see §
27-505.1, “Conservation District (C), Purpose”):
   A.   To ensure that the provisions of this Chapter which are concerned with
the uniform treatment of dwelling type, bulk, density and open space, within
each zoning district, shall not be applied to the improvement of land by other
than lot- by-lot development in a manner which would distort the objectives of
this Chapter.
   B.   To encourage innovations in residential and nonresidential development
and renewal so that the growing demand for housing and other development may be
met by greater variety in type, design and layout of dwelling and other
buildings and structures and by the conservation and more efficient use of open
space ancillary to said dwellings and uses.
   C.   To provide greater opportunities for better housing and recreation for
all who are or will be residents of the Borough.
   D.   To encourage a more efficient use of land and public services and to
reflect changes in the technology of land development so that the economics so
secured may enure to the benefit of those who need homes and for other uses.
   E.   In aid of these purposes, to provide a procedure which can relate the
type, design and layout of residential and nonresidential development to the
particular site and the particular demand for housing existing at the time of
development in a manner consistent with the preservation of the property values
within existing residential and nonresidential areas, and to assure that the
increased flexibility of regulations over land development authorized herein is
carried out under such administrative standards and procedures as shall
encourage the disposition of proposals for land development without undue
delay.
   2.   Use Regulations. The uses allowed shall be single-family dwellings,
two-family dwellings and multiple-family dwellings, as well as customary
accessory uses, public and semi-public uses (except storage yards), and
recreational facilities for the use of residents of the planned residential
development. Other uses allowed only by special exception include home
occupations, model homes and temporary structures and buildings including
trailers.
   3.   Dimensional Regulations.
   A.   Minimum Tract Area. The development shall have an area of at least 50
acres.
   B.   Minimum Tract Width. The development shall have a minimum mean width of
500 feet.
   C.   Front, Side and Rear Setbacks. The minimum front, side and rear
setbacks for a planned residential development tract shall each be 50 feet from
the corresponding tract property lines. A planting strip of at least 20 feet in
width shall be provided along all property lines at the periphery of the
development tract where necessary to protect the privacy of neighboring
residents.
   D.   Density. The density shall not exceed the number of housing units
permitted in the C, Conservation District.
   E.   Common Open Space. Not less than 20 percent of the total area of the
planned residential development shall be designated as and devoted to common
open space, which is a land area within a development site designed and
intended for the use and enjoyment of residents of the planned residential
development, not including streets and off-street parking areas.
   F.   Building Height. The maximum height of any single-family or two-family
residence shall be the lesser of 35 feet or 2-1/2 stories. The maximum height
of any multi-family building shall be the lesser of 40 feet or 3 stories.
   4.   Development Regulations. A planned residential development shall be
subject to the following standards and regulations (See Article 7 - 704 - B -
one (1) through five (5)):
   A.   Comprehensive Plan. The proposed planned residential development shall
be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan of Dallas Borough.
   B.   Site Design. All housing shall be designed with regard to the
topography and natural features of the site and shall be sited so as to enhance
privacy and ensure natural light for all principal rooms. Variations in
setbacks shall be provided where necessary to create a more pleasing layout,
but no structure shall be less than 35 feet from the street line or 20 feet
from any other building or structure, including its extensions or projections.
   C.   Tree Conservation and Erosion Control.
   (1)   Existing trees shall be preserved wherever possible. The protection of
trees of 4-inch caliper or over shall be a factor in determining the location
of open space, buildings, underground services, walks, paved areas,
playgrounds, parking areas and finished grade levels.
   (2)   The development shall be designed and programmed so as to minimize
earth-moving, erosion, tree clearance and the destruction of natural amenities.
Seeding, sodding and other planting shall be applied to stabilize topsoil on
steep slope (slopes of 25 percent or more).
   (3)   Erosion control measures such as minimizing the area of exposed soil,
mulching, building silt catchment basins, and planting temporary ground cover
shall be instituted as necessary.
   D.   Streets. The street system shall be designed so as to relate
harmoniously with land uses and adjacent streets and to minimize through-
traffic in residential areas. All streets shall be constructed and maintained
according to the Luzerne County Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance
requirements. Shade trees shall be provided within the rights-of-way of all
streets. All streets and areas of high pedestrian use shall be adequately
lighted. (A.O.)
   E.   Parking Areas. All parking areas and access drives shall be paved and
landscaped with shrubbery along the sides. No more than 15 parking spaces shall
be permitted in a continuous row without being interrupted by approved
landscaping. Access aisles shall be at least 20 feet wide. Parking shall be
arranged so as to prevent through-traffic to other parking areas. All off-
street parking shall be adequately lighted, and all such lighting shall be
arranged so as to direct light away from adjoining residences.
   F.   Pedestrian Walks. Residential clusters having a density of five homes
per net acre shall have paved pedestrian walks on one or both sides of the
street.
   G.   Drainage. Storm drainage from roofs and paved areas shall be channeled
to natural drainage courses and away from adjacent properties.
   H.   Utilities.
   (1)   All utilities serving a planned residential development shall be
placed underground.
   (2)   The development shall be served by central water supply and central
sewage disposal systems. If water is to be provided by means other than by
private wells owned and maintained by the individual owners of lots within the
planned residential development, applicants shall present evidence to the
Council that the planned residential development is to be supplied by a
certified public utility, a bona fide cooperative association of lot owners, or
by a municipal corporation, authority or utility. A copy of a certificate of
public convenience from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission or an
application for such certificate, a cooperative agreement, or a commitment or
agreement, to serve the area in question, whichever is appropriate, shall be
acceptable evidence. The facilities or financial responsibility for the
installation of them shall be provided prior to final approval of each
development.
   I.   Staging of Development. A planned residential development may be
constructed in phases if the following criteria are met:
   (1)   The application for tentative approval covers the entire planned
residential development and shows the location and approximate time of
construction for each stage, in addition to other information required by this
Part.
   (2)   At least 15 percent of the dwelling units in the tentatively approved
plan are included in the first phase.
   (3)   The second and subsequent stages are completed consistent with the
tentatively approved plan and in no stage contain less than 15 percent of the
dwelling units receiving tentative approval.
   (4)   At no time may the density of any phase be greater than five dwelling
units per net acre in the area covered by that phase.
   J.   Standards for Location and Management of Open Space.
   (1)   The open space shall be located so as to be consistent with the
objectives set forth in the application for planned residential development.
Where possible, it shall be designed as a contiguous area easily accessible to
the residents, and preserving natural features.
   (2)   There shall be provisions which ensure that the open space land shall
continue as such and be properly maintained. The developer shall either: (a)
dedicate such land to public use if Dallas Borough or another public agency has
indicated it will accept such dedication, (b) retain ownership and
responsibility for maintenance of such open space land, or (c) provide for and
establish one or more organizations for the ownership and maintenance of all
common open space. In the case of clause (c) above, each organization shall be
a nonprofit homeowners corporation, unless the developer demonstrates that a
community open space trust is a more appropriate form of organization.
   (3)   If a homeowners association or open space trust is formed, it shall be
governed according to the following regulations:
   (a)   The organization is organized by the developer and operating with
financial subsidization by the developer, if necessary, before the sale of any
lots within the development.
   (b)   Membership in the organization is mandatory for all purchasers of
homes therein and their successors.
   (c)   The organization shall be responsible for maintenance of and insurance
and taxes on common open space.
   (d)   The members of the organization shall share equitably the costs of
maintaining and developing common open space, in accordance with procedures
established by them.
   (e)   The organization shall have or hire adequate staff to administer
common facilities and maintain the common open space.
   (f)   In the event that the organization established to own and maintain a
common open space or any other successor organization, shall at any time after
establishment of the planned residential development fail to maintain the
common open space in reasonable order and condition in accordance with the
development plan, Dallas Borough may serve written notice upon such
organization or upon the residents of the planned residential development
setting forth the manner in which the organization has failed to maintain the
common open space in reasonable condition, and said notice shall include a
demand that such deficiencies of maintenance be cured within 30 days thereof
and shall state the date and place of a hearing thereon which shall be held
within 14 days of the notice. At such hearing Dallas Borough may modify the
terms of the original notice as to the deficiencies and may give an extension
of time within which they shall be corrected.
   (g)   If the deficiencies set forth in the original notice or in the
modifications thereof shall not be cured within said 30 days or any extensions
thereof, Dallas Borough, in order to preserve the taxable values of the
properties within the planned residential development and to prevent the common
open space from becoming a public nuisance, may enter upon said common space
and maintain the same for a period of 1 year. Said maintenance by Dallas
Borough shall not constitute a taking of said common open space, nor vest in
the public any rights to use the same.
   (h)   Before the expiration of said year, Dallas Borough shall, upon its
initiative or upon the request of the organization theretofore responsible for
the maintenance of the common open space, call a public hearing upon notice to
such organization, or to the residents of the planned residential development,
to be held by the Borough Council, at which hearing such organization or the
residents of the planned residential development shall show cause why such
maintenance by Dallas Borough shall not, at the option of the Borough, continue
for a succeeding year.
   If the Borough Council shall determine that such organization is ready and
able to maintain said common open space in reasonable condition, Dallas Borough
shall cease to maintain such common open space at the end of said year. If the
Borough Council shall determine such organization is not ready and able to
maintain said common open space in a reasonable condition, Dallas Borough may,
in its discretion, continue to maintain said common open space during the next
succeeding year and, subject to a similar hearing and determination, in each
year thereafter.
   (i)   The decision of the Dallas Borough Council shall be subject to appeals
to court in the same manner, and within the same time limitation, as is
provided for appeals to court in Part 11.
   (j)   The cost of such maintenance by the Borough shall be assessed ratably
against the properties within the planned residential development that have a
right of enjoyment of the common open space and shall become a lien on said
properties. Dallas Borough, at the time of entering upon said common open space
for the purpose of maintenance, shall file a notice of such lien in the office
of the Prothonotary of Luzerne County, upon the properties affected by such
lien within the planned residential development.
   5.   Supplementary Regulations. (See Part 8.)
   6.   Subdividing and Developing. Since a planned residential development is
a land development according to the definition of land development as found in
Part 3, it shall also be subject to the regulations found in the Luzerne County
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance except as otherwise exempted by this
Section. (A.O.)
   7.   Enforcement and Modification of Provisions of the Plan. To further the
mutual interest of the residents of the planned residential development and of
the public in the preservation of the integrity of the development plan, as
finally approved, and to ensure that modifications, if any, in the development
plan shall not impair the reasonable reliance of the said residents upon the
provisions of the development plan, nor result in changes that would adversely
affect the public interest, the enforcement and modification of the provisions
of the development plan as finally approved, whether those are recorded by
plat, covenant, easement or otherwise shall be subject to the following
provisions:
   A.   The provisions of the development plan relating to (1) the use, bulk
and location of building and structures, (2) the quantity and location of
common open space, except as otherwise provided in this Part, and (3) the
intensity of use or the density of residential units, shall run in favor of
Dallas Borough and shall be enforceable in law or in equity by the Borough,
without limitation on any powers of regulation otherwise granted the Borough by
law.
   B.   All provisions of the development plan shall run in favor of the
residents of the planned residential development but only to the extent
expressly provided in the development plan and in accordance with the terms of
the development plan, and to that extent said provisions, whether recorded by
plat, covenant, easement or otherwise, may be enforced at law or equity by said
residents acting individually, jointly or through an organization designated in
the development plan to act on their behalf; provided, however, that no
provisions of the development plan shall be implied to exist in favor of
residents of the planned residential development except as to those portions of
the development plan which have been finally approved and have been recorded.
   C.   All those provisions of the development plan authorized to be enforced
by Dallas Borough under this Section may be modified, removed or released by
the Borough, except grants or easements relating to the service or equipment of
a public utility, subject with the following conditions: (1) no such
modification, removal or release of the provisions of the development plan by
the Borough shall affect the rights of the residents of the planned residential
development to maintain and enforce those provisions, at law or equity, as
provided in this Section; (2) no modification, removal or release of the
provisions of the development plan by the Borough shall be permitted except
upon a finding by the Council or its designated agency, following a public
hearing thereon pursuant to public notice called and held in accordance with
the provisions of this Section, that the same is consistent with the efficient
development and preservation of the entire planned residential development,
does not adversely affect either the enjoyment of land abutting upon or across
the street from the planned residential development or the public interest, and
is not granted solely to confer a special benefit upon any person.
   D.   Residents of the planned residential development may, to the extent and
in the manner expressly authorized by the provisions of the development plan,
modify, remove or release their rights to enforce the provisions of the
development plan, but no such action shall affect the right of the Borough to
enforce the provisions of the development plan in accordance with the
provisions of this Section.

of a planned residential development shall be subject to the following
procedures:
   A.   Application and Fee. The application for tentative approval shall be

   10.   The Findings.
   A.   The Dallas Borough Council, within 60 days following the conclusion of
the public hearing provided for in this Section, shall, by official written
communication, to the landowner, either:
   (1)   Grant tentative approval to the development plan as submitted.
   (2)   Grant tentative approval subject to specified conditions not included
in the development plan as submitted.
   (3)   Deny tentative approval to the development plan.
   Failure to act within said period shall be deemed to be a grant of tentative
approval of the development plan as submitted. In the event, however, that
tentative approval is granted subject to conditions, the landowner may, within
30 days after receiving a copy of the official written communication of the
Dallas Borough Council notify such Council of his refusal to accept all said
conditions, in which case the Borough Council shall be deemed to have denied
tentative approval of the development plan. In the event the landowner does
not, within said period, notify the Council of his refusal to accept all said
conditions, tentative approval of the development plan, with all said
conditions, shall stand as granted.
   B.   The grant or denial of tentative approval by official written
communication shall include not only conclusions but also findings of fact
related to the specific proposal and shall set forth the reasons for the grant,
with or without conditions, or for the denial, and said communication shall set
forth with particularity in what respects the development plan would or would
not be in the public interest, including, but not limited to, findings of fact
and conclusions on the following:
   (1)   In those respects in which the development plan is or is not
consistent with the Comprehensive Plan for the development of Dallas Borough.
   (2)   The extent to which the development plan departs from zoning and
subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the subject property,
including, but not limited to, density, bulk and use, and the reasons why such
departures are or are not deemed to be in the public interest.
   (3)   The purpose, location and amount of the common open space in the
planned residential development, the reliability of the proposals for
maintenance and conservation of the common open space, and the adequacy or
inadequacy of the amount and purpose of the common open space as related to the
proposed density and type of residential development.
   (4)   The physical design of the development plan and the manner in which
said design does or does not make adequate provisions for public services,
provide adequate control over vehicular traffic, and further the amenities of
light and air, recreation and visual enjoyment.
   (5)   The relationship, beneficial or adverse, of the proposed planned
residential development to the neighborhood in which it is proposed to be
established.
   (6)   In the case of a development plan which proposes development over a
period of years, the sufficiency of the terms and conditions intended to
protect the interest of the public and of the residents of the planned
residential development in the integrity of the development plan.
   C.   In the event a development plan is granted tentative approval, with or
without conditions, the Council may set forth in the official written
communication the time within which an application for final approval of the
development plan shall be filed or, in the case of a development plan which
provides for development over a period of years, the periods of time within
which applications for final approval of each part thereof shall be filed.
Except upon the consent of the landowner, the time so established between grant
of tentative approval and an application for final approval shall not be less
than 3 months and, in the case of developments over a period of years, the time
between applications for final approval of each part of a plan shall be not
less than 12 months.
   11.   Status of Plan After Tentative Approval.
   A.   The official written communication provided for in this Section shall
be certified by the Secretary of the Council and shall be filed in his or her
office, and a certified copy shall be mailed to the landowner. Where tentative
approval has been granted, it shall be deemed an amendment to the Zoning Map,
effective upon final approval and shall be noted on the Zoning Map.
   B.   Tentative approval of a development plan shall not qualify a plat of
the planned residential development for recording nor authorize development or
the issuance of any zoning (building) permits. A development plan which has
been given tentative approval as submitted, or which has been given tentative
approval with conditions which have been accepted by the landowner (and
provided that the landowner has not defaulted nor violated any of the
conditions of the tentative approval), shall not be modified or revoked nor
otherwise impaired by action of the Borough pending an application or
applications for final approval, without the consent of the landowner, provided
an application for final approval is filed, or, in the case or development over
a period of years, provided applications are filed, within the periods of time
specified in the official written communication granting tentative approval.
   C.   In the event that a development plan is given tentative approval, and
thereafter, but prior to final approval, the landowner shall elect to abandon
said development plan and shall so notify the Council in writing, or in the
event the landowner shall fail to file application or applications for final
approval within the required period of time or times, an the case may be, the
tentative approval shall be deemed to be revoked, and all that portion of the
area included in the development plan for which final approval has not been
given shall be subject to those local ordinances otherwise applicable thereto
as they may be amended from time to time, and the same shall be noted on the
Zoning Map and in the records of the Secretary of Dallas Borough.
   12.   Application for Final Approval.
   A.   An application for final approval may be for all the land included in a
development plan or, to the extent set forth in the tentative approval, a
section thereof. Said application shall be made to the Council and within the
time or times specified by the official written communication granting
tentative approval. If the application for final approval of the development
plan or part thereof, is in compliance with the tentatively approved
development plan and with any specified conditions attached thereto, a public
hearing need not be held.
   B.   The application for final approval shall show all information as
required on the final plan map in the Luzerne County Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance. (A.O.)
   C.   In the event the application for final approval has been filed,
together with all drawings, specifications and other documents in support
thereof, and as required by this Chapter and the official written communication
of tentative approval, the Council shall, within 45 days of such filing, grant
such development plan final approval.
   D.   In the event the development plan as submitted contains variations from
the development plan given tentative approval, the Council may refuse to grant
final approval and shall, within 45 days from the filing of the application for
final approval, so advise the landowner in writing of said refusal, setting
forth in said notice the reasons why one or more of said variations are not in
the public interest. In the event of such refusal, the landowner may either:
   (1)   Refile his application for final approval without the variations
objected.
   (2)   File a written request with the Council that it hold a public hearing
on his application for final approval.
   If the landowner wishes to take either such alternate action, he may do so
at any time within which he shall be entitled to apply for final approval, or
within 30 additional days if the time for applying for final approval shall
have already passed at the time when the landowner was advised that the
development plan was not in substantial compliance.
   In the event the landowner shall fail to take either of these alternate
actions within said time, he shall be deemed to have abandoned the development
plan.
   Any such public hearing shall be held pursuant to public notice within 30
days after request for the hearing is made by the landowner, and the hearing
shall be conducted in the manner prescribed in this Chapter for public hearings
on applications for tentative approval. Within 30 days after the conclusion of
the hearing, the Council shall by official written communication either grant
final approval to the development plan or deny final approval.
   The grant or denial of final approval of the development plan shall, in
cases arising under this subsection, be in the form and contain the findings
required for an application for tentative approval set forth in this Section.
   E.   A development plan, or any part thereof, which has been given final
approval shall be so certified without delay by the Council and shall be filed
of record forthwith in the Office of Recorder of Deeds of Luzerne County before
any development shall take place in accordance therewith. Upon the filing of
record of the development plan, the zoning and subdivision regulations
otherwise applicable to the land included in such plan shall cease to apply
thereto. Pending completion, in accordance with the time provisions stated in
the Luzerne County Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance, of said planned

viable use of forested land and forestry activities, including, but not limited
to, timber harvesting and to be in compliance with the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §§ 10101 et seq., as amended. Forestry
shall be a permitted use by right in all zoning districts. The following
standards apply to all timber harvesting within the Borough where the value of
trees, logs or other timber products removed exceeds $1,000. These provisions
do not apply to the cutting of trees for the personal uses of the landowner or
for pre-commercial timber stand improvement.
   (1)   Policy and Purpose. In order to conserve forested open space and the
environmental and economic benefits they provide, it is the policy of Dallas
Borough to encourage the owners of forestland to continue to use their land for
forestry purposes, including the long-term production of timber, recreation,
wildlife and amenity values. The timber harvesting regulations are intended to
further this policy by promoting good forest stewardship, protecting the rights
of adjoining property owners, minimizing the potential for adverse
environmental impacts, and avoiding unreasonable and unnecessary restrictions
on the right to practice forestry.

shall occur until the notice has been provided. Notification shall be in
writing and shall specify the land on which harvesting will occur, the expected
size of the harvest area, and, as applicable, the anticipated starting or
completion dare of the operation.
   (b)   Every landowner on whose land timber harvesting is to occur shall
prepare a written logging plan in the form specified by this Chapter. No timber
harvesting shall occur until the plan has been prepared. The provisions of the
plan shall be followed throughout the operation. The plan shall be available at
the harvest site at all times during the operation and shall be provided to the
Zoning Officer upon request.
   (c)   The landowner and the operator shall be jointly and severally
responsible for complying with the terms of the logging plan.

used as before the time of the damage; provided, that:
   1)   Such repairs or reconstruction are commenced within 1 year of the date
of such damage.
   2)   The reconstructed building does not exceed in height, area and volume,
the building destroyed.
   (c)   The determination of the extent of damage in terms of percent

insurance adjuster. The cost of such appraisals shall be borne by the property
owner of the affected property.
   B.   Extensions, Expansions and Enlargements.
   (1)   Nonconforming uses or buildings occupied or used for residential or
nonresidential purposes which are nonconforming and otherwise not permitted in
the district in which they are located shall be allowed to expand, extend or

the nonconforming side or rear setback line, provided that:
   a)   The structure shall not be extended beyond the existing nonconforming
setback line.
   b)   No additional nonconformity shall be created.

use shall not thereafter be changed to a nonconforming use.
   B.   Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a more restricted
classification or to a conforming use, such use shall not hereafter be changed
to a use of less restricted classification unless in compliance with the rules
for such change as outlined by this Part.
   C.   A nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use only by
the granting of a special exception by the Zoning Hearing Board in compliance
with this Chapter. Where a special exception approval is required, the Zoning
Hearing Board shall determine whether the applicant has provided sufficient
proof to show that the proposed new use will be equal or less objectionable in
external effects than the preexisting nonconforming use with regard to:
   (1)   Traffic safety and generation (especially truck traffic).
   (2)   Noise, dust, fumes, vapors, gases, odors, glare, vibration, fire,
hazardous substances and explosive hazards.
   (3)   Amount and character of outdoor storage.

be close to dwellings.
   (5)   Compatibility with the character of surrounding uses.

abandoned when operations associated with the nonconforming use have ceased by
an apparent act or failure to act on the part of the tenant or owner to
reinstate such use within 1 year from the date the activity stopped and the use
is not actively advertised for sale or lease. Such nonconforming use shall not
thereafter be reinstated except in conformance with this Chapter. A
nonconforming building or land, which is actively marketed, but has not been
sold or leased, shall not be considered abandoned. The applicant shall be
responsible to provide evidence that the nonconformity was not abandoned.

Chapter to the best knowledge of the Zoning Officer or his/her designee. No
zoning permit or certificate of use and compliance shall be granted by him/her

the Borough Council of the Borough.
   (3)   Any recorded subdivision or land development plan.
   F.   In all instances in which the Zoning Officer expresses a reasonable
doubt as to the ability of a proposed use to meet all of the above-described

evidence in support of his application. If such evidence is not presented, the
zoning permit will be denied.
   G.   Application for a zoning permit shall be made by the owner or lessee of
any building or structure, or the agent of either; provided, however, that if
the application is made by a person other than the owner or lessee, it shall be
accompanied by a written authorization of the owner or the qualified person

commenced or changed prior to obtaining such permit, and after notice by the
Borough, the fees set by ordinance or resolution of the Borough Council of the
Borough for such permit shall be doubled. The doubling of the permit fee shall
be required to reflect the additional expense incurred by the Borough resulting
from the need to inspect the property, respond to any complaints, issue any
enforcement notices and/or process the application as soon as it is received.
The payment of such increased permit fee shall not relieve any person from
complying with all requirements of this Chapter or any other applicable Borough

compliance as required herein has been applied for, he shall issue a permit
therefore as soon as practical but not later than 90 days from receipt of the
application.
   L.   Reconsideration of Application. An applicant whose request for a permit
has been denied by the Zoning Officer may make a later application for a permit
provided all deficiencies which were the basis for the prior denial of the
permit have been eliminated. Additional fees may apply as set by the Borough
Council of the Borough.
   M.   Expiration of Zoning Permit. The permit shall expire after 1 year from
the date of issuance; provided, however, that the same may be extended one time

the approved application and plans for which the permit has been issued as well
as the approved plot plan.

prominently displayed on the subject property during construction, renovation,
reconstruction, repair, remodeling or the conduct of other site improvements.
Such permit displays shall occur within 5 days of permit issuance, or prior to
the commencement of actual work on the site, whichever occurs first. Such
permit display shall be continuous until the site receives its certificate of
use and compliance.

   4.   The applicant shall keep a copy of the certificate of use and
compliance available for inspection.

by the zoning permit has been completed.
   A.   However, such temporary certificate shall only be issued if the
applicant proves to the Zoning Officer that the activity or occupancy can occur
safely without endangering public health or safety.
   B.   The temporary certificate shall establish in writing a maximum time
period under which it is valid. A 6-month maximum time period shall apply if

certain specific requirements within certain time periods.

Hearing Board in granting a variance, special exception or other approval.
   (5)   Violation of any condition imposed by a decision of the Borough
Council of the Borough in granting a conditional use.
   B.   Causes of Action; Enforcement; Remedies.
   (1)   Enforcement. If it appears to the Borough that a violation of this
Chapter has occurred, the Borough shall initiate enforcement proceedings by
sending an enforcement notice. Prior to sending an official enforcement notice,
the Zoning Officer may at his/her option informally request compliance.
   (2)   Enforcement Notice. The enforcement notice shall be sent to the owner
of record of the parcel on which the violation has occurred, to any person who
has filed a written request to receive enforcement notices regarding that
parcel, and to any other person requested in writing by the owner of record. An
enforcement notice shall state the following, at minimum:
   (a)   The name of the owner of record and any other person against whom the
Borough intends to take action.
   (b)   The location of the property in violation.
   (c)   The specific violation with a description of the requirements which
have not been met, citing in each instance the applicable provisions of this
Chapter.
   (d)   The date before which the steps for compliance must be commenced and
the date before which the steps must be completed.
   (e)   The recipient of the notice has the right to appeal to the Zoning
Hearing Board within a prescribed period of time in accordance with procedures
set forth in this Chapter.
   (f)   Failure to comply with the notice within the time specified, unless
extended by appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board, constitutes a violation, with
possible sanctions clearly described.
   (3)   Evidence and Fees. In any appeal of an enforcement notice to the
Zoning Hearing Board, the Borough shall have the responsibility of presenting
its evidence first. Any filing fees paid by a party to an appeal to an
enforcement notice to the Zoning Hearing Board shall be returned to the
appealing party by the Borough if the Zoning Hearing Board, or any court in a
subsequent appeal, rules in the appealing party’s favor.
   (4)   Cause of Action. If the enforcement notice is not complied with,
within the specified time period, the Zoning Officer shall notify the Borough
Council of the Borough. With the consent of the Borough Council of the Borough,
the Borough Solicitor or other officer of the Borough may institute any
appropriate action or proceeding to prevent, restrain, correct or abate such
building, structure, landscaping or land, or to prevent in or about such
premises, any act, conduct, business or use constituting a violation.
   (5)   Violations and Penalties. Any person, partnership or corporation who
or which has violated or permitted the violation of the provisions of this
Chapter shall, upon being found liable therefore in a civil enforcement
proceeding commenced by the Borough, pay a judgment of not more than $500 plus
all court costs, including the reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by the
Borough as a result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied
or be payable until the date of the determination of a violation by the
magisterial district judge. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals
the judgment, the Borough may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable
rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute
a separate violation, unless a magisterial district judge determining that
there has been a violation, further determines that there was a good faith
basis for the person, partnership or corporation violating this Chapter to have
believed that there was no such violation, in which event there shall be deemed
to have been only one such violation until the 5th day following the date of
the determination by the magisterial district judge, and thereafter each day
that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. All
judgments, costs and reasonable attorney’s fees collected for the violation of
this Chapter shall be paid over to the Borough. Imprisonment shall not be
authorized by this Chapter. (A.O.)

and shall also consider:
   (1)   The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools and other public service facilities.

housing units of a type actually available to and affordable by classes of
persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by the challenged provisions of the

   (3)   The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by the
site’s soils, slopes, woodland, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers, natural

   D.   Public notice of the hearing shall include notice that the validity of
the ordinance or zoning map is in question and shall give the place where and
the times when a copy of the request including any plans, explanatory material

close of the last hearing on the request, unless the time is extended by mutual
consent by the landowner and the Borough.
   F.   Where curative amendment proposal is approved by the grant of a
curative amendment application by the Borough Council pursuant to this Section
or a validity challenge is sustained by the Zoning Hearing Board or the court
acts finally on appeal from denial of a curative amendment proposal or a
validity challenge, and the proposal or challenge so approved requires a
further application for subdivision or land development, the develop shall have
2 years from the date of such approval for a subdivision, land development or
planned residential development. Within the 2-year period, no subsequent change
or amendment in the zoning, subdivision or other governing ordinance or plan
shall be applied in any manner which adversely affects the rights of the
applicant as granted in the curative amendment or the sustained validity
challenge. Upon the filing of the preliminary or tentative plan, the provisions
of the MPC shall apply.
   G.   Where the proposal appended to the curative amendment application or
the validity challenge is approved but does not require further application
under any subdivision or land development ordinance, the developer shall have 1
year within which to file for a zoning permit. Within the 1-year period, no
subsequent change or amendment in the zoning, subdivision or other governing
ordinance or plan shall be applied in any manner which adversely affects the
rights of applicant as granted in the curative amendment or the sustained
validity challenge. During these protected periods, the court shall retain or
assume jurisdiction for the purposes of awarding such supplemental relief as
may be necessary.
   7.   Curative Amendment by the Borough Council.
   A.   The Borough Council, by formal action, may declare this Chapter or
portions thereof substantively invalid and propose to prepare a curative
amendment to overcome such invalidity. Within 30 days following such
declaration proposal, the Borough Council shall:
   (1)   By resolution, make specific findings setting forth the declared
invalidity of the ordinance or portions thereof which may include.
   (a)   References to specific uses which are either not permitted or not
permitted in sufficient quantity.
   (b)   References to a class of use or uses which require revision.
   (c)   References to the entire ordinance which requires revision.
   (2)   Begin to prepare and consider a curative amendment to the ordinance to
correct the declared invalidity.
   B.   Within 180 days from the date of the declaration and proposal, the
Borough Council shall enact a curative amendment to validate or reaffirm the
validity of this Chapter pursuant to the provisions required by the MPC in
order to cure the declared invalidity of the ordinance.
   C.   Upon the date of the declaration and proposal, the Borough Council
shall not be required to entertain or consider any curative amendment filed by
a landowner. Nor shall the Zoning Hearing Board be required to give a report,
upon request, for a challenge to the validity of the ordinance subsequent to
the declaration and proposal, based upon the grounds identical to or
substantially similar to those specified in the resolution required by this
Section. Upon the enactment of a curative amendment to, or the reaffirmation of
the validity of this Chapter, no rights to a cure by amendment or challenge
shall, from the date of the declaration and proposal, accrue to any landowner
on the basis of the substantive invalidity of the unlamented zoning ordinance
for which the Borough Council propose to prepare a curative amendment.
   D.   The Borough Council, having utilized the procedures as set forth in
this section, may not again utilize said procedures for a 36-month period
following the date of the enactment of a curative amendment, or reaffirmation
of the validity of the ordinance; provided, however, that if after the date of
declaration and proposal there is a substantially new duty or obligation
imposed upon the Borough by virtue of a decision by any court of competent
jurisdiction, the Borough Council may utilize the provisions of this Section to
prepare a curative amendment to the ordinance to fulfill this duty or
obligation.
   8.   Authentication of Official Zoning Map. Whenever there has been a change
in the boundary of a zoning district or a reclassification of the zoning
district adopted in accordance with the above, the change on the Official
Zoning Map shall be made, and shall be duly certified by the Borough Secretary
and shall thereafter be refilled as part of the permanent records of the
Borough.

and conclusions based thereon together with the reasons therefore. Conclusions
based on any provisions of this or of any ordinance, rule or regulation shall

conducted by a hearing officer, and there has been no stipulation that his
decision or findings are final the Zoning hearing Board shall make his report
and recommendations available to the parties within 45 days and the parties
shall be entitled to make written representations thereon to the Zoning Hearing
Board prior to final decision or entry of finds, and the Zoning hearing Board’s
decision shall be entered no later than 30 days after the report of the hearing

Municipalities Planning Code (MPC), 53 P.S. §§ 10901 et seq., where the Zoning
Hearing Board fails to render the decision within the period required by this
paragraph or fails to commence, conduct or complete the required hearing as
provided in this paragraph of this Section, the decision shall be deemed to
have been rendered in favor of the applicant unless the applicant has agreed in
writing or on the record to an extension of time. When a decision has been
rendered in favor of the applicant because of the failure of the Zoning Hearing
Board to meet or render a decision as hereinabove provided, the Zoning Hearing
Board shall give public notice of said decision with 10 days from the last day
it could have met to render a decision in the same manner as provided in this
subsection of this Section. If the Zoning Hearing Board shall fail to provide
such notice, the applicant may do so. Nothing in this paragraph shall prejudice
the right of any party opposing the application to appeal.
   J.   A copy of the final decision or, where no decision is called for, of
the findings, shall be delivered to the applicant personally or mailed to him
not later than the next business day following its date. To all other persons
who have filed their name and address with the Zoning Hearing Board not later
than the last day of the hearing, the Zoning Hearing Board shall provide by
mail or otherwise, brief notice of the decision or findings and a statement of
the place at which the full decision or findings may be examined.
   K.   Effect of Zoning Hearing Board’s Decision.
   (1)   If the variance or special exception is granted or the issuance of a
permit is approved, or other action by the appellant is authorized, the
necessary permit shall be secured and the authorized action begun within 2
years after the date when the variance or special exception is finally granted,
or the issuance of a permit is finally approved, or the other action by the
appellant is authorized, and the building or alteration, as the case may be,
shall be completed within 3 years of said date. For good cause, the Zoning
Hearing Board may, at any time, upon application in writing, extend either of
these deadlines.
   (2)   Should the appellant or applicant fail to obtain the necessary permits
within said 2-year period, or having obtained the permit, should he fail to
commence work thereunder within such 2-year period, it shall be conclusively
presumed that the appellant or applicant has waived, withdrawn, or abandoned
his appeal or his application, and all provisions, variances and permits
granted to him shall be deemed automatically rescinded by the Zoning Hearing
Board.
   (3)   Should the appellant or applicant commence construction or alteration
within said 2-year period, but should he fail to complete such construction or
alteration within said 3-year period, the Zoning Hearing Board may, upon 10
days notice in writing, rescind or revoke the granted variance or special
exception, or the issuance of the permit, or permits, or the other action
authorized to the appellant or applicant, if the Zoning Hearing Board finds
that no good cause appears for the failure to complete within such 3-year
period, and if the Zoning Hearing Board further finds that conditions have so
altered or changed in the interval since the granting of the variance, permit
or action, that revocation or rescission of the action is justified.
   (4)   As an alternative to the proceeding, an applicant can request, as part
of the original application before the Zoning Hearing Board, the granting of a
timetable associated with the request which would supersede the deadlines
imposed. In so doing, the applicant must demonstrate that the times requested
are logically related to normal and expected progress of the project. In
approving a timetable under this section, the Zoning Hearing Board must
establish and bind a definite time frame for (a) issuance of a zoning permit,
and (b) completion of construction of the project.
   5.   Zoning Hearing Board’s Functions. The Zoning Hearing Board shall have

brought before the Borough Council pursuant to § 916.1(a) (2) of the MPC, 53
P.S. § 10916.1(a)(2).
   (1)   If a challenge heard by a Zoning Hearing Board is found to have merit,
the decision of the Zoning Hearing Board shall include recommended amendments
to the challenged ordinance which will cure the defects found. In reaching its
decision, the Zoning Hearing Board shall consider the amendments, plans and
explanatory material submitted by the landowner and shall also consider:
   (a)   The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools and other public service facilities.
   (b)   If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the proposal
upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of the proposal in providing
housing units of a type actually available to and affordable by classes of
persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by the challenged provisions of the
ordinance or zoning map.
   (c)   The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by the
site’s soils, slopes, woodland, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers, natural
resources and other natural features.
   (d)   The impact of the proposed use on the site’s soils, slopes, woodlands,
wetlands, floodplains, natural resources and nature features, the degree to
which these are protected or destroyed, the tolerance of the resources to
development and any adverse environmental impacts.
   (e)   The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture and
other land uses which are essential to public health and welfare.
   (2)   Public notice of the hearing shall be provided as specified in
subsection .4 of this Section.
   (3)   The Zoning Hearing Board shall commence its hearings within 60 days
after the request is filed unless the landowner requests or consents to an
extension of time.
   (4)   The Zoning Hearing Board shall render its decision with 45 days after
the conclusion of the last hearing. If the Board fails to act on the
landowner’s request within this time limit a denial of the request is deemed to
have occurred on the forty-sixth day after the close of the last hearing.
   B.   Challenges to the validity of this Chapter, raising procedural
questions or alleged defects in the process of enactment or adoption which
challenges shall be raised by an appeal taken within 30 days after the
effective date of this Chapter.
   C.   Special exceptions as provided for in this Chapter and subject to all
applicable requirements, including, but not limited to:
   (1)   Filing Requirements. In addition to the required zoning permit
information, each special exception application shall include the following:
   (a)   Ground floor plans and elevations or proposed structures.
   (b)   Names and addresses of adjoining property owners including properties
directly across a public right-of-way.
   (c)   A scaled drawing (site plan) of the site with sufficient detail and
accuracy to demonstrate compliance with all applicable provisions of this
Chapter.
   (d)   A written description of the proposed use in sufficient detail to
demonstrate compliance with all applicable provisions of this Chapter.
   (2)   General Criteria. Each applicant must demonstrate compliance with the
following:
   (a)   The proposed use shall be consistent with the purpose and intent of
this Chapter.
   (b)   The proposed use shall not detract from the use and enjoyment of
adjoining or nearby properties.
   (c)   The proposed use will not substantially change the character of the
subject property’s neighborhood.
   (d)   Adequate public facilities are available to serve the proposed use
(e.g., schools, fire, police and ambulance protection, sewer, water and other
utilities vehicular access and the like).
   (e)   The proposed use complies with the Borough’s floodplain regulations.
   (f)   The proposed use shall comply with those criteria specifically listed
in Part 6 of this Chapter. In addition, the proposed use must comply with all
other applicable regulations contained in this Chapter.
   (g)   The proposed use will not substantially impair the integrity of the
Back Mountain Area Council of Governments Comprehensive Plan and where
applicable, the Dallas Borough Downtown Master Plan.
   (3)   Conditions. The Zoning Hearing Board in approving special exception
applications may attach conditions considered necessary to protect the public
welfare and the purposes listed above, including conditions which are more
restrictive than those established for other uses in the same zoning district.
The conditions shall be enforceable by the Zoning Officer and failure to comply
with such conditions shall constitute a violation of this Chapter.
   (4)   Site Plan Approval. Any site plan presented in support of the special
exception pursuant to subsection .5.C(1)(c) shall become an official part of
the record for said special exception. Approval of any special exception will
also bind the use in accordance with the submitted site plan; therefore, should
a change in the site plan be required as part of the approval of the use, the
applicant shall revise the site plan prior to the issuance of a zoning permit.
Any subsequent change to the use on the subject property not reflected on the
originally approved site plan shall require the obtainment of another special
exception approval.
   D.   Variances. The Zoning Hearing Board shall hear requests for variances
where it is alleged that the provisions of this Chapter inflict unnecessary
hardship upon the applicant. The Zoning Hearing Board may, by rule, prescribe
the form of application to the Zoning Officer. The Zoning Hearing Board may
grant a variance, provided that all of the following findings are made where
relevant in a given case:
   (1)   There are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including
irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property
and the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions, and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of this Chapter
in the neighborhood or zoning district in which the property is located.
   (2)   Because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is not a
possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of this Chapter and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable reasonable use of the property.
   (3)   Such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant.
   (4)   The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of
the zoning district or neighborhood in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
   (5)   The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that
will afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of the
regulations in issue.
   (6)   The proposed use complied with the Borough’s floodplain regulations.
   (7)   In granting any variance, the Zoning Hearing Board may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards, as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes of this Chapter. These conditions shall be enforceable by the Zoning
Officer and failure to comply with such conditions shall constitute a violation
of this Chapter.
   (8)   Filing Requirements. In addition to the required zoning permit each
variance application shall include the following:
   (a)   Ground floor plans and elevations of existing and/or proposed
structures.
   (b)   Names and addresses of adjoining property owners, including properties
directly across a public right-of-way.
   (c)   A scaled drawing (site plan) of the site with sufficient detail and
accuracy to demonstrate compliance with all applicable provisions of this
Chapter.
   (d)   A written description of the proposed use in sufficient detail to
demonstrate compliance with all applicable provisions of this Chapter.
   (9)   Conditions. The Zoning Hearing Board in approving variance
applications may attach conditions considered necessary to protect the public
welfare and the purposes listed above, including conditions which are more
restrictive than those established for other uses in the same zoning district.
These conditions shall be enforceable by the Zoning Officer and failure to
comply with such conditions will constitute a violation of this Chapter.
   (10)   Site Plan Approval. Any site plan presented in support of a variance
shall become an official part of the record for said variance. Approval of any
variance will also bind the use in accordance with the submitted site plan.
   E.   Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer, including, but
not limited to, the granting or denial of any permit, or failure to act on the
application therefore, the issuance of any cease and desist order or the
registration or refusal to register any nonconforming use, structure or lot.
   F.   Appeals from the determination of any officer or agency charged with
the administration of any transfers of development rights or performance
density provisions of this Chapter.
   G.   Appeals from the Zoning Officer’s determination under § 916.2 (and any
subsequent amendments) of the MPC, 53 P.S. § 10916.2.
   H.   Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer or Borough
Engineer in the administration of any land use ordinance with reference or
sedimentation and erosion control, and/or stormwater management for
applications not involving a subdivision/land development, or a planned
residential development as regulated in Article V and VII of the MPC, 53 P.S.
§§ 10501 et seq., 10701 et seq.
   6.   Parties Appellant Before the Zoning Hearing Board. Appeals under
subsection .5.E–.G and proceedings to challenge this Chapter under subsection
.5 may be filed with the Zoning Hearing Board in writing by the landowner
affected, any officer or agency of the Borough, or any person aggrieved.
Requests for a variance or a special exception may be filed with the Zoning
Hearing Board by any landowner or any tenant with the permission of such
landowner. Any appeal shall state:
   A.   The name and address of the appellant and applicant.
   B.   The name and address of the landowner of the real estate to be
affected.
   C.   A brief description and location of the real estate to be affected by
such proposed change together with a plot plan drawn to scale with sufficient
clarity to show the nature and character of the request.
   D.   A statement of the present zoning classification of the real estate in
question, the improvements thereon, and the present use thereof.
   E.   A statement of the section of this Chapter under which the request may
be allowed, and reasons why it should, or should not be granted.
   7.   Time Limitations.
   A.   No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Zoning
Hearing Board later than 30 days after an application for development,
preliminary or final, has been approved by the Zoning Officer or the agency
responsible for granting such approval if such proceeding is designed to secure
reversal or to limit the approval in any manner unless such person alleges and
proves that he had no notice or knowledge, or reason to believe that such
approval had been given. If such person has succeeded to his interest after
such approval, he shall be bound by the knowledge of his predecessor in
interest.
   B.   The failure of anyone other than the landowner to appeal from an
adverse decision by the Zoning Officer a challenge to the validity of this
Chapter or the Official Zoning Map pursuant to § 916.2 of the MPC, 53 P.S. §
10916.2, as amended, shall preclude an appeal from a final approval except in
the case where the final submission substantially deviates from the approved
tentative preliminary approval.
   8.   Stay of Proceeding.
   A.   Upon filing of any proceeding referred to in subsection .6 above and
during its pendency before the Zoning Hearing Board, all land development
pursuant to any challenged ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning Officer
or of any agency or body, and all official action thereunder, shall be stayed
unless the Zoning Officer or any other appropriate agency or body certifies to
the Zoning Hearing Board facts indicating that such stay would cause imminent
peril to life or property, in which case, the development or official action
shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted
by the Zoning Hearing Board or by the court having jurisdiction of zoning
appeals on petition after notice to the Zoning Office or other appropriate
agency or body. When an application for development, preliminary or final, has
been duly approved and proceedings designed to reverse or limit the approval
are filed with the Zoning Hearing Board by person other than the applicant, the
applicant may petition the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals to order
such person to post bond as a condition to continuing the proceedings before
the Zoning Hearing Board. After the petition is presented, the court shall hold
a hearing to determine if the filing of the appeal is frivolous. At the
hearing, evidence may be presented on the merits of the case. It shall be the
burden of the applicant for a bond to prove the appeal is frivolous. After
consideration of all evidence presented, if he court determines that the appeal
is frivolous it shall grant the petition for a bond. The right to petition the
court to order the appellants to post bond may be waived by the appellate but
such waiver may be revoked by him if an appeal is taken from a final decision
of the court. The question whether or not such petition should be granted and
the amount of the bond shall be within the sound discretion of the court. An
order denying a petition for bond shall be interlocutory. An order directing
the responding party to post a bond shall be interlocutory.
   B.   If an appeal is taken by a respondent to the petition for a bond from
an order of the court dismissing a zoning appeal for refusal to post a bond and
the appellant court sustains the order of the court below to post a bond, the
respondent to the petition for a bond, upon motion of the petitioner and after
hearing in the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals, shall be liable for
all reasonable costs, expenses, and attorney fees incurred by the petitioner.
   9.   Appeal. Any person, taxpayer, or the borough aggrieved by any decision
of the Zoning Hearing Board may within 30 days after such decision of the
Zoning Hearing Board seek review by the Court of Common Pleas of such decision
in the manner provided by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the
MPC, 53 P.S. §§ 10101 et seq., as amended.
(Ord. 2009-3, 12/16/2009, § 1001)
§ 27-1002.   Conditional Uses.
   1.   Conditional uses as provided for in this Chapter and subject to all
applicable requirements, including, but not limited to:
   A.   Filing Requirements. In addition to the required zoning permit
information, each conditional use application shall include the following:
   (1)   Ground floor plans and elevations or proposed structures.
   (2)   Names and addresses of adjoining property owners, including properties
directly across a public right-of-way.
   (3)   A scaled drawing (site plan) of the site with sufficient detail and
accuracy to demonstrate compliance with all applicable provisions of this
Chapter.
   (4)   A written description of the proposed use in sufficient detail to
demonstrate compliance with all applicable provisions of this Chapter.
   B.   General Criteria. Each applicant must demonstrate compliance with the
following:
   (1)   The proposed use shall be consistent with the purpose and intent of
this Chapter.
   (2)   The proposed use shall not detract from the use and enjoyment of
adjoining or nearby properties.
   (3)   The proposed use will not substantially change the character of the
subject property’s neighborhood.
   (4)   Adequate public facilities are available to serve the proposed use
(e.g., schools, fire, police and ambulance protection, sewer, water and other
utilities, vehicular access and the like).
   (5)   The proposed use complies with the Borough’s floodplain regulations.
   (6)   The proposed use shall comply with those criteria specifically listed
in Part 7 of this Chapter. In addition, the proposed use must comply with all
other applicable regulations contained in this Chapter.
   (7)   The proposed use will not substantially impair the integrity of the
Back Mountain Area Council of Governments Comprehensive Plan and where
applicable, the Dallas Borough Downtown Master Plans.
   2.   Conditions. The Borough Council in approving conditional use
applications may attach conditions considered necessary to protect the public
welfare and the purposes listed above, including conditions which are more
restrictive than those established for other uses in the same zoning district.
These conditions shall be enforceable by the Zoning Officer and failure to
comply with such conditions shall constitute a violation of this Chapter.
   3.   Site Plan Approval. Any site plan presented in support of the
conditional use shall become an official part of the record for said
conditional use. Approval of any conditional use will also bind the use in
accordance with the submitted site plan; therefore, should a change in the site
plan be required as part of the approval of the use, the applicant shall revise
the site plan prior to the issuance of a zoning permit. Any subsequent change
to the use on the subject property not reflected on the originally approved
site plan shall require the obtainment of another conditional use approval.
   4.   Hearing Procedures.
   A.   Before voting on the approval of a conditional use, the Borough Council
shall hold a public hearing thereon, pursuant to public notice. The Borough
Council shall submit each such application to the Borough Planning Commission
at least 30 days prior to the hearing held upon an application to provide the
Borough Planning Commission an opportunity to submit recommendations. If, after
any public hearing held upon an application, the proposed application is
revised, the Borough Council shall hold another public hearing, pursuant to
public notice, before proceeding to vote on the application.
   B.   Public notice as defined herein shall be provided. In addition, the
Borough Council shall notify in writing by mail the applicant, Zoning Officer,
and every other person or organization who shall have registered with the
Borough for the purposes of receiving such notices, and other persons as the
Borough Council shall designate by ordinance, and to any person who has made
timely request for the same. Written notices shall be given at such time and in
such manner as shall be prescribed by ordinance or, in the absence of ordinance
provisions, by rules of the Borough Council of the Borough. In addition to the
written notice provided herein, written notice of said hearing shall be
conspicuously posted on the affected tract of land at least one week prior to
the hearing.
   C.   The Borough Council may prescribe reasonable fees with respect to
hearings. Fees for said hearings may include compensation for the secretary,
notice and advertising costs, and necessary administrative overhead connected
with the hearing. The costs, however, shall not include legal expenses,
expenses for engineering, architectural, or other technical consultants, or
expert witness costs.
   D.   The parties to the hearing shall be the borough, any person affected by
the application who has made timely appearance of record before the Borough
Council, and any other person, including civic or community organizations
permitted to appear by the Borough Council. The Borough Council shall have
power to require that all persons who wish to be considered parties enter
appearance in writing on forms provided by the Borough Council for that
purpose.
   E.   The Chairman or Acting Chairman of the Borough Council shall have power

   F.   The parties shall have the right to be represented by counsel and shall
be afforded the opportunity to respond and present evidence and argument and
cross- examine adverse witnesses on all relevant issues.
   G.   Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but irrelevant, immaterial,
or unduly repetitious evidence may be excluded.
   H.   The Borough Council may keep a stenographic record of the proceedings.
The appearance fee for a stenographer shall be shared equally by the applicant
and the Borough Council. The cost of the original transcript shall be paid by
the Borough Council if the transcript is ordered by the Borough Council; or
shall be paid by the person appealing the decision of the Borough Council if
such appeal is made, and in either event, the cost of additional copies shall
be paid by the person requesting such copy or copies. In other cases the party
requesting the original transcript shall bear the cost thereof.
   I.   The Borough Council shall not communicate, directly or indirectly, with
any party or his representatives in connection with any issue involved except
upon notice and opportunity for all parties to participate, shall not take
notice of any communication, reports, staff memoranda, or other materials,
except advice from their legal counsel, unless parties are afforded an
opportunity to contest the material so noticed and shall not inspect the site
or its surroundings after the commencement of hearings with any party or his
representative unless all parties are given an opportunity to be present.
   J.   The hearing shall be conducted by the Borough Council or the Borough
Council may appoint any member or an independent attorney as a hearing officer.
The decision or, where there is no decision, the findings shall be made by the
Borough Council. However, the appellant or the applicant, as the case may be,
in addition to the borough, may, prior to the decision of the hearing, waive
decision or findings by the Borough Council and accept the decision or findings
of the hearing officer as final.
   K.   The Borough Council shall render a written decision or, when no
decision is called for, make written finds on the conditional use application
within 45 days after the last hearing before the Borough Council. Where the
application is contested or denied, each decision shall be accompanied by
findings of fact or conclusions based thereon, together with any reasons
therefore. Conclusions based on any provisions of this Chapter or of any
ordinance, rule or regulation shall contain a reference to the provision relied
on and the reasons why the conclusion is deemed appropriate in the light of the
facts found.
   L.   Where the Borough Council fails to render the decision within the
period required by this article or fails to commence, conduct or complete the
required hearing as provided in subsection .5 of this Section, the decision
shall be deemed to have been rendered in favor of the applicant unless the
applicant has agreed in writing or on the record of an extension of time. When
a decision has been rendered in favor of the applicant because of the failure
of the Borough Council to meet or render a decision as hereinabove provided,
the Borough Council shall give public notice of the decision within 10 days
from the last day it could have met to render a decision in the same manner as
required by the public notice requirements of this Part. If the Borough Council
shall fail to provide such notice, the applicant may do so.
   5.   Time Limitation.
   A.   If a conditional use is granted, the necessary permit shall be secured
and the authorized action begun within 2 years after the date when the
conditional use is finally granted, and the building or alteration, as the case
may be, shall be completed within 3 years of said date. For good cause, the
Borough Council may at any time, upon application in writing, extend either of
these deadlines.
   B.   Should the appellant or applicant fail to obtain the necessary permits
within said 2-year period, or having obtained the permit should he fail to
commence work thereunder within such 2-year period, it shall be conclusively
presumed that the appellant or applicant has waived, withdrawn, or abandoned
his application, and all approvals and permits granted to him shall be deemed
automatically rescinded by the Borough Council.
   C.   Should the appellant commence construction or alteration within said 2-
year period, but should he fail to complete such construction or alteration
within said 3-year period, the Borough Council may, upon 10 days notice in
writing, rescind or revoke the granted conditional use, if the Borough Council
finds that no good cause appears for the failure to complete within such 3-year
period, and if the Borough Council further finds that conditions have altered
or changed in the interval since the granting of the conditional use that
revocation or rescission of the action is justified.
   D.   As an alternative to the preceding, an applicant can request, as part
of the original application before the Borough Council the granting of a
timetable associated with the request which would supersede the deadlines
imposed in this Part. In so dong, the applicant must demonstrate that the times
requested are logically related to normal and expected progress of the project.
In approving a timetable under this Section, the Borough Council must establish
and bind a definite time frame for (1) issuance of a zoning permit, and (2)
completion of construction of the project.

in which the land use appeal has been taken, or a true and complete copy
thereof, including any transcript of testimony in existence and available to
the Borough Council, board or agency at the time it received the writ of
certiorari. The appellant shall be required to pay for the cost of preparing
the original transcript and copy as allowed by PA ACT 247, as amended.
   3.   Appellant Other than Landowner. If the appellant is a person other than
the landowner of the land directly involved in the decision or action appealed
from, the appellant, within 7 days after the land use appeal is filed, shall
serve a true copy of the land use appeal notice by mailing said notice to the
landowner or his attorney at his last known address. For identification of such
landowner, the appellant may rely upon the record of the borough and, in the
event of good faith mistakes as to such identity, may make such service nunc
pro tunc by leave of court.
   4.   Stay of Proceedings.
   A.   Petition for Stay by Appellants. The filing of an appeal in court under
this Section shall not stay the action appealed from, but the appellants may
petition the court having jurisdiction of land use appeals for a stay.
   B.   Landowner’s Petition for Appellant to Post Bond. If the appellants are
persons who are seeking to prevent a use or development of the land of another,

is in question may petition the court to order the appellants to post bond as a
condition to proceeding with the appeal.
   C.   Hearing to Determine If Filing of Appeal Is Frivolous. After the
petition for posting a bond is presented, the court shall hold a hearing to
determine if the filing of the appeal is frivolous. At the hearing, evidence
may be presented on the merits of the case. It shall be the burden of the
landowners to prove the appeal is frivolous. After consideration of all
evidence presented, if the court determines that the appeal is frivolous, it
shall grant the petition for posting a bond. The right to petition the court to
order the appellants to post bond may be waived by the appellate, but such
waiver may be revoked by him if an appeal is taken from a final decision of the
court.
   D.   Petition for Granting Bond If Petition Is Frivolous. The question of
the amount of the bond shall be within the sound discretion of the court. An
order denying a petition for bond shall be interlocutory. An order directing
the respondent to the petition for posting a bond to post a bond shall be
interlocutory.
   E.   Appeal by Respondent to Petition for Granting Bond. If an appeal is
taken by a respondent to the petition for posting a bond from an order of the
court dismissing a land use appeal for refusal to post a bond, such responding
party, upon motion of petitioner and, after hearing in the court having
jurisdiction of land use appeals, shall be liable for all reasonable costs,
expenses and attorney fees incurred by petitioner.

service of the same, upon each appellant or each appellant’s counsel of record.
All other intervention shall be governed by the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil
Procedure.
(Ord. 2009-3, 12/16/2009, § 1104)
§ 27-1105.   Hearing and Argument of Land Use Appeal.
   1.   If, upon motion, it is shown that proper consideration of the land use
appeal requires the presentation of additional evidence, a judge of the court
may hold a hearing to receive additional evidence, may remand the case to the
body, agency or officer whose decision or order has been brought up for review,
or may refer the case to a referee to receive additional evidence provided that
appeals brought before the court pursuant to Section 1012 Validity of
Ordinance: Substantive Questions shall not be remanded for further hearings
before any body, agency or officer of the Borough.
   2.   If the record below includes findings of fact made by the Borough
Council, board or agency whose decision or action is brought up for review and
the court does not take additional evidence or appoint a referee to take
additional evidence, the finding of the Borough Council, board or agency shall
not be disturbed by the court if supported by substantial evidence.
   3.   If the record does not include findings of fact or if additional
evidence is taken by the court or by a referee, the court shall make its own
findings of fact based on the record below as supplemented by the additional
evidence, if any.

court shall have the power to declare any ordinance or map invalid and set
aside or modify any action, decision or order of the Borough Council, agency or
officer of the Borough brought up on appeal.
   2.   Order of Approval of Development or Use. If the court finds that an
ordinance or map, or a decision or order thereunder, which has been brought up
for review unlawfully prevents or restricts a development or use which has been
described by the landowner through plans and other materials submitted to the
Borough Council, agency or officer of the Borough whose action or failure to
act is in question on the appeal, it may order the described development or use
approved as to all elements or it may order it approved as to some elements and
refer other elements to the Borough Council, agency or officer having
jurisdiction thereof for further proceedings, including the adoption of
alternative restrictions, in accordance with the court’s opinion and order.
   3.   Additional Court Hearings. Upon a motion by any of the parties or upon
motion by the court, the judge of the court may hold a hearing or hearings to
receive additional evidence or employ experts to aid the court to frame an
appropriate order. If the court employs an expert, the report or evidence of
such expert shall be available to any party and he shall be subject to
examination or cross-examination by any party. He shall be paid reasonable
compensation for his services which may be assessed against any or all of the
parties as determined by the court.
   The court shall retain jurisdiction of the appeal during the pendency of any
such further proceedings and may, upon motion of the landowner, issue such
supplementary orders as it deems necessary to protect the rights of the
landowner as declared in its opinion and order.
   4.   Definitive Relief for Development or Use. The fact that the plans and
other materials are not in a form or are not accompanied by other submissions
which are required for final approval of the development or use in question or
for the issuance of permits shall not prevent the court from granting the
definitive relief authorized. The court may act upon preliminary or sketch

submissions before final approval is granted.
