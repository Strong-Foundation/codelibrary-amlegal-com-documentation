general revision of the ordinances of the Township before it for some time; and

Publishing Company to prepare and publish such codification and general
revision; and
   WHEREAS, the codification and general revision of such ordinances, together
with the new matter to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be

   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative provision
prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or proceeding for
the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall not be
construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in

continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and codification.

   EDITOR'S NOTE
      The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is consistent with
the best accepted practice for codification.  Each section is self-identifying
as to code, chapter and section number.  For example, 238.01 indicates that the
code number is 2, the chapter number is 238 (or the 38th chapter within code
2), and the section number is .01.  The code and chapter numbers appear left of
the decimal, with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the
decimal, and the chapter number being the first two digits left of the
decimal.  The section number appears to the right of the decimal.  As another
example, 410.01 indicates that the code number is 4, the chapter number is 410
(or the 10th chapter within code 4), and the section number is .01.
      With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded
almost endlessly.  Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation.  Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original
codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event
the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For
example, newly created 662.021, 662.022 and 662.023 follow 662.02 and precede
662.03 to be placed in their logical position.
      Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either
its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that
time, or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the adopting ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
      The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of
every ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances.  It
indicates whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another
into one section or split into two or more sections.  Cross references direct
the user to subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a
given chapter.

other structure, and the designated officer shall return the amount of the
funds transferred to the Municipality in excess of the estimate to the named
insured if the Municipality has not commenced to remove, repair or secure the
building or other structure.
      (5)   Upon receipt of proceeds under this section, the Municipality shall
do the following:

244.05  RECOVERY OF COSTS OF POLICE SERVICES.
   (a)   Findings; Intent.  It is hereby found and determined that:
      (1)   Certain private properties require a disproportionate amount of
police service with many calls requiring a response to maintain order and
public peace and to stop public disturbances so that there are fewer police
personnel and resources available for other locations, emergencies and duties
in the Township, and extraordinary police service at such properties puts a
disproportionate and unfair burden upon the citizens and taxpayers of the
Township;
      (2)   Owners and/or rental agents in charge of such private properties
derive a benefit from such police service;
      (3)   Owners and/or rental agents in charge of such private properties
have a responsibility to manage their properties to minimize required police
service, to maintain order and public peace, to stop public disturbances, to
minimize the burden upon citizens and taxpayers of the Township and to promote
the health, safety and welfare of the public in general;
      (4)   Owners and/or rental agents in charge of such private properties
can minimize required police service to maintain order and public peace and to
stop public disturbances by diligent and strict management and regulation of
their properties; and
      (5)   Assessment of costs as provided in this section is reasonable and
will have a deterrent effect and encourage more responsible management of such
properties.
   It is not the intent of this section to discourage or suppress requests for
police service, but rather to encourage and stimulate diligent and strict
management and regulation of private property by owners and/or rental agents in
charge.
   (b)   Definitions.
      (1)   Owner: A person, corporation or other entity comprising the record
owner of any land or building.
      (2)   Police service costs: An amount fixed by Township Commissioners to
cover the estimated compensation of officers for the amount of time normally
spent in responding to a call or otherwise maintaining order and public peace
and stopping disturbances, appropriate administrative costs allocable thereto,
and medical treatment to injured officers and the cost of repairing damaged
Township equipment or property.  This amount shall be fixed from time to time
and shall be based upon an average cost for a typical police response.
      (3)   Private property: Any land or building, including single and multi-
family dwellings and commercial and industrial buildings, not owned by a public
entity.
      (4)   Public disturbances: Any party, gathering, event or disturbance
involving disorderly conduct as described by the Pennsylvania statutes.
      (5)   Public entity: Any Federal, State or local government or school
district or any agency or authority created or organized thereby.
   (c)   Payment by Owners and/or Rental Agents of Police Service Costs.  Every
owner of private property and/or rental agent with responsibility to manage
private property within the Township is required to pay police service costs to
maintain order and public peace and to stop public disturbances at such private
property, for each response by the police in excess of one response per thirty-
day period, in the amount of sixty dollars ($60.00) per hour per patrol officer
and police car or in an amount fixed by resolution of the Board of
Commissioners.  However, police service in connection with crimes against
residents and/or property by persons not residing thereon or invited guests or
otherwise lawful occupants of the private property shall not be considered
responses for purposes of this section.  Further, police service in connection
with spousal abuse or abuse of children by parents or in connection with crimes
classified as misdemeanors or felonies under the Pennsylvania Crimes Code shall
not be considered responses for purposes of this section.
   (d)   Notice to Owner and/or Rental Agent.  The Chief of Police or other
duly authorized agent of the Township shall notify the owner of private
property and/or a rental agent with responsibility to manage private property
that a response has been made to such property to maintain order or public
peace or to stop a public disturbance.  Such notice shall be given by regular
mail to the last known address of such owner and/or rental agent.  However, an
owner and/or rental agent with responsibility to manage private property shall
be required to pay police service costs in accordance with subsection (c)
hereof whether or not such notice has been given.
   (e)   Billing.  Police service costs due in accordance with subsection (c)
hereof shall be billed to the owner and/or rental agent with responsibility to
manage private property by the Township Secretary of his or her duly authorized
agent and shall be due and payable within thirty days of such billing.
   (f)   Failure to Pay.  Unpaid police service costs may be collected by civil
action by the Township against the owner and/or rental agent with
responsibility to manage private property and/or may be imposed or assessed
against such private property as a Municipal claim under the Act of May 16,
1923, P.L. 207, as amended (53 P.S. § 7101.)  In either event, a penalty of ten
percent and interest at the rate of ten percent per annum shall be added and
collected as provided by law.

authorized to do so by the Board of Health.

dollars ($4,000) each, shall continue to be maintained.
   (b)   Said insurance coverage shall be in addition to the benefits derived
from the Township Police Pension Fund.
   (c)   As each member retires from active duty after reaching the normal
retirement date under said Police Pension Plan, the retiring member shall, upon
application, be entitled to assignment of ownership to said member.
   (d)   In addition, the Township shall increase the amount of term life
insurance upon the life of each full-time member of the Township Police
Department to six thousand dollars ($6,000).
(Res. 471.  Passed 4-21-69.)
290.04  SOCIAL SECURITY COVERAGE.
   (a)   Benefits of Coverage.  The extension of the Social Security System to
employees and officers of the Township will be of great benefit, not only to
the employees of the Township, by providing that said employees and officers
may participate in the provisions of the Old Age and Survivors Insurance
System, but also to the Township, by enabling it to attract and retain in
employment the best personnel and thus increase the efficiency of its
government.
   (b)   Extension of Coverage.  The 1951 Session of the General Assembly of
the Commonwealth, in regular session, enacted a statute known as Act No. 491,
which is the enabling Act provided for in Section 218 of Public Law 734,
Eighty-first Congress, which designated the Secretary of Labor and Industry of
the Commonwealth to act as the State Agency to implement the coverage of
employees and officers under the Old Age and Survivors Insurance System.  The
Township is hereby authorized to execute and deliver to the State Agency a plan
or plans and agreement, required under Section 6 of said enabling Act and the
Social Security Act, to extend coverage to employees and officers of the
Township and to do all other necessary things to effectuate coverage of
employees and officers under the Old Age and Survivors Insurance System.
   (c)   Payroll Deduction System; Matching Township Payments.  The Secretary
is hereby authorized to establish a system of payroll deductions, to be matched
by payments by the Borough, to be made into the Contribution Fund of the Social
Security Act through the office of the State Agency, and to make charges of
this tax to the Fund or funds from which wage or salary payments are issued to
employees and officers of the Township.  Such payments are to be made in
accordance with the provisions of the law and regulations promulgated by the
State Agency and the Federal Social Security Administration.  Payments which
are delinquent shall bear interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per
month until such time as payments are made.
   (d)   Appropriation Into Contribution Fund; Date Participation Commences. 
Appropriation is hereby made from the proper fund or funds of the Township in
the necessary amount to pay into the Contribution Fund, as provided in Section
4 of the enabling Act and in accordance with the plan or plans and agreement. 
Authority is hereby given to the President and the Secretary of the Board of
Commissioners to enter into an agreement with the State Agency, which agreement
shall be in accordance with Act No. 491 and with paragraph 218 of the Social
Security Act.  Such plan and agreement shall provide that the participation of
the Township shall commence as of January 1, 1951.
(Ord. 267.  Passed 7-21-52.)
   (e)   Police Officers; Solicitor; Utility Men. Police officers, the
Solicitor and the Utility Men of the Township are hereby placed under the
provisions of the Old Age and Survivors Insurance System in accordance with the
laws of Pennsylvania and the Social Security laws.
(Res. 234.  Passed 7-21-52.)

294.03  CONTRIBUTIONS.
   (a)   Contributions by Members.  Members shall pay into the Fund at the rate
of 5.0 percent of compensation.  "Compensation," for this purpose, shall be as
defined in Section

reduce or eliminate payments into the Fund by members.  Individual records of
contributions by members shall be maintained, including all interest credited

compounded annually.
   Interest shall be credited from the end of the plan year in which it is paid

   (b)   Refund of Member's Contributions.  Any member who for any reason shall
be ineligible to receive a pension after having made contributions shall be
entitled to a refund of his or her individual account balance.  Such refund is
payable immediately upon discontinuance of his or her employment with the
Police Department or within a reasonable time (not more than fifteen days after
discontinuance).  If such discontinuance is due to death, then such refund
shall be paid to his or her designated beneficiary or, in the absence thereof,
to his or her estate.  If the disabled or retired member is receiving a benefit
by reason of disability or retirement, then the refund payable to the
beneficiary is equal to the individual account balance at the date of
disability or retirement, less any pension payments made to the member.
   (c)   Deposits.  Contributions by members shall be remitted to the Trustee
monthly.
   (d)   State Aid.  The portion of the payments made by the State Treasurer to
the Township and designated by the Board to be allocated to the Fund from money
received from taxes paid upon premiums by foreign casualty insurance companies
for purposes of pension retirement or disability benefits for police officers
shall be used as follows: to reduce the unfunded liability;  after such
liability has been fully funded, to apply against the annual obligation of the
Township for future service costs; or, to the extent that the payment may be in
excess of such obligations, to reduce member contributions pursuant to
subsection (a) hereof.
   (e)   Township Contributions.  Subject to the provisions and limitations set
forth in other provisions of this chapter, the Township shall contribute the
amounts certified to be necessary by the Fund's actuary to provide the benefits
provided by this Plan.
   (f)   Contributions by Members While on Military Service.  A member who
enters the military service during a time of national emergency either
voluntarily or by conscription shall continue to make contributions to this
Plan as outlined in subsection (a) hereof based on the compensation in effect
on the last day of service with the Township's Police Department.  These
contributions will continue throughout the length of his or her military
service.  During military service, the Trustee shall continue to contribute to

service during peacetime.
   (g)   Gifts.  The Fund shall be authorized to receive, by gift, grant,
devise or bequest, any money or property, real, personal or mixed, in trust for
the benefit of the Fund.  The Trustee of the Fund shall be subject to such

property may prescribe.
(Ord. 91-5.  Passed 6-24-91; Ord. 00-6.  Passed 10-16-00; Ord. 2003-02.  Passed
4-21-03.)
294.04  RETIREMENT BENEFITS.
   (a)   Normal Retirement.  Each member may retire on or at any time after his
or her normal retirement date.  Any member so retiring shall be entitled to
receive a monthly pension commencing as of the first day following his or her
date of actual retirement and ending with the payment made as of the first day
of the month in which his or her death occurs.  The monthly pension to which
such retired member shall be entitled under this Plan shall be equal to fifty
percent of such member's average applicable salary.
   In addition to the above monthly retirement benefit, each member who has
completed twenty-six years of service shall receive an additional monthly
pension benefit equal to a maximum of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month.
   (b)   Late Retirement.  An employee shall be allowed to continue as an
employee beyond his or her normal retirement date.  In such case, the employee
shall remain a member of this Plan until he or she actually retires or ceases
to be an employee.  Any contributions required pursuant to subsection (a)
hereof shall continue.
   (c)   Disability Retirement.  If a member retires because of a total and
permanent disability, he or she shall be entitled to receive a pension benefit
equal to seventy percent of his or her salary at the time the disability was
incurred, offset by any Social Security disability benefits received by the
member for the same injury.  Salary shall mean base wage.  The benefit shall
commence on the first day of the month following the month in which the member
retires.  The Township reserves the right to require the disabled member to
present evidence of total and permanent disability and of the continuance of
such condition from time to time and either reserves the right to require
members to submit to medical examinations by practitioner(s) selected by the
Township as a precondition to the continued payment of benefits.
   (d)   Early Retirement Benefit.  Each member may retire on or at any time
after his or her early retirement date.  Upon termination, the member must file
with the Secretary of the Township, a written notice of his or her intention to
elect an early retirement benefit.  This benefit shall become effective as of
the date of the notice or the date designated in the notice, whichever is
later.  The amount of the early retirement benefit shall be the actuarial
equivalent of a vested retirement benefit as computed in Section
294.06.  The actuarial equivalent of the vested retirement benefit shall be
determined by actuarially reducing the vested retirement benefit to reflect
that it will commence on the effective date of the early retirement rather than
on the member's normal retirement date.  The actuarial reduction shall be
calculated using the actuarial assumptions reported in the last actuarial
valuation report filed with the Public Employee Retirement Commission.

Passed 4-21-03; Ord. 2003-03.  Passed 4-21-03.)
294.05  DEATH BENEFITS.
   (a)   Before Commencement of Pension Benefits.  If a member dies prior to
the commencement of pension benefits, then his or her beneficiary shall be
entitled to a refund of his or her accumulated member's contributions with
credited interest.  If no beneficiary survives, then the refund is payable to
the member's estate.
   (b)   Pension Benefit to Surviving Spouse and Dependent Children.  If a
member dies survived by a spouse or dependent children, after having become
eligible to receive a pension benefit, i.e. he or she was eligible because he
or she was already receiving a pension, or he or she met the age and service
requirements, but he or she had not yet retired, then a monthly pension benefit
shall be provided.
   The amount of the monthly pension benefit shall be fifty percent of the
pension the member was receiving or would have been entitled to receive if he
or she had been retired at the time of his or her death.
   In the event a member dies after completing twelve or more years of service
but was not yet eligible for normal retirement or pre-retirement survivor
benefits, the surviving spouse shall act on behalf of the member in selecting
the alternative addressed in Section
294.06.  If a vested benefit is selected, the surviving spouse shall receive
fifty percent of the member's vested monthly benefit commencing on the first
day of the month following the member's normal retirement date.
   In the event a member dies after completing twenty or more years of service
but was not yet eligible for normal retirement or pre-retirement survivor
benefits, the surviving spouse shall act on behalf of the member in selecting
the alternative addressed in Section
294.04.  If an early retirement benefit is selected, the surviving spouse shall
receive fifty percent of the member's monthly early retirement benefit
commencing on the first day of the month following the election of this
benefit.
   The monthly pension benefit is payable to the surviving spouse until death,
then to surviving dependent children under the age of eighteen years or if
attending college, under or attaining the age of twenty-three years.  Attending
college shall mean the eligible children are registered at an accredited
institution of higher learning and are carrying a minimum course load of seven
credit hours per semester.  Dependent children shall include step-children,
adopted children, and any child conceived before the time of the member's date
and thereafter born to the member's spouse.
   (c)   Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit.  In the event a member is killed in
service, the member's family shall receive a pension calculated at 100 percent
of the member's salary at the time of death.  It is understood that the
definition of salary shall mean base wages and that family shall refer to the
surviving spouse and dependent children.  The benefit is payable to the
surviving spouse until death, then to the surviving dependent children under
the age of eighteen years or if attending college, under or attaining the age
of twenty-three years.  The term dependent children and attending college shall
be consistent with that of subsection (b) hereof.

Passed 4-21-03.)
294.06  TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.
   If a member leaves the employ of the Township or ceases to be a member,
whether by reason of his or her transfer, resignation or discharge, or by
reason of disability or retirement other than after becoming eligible for
benefits pursuant to Section
294.04 or
294.05, he or she shall be entitled to a refund of all contributions made by
him or her and then on deposit in the fund, plus interest thereon, computed at
the rate described in Section
294.03(a).
   However, a member who has completed twelve or more years of service may
elect either of the following:
   (a)   He or she may elect to leave his or her contributions, plus interest,
in the Fund so as to receive a vested pension benefit to start at his or her
normal retirement date.  He or she must file with the Secretary of the
Township, within ninety days of the date he or she ceases to be a full-time
police officer, a written notice of his or her intention to vest.  The amount
of the vested pension benefit shall be (x) divided by (y) where (x) is the
number of years of service at the date of termination and (y) is the number of
years of service which the member would have had if he or she worked until his
or her normal retirement date, multiplied by the benefits described in Section
294.04(a).  Years of service shall be measured in years and completed months.
   (b)   He or she may elect to receive a refund of all contributions made by
him or her and then on deposit in the Fund, plus interest thereon, computed at
the rate described in Section
294.03(a).  If he or she elects to receive the refund of his or her
contributions plus interest, he or she would forfeit the pension benefit
outlined in subsection (a) hereof.
(Ord. 91-5.  Passed 6-24-91.)
294.07  DISTRIBUTIONS OF BENEFITS.
   (a)   Refund benefits becoming distributable pursuant to Section
294.06 and death benefits becoming distributable pursuant to Section
294.05(a) shall be paid in the form of a lump-sum distribution.
   (b)   The normal form of all benefits payable hereunder shall be a pension
for the life of the member commencing on the date specified and ending with a
payment made on the first day of the month in which the member dies, subject,
however, to the payment of a death benefit calculated pursuant to Section
294.05(b).
(Ord. 91-5.  Passed 6-24-91.)
294.08  ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   It is the duty of the Trustee to pay the benefits to members and their
beneficiaries, as provided in Sections
294.04 to
294.06, in accordance with the instructions received from the Board, provided,
however, that the duty of the Trustee to make such payments is wholly
contingent upon the sufficiency of the Fund for such purposes.
   (b)   The Township may employ an actuary, investment advisors, counsel or
other professional consultants from time to time in connection with the
operation of the Fund or of this Plan.  Such persons or entities shall be
compensated by the Township at such rates as may be agreed upon by the Board. 
Such compensation may be paid from the Fund.
   (c)   The Trustee shall make an annual determination of the fair market
value of the Fund as of the anniversary date and as of such additional dates as
the Board may direct.
   The fair market value of the Fund shall be reported to the actuary, who
shall calculate the amount to be contributed to the Fund by the Township with
respect to each plan year in accordance with the assumptions most recently
adopted by the Board for the purpose of such computations, provided, however,
that the liability of the Township to make such contributions is subject to all
of the conditions and limitations set forth elsewhere in this Plan.
(Ord. 91-5.  Passed 6-24-91.)
294.09  PENSION BOARD.

Township.  The Board shall make and adopt rules and regulations for the
efficient administration of this Plan.
   (b)   The Board shall keep all data, records and documents pertaining to the
administration of the Plan, shall execute all documents necessary to carry out
the provisions of this Plan and shall provide all such data, records and
documents to the professionals whose services are employed pursuant to Section
294.08(b).
   (c)   The Board shall construe this Plan, shall determine any question or
fact arising under this Plan and shall make all decisions required of it under
this Plan.  Decisions and actions taken thereon in good faith shall be final
and conclusive.  The Board may correct any defect, supply any omission or
reconcile any inconsistency in such manner and to such extent of which it shall
be the sole judge.  The Board shall act uniformly with respect to matters
coming before it concerning employees in similar circumstances.
   (d)   The members of the Board, and each of them, shall be free of all
liability for any act or omission except by willful misconduct or gross
negligence, and each of them shall be fully indemnified by the Township against
all judgments not involving findings of their respective personal or collective
willful misconduct or gross negligence and against all expenses, including
counsel fees, incurred in defense of actions brought against them.
   (e)   The Board shall make available to members, retired members and
terminated members, and to their beneficiaries, for examination during business
hours, such records as pertain to the person examining them.
   (f)   To enable the Board to perform its function, the Township
administration shall supply full and timely information to it on all matters
relating to the pay of all members, their retirement, death and termination of
employment, and such other pertinent facts as the Board may require.
   (g)   The Board shall enact such rules and regulations for the conduct of
its business and for the administration of this Plan as it may consider
desirable, provided the same shall not be in conflict with any of the
provisions of this Plan.  All actions of the Board shall be taken at meetings
at which at least four members shall be present, or by written resolutions
concurred in by not less than four of its members.  Written minutes shall be
kept of the meetings and actions of the Board.
   (h)   The Secretary, acting on behalf of the Board, or any four members of
the Board, shall have the power to execute all documents necessary to carry out
the actions of the Board.  Any person, partnership, corporation or government
agency shall accept such documents over such signature or signatures as if they
were executed by the Board.
(Ord. 91-5.  Passed 6-24-91.)
294.10  RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES OF TOWNSHIP.
   (a)   It is the expectation of the Township that it will continue this Plan
indefinitely, and will from time to time contribute to the Fund such amounts as
may be needed to provide the benefits set forth in this Plan.
   (b)   The provisions of any ordinance establishing, amending or maintaining
this Plan shall not be a charge on any other fund in the Treasury of the
Township or under its control, save the Uniformed Employee's Pension Fund
herein provided for.
   (c)   Nothing contained in this Plan shall be held or construed as a
contract or guarantee of employment nor to create any liability or guarantee of
employment nor to create any liability upon the Township to retain any person
in its service.  The Township reserves the full right to discontinue the
service of any person without any liability except for salary or wages that may
be due and paid, whenever, in its judgment, its best interests so require, and
such discontinuance shall be without regard to this Plan.
(Ord. 91-5.  Passed 6-24-91.)
294.11  TERMINATION OR AMENDMENT OF PLAN.
   (a)   The Township may amend this Plan from time to time as is necessary to
maintain its actuarial soundness and to incorporate changes in Plan benefits or
entitlements.  However, no amendment shall be made which will in any manner
divert any part of the Fund to any purpose other than the exclusive benefit of
members or their beneficiaries (except that, upon termination, such diversion
may be made after all of the fixed and contingent liabilities to members and
their beneficiaries have been met); nor shall any amendment be made at any time
which will in any manner divest any benefit then vested in a member or reduce
or eliminate a benefit to which a member has been given an expectation by
virtue of a pension ordinance or pension calculations for retiring officers who
retired during the member's participation in this Plan.
   (b)   In the event of termination of this Plan, the Board shall allocate the
assets then remaining in the Fund as follows:
      (1)   Sufficient funds shall be maintained to provide the pension
benefits prescribed in Section
294.04 for all participants who have retired prior to termination or who are
eligible for retirement at the time of the termination of this Plan.
      (2)   Contributions with interest at a rate established by the Board as
provided in Section
294.03 shall be refunded to any and all participants who terminate service at
the time of the termination of this Plan.
      (3)   Of the remaining funds, those which can be identified as
Municipality contributions, or contributions other than from participants or
from the Commonwealth allocation, shall be distributed as the Board sees fit,
provided that such distribution is in compliance with Section
294.07.
      (4)   All funds in excess of the funds described in paragraphs (b)(1)
through (3) hereof shall be returned to the Commonwealth as unused funds
pursuant to the Act of May 12, 1943, P.L. 259, as amended, 72 P.S. 2263.1 et
seq.

acquittance therefor.  Such payment shall, to the extent therefor, discharge
all liability of the Township or the Fund.

   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to establish regulations
regarding the use of mobile telephones in the Township of Lower Chichester
(hereinafter the "Township") while driving a motor vehicle.  It is the position
of the Township that the operation of a motor vehicle on the public roadways
while using a telephone may cause the operator to maintain less than full-time
attention to the operation of said motor vehicle.  The Township further
believes that the regulation of the use of mobile telephones while operating a
motor vehicle in the Township will enhance the safety of those persons
operating motor vehicles as well as other drivers, passengers, pedestrians and
the general populace of the Township.

otherwise, the meaning of the following terms used in this section shall be as
follows:

analog, wireless and digital telephones.

vehicle is in the park gear; for a standard transmission vehicle that the
vehicle is in the neutral gear and the brake is being utilized or otherwise
stationary.
      (3)   "Use" means to operate a mobile telephone in dialing, answering,
talking, and listening.
   (c)   Application of Section.  This section shall be liberally construed and
applied to promote its purpose and policies.
   (d)   Uses, Restrictions.
      (1)   No person shall operate a motor vehicle on any street or highway
while engaging in any conduct defined as use of a mobile telephone unless the
operator maintains both hands on the applicable steering device.
      (2)   Paragraph (1) hereof does not apply to a person who is using a
mobile telephone:
         A.   To contact police, fire, ambulance or other public safety forces;
         B.   While maintaining the vehicle in park position either on public
or private property; or
         C.   With a "hands-free device" which allows the operator to maintain
both hands on the vehicle while using the mobile telephone.
   (e)   Exceptions.
      (1)   The provisions of this section shall not apply to law enforcement
officers, operators of emergency vehicles when on duty and acting in their
official capacities.
      (2)   The use of emergency 911 phone numbers shall not be prohibited for
any person operating a motor vehicle in the Township.
   (f)   Procedure upon Violation.  Anyone who shall violate the provision of
this section while operating his or her motor vehicle, in addition to any other
violation of the Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Code, and to the extent that such
violations occurred, shall upon conviction hereof, be sentenced to pay a fine
of not more than seventy-five dollars ($75.00), plus costs of prosecution. 
Said fines to be payable to the Township treasury.

   (b)   No person shall operate any motor driven vehicle or devices including,
but not limited to: all-terrain vehicles, snowmobiles, mini-bikes, scooters,

   (c)   No person shall operate a motor driven vehicle, or devices, including
but not limited to all-terrain vehicles, snowmobiles, mini-bikes, scooters,
skateboards, power wheels, pedalcycles, motorized go-carts upon any street,
way, alley or highway located in the Township.  This section does not apply to
any passenger motor vehicle, tractor or motorcycle which is a properly
registered motor vehicle provided that said vehicle is operated by a properly
licensed driver.
   (d)   Penalty.  Any person, firm or corporation who shall violate provisions
of this section, shall, upon conviction thereof, be sentenced to pay a fine of
not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000), plus costs and in default of

to the school. A second or subsequent offense shall result in the violation

   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish regulations
regarding the use of portable electronic devices in the Township of Lower
Chichester (Hereinafter the “Township”) while driving a motor vehicle. It is
the position of the Township that the operation of a motor vehicle on the
public roadways, while using a portable electronic device; by sending and/or
reading text messages; sending or reading e-mail messages; internet browsing;
game playing; or any other use of the portable electronic device will cause the
operator to maintain less than full time attention to the operation of said
motor vehicle. The Township further believes that the regulation of the use of
portable electronic devices, while operating a motor vehicle in the Township,
will enhance the safety of those persons operating motor vehicles, as well as
other drivers, passengers, pedestrians, property, and the general populace of
the Township.

otherwise, the meaning of the following terms used in this section shall be as

         A.   Dialing
         B.   Typing
         C.   Answering
         D.   Reading

         F.   Sending
      (3)   “Park” means for an automatic transmission vehicle that the vehicle
is in the park gear; for a standard transmission vehicle that the vehicle is in
the neutral gear and the brake is being utilized or otherwise stationary.
   (c)   Title and application of section.
      (1)   This section shall be known and may be cited as the Lower
Chichester Township Portable Device Ordinance.
      (2)   This section shall be liberally construed and applied to promote
its purpose and policies.
   (d)   Purpose of this section. It is the purpose of this section and the
Policy of the Township to regulate the use of portable electronic devices,
which are used while persons are operating a motor vehicle, in order to protect
that person, as well as other drivers; passengers; pedestrians; property and
the general populace of the Township.
   (e)   Uses and restrictions.
      (1)   No person shall operate a motor vehicle on any street or highway,
while using a portable electronic device or while engaging in any conduct
defined as use of a portable electronic device.
      (2)   Division (1) does not apply to a person who is using a portable
electronic device:
         A.   To contact police, fire, ambulance or other public safety forces;
or
         B.   While maintaining the vehicle in park position either on public
or private property.
   (f)   Exceptions. The provisions of this section shall not apply to law
enforcement officers, operators of emergency vehicles when on duty and acting
in their official capacities.
   (g)   Procedure upon violation.  Violation of this section is a non-moving
civil violation. To the extent that such violation occurs, a person shall upon
conviction hereof, be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than Seventy Five
Dollars ($75.00), plus costs of prosecution. Said fines to be payable to the

opening or destruction of any bales, boxes, crates or other containers, between
the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.

by the Township, which unreasonably interferes with the workings of such
institutions.
   (h)   Disturbing the Peace Noise.  No person shall create any plainly
audible noise that disturbs the peace, quiet, and comfort of the neighboring
inhabitants or persons in any public space or public right-of-way. Furthermore,

health of any individual is prohibited.
   (i)   Operation of Motor Vehicles.  It shall be unlawful for any person to

(Ord. 87-1.  Passed 1-19-87.)
882.03  IMPOSITION OF TAX; AUTHORITY.
   For general revenue purposes, there is hereby imposed a realty transfer tax
upon the transfer of real estate or interest in real estate situated within the
Township, regardless of where the documents making the transfer are made,
executed or delivered, or where the actual settlements on such transfer took
place, as authorized by Article XI-D, Local Real Estate Transfer Tax, 72 P.S.
8101-D et seq.
(Ord. 87-1.  Passed 1-19-87.)
882.04  APPLICATION; RATE; EVIDENCE OF PAYMENT; LIMITATIONS; INTEREST ON UNPAID
TAX.
   (a)   Whoever makes, executes, delivers, accepts or presents for recording
any document, or in whose behalf any document is made, executed, delivered,
accepted or presented for recording, shall be subject to pay a tax, for and in
respect to the transaction or any part thereof, at the rate of one percent of
the value of the real estate represented by such document.  Such tax shall be
payable at the earlier of the time the document is presented for recording or
within thirty days of acceptance of such document or within thirty days of an
entity becoming an acquired company.
   (b)   The payment of the tax imposed by this chapter shall be evidenced by
the affixing of an official stamp or writing by the Recorder whereon the date
of the payment of the tax, the amount of the tax and the signature of the
collecting agent shall be set forth.
   (c)   It is the intent of this chapter that the entire burden of the tax
imposed herein on a person or transfer shall not exceed the limitations
prescribed in the Local Tax Enabling Act, being the Act of December 31, 1965,
P.L. 1257, 53 P.S. 6901 et seq., so that if any other political subdivision
shall now or hereafter impose such tax on the same person or transfer, then the
tax levied by the Township under the authority of such Act shall, during the
time such duplication of the tax exists, except as hereinafter otherwise
provided, be one-half of the tax rate.  Such one-half rate shall become
effective without any action on the part of the Township, provided, however,
that the Township and any other political subdivision which imposes such tax on
the same person or transfer may agree that, instead of limiting their
respective rates to one-half of the rate herein provided, they will impose
respectively different rates, the total of which shall not exceed the maximum
rate permitted under the Act.
   (d)   If, for any reason, the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate
in effect at the time the tax is due shall be added and collected.
(Ord. 87-1.  Passed 1-19-87.)
882.05  EXEMPTION FOR GOVERNMENTAL BODIES.
   The United States, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or any of their
instrumentalities, agencies or political subdivisions, shall be exempt from
payment of the tax imposed by this chapter. The exemption of such governmental
bodies shall not, however, relieve any other party to a transaction from
liability for the tax.
(Ord. 87-1.  Passed 1-19-87.)
882.06  EXCLUDED TRANSACTIONS.
   (a)   The tax imposed by Section

of an ordinary trust, where the transfer of the same property would be exempt
if the transfer was made directly from the grantor to all of the possible
beneficiaries, whether or not such beneficiaries are contingent or specifically
named. No such exemption shall be granted unless the Recorder of Deeds is
presented with a copy of the trust instrument that clearly identifies the
grantor and all possible beneficiaries;

   For specific revenue purposes, an annual tax is hereby levied and assessed,
commencing January 1, 2008; upon the privilege of engaging in an occupation
with a primary place of employment within the Township during the tax year. 
Each natural person who exercises such privilege for any length of time during
any tax year shall pay the tax for that year in the amount of fifty-two dollars
($52.00), assessed on a pro rata basis, in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter.  This tax may be used solely for the following purposes as the
same may be allocated by the Township from time to time: emergency services,
which shall include emergency medical services, police services and/or fire
services; road construction and/or maintenance; reduction of property taxes; or
property tax relief through implementation of a homestead and farmstead
exclusion in accordance with 53 Pa. C.S. Ch. 85, Subch. F (relating to
homestead property exclusion). The political subdivision shall use no less than
twenty-five percent of the funds derived from the tax for emergency services.
This tax is in addition to all other taxes of any kind or nature heretofore
levied by the political subdivision. The tax shall be no more than fifty- two
dollars ($52.00) on each person for each calendar year, irrespective of the
number of political subdivisions within which a person may be employed.
(Ord. 2007-02.  Passed 11-19-07.)
886.03  EXEMPTION AND REFUNDS.
   (a)   Exemption.  Any person whose total earned income and net profits from
all sources within the political subdivision is less than twelve thousand
dollars ($12,000) for any calendar year in which the tax is levied is exempt
from the payment of the tax for that calendar year.  In addition, the following
persons are exempt from payment of the tax:
      (1)   Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which the
United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or released under
honorable circumstances from active service if, as a result of military
service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double or quadruple amputee or
has a service-connected disability declared by the United States Veterans'
Administration or its successor to be a total 100 percent disability.
      (2)   Any person who serves as a member of a reserve component of the
armed forces and is called to active duty at any time during the taxable year.
For the purposes of this paragraph, "reserve component of the armed forces"
shall mean the United States Army Reserve, United States Navy Reserve, United
States Marine Corps Reserve, United States Coast Guard Reserve, United States
Air Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the Pennsylvania Air
National Guard.
   (b)   Procedure to Claim Exemption.
      (1)   A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the political subdivision and
with the person's employer affirming that the person reasonably expects to
receive earned income and net profits from all sources within the political
subdivision of less than twelve thousand dollars ($12,000) in the calendar year
for which the exemption certificate is filed. In the event the political
subdivision utilizes a tax collection officer, it shall provide a copy of the
exemption certificate to that officer. The exemption certificate shall have
attached to it a copy of all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from
employment within the political subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal
year for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax. Upon
receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise instructed by the
political subdivision or except as required by clause (2), the employer shall
not withhold the tax from the person during the calendar year or the remainder
of the calendar year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers
shall ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to
employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a form at the
time of hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be the uniform form
provided by the political subdivision.
      (2)   With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the person or
by the political subdivision that the person has received earned income and net
profits from all sources within the political subdivision equal to or in excess
of twelve thousand dollars ($12,000) in that calendar year or that the person
is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that calendar year, or upon
an employer's payment to the person of earned income within the municipality in
an amount equal to or in excess of twelve thousand dollars ($12,000) in that
calendar year, an employer shall withhold the local services tax from the
person under clause (3).
      (3)   If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year from
the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under clause (2), the
employer shall withhold the tax for the remainder of that calendar year. The
employer shall withhold from the person, for the first payroll period after
receipt of the notification under clause (2), a lump sum equal to the amount of
tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption claimed by the
person under this subsection, plus the per payroll amount due for that first
payroll period. The amount of tax withheld per payroll period for the remaining
payroll periods in that calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for
other employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to withholding
of the tax under this clause is subsequently severed in that calendar year, the
person shall be liable for any outstanding balance of tax due, and the
political subdivision may pursue collection under this chapter.
      (4)   Except as provided in clause (2), it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating exemption
certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or exempting any employee
from the local services tax.
   (c)   Refunds. The Township, in consultation with the collector and DCED,
shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims for any tax paid
by any person who is eligible for exemption, which procedures shall be in
accord with provisions of the general municipal law relating to refunds of
overpayments and interest on overpayments. Refunds made within seventy-five
days of a refund request or seventy-five days after the last day the employer
is required to remit the tax for the last quarter of the calendar year,
whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest. No refunds shall be made
for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do not exceed one dollar ($1.00):
the Township, or the collector shall determine eligibility for exemption and
provide refunds to exempt persons.
(Ord. 2007-02.  Passed 11-19-07.)
886.04  DUTY OF EMPLOYERS TO COLLECT.
   (a)   Each employer within the political subdivision, as well as those
employers situated outside the political subdivision but who engage in business
within the political subdivision, is hereby charged with the duty of collecting
the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or performing for him within
the political subdivision and making a return and payment thereof to the
collector.  Further, each employer is hereby authorized to deduct this tax for
each employee in his or her employ, whether said employee is paid by salary,
wage or commission and whether or not all such services are performed within
the political subdivision.
   (b)   A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro
rata share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person for a
payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax levied for
the calendar year by the number of payroll periods established by the employer
for the calendar year. For purposes of determining the pro rata share, an
employer shall round down the amount of the tax collected each payroll period
to the nearest one-hundredth of a dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made
on a payroll period basis for each payroll period in which the person is
engaging in an occupation, except as provided in subsection (d) hereof.  For
purposes of this subsection, combined rate shall mean the aggregate annual rate
of the tax levied by the school district and the Municipality.
   (c)   No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
   (d)   In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement from a
principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the length of the
payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a statement from the
employee that the pay statement is from the employee's principal employer and
the employee will notify other employers of a change in principal place of
employment within two weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall
be provided on the form approved by DCED.
   (e)   The tax shall be no more than fifty-two dollars ($52.00) on each
person for each calendar year, irrespective of the number of political
subdivisions within which a person may be employed.  The political subdivision
shall provide a taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
   (f)   No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or
for the payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the
employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the employee's
principal office or where the employee is principally employed.  Further, an
employer shall not be liable for payment of the local services tax in an amount
exceeding the amount withheld by the employer if the employer complies with the
provisions of Section
886.03(b) and this section and remits the amount so withheld in accordance with
this chapter.
   (g)   Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes thirty
days after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
(Ord. 2007-02.  Passed 11-19-07.)
886.05  RETURNS.
   Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the collector.  If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her to
an employee, except as provided hereafter in this chapter, the employer shall
be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had been
originally levied against the employer.
(Ord. 2007-02.  Passed 11-19-07.)
886.06  DATES FOR DETERMINING TAX LIABILITY AND PAYMENTS.
   In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted and paid
over to the collector on or before the thirtieth day following the end of each
calendar quarter of each such tax year.

thirtieth day following the end of each quarter.
(Ord. 2007-02.  Passed 11-19-07.)
886.08  INDIVIDUALS ENGAGED IN MORE THAN ONE OCCUPATION OR EMPLOYED IN MORE
THAN ONE POLITICAL SUBDIVISION.
   (a)   The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day
the person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period.  In the event
a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is, concurrent
employment, or an occupation which requires the person working in more than one
political subdivision during a payroll period, the priority of claim to collect
the local services tax shall be in the following order:
      (1)   First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
      (2)   Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
      (3)   Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
   (b)   In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that
calendar year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
(Ord. 2007-02.  Passed 11-19-07.)
886.09  NON-RESIDENTS SUBJECT TO TAX.
   All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the political subdivision but who perform services of
any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the political
subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject themselves
to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under this chapter
with the same force and effect as though they were residents of the political
subdivision. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation within the
political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential employer may, for the
purpose of this chapter, be considered a self-employed person, and in the event
his or her tax is not paid, the political subdivision shall have the option of
proceeding against either the employer or employee for the collection of this
tax as hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 2007-02.  Passed 11-19-07.)
886.10  ADMINISTRATION OF TAX.
   (a)   The collector shall be appointed by resolution of the political
subdivision. It shall be the duty of the collector to accept and receive
payments of this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount received
by him from each employer of self-employed person, together with the date the
tax was received.
   (b)   The collector is hereby charged with the administration and
enforcement of this chapter and is hereby charged and empowered, subject to
Municipal approval, to proscribe, adopt and promulgate rules and regulations
relating to any matter pertaining to the administration and enforcement of this
chapter, including provisions for the examination of payroll records of any
employer subject to this chapter, the examination and correction of any return
made in compliance with this chapter and any payment alleged or found to be
incorrect or as to which overpayment is claimed or found to have occurred. Any
person aggrieved by any decision of the collector shall have the right to
appeal consistent with the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights under Act 50 of 1998
(municipalities may detail their appeal processes).
   (c)   The collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return made by
an employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax due. Each employer
is hereby directed and required to give the collector the means, facilities and
opportunity for such examination.
(Ord. 2007-02.  Passed 11-19-07.)
886.11  SUITS FOR COLLECTION.
   (a)   In the event that any tax under this chapter remains due or unpaid
thirty days after the due dates above set forth, the collector may sue for the
recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this chapter, together with
interest and penalty.
   (b)   If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate
of six percent on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning with the
due date of the tax and a penalty of five percent shall be added to the flat
rate of such tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery
of this tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable
therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of
collection.
(Ord. 2007-02.  Passed 11-19-07.)
886.12  INTERPRETATION.
   (a)   Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to empower the
political subdivision to levy and collect the tax hereby imposed on any
occupation not within the taxing power of the political subdivision under the
Constitution of the United States and the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania.
   (b)   If the tax hereby imposed under the provisions of this chapter shall
be held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of the
Constitution of the United States or of the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania as to any individual, the decision of the court shall not affect
or impair the right to impose or collect said tax or the validity of the tax so
imposed on other persons or individuals as herein provided.
(Ord. 2007-02.  Passed 11-19-07.)
886.99  PENALTY.
   Whoever makes any false or untrue statement on any return required by this
chapter, or whoever refuses inspection of the books, records or accounts in his
or her custody and control setting forth the number of employees subject to
this tax who are in his or her employment, or whoever fails or refuses to file
any return required by this chapter shall be guilty of a violation and, upon
conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than six
hundred dollars ($600.00) and costs of prosecution, and, in default of payment
of such fine and costs, to imprisonment for not more than thirty days.  The
action to enforce the penalty herein prescribed may be instituted against any
person in charge of the business of any employer who shall have failed or who
refuses to file a return required by this chapter.

(Ord. 186.  Passed 5-24-35.)
1020.05  CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   (a)   Materials.  The paving and/or repaving, curbing and/or recurbing,
guttering and/or reguttering, shall be constructed of such cement-concrete
material, or of such other material, as shall meet with the approval of the
Township Board.
   (b)   Stone Curbs.  This type of curbing shall consist of granite or other
approved stone.  It shall be not less than five inches in width at the top, not
less than twenty-two inches in depth, and not more than eight feet, nor less
than four feet, in length.  The bottom of the stone curb preferably should be
two inches wider than the top.  The top surface shall be tool-dressed and with
a quarter-inch bevel.  The ends of the curb shall be cut square for the full
depth and width of the stone.  The front face of the curb shall be tool-dressed
to a point not less than eight inches below the top, and the back face shall be
tool-dressed to not less than three inches below the top.  All curved curbing
where the radius exceeds five feet shall be cut and dressed as specified for
straight stone curbing, except that the width at the top shall be six inches,
the width at the bottom eight inches, and the back face vertical and the front
face on a batter.  All stone curb radii under five feet shall be cut as a
corner stone where the top and front faces only shall be tool-dressed as
specified for straight curbing.  All joints on stone curbing shall be true and
straight and not exceeding one-quarter inch in width for a distance of twelve
inches below the top, and may be wider from this point to the bottom.  All
joints shall be filled and pointed with a stiff mortar composed of one part of
Portland cement and two parts of approved sand.  When indicated or directed,
drainage openings shall be made through the stone curbing at the elevation and
of the size required.  Any curbing required crossing the entrance to an alley,
driveway or private entranceway shall have the top finished two inches above
the outside edge or gutter line of the finished roadway pavement.
   (c)   Cement-Concrete Curbs.  These shall be of monolithic construction with
a width of six inches at the top and eight inches at the bottom, and with a
depth of twenty inches, and with no section exceeding ten feet in length.  The
back face shall be vertical.  Any curbing required crossing the entrance to an
alley, driveway or private entranceway shall have the top finished two inches
above the outside edge of the gutter line of the finished roadway pavement. 
When indicated or directed, drainage openings shall be made through the cement-
concrete curb at the elevation and of the size required.  The proportion of
Portland cement, clean sharp sand and three-quarter inch pebbles or stone used
in the curbing shall be 1:2:4, volumetric measuring.  When the temperature of
the air falls below forty degrees Fahrenheit, calcium chloride must be added to
the mix to insure quick set-up.  Its use shall be a proportion not exceeding
four percent of the cement used.  All curb corners shall be circular and have a
radius equal to the least width of the sidewalk area of the intersecting
streets.
   (d)   Excavation for Curb Subgrade.  Excavation for curb subgrade shall be
at a point not less than twenty inches from the top of the finished curb,
unless otherwise specified by the Township Engineer, in which case it may be
required that this excavation be increased a further depth of four inches and
refilled with a tamped layer of stone, gravel or cinders, due to unsuitable
conditions.  Backfilling around all curbing construction shall be hand-tamped
and grass plots and other adjacent areas shall be brought to a level not lower
than the top of the curbs.
   (e)   Curb Forms.  These shall be of such material and type as will meet
with the approval of the Township Engineer.
   (f)   Mixing of Cement-Concrete for Curbs.  The cement-concrete may be mixed
upon the site in such manner and by such method as shall meet with the approval
of the Township Engineer, or may be delivered on the job from a central mixing
plant, if the Engineer so approves.
   (g)   Excavations for Sidewalks.  The subgrade shall be excavated to a depth
of four inches below and parallel with the top of the finished pavement and
well compacted.  If, after excavation, the subgrade is found to be of
unsuitable material, then the Township Engineer may, at his of her discretion,
require additional excavation to a depth of not less than four inches, and its
replacement with cinders well compacted.
   (h)   Cement-Concrete for Sidewalks.  The ingredients for cement-concrete
for sidewalks shall be of the same proportions as provided for curbs.  The
concrete may be job mixed or supplied from a central mixing plant, and each
block of sidewalk shall be jointed not less than every four feet, with every
fourth joint opened to the subgrade and sandfilled upon withdrawal of the forms
and templets.  At street corners the sidewalk tangent shall be extended each
way across grass plots to the curved curb.  All sidewalks shall have a slope of
one-quarter inch per foot toward the curb.  All sidewalks shall be of
monolithic construction.
   (i)   Driveways.  All private driveways constructed across the sidewalk area
shall have the finished grade meet the finished grade of the sidewalk with the
ramp or approach beginning two inches above the gutter line of the roadway
pavement and terminating at the edge of the sidewalk closest to the curb.  Curb
returns are not required for this type of driveway approach.
   (j)   Gutters.  Cement-concrete gutters shall be six inches in depth, twenty
inches in width and jointed where possible every ten feet.  These shall be
constructed separately from the curbs, and the curb surface contacting the
gutter depth shall have a coat of asphalt paint prior to placement of cement-
concrete in the gutter.  The proportions of cement-concrete shall be one part
of Portland cement, two parts of clean sharp sand and three and one-half parts
of clean three-quarter inch commercial stone or pebbles.
(Ord. 186.  Passed 5-24-35.)
1020.06  CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   Excavating, laying, construction, form work, jointing and finishing of all
curbs, sidewalks, driveways and gutters shall be according to the best practice
and methods and in every case such as will meet with the approval of the
Township Engineer.  Every provision separately noted for curbs, sidewalks,
driveways and gutters, and applying under each or another classification, shall
be with as full force and effect as if set out at length in each such
classification of curbs, sidewalks, driveways and gutters. Any materials,
practices and methods to be employed in these classifications and not now
contemplated in these specifications may be put into effect or regulated by the
Township Engineer.
(Ord. 186.  Passed 5-24-35.)
1020.07  WIDTH OF SIDEWALKS; UNPAVED PORTIONS.
   The paved width of all sidewalks in the Township shall be not less than four
feet.  The width of the paved portion of the sidewalk area and the location
thereof shall be as directed by resolution of the Board of Commissioners, and
those parts not occupied by the paving shall be brought to the proper Township
grade and consist of a grass plot, the grass for the entire width to be
regulated at a height of not to exceed four inches.
(Ord. 186.  Passed 5-24-35.)
1020.08  PERMIT REQUIRED; ESTABLISHMENT OF LINES AND GRADES; CERTIFICATE OF
COMPLIANCE; FEE; EFFECTIVE PERIOD.
   No sidewalk shall be constructed or reconstructed, or any grading, paving or
repaving done to the same, and no gutters or curbs shall be constructed or
corrected, until the owner or owners of the ground, or the person having charge
of the work, shall first have obtained a permit for the same from the Secretary
of the Board of Commissioners.  The permit shall be placed, by the party
applying for the same, in the hands of the Township Engineer, who shall furnish
the said person with the established lines and grades, for which services he or
she shall receive his or her proper charge from the Board of Commissioners.
   When the work set forth in the said permit has been fully completed, a
certificate that the work has been properly done, and that the plans,
regulations, requirements and ordinances of the Township have been complied
with, shall be procured from the Township Engineer by the party applying for
the above-mentioned permit, and endorsed on the permit, and returned to the
Secretary of the Board of Commissioners, provided that if, in the judgment of
the Township Engineer, such construction or reconstruction, grading, paving,
repairing or repaving of any sidewalk shall be inexpedient or dangerous because
of the existing grade of the street or of the contiguous sidewalk, such permit
shall not be issued, or if issued shall be canceled by the Township Engineer,
and the fee therefor returned to the applicant.  The cost of each permit shall
be thirty-five dollars ($35.00), which shall be paid into the Township Treasury
for the use of the Township.  No permit shall be valid after sixty days from
the date of issue.
1020.09  REMEDY OF TOWNSHIP UPON OWNER'S FAILURE TO GRADE, PAVE OR REPAIR
SIDEWALKS, CURBS OR GUTTERS.
   If any person shall neglect or refuse to grade, pave, repave or repair any
sidewalk, or to construct, correct or repair any curb, or to keep the same in
repair, pursuant to notice given as above mentioned, for a period of thirty
days after the receipt of such notice, or service of the same as hereinbefore
provided, the Township Board of Commissioners shall forthwith cause such
grading, paving, repaving and repairing of sidewalks, and such constructing,
correcting and repairing of curbs and gutters, to be done by contract, and the

1042.01  ESTABLISHMENT OF SYSTEM; CONSTRUCTION; EXTENSIONS; INJURY.
   (a)   A system of sewers and drainage is hereby established and ordained to
be constructed for the Township for the purpose of disposing of domestic
drainage and sewage by disposal plants, or by a direct line of sewers to
tidewater, or by incineration, or by any other form of disposal that the Board
of Commissioners may hereafter set forth.  The location of the sewers for that
purpose shall be along and within the lines, as far as practicable, of the
public roads of the Township within the territory designated as shown upon a
plan or map filed this day in the office of the Board of Commissioners, which
plan is hereby made a part of this chapter by reference.
   (b)   The Committee on Sewers and Drainage is hereby directed to cause to be
prepared detailed specifications for the construction of said system of sewers,
and thereupon to advertise for proposals for the construction of the same, or
for any specified parts or sections thereof upon said specifications, and
subject to such conditions as the Committee may prescribe, provided that it may
be stipulated that the construction of said sewers shall in all particulars,
both as to material and workmanship, be subject to the inspection and approval
of an engineer to be appointed by the Board, and further provided that it shall
be stipulated that the Board reserves the right to reject any and all
proposals.  The Committee shall submit to the Board all the proposals received
and shall also submit a recommendation as to which of the proposals should, in
the judgment of the Committee, be accepted.
   (c)   The advertisement provided for in this section shall be inserted in at
least one newspaper of general circulation in the City of Philadelphia, and in
such other newspapers as the Committee may select, and the expenses of said
advertisement shall be paid by the Township Treasurer on the order of the
Committee certifying to the correctness of the bills for the same.
   (d)   The system of sewers and drainage hereby established and designated on
the maps or plans, which are hereby made a part of this chapter, shall be laid,
as far as practicable, along and within the lines of the public roads of the
Township as on said plans designated, and where such system diverges from such
public roads, as shown on the plans, and passes through private property, the
consent of the owners of such private property shall be first obtained if
possible, and if not, such sewerage system shall be constructed through private
property after providing for compensation in accordance with the Act of
Assembly in such case made and provided.
   (e)   The extension of the system of sewers and drainage, hereby
established, so as to cover additional portions of the Township, shall be
hereafter, from time to time, adopted and approved by the Board of Township
Commissioners, and when such extensions and additions have been thus approved
and ordained, the same shall become a part of the system of sewers and drainage
hereby established.
   (f)   No person shall injure, break or remove any portion of a sewer, pipe
or inlet or other property belonging to the sewer and drainage system, or
obstruct the mouth of any sewer or drain connection with a sewer, or interfere
with the work of construction of said sewer and drainage system, or injure any
of the material during construction or after completion.
   (g)   Provision for the construction of a system of sewers and drainage,
hereby established, shall be fixed hereafter by ordinance or contract, and the
same also shall be done for the disposal of the sewage and drainage collected
within the Township, or for carrying the same beyond the limits thereof, as
hereafter shall be determined.
(Ord. 19.  Passed 6-6-16.)
1042.02  CONNECTIONS REQUIRED; CONNECTION BY TOWNSHIP; COSTS.
   (a)   Whenever any sewer of the Township is completed and ready for use by
the public, it shall be the duty of every owner of land abutting on the street,
road, alley or highway in which the sewer has been laid to connect with said
sewer all buildings on his or her land requiring drainage, and the drain from
said buildings shall be cast into said sewer.
   (b)   If any owner of said land fails, neglects or refuses for thirty days
to connect his or her building with said sewer as provided in subsection (a)
hereof after notice to do so from the Clerk of the Township Commissioners has
been served upon him or her personally or left upon the premises with an adult
member of the family residing therein, the said Township may cause the said
connection to be made and the costs thereof to be collected from the said owner
or from the said property as provided by law.  Said remedy shall be in addition
to the penalty provided in Section
1042.99.
(Ord. 108.  Passed 7-2-20.)
1042.03  ASSESSMENTS.
   (a)   Allocation of Charges.  Each lot abutting on a Township sewer shall be
charged with its due share of the cost of such sewer reckoned in proportion to
its frontage thereon, provided that:
      (1)   Any lot which abuts on two sewers shall be allowed an exemption on
150 feet on one or the other of said sewers.
      (2)   No charge shall be made against property when the physical
conditions are such that, in the judgment of the Committee on Health and
Drainage, the sewer cannot be made available for carrying off domestic drainage
therefrom.
   (b)   Calculation.  The Committee on Health and Drainage shall cause a
calculation of such assessments to be made and a schedule therefor to be
prepared, giving the total length of the sewer in feet, and the total cost
thereof, the frontage of each lot abutting on the sewer and the amount of the
assessment charged thereon, and the name of the owner of such lot, which
schedule shall be certified by the chairperson of the said Committee and filed
with the Township Secretary as soon as conveniently may be done after the
construction of the sewer.
   (c)   Collection.  The said assessment shall be collected in the manner
provided by existing Township law, and Municipal liens shall be filed in the
name of the Township against all properties on which the assessments shall not
be duly paid as required by law.
   (d)   Charge for Future Connections.  If at any time it shall be the desire
of any property owner to connect with the sewer a property which has been
exempted from charge for such sewer under the provisions of subsection (a)
hereof, he or she shall pay such charge, not exceeding the full frontage
charge, as shall be determined by the Committee on Health and Drainage.
   (e)   Payment.  The owner of any lot or piece of ground charged with an
assessment under any of the provisions of this section shall have the privilege
of paying the said assessment in ten equal annual installments to be paid
within sixty days from the date of the bills sent out for the same, provided
that notice of intention to exercise such option shall be given on a blank to
be prepared by the Committee on Health and Drainage, which may contain such
stipulation as said Committee shall require, which notice shall be filed with
the Township Treasurer at the time of paying the first installment, and
provided further that in every such case a Municipal lien shall be filed for so
much of the assessment as remains unpaid.
1042.04  DEPOSITS OF GARBAGE, ETC., INTO SANITARY SYSTEM; RESPONSIBILITY OF
OWNERS AND OCCUPANTS; VIOLATIONS; AUTHORITY OF BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS.
   (a)   No garbage or kitchen or household refuse, whether whole, ground,

permitted to enter, the Lower Chichester Township sanitary sewer system, nor
any laterals thereof, nor any plumbing system connected therewith, unless
permitted by resolution of the Board of Health.
   (b)   Consideration shall be given by the Board of Health to owners and
occupiers of buildings where such refuse has heretofore emptied into said sewer
system my means of electric disposal units.
   (c)   The owner, tenant, occupier or possessor of any building with plumbing
connected to the Lower Chichester sanitary sewer shall be responsible for the
use of said plumbing and sewerage connections.
   (d)   Upon conviction of anyone for any prohibited use of the plumbing in
any building connected with the sanitary sewer system, the Board of
Commissioners shall have the power, upon five days notice to the owner, tenant,
occupier or possessor of said building, to enter said building and disconnect
any fixture used in connection with said prohibited use, and the cost of said
disconnection shall be paid by the owner, tenant, occupier or possessor of said
building.  Such remedy shall be in addition to the penalty provided in Section
1042.99.
(Ord. 294.  Passed 7-18-55.)
1042.05  DISCHARGE OF STORM WATER INTO SANITARY SEWERS.

1042.06  ANNUAL SEWER RENTAL CHARGE; EXEMPTION.
   (a)   For the year beginning March 16, 1959, and each calendar year
thereafter, there is hereby imposed an annual rental or charge upon the owners
of all properties in the Townships of Lower Chichester and Upper Chichester
served, or to be served, for the use of the sewers, the sewer system and a
sewage treatment plant, and for the use of extensions thereof.
   (b)   The total amount of annual sewer rental or charge shall be a sum
sufficient to pay the following:
      (1)   The amount expended annually in the operation, maintenance, repair,
alteration, inspection, depreciation or other expense in relation to such
sewers, sewer system, pumping station or sewage treatment works.
      (2)   Such annual amount as may be necessary to provide for the
amortization of the indebtedness incurred or of the nondebt revenue bonds or
other bonds issued by the Township in the construction or acquisition of such
sewer, sewerage system or sewage treatment works, and interest thereon, in
order that said improvement may become self-liquidating, or as may be
sufficient to pay the amount agreed to be paid annually under the terms of any
contract with any authority or municipality furnishing sewage disposal or
treatment services to the Township.
      (3)   An amount sufficient to establish a margin of safety of ten
percent.
   (c)   The annual sewer rental rate shall be on a unit basis, the amount or
rate per unit to be determined by dividing the total amount of rental, as
provided in subsection (b) hereof, by the number of units in the Township.  The
Board of Township Commissioners shall annually adopt an ordinance which shall
compute the total amount of rental to be collected, the total number of sewer
rental units in the Township and the amount or rate per sewer rental unit to be
charged for the ensuing year.
   (d)   The sewer rental for each dwelling unit connected directly or
indirectly to the Township sewer system shall be at the rate of one unit per
year.  Buildings containing more than one dwelling unit shall be charged for
each of such dwelling units and the total of such charges for the building
shall be the aggregate of the numbers of dwelling units therein at the rate of
one unit per dwelling unit.
   In cases of use and occupancy of buildings or parts of buildings for
purposes other than dwellings, the number of units shall be computed by the
Board of Commissioner so that such establishments shall pay a sewer rental
substantially proportionate to the rental charged for dwelling units.  The
minimum annual charge for sewer rental shall be not less than the rate for one
unit for each establishment.  In all cases where connection to the sewer system
is made after January 1 of the current or any other year, the rental or charge
shall be apportionable into quarters, and the property owner shall pay for the
current and for all succeeding quarters.
   In all cases in which the above rates are not exactly applicable, the Board
of Commissioner shall fix applicable rats with the same force and effect as if
set forth herein.
   (e)   The Township Tax Collector is hereby designated as the collector of
sewer rentals for the Township of Lower Chichester.  On or before June 1 of
each year, the Board of Commissioners shall execute a warrant authorizing the
Tax Collector to collect the sewer rental and shall certify to the Tax
Collector the number of sewer rental units and the amount of sewer rental to be
collected from the owner of each property connected to the Township sewer
system.  The Tax Collector shall give notice of such sewer rental charges to
respective property owners on the regular Township tax bill.
   All payments of sewer rental shall be subject to the same discount and
penalty as applicable to the Township real estate tax for the ensuing year. 
The Tax Collector shall make a monthly report on or before the tenth day of
each month, to the Board of Commissioners, of all amount collected by him or
her and shall remit all such collections from the preceding month to the
Township Treasurer, with said report.  The compensation of the Tax Collector,
and the Collector's bond for the collection of the sewer rental charges, shall
be fixed by ordinance annually.
   All sewer rentals or charges not paid on or before the first Monday of May
of the following year, shall be deemed to be delinquent, and the Tax Collector
shall file with the Board of Commissioners a complete list of all unpaid sewer
rentals or charges and it shall be the duty of the Township Treasurer to
certify the unpaid bills to the Township Solicitor, who shall proceed to
collect such delinquent sewer rentals, together with penalties and cost accrued
thereon, either by action at law or by filing a lien or liens for the same, in
accordance with law.
(Ord. 325.  Passed 3-16-59.)
   (f)   All churches or other regular places of stated worship are hereby
exempt from the annual sewer rental charge levied under subsections (a) through
(e) hereof for the year 1966 and thereafter.

ARTICLE I - GENERAL PROVISIONS
1044.01  SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the " Lower Chichester
Township Stormwater Management Ordinance."
(Ord. 2004-03A.  Passed 7-19-04.)
1044.02  STATEMENT OF FINDINGS.
   The governing body of the Municipality finds that:
   (a)   Stormwater runoff from lands modified by human activities threatens
public health and safety by causing decreased infiltration of rainwater and
increased runoff flows and velocities, which overtax the carrying capacity of
existing streams and storm sewers, and greatly increases the cost to the public
to manage stormwater.
   (b)   Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from
land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface
water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns, accelerating
stream flows (which increase scour and erosion of stream-beds and stream-banks
thereby elevating sedimentation), destroying aquatic habitat and elevating
aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients,
heavy metals and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted through
loss of recharge.
   (c)   A program of stormwater management, including reasonable regulation of
land development and redevelopment causing loss of natural infiltration, is
fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare, and the protection of the
people of the Municipality and all the people of the Commonwealth, their
resources, and the environment.
   (d)   Stormwater can be an important water resource by providing groundwater
recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams, which also protects and
maintains surface water quality.
   (e)   Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
   (f)   Federal and State regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are required
to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer
systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).
   (g)   Non-stormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of waters of the Commonwealth by the Municipality.
(Ord. 2004-03A.  Passed 7-19-04.)
1044.03  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
the Municipality and its watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing the
benefits described in Section
1044.02, through provisions designed to:
   (a)   Manage stormwater runoff impacts at their source by regulating
activities that cause the problems.
   (b)   Provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
   (c)   Utilize and preserve the existing natural drainage systems as much as
possible.
   (d)   Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, which requires a
minimum of structures and relies on natural processes.
   (e)   Focus on infiltration of stormwater, to maintain groundwater recharge,
to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to otherwise
protect water resources.
   (f)   Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses.
   (g)   Meet legal water quality requirements under State law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93.4a to protect and maintain "existing
uses" and maintain the level of water quality to support those uses in all
streams, and to protect and maintain water quality in "special protection"
streams.
   (h)   Prevent scour and erosion of streambanks and streambeds.
   (i)   Provide for proper operations and maintenance of all permanent
stormwater management BMPs that are implemented in the Municipality.
   (j)   Provide a mechanism to identify controls necessary to meet the NPDES
permit requirements.
   (k)   Implement an illegal discharge detection and elimination program to
address non-stormwater discharges into the Municipality's separate storm sewer
system.
(Ord. 2004-03A.  Passed 7-19-04.)
1044.04  STATUTORY AUTHORITY.
   The Municipality is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect
stormwater impacts by the authority of 53 P.S. Section 55101 et seq. and/or the
Municipalities Planning Code — 53 P.S. Section 10101 et seq.
(Ord. 2004-03A.  Passed 7-19-04.)
1044.05  APPLICABILITY.
   (a)   This chapter applies to any regulated earth disturbance activities
within the Municipality, and all stormwater runoff entering into the
Municipality's separate storm sewer system from lands within the boundaries of
the Municipality.
   (b)   Earth disturbance activities and associated stormwater management
controls are also regulated under existing State law and implementing
regulations.  This chapter shall operate in coordination with those parallel
requirements; the requirements of this chapter shall be no less restrictive in
meeting the purposes of this chapter than State law.
(Ord. 2004-03A.  Passed 7-19-04.)
1044.06  COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Approvals issued and actions taken under this chapter do not relieve
the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for

ARTICLE II - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FOR WATER QUALITY
1044.08  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT.
   (a)   All regulated earth disturbance activities within the Municipality
shall be designed, implemented, operated and maintained to meet the purposes of
this chapter, through these two elements:
      (1)   Erosion and sediment control during the earth disturbance
activities (e.g., during construction); and
      (2)   Water quality protection measures after completion of earth
disturbance activities (e.g., after construction), including operations and
maintenance.
   (b)   No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Municipality
shall commence until the requirements of this chapter are met.
   (c)   Erosion and sediment control during regulated earth disturbance
activities shall be addressed as required by Section
1044.10.
   (d)   Post-construction water quality protection shall be addressed as
required by Section
1044.11.  Operations and maintenance of permanent stormwater BMPs shall be
addressed as required by Article III.
   (e)   All Best Management Practices (BMPs) used to meet the requirements of
this chapter shall conform to the State water quality requirements, and any
more stringent requirements as determined by the Municipality.
   (f)   Techniques described in Appendix A (Low Impact Development) of this
chapter are encouraged, because they reduce the costs of complying with the
requirements of this chapter and the State water quality requirements.
(Ord. 2004-03A.  Passed 7-19-04.)
1044.09  PERMIT REQUIREMENTS BY OTHER GOVERNMENT ENTITIES.
   The following permit requirements may apply to certain regulated earth
disturbance activities, and must be met prior to commencement of regulated
earth disturbance activities, as applicable:
   (a)   All regulated earth disturbance activities subject to permit
requirements by DEP under regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102.
   (b)   Work within natural drainageways subject to permit by DEP under 25 Pa.
Code Chapter 105.
   (c)   Any stormwater management facility that would be located in or
adjacent to surface waters of the Commonwealth, including wetlands, subject to
permit by DEP under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105.
   (d)   Any stormwater management facility that would be located on a State
highway right-of-way, or require access from a State highway, shall be subject
to approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PENNDOT).

pass or convey flows from the tributary area and any facility which may
constitute a dam subject to permit by DEP under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105.
(Ord. 2004-03A.  Passed 7-19-04.)
1044.10  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL DURING REGULATED EARTH DISTURBANCE
ACTIVITIES.
   (a)   No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Municipality
shall commence until approval by the Municipality of an erosion and sediment
control plan for construction activities.
   (b)   DEP has regulations that require an erosion and sediment control plan
for any earth disturbance activity of 5,000 square feet or more, under 25 Pa
Code § 102.4(b).
   (c)   In addition, under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 92, a DEP "NPDES Construction
Activities" permit is required for regulated earth disturbance activities.
   (d)   Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate DEP regional office or County Conservation
District must be provided to the Municipality.  The issuance of an NPDES
Construction Permit (or permit coverage under the Statewide General Permit
(PAG-2) satisfies the requirements of subsection (a) hereof.
   (e)   A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan and any required
permit, as required by DEP regulations, shall be available at the project site
at all times.
(Ord. 2004-03A.  Passed 7-19-04.)
1044.11  WATER QUALITY REQUIREMENTS AFTER REGULATED EARTH DISTURBANCE
ACTIVITIES ARE COMPLETE.
   (a)   No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Municipality
shall commence until approval by the Municipality of a plan which demonstrates
compliance with State water quality requirements after construction is
complete.
   (b)   The BMPs must be designed, implemented and maintained to meet State
water quality requirements, and any other more stringent requirements as
determined by the Municipality.
   (c)   To control post-construction stormwater impacts from regulated earth
disturbance activities, State water quality requirements can be met by BMPs,
including site design, which provide for replication of pre-construction
stormwater infiltration and runoff conditions, so that post-construction
stormwater discharges do not degrade the physical, chemical or biological
characteristics of the receiving waters.  As described in the DEP Comprehensive
Stormwater Management Policy (#392-0300-002, September 28, 2002), this may be
achieved by the following:
      (1)   Infiltration: replication of pre-construction stormwater
infiltration conditions;
      (2)   Treatment: use of water quality treatment BMPs to ensure filtering
out of the chemical and physical pollutants from the stormwater runoff; and
      (3)   Streambank and streambed protection: management of volume and rate
of post-construction stormwater discharges to prevent physical degradation of
receiving waters (e.g., from scouring).
   (d)   DEP has regulations that require municipalities to ensure design,
implementation and maintenance of Best Management Practices ("BMPs") that
control runoff from new development and redevelopment after regulated earth
disturbance activities are complete.  These requirements include the need to
implement post-construction stormwater BMPs with assurance of long-term
operations and maintenance of those BMPs.
   (e)   Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate DEP regional office must be provided to the
Municipality. The issuance of an NPDES construction permit (or permit coverage
under the Statewide General Permit (PAG-2) satisfies the requirements of
subsection (a) hereof.
   (f)   BMP operations and maintenance requirements are described in Article
III of this chapter.

APPENDIX A
LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES
ALTERNATIVE APPROACH FOR MANAGING STORMWATER RUNOFF
Natural hydrologic conditions may be altered radically by poorly planned
development practices, such as introducing unneeded impervious surfaces,
destroying existing drainage swales, constructing unnecessary storm sewers, and
changing local topography. A traditional drainage approach of development has
been to remove runoff from a site as quickly as possible and capture it in a
detention basin. This approach leads ultimately to the degradation of water
quality as well as expenditure of additional resources for detaining and
managing concentrated runoff at some downstream location.
The recommended alternative approach is to promote practices that will minimize
post-development runoff rates and volumes, which will minimize needs for
artificial conveyance and storage facilities. To simulate pre-development
hydrologic conditions, forced infiltration is often necessary to offset the
loss of infiltration by creation of impervious surfaces.  The ability of the
ground to infiltrate depends upon the soil types and its conditions.
Preserving natural hydrologic conditions requires careful alternative site
design considerations.  Site design practices include preserving natural
drainage features, minimizing impervious surface area, reducing the hydraulic
connectivity of impervious surfaces, and protecting natural depression
storage.  A well-designed site will contain a mix of all those features.  The
following describes various techniques to achieve the alternative approach:
Preserving Natural Drainage Features.  Protecting natural drainage features,
particularly vegetated drainage swales and channels, is desirable because of
their ability to infiltrate and attenuate flows and to filter pollutants.
However, this objective is often not accomplished in land development.  In
fact, commonly held drainage philosophy encourages just the opposite pattern —
streets and adjacent storm sewers typically are located in the natural
headwater valleys and swales, thereby replacing natural drainage functions with
a completely impervious system. As a result, runoff and pollutants generated
from impervious surfaces flow directly into storm sewers with no opportunity
for attenuation, infiltration, or filtration. Developments designed to fit site
topography also minimizes the amount of grading on site.
Protecting Natural Depression Storage Areas.  Depressional storage areas have
no surface outlet, or drain very slowly following a storm event. They can be
commonly seen as ponded areas in farm fields during the wet season or after
large runoff events. Traditional development practices eliminate these
depressions by filling or draining, thereby obliterating their ability to
reduce surface runoff volumes and trap pollutants. The volume and release-rate
characteristics of depressions should be protected in the design of the
development site. The depressions can be protected by simply avoiding the
depression or by incorporating its storage as additional capacity in required
detention facilities.
Avoiding introduction of impervious areas.  Careful site planning should
consider reducing impervious coverage to the maximum extent possible. Building
footprints, sidewalks, driveways and other features producing impervious
surfaces should be evaluated to minimize impacts on runoff.
Reducing the Hydraulic Connectivity of Impervious Surfaces.  Impervious
surfaces are significantly less of a problem if they are not directly connected
to an impervious conveyance system (such as storm sewer). Two basic ways to
reduce hydraulic connectivity are routing of roof runoff over lawns and
reducing the use of storm sewers.  Site grading should promote increasing
travel time of stormwater runoff, and should help reduce concentration of
runoff to a single point in the development.
Routing Roof Runoff Over Lawns.  Roof runoff can be easily routed over lawns in
most site designs.  The practice discourages direct connections of downspouts
to storm sewers or parking lots. The practice also discourages sloping
driveways and parking lots to the street. By routing roof drains and crowning
the driveway to run off to the lawn, the lawn is essentially used as a filter
strip.
Reducing the Use of Storm Sewers.  By reducing use of storm sewers for draining
streets, parking lots, and back yards, the potential for accelerating runoff
from the development can be greatly reduced.  The practice requires greater use
of swales and may not be practical for some development sites, especially if
there are concerns for areas that do not drain in a "reasonable" time.  The
practice requires educating local citizens and public works officials, who
expect runoff to disappear shortly after a rainfall event.
Reducing Street Widths.  Street widths can be reduced by either eliminating on-
street parking or by reducing roadway widths.  Municipal planners and traffic
designers should encourage narrower neighborhood streets which ultimately could
lower maintenance.
Limiting Sidewalks to One Side of the Street. A sidewalk on one side of the
street may suffice in low-traffic neighborhoods. The lost sidewalk could be
replaced with bicycle/recreational trails that follow back-of-lot lines. Where
appropriate, backyard trails should be constructed using pervious materials.
Using Permeable Paving Materials.  These materials include permeable
interlocking concrete paving blocks or porous bituminous concrete. Such
materials should be considered as alternatives to conventional pavement
surfaces, especially for low use surfaces such as driveways, overflow parking
lots, and emergency access roads.
Reducing Building Setbacks.  Reducing building setbacks reduces driveway and
entry walks and is most readily accomplished along low-traffic streets where
traffic noise is not a problem.
Constructing Cluster Developments.  Cluster developments can also reduce the
amount of impervious area for a given number of lots. The biggest savings is in
street length, which also will reduce costs of the development. Cluster
development clusters the construction activity onto less-sensitive areas
without substantially affecting the gross density of development.
In summary, a careful consideration of the existing topography and
implementation of a combination of the above mentioned techniques may avoid
contraction of costly stormwater control measures.  Other benefits include
reduced potential of downstream flooding, water quality degradation of
receiving streams/water bodies and enhancement of aesthetics and reduction of
development costs.  Beneficial results include more stable baseflows in
receiving streams, improved groundwater recharge, reduced flood flows, reduced
pollutant loads, and reduced costs for conveyance and storage.

waste described in subsection (a) hereof upon completion and commencement of
operation of the plant in accordance with a contract with the contractor,
containing terms satisfactory to the County and providing for construction and

   (c)   The term of this Agreement shall be for a period of twenty-five years,
and said term shall commence on the date the County advises the Municipality

generally accepted by the other municipalities in delivering Municipal solid
waste to the County during the term of this Agreement, provided that the
Municipality has first obtained final approval from the Department of
Environmental Resources for its own plan under the Act or an approval from the
Department for a modification that brings the Municipality under another plan

any such termination of this Agreement by the Municipality, the County, the
Authority and/or the County's contractor shall be relieved of any
responsibility to accept and dispose of Municipal solid waste generated within
the Municipality.  It is further understood that any such termination of this
Agreement by the Municipality shall constitute a repeal, whether express or
implied, of Section

suit, claim or action challenging the legality of this chapter against the

selected modern, non-nuisance, commercial and light industrial establishments

hazard or a nuisance to the population of the adjacent areas and which would
contribute to the continuation of appropriate development within and adjacent
to the District and to discourage the use of land for residences in order to
preserve the area for its appropriate use and also to prevent the location of
residences in an area inappropriate for residential use.

If the Board of Commissioners finds that a good reason exists for the failure
to comply with the time periods specified above, an extension may be granted.
      (7)   The grant of approval by the Board of Commissioners for a

   (a)   On and after the adoption of this Building and Housing Code, it shall
be the duty of the Building Inspector to examine all plans and specifications
for any proposed new building or structure or alterations or additions to
present buildings or structures, and to grant a permit therefor within fifteen
days from the date of such application, if the plans and specifications meet
the requirements of this Building and Housing Code or any amendments thereto.
If the plans and specifications do not meet said requirements, or are so
indefinite as to not explain the nature of the work to be done, the Building
Inspector shall refuse to issue a permit therefor.
   (b)   The Building Inspector shall keep copies of all applications, plans
and specifications, and shall make a record of all permits and refusals. After
a permit has been granted, it shall be his or her duty to make an inspection of

done in accordance with the application, plans and specifications, he or she
shall order the work stopped at once, and then require the removal and proper
replacement of such parts as are in violation of this Building and Housing
Code, and shall not allow the work to proceed except upon a written agreement
of the contractor or owner that the work so condemned will be removed and
properly rebuilt. The said contractor or owner shall have the right to appeal

Inspector, upon a refusal of the contractor, owner or agent to take immediate
measures to insure safety to such adjacent property or to the general public,
shall notify the Township Commissioners of the necessity of action and, upon
their instructions, shall have the power to enter upon the premises and take
such measures as are necessary for safety, the expense of such work be charged
against the owner or agent of the property, collectible as such debts are now

perform the duties as above set forth, will be just cause for his or her
removal from the office of Building Inspector. He or she shall also report to

the provisions hereof, may appeal to the Board of Township Commissioners by
giving to the Building Inspector and the Secretary of the Board of
Commissioners notice in writing that he or she does so appeal. If the appeal

to take down or remove a dangerous building or structure or dangerous wall or
walls, it shall be taken within three days from the issuing of such orders, and

1466.19  IDENTIFICATION OF FLOOD-PRONE AREAS.
   The identified flood-prone area shall be any areas of the Township of Lower
Chichester subject to the 100-year flood, which are identified as areas of
special flood hazard (Zone A) on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and the
Flood Insurance Study (FIS) prepared for the Township by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), effective November 18, 2009, or the most recent
revision thereof as issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Including all digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study.
(Ord. 92-16. Passed 9-21-92; Ord. 2009-04. Passed 10-19-09.)
1466.20  DESCRIPTION OF FLOOD-PRONE AREAS.
   The identified flood-prone areas shall consist of the following specific
areas:
   (a)   FW (Floodway Area) - the areas identified as "Floodway" in the AE Zone
in the Flood Insurance Study prepared by the FEMA. The term shall also include
floodway areas which have been identified in other available studies or sources
of information for those floodplain areas where no floodway has been identified
in the Flood Insurance Study.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the floodway is based upon the criteria
that a certain area within the floodplain would be capable of carrying the
waters of the 100-year flood without increasing the water surface elevation of
that flood more than one foot at any point.
   (b)   FF (Flood-Fringe Area") - the remaining portions of the 100-year
floodplain in those areas identified as an AE Zone in the Flood Insurance
Study, where a floodway has been delineated.
   The basis for the outermost boundary of this area shall be the 100-year
flood elevations as shown in the flood profiles contained in the Flood
Insurance Study.
   (c)   FA (General Floodplain Area) - the areas identified as Zone A in the
FIS for which no 100-year flood elevations have been provided. When available,
information from other Federal, State and other acceptable sources shall be
used to determine the 100-year elevation, as well as a floodway area, if
possible. When no other information is available, the 100-year elevation shall
be determined by using a point on the boundary of the identified floodplain
area which is nearest the construction site in question.
      In lieu of the above, the Municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional
engineers or other of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the
technical methods that are employed correctly reflect currently accepted
technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted
in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Township,
(Ord. 92-17. Passed 12-21-92; Ord. 2009-04. Passed 10-19-09.)

1482.01  FOUNDATION WALLS.
   (a)   All foundation walls shall be constructed of stone or pebble cement-
concrete, stone or pebble concrete blocks, stone or brick. If built on the
ground they must be on a solid bottom and at least three feet below the surface
of the finished grade. Where, in the opinion of the Building Inspector, the
soil is unsuitable for the foregoing provisions, he or she may require the
further extension in depth of such foundation walls until suitable soil is
reached, or require the foregoing foundation walls to rest on a spread-footing
of such dimensions as he or she shall deem necessary.
   (b)   Where enclosing cellars or an excavation, foundation walls shall start
at a point at least twelve inches below the finished cellar or excavation floor
level. All cellars shall have a vertical clearance of seven feet between the
finished floor level and the bottom of the first floor joists.
   (c)   Foundation walls must be carried to the top of first floor joists, or
beams, and filled to full width except in buildings of frame construction.
However, for small one-story buildings or private garages without basements,
foundation walls shall be constructed of such materials, depth and thickness as
may be approved by the Building Inspector.  In no case shall foundation walls
be less than eight inches in thickness nor less than eighteen inches in depth.
   Cement-blocks or brick must be constructed of standard cement as follows:
materials, one part cement, one and one-half parts sharp sand, two and one-half
parts crushed stone, gravel or slag.
   (d)   In all cases where, in the opinion of the Building Inspector, the soil
is not sufficiently solid to bear the weight of the construction, and where it
has been determined by the said Building Inspector that a spreadfooting shall
be built, then such footing shall be constructed of stone or brick laid in
cement mortar, or of stone or pebble cement-concrete, with or without steel
reinforcement. The design of footings shall be such that the loads sustained
per unit of area shall be as nearly uniform as possible and within the bearing
capacities of soil set forth in the following table, to wit:
 
Soft clay                                            1 ton per sq. ft.
Firm clay, fine sand or layers of sand and clay, wet 2 ton per sq. ft.
Clay or fine sand, firm and dry                      3 ton per sq. ft.
Hard clay, course sand, gravel, dry                  4 ton per sq.
Hard pan                                             8 to 16 ton per sq. ft.
Hard rock                                            30 ton per sq. ft.
 
   (e)   In case of doubt as to the bearing capacity, tests shall be made and
the footings designed accordingly. Whenever such tests shall be required by the
Building Inspector, the same shall be made under his or her direction and the
cost therefor borne by the permittee.
