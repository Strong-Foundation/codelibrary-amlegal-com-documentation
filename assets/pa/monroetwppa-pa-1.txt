§ 10.07 CODE ENFORCEMENT POLICY.
   (A)   As of February 16, 1997, Act 172 of 1996 of the Pennsylvania Second
Class Township Code was changed. Incorporated within this change was a section
which provides mandatory criminal enforcement for ordinances regulating
building, housing, property maintenance, health, fire, public safety, parking,
solicitation, curfew, water, air, and noise pollution violations. With these
changes in enforcement an authority in the Second Class Township Code, the
township attempts to obtain compliance with the township ordinances through
verbal and written communication with the alleged violator rather than fining
immediately for punishment. This type of enforcement emphasis is called
voluntary compliance.
   (B)   When an enforcement policy is adhered to by the Zoning and Codes
Enforcement Officer, voluntary compliance can be achieved. This enforcement
policy is intended to provide guidance for enforcement, but this policy can be
deviated or modified to fit the needs of obtaining compliance, especially when
violations exist that are a serious danger to life, health, and safety. Many
citizens are unaware that they have committed a violation. With voluntary
compliance, using an oral and written warning system, the Zoning and Codes
Enforcement Officer is likely to obtain compliance without setting in motion
formal sanctions such as issuing an enforcement notice, filing a summary non-
traffic citation or civil complaint form with the local District Judge upon the
alleged violator. The following enforcement procedure is typically how the
township and the Zoning and Codes Enforcement Officer will attempt to gain
compliance.
      (1)   Oral warning is given, via telephone call (if the phone number is
known) or by on-site meeting when possible and if the violation is not serious.
If an oral warning is not possible, then the Zoning Officer proceeds to the
next step.
      (2)   A formal inspection report is given either by an on-site meeting or
sent by certified mail with a violation warning letter. The inspection report
will give specific deadline dates in order for the violator to come into
compliance with township ordinances. The inspection report documents site
conditions, type and nature of violation(s), and other pertinent information
required by the officer to properly conduct the inspection. If deadlines are
not met for compliance, then the Zoning Officer proceeds to the next step.
      (3)   A civil enforcement notice (EN) is then sent to the owner of the
property if violations continue to exist past the deadline date given in the
inspection report or warning letter. Official cease and desist orders of the
violations or suspension or revocation of current permits may be included
within the EN. The owner at this time has a chance to appeal the alleged
violations to the Zoning Hearing Board. The Zoning Hearing Board does not have
enforcement authority to levy fines. The purpose of the Zoning Hearing Board is
to either affirm or deny violations to the Zoning Hearing Board within the
deadline stated in the EN, then the Zoning Officer will proceed to the next
step.
      (4)   Filing a summary non-traffic citation or a civil complaint form
with the office of the local District Judge is the next step. It is the policy
of the township to seek the maximum fine allowed by the law for each violation,
each day that the violation exists ($1,000 per day per violation). All court
costs plus legal expenses incurred by the township to try to obtain compliance
will also be included in the final determination of the cost of the fine.
Should the owner appeal the District Judge’s decision, the cost of the fine
will be raised by the township to the maximum extent allowed by law in the
County Court of Common Pleas, plus court costs and legal fees. It is the goal
of the township however not to take any case this far unless all methods of
voluntary compliance have failed. In certain circumstances where there is a
continuing violation existing that is a serious threat and danger to life,
health, and safety of the adjoining properties or individuals, an injunction
may be filed by the township to abate the violation. This is a costly procedure
for the township and usually will be used as a last resort to achieve
compliance. Also, if the injunction is ignored, the owner may be held in
contempt of court. This enforcement policy has been instituted to provide a
fair and reasonable method for obtaining compliance. Along with this policy,
the Township Zoning and Codes Enforcement Officer will only respond to non-
structural items such as noise, lighting, and environmental issues by written
complaint.

amended, with the express purpose of having the system administer the Pension
Plan established for the municipal employees of the township. The township does

can answer any questions they have of about the township. If the individual
does not need assistance, the employee should return to their normal duties.

§ 32.017 REQUIREMENTS FOR REQUESTS FOR TAXPAYER INFORMATION.
   (A)   Minimum time periods for taxpayer response.
      (1)   The taxpayer shall have at least 30 calendar days from the mailing
date to respond to requests for information by the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall grant a reasonable extension upon written application
explaining the reason(s) necessitating the extension which must amount to good
cause. If the Tax Administrator denies a request for extension, the Tax
Administrator must inform the taxpayer in writing of the basis for the denial
and that the taxpayer must immediately provide the requested information. If
the Tax Administrator grants an extension request, he or she must notify the
taxpayer in writing of the amount of extension granted. Generally, an extension
will not exceed 30 calendar days in length, and may be less, depending on the
circumstances.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer of the procedures
to obtain an extension in its initial request for information. Please refer to
the notice explaining the request for extension of time to provide information
in this subchapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator shall take no lawful action against a
taxpayer for the tax year in question until the expiration of the applicable
response period for submission of the information requested, including
extensions. For example, the Tax Administrator may not engage in any collection
efforts until after expiration of the response period. After expiration of the
response period, the Tax Administrator may engage in collection efforts
permitted by the LTBR and discussed in §
32.029.
   (B)   Requests for prior year tax returns.
      (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(2) below, an initial inquiry by
the Tax Administrator regarding a taxpayer’s compliance with any eligible tax
may include taxes required to be paid or tax returns required to be filed no
more than three years prior to the mailing date of the notice.
      (2)   (a)   The Tax Administrator may make an additional subsequent
request for a tax return or supporting information if, after the initial
request, the Tax Administrator determines that the taxpayer failed to file a
tax return, under reported income, or failed to pay a tax for one or more of
the tax periods covered by the initial request. Generally, however the Tax
Administrator should not make routine requests for additional prior year
returns.
         (b)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations in division (B)
(2)(a) above on subsequent requests for prior year returns shall not apply if
the Tax Administrator has sufficient information to indicate that the taxpayer
failed to file a required return or to pay an eligible tax which was due more
than three years prior to the date of the notice. Thus, in situations involving
failure to file a required return or to pay a required eligible tax, the Tax
Administrator shall, in his or her discretion, have the ability to request
prior year returns due more than three years prior and supporting information.
   (C)   Use of federal or state tax information. The Tax Administrator may
require a taxpayer to provide copies of the taxpayer’s federal individual
income tax return if the Tax Administrator can demonstrate that the federal tax
information is reasonably necessary for the enforcement or collection of tax
and the information is not available from other available sources or the
state’s Department of Revenue. The Tax Administrator may also require a
taxpayer to provide copies of the taxpayer’s state individual income tax
return.

§ 32.018 NOTICE OF BASIS OF UNDERPAYMENT.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator must notify the taxpayer in writing of the basis
for any underpayment that the Tax Administrator has determined to exist with
respect to any eligible tax. The purpose of this notification is for the
taxpayer to understand the exact reason why the Tax Administrator believes an
underpayment exists. This notification from the Tax Administrator shall be
written in a manner calculated to be understood by an average person.
   (B)   The notification must include:
      (1)   The tax period or periods (usually measured in calendar years) for
which the underpayment is asserted;
      (2)   The amount of the alleged underpayment of the eligible tax detailed
by tax period;
      (3)   The legal basis (including any statutory or case law citations)
upon which the Tax Administrator has relied to determine that an underpayment
of an eligible tax exists; and
      (4)   An itemization of the changes made by the Tax Administrator to a
return or report filed by the taxpayer that results in the determination that
an underpayment exists. A copy of any revised return or report in the Tax
Administrator’s file must be provided to the taxpayer.
(Ord. 1999-3, passed 12-21-1999)
§ 32.019 PETITIONS FOR APPEALS OF ASSESSMENTS OR REFUND OF TAXES PAID.
   (A)   (1)   A taxpayer has the legal right to challenge an assessment or
denial of a refund claim under the LTBR. However, a taxpayer has a right to one
appeal only. If a taxpayer loses an assessment appeal, the taxpayer is not
entitled to a second refund appeal after paying the tax. In addition, no
administrative appeals are provided for other decisions, including, but not
limited to, the denial of an extension of time to provide information or the
modification or termination of an installment agreement.
      (2)   The LTBR requires political subdivisions to establish appeals
procedures. In order to begin the appeals process, the taxpayer must filed a
complete and timely petition (the “petition”). A petition is timely filed if
the letter transmitting the petition is postmarked by the United Stairs Postal
Service or actually received on or before the final day on which the petition
is due. Receipts from carriers other than the United States Postal Service are
not accepted as proof of timely filing. Deadlines for filing a petition are as
follows.
         (a)   Petitions challenging the denial of a refund shall be filed
within three years after the due date for filing the report or return as
extended or one year after actual payment of the tax, whichever is later. If no
report or return is required, the petition shall be filed within three years
after the due date for payment of the eligible tax or within one year after
actual payment, whichever is later.
         (b)   Petitions for reassessment of tax shall be filed within 90 days
of the date of the assessment notice which has been sent to the taxpayer by the
Tax Administrator.
   (B)   The Tax Administrator shall make available a form of petition for
appeal and refund attached as §
32.031.
   (C)   Any petition filed under division (A)(2)(a) above shall:
      (1)   State the legal basis for claiming the refund or disagreeing with
the Tax Administrator’s assessment;
      (2)   State the tax period or periods (i.e., years) to which it pertains;
      (3)   State the amount of the claim and the type of eligible tax detailed
by tax period;
      (4)   Include all supporting documentation and calculations;
      (5)   Provide the name, address, and telephone number of the taxpayer’s
representative, if any;
      (6)   Include a statement certifying that the facts in the petition are
true and correct, under penalty of perjury, and that the petition is not filed
for purposes of delay; and
      (7)   Include such other information (essentially identification) as is
reasonably requested by the Tax Administrator on the petition for appeal and
refund provided to taxpayer.
   (D)   The taxpayer shall have his or her petition decided by the Board of
Supervisors acting in executive session based solely on the petition and record
(including information on file and information submitted by the taxpayer). No
hearing, oral testimony, or oral argument is required, but can be requested by
the taxpayer. The Board of Supervisors may choose to grant a hearing in its
sole discretion.
(Ord. 1999-3, passed 12-21-1999)
§ 32.020 APPEALS BOARD.
   (A)   The Appeals Board shall consist of the Board of Supervisors acting in
executive session, without any maximum or minimum limitation on the number of
persons acting as the Board of Supervisors, provided that a quorum exists.
   (B)   The decision by the Board of Supervisors acting in executive session
shall be based solely on the petition and record. Decisions on petitions shall
be issued within 60 days of the date a complete and accurate petition is
received. Failure to act within 60 days shall result in the petition being
deemed approved.
   (C)   Any person aggrieved by a decision under this section who has a direct
interest in the decision shall have the right to appeal to the County Court of
Common Pleas vested with the jurisdiction of local tax appeals by or pursuant
to 42 Pa.C.S. § 5571(b).
   (D)   Decisions by the Appeals Board shall be made according to principles
of law and equity.
(Ord. 1999-3, passed 12-21-1999)
§ 32.021 CONDUCT OF APPEALS.
   (A)   A taxpayer may or may not choose to be represented by a taxpayer
representative. The taxpayer representative may be a lawyer, certified public
accountant, accountant, or other tax advisor possessing appropriate tax
training to represent taxpayers in tax appeals. The taxpayer must submit a
written authorization to use a taxpayer representative. However, a simple
letter signed by a taxpayer authorizing representation will be accepted as
authorization. Such authorization shall include the representative’s name,
address, and telephone number.
   (B)   Copies of notices or communications may be sent by the Tax
Administrator or other representative of the political subdivision to the
taxpayer’s representative. However, the original notice or communications will
always be sent directly to the taxpayer. Action taken by the taxpayer’s
authorized representative (for example, requesting an extension of time or
submitting factual information) shall have the same force or effect as if taken
directly by the taxpayer.
   (C)   The Appeals Board’s final decision shall be in writing and signed by
the representative of the Appeals Board. The final decision shall be mailed to
the taxpayer, with a copy also mailed to the taxpayer’s authorized
representative (if any).

§ 32.022 REFUNDS.
   (A)   A taxpayer who has paid an eligible tax may file a written request for
refund or credit. A request for refund shall be made within three years of the
due date, as extended, for filing the report or tax return, or one year after
actual payment of the tax, whichever is later. If no report is required, the
request shall be made within three years after the due date for payment of the
tax or within one year after actual payment of the tax, whichever is later.
   (B)   A tax return filed by the taxpayer showing an overpayment shall be
deemed to be a written request for a cash refund unless otherwise indicated on
the tax return.
   (C)   A request for refund under this section shall not be considered a
petition under §
32.019 and shall not preclude a taxpayer from submitting a petition under §
32.019.
   (D)   For amounts paid as a result of a notice asserting or informing a
taxpayer of an underpayment, a written request for refund shall be filed within
one year of the date of payment.

copy of the disclosure statement.
(Ord. 1999-3, passed 12-21-1999)
§ 32.024 INTEREST ON OVERPAYMENT.
   (A)   General rule. All overpayments of an eligible tax made to the local
government shall bear simple interest from the date of overpayment of such
eligible tax until the date of resolution.
   (B)   Interest rate. Interest on overpayments shall be paid at the same rate
as the state is required to pay pursuant to § 806.1 of the Act of April 9, 1929
(Pub. Law 343, No. 176), known as the Fiscal Code (72 P.S. §§ 1 et seq.) As of
December 1998, this interest rate is currently 9% annually (.00247% daily).
   (C)   Exceptions to payments of interest.
      (1)   No interest shall be paid if an overpayment is refunded or applied
against any other eligible tax, interest, or penalty due to the local
government within 75 days after the last date prescribed for filing the report

or report of the liability due is filed, whichever is later.
      (2)   Interest is not required to be paid on taxpayer overpayments of
interest or a penalty(ies).
   (D)   Acceptance of refund check. The taxpayer’s acceptance of a refund
check from the Tax Administrator or political subdivision shall not prejudice
any right of the taxpayer to claim any additional overpayment and interest
thereon. Tender or a refund check by the local government shall be deemed to be
acceptance of the check by the taxpayer for purposes of this division (D).
   (E)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      DATE OF OVERPAYMENT. The later of the date paid or the date the tax is
deemed to have been overpaid as follows.

deemed to have been overpaid on the last day for filing the report for the tax
period, determined without regard to any extension of time for filing.
         (b)   Any amount overpaid as estimated tax for the tax period shall be
deemed to have been overpaid on the last day for filing the final report for

shall be deemed to have been paid on the last day.
         (d)   Any amount claimed to be overpaid with respect to which a lawful

have been overpaid 60 days following the date of initiation of the review or

refund to a date preceding the date of the refund check by not more than 30
days, whether or not the refund check is accepted by the taxpayer after tender.
(Ord. 1999-3, passed 12-21-1999)
§ 32.025 ABATEMENT OF CERTAIN INTEREST AND PENALTY.
   (A)   Errors and delays. The purpose of this provision is to provide, in the
discretion of the Tax Administrator, a mechanism to abate (i.e., reduce)
interest and/or penalties where an underpayment is the result of an error or
delay in performance by a representative of the Tax Administrator. Accordingly,
in the case of any underpayment, the Tax Administrator, in his or her
discretion, may offer to abate all or any part of the interest relating to an
eligible tax for any period for any one or all of the following reasons:
      (1)   Any underpayment of an eligible tax finally determined to be due,
which is attributable in whole or in part to any error or delay by the Tax
Administrator in the performance of a ministerial act. For purposes of this
division (A)(1), an error or delay shall be taken into account only if no
significant aspect of the error or delay can be attributed to the taxpayer and
after the Tax Administrator has contacted the taxpayer in writing with respect
to the underpayment of tax finally determined to be due or payable; or
      (2)   Any payment of an eligible tax to the extent that any error or
delay in the payment is attributable to an officer, employee, or agent of the
Tax Administrator being erroneous or dilatory in performance of a ministerial
act. The Tax Administrator shall determine what constitute timely performance
of ministerial acts performed under this division (A).
   (B)   Abatement of any penalty or excess interest due to erroneous written
advice by the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall abate any portion
of any penalty or excess interest attributable to erroneous advice furnished to
the taxpayer in writing by an officer, employee, or agent of the Tax
Administrator acting in the officer’s, employee’s, or agent’s official capacity
if:
      (1)   The written advice was reasonably relied upon by the taxpayer and
was in response to a specific written request of the taxpayer; and
      (2)   The portion of the penalty or addition to tax or excess interest
did not result from a failure by the taxpayer to provide adequate or accurate
information to the Tax Administrator.
   (C)   Providing tax advice is a choice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it
shall be in the sole discretion of the Tax Administrator whether or not to
provide written tax advice to a taxpayer. Taxpayers shall not have any right to
compel the Tax Administrator to provide written tax advice.
(Ord. 1999-3, passed 12-21-1999)
§ 32.026 APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS.
   Unless otherwise specified by the taxpayer, all voluntary payments of an

order:
   (A)   Tax;
   (B)   Interest;
   (C)   Penalty; and
   (D) Any other fees or charges.
(Ord. 1999-3, passed 12-21-1999)
§ 32.027 INSTALLMENT AGREEMENTS.
   (A)   Payment option. The Tax Administrator has the discretion to enter into
written agreements with any taxpayer under which the taxpayer is allowed to
satisfy liability for tax in installment payments if the Tax Administrator
determines that the installment agreement will facilitate collection.
   (B)   Extent to which installment agreements remain in effect.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (B), any installment
agreement entered into by the Tax Administrator under this section shall remain
in effect for the term of the agreement.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may terminate any prior installment agreement
entered into under this section if:
         (a)   Information which the taxpayer provided to the Tax Administrator
prior to the date of the installment agreement was inaccurate, false,
erroneous, or incomplete in any manner, determined in the reasonable discretion
of the Tax Administrator; or
         (b)   The Tax Administrator reasonably believes and has determined
that collection of the eligible tax under the bailment agreement is in
jeopardy.
      (3)   If the Tax Administrator finds that the financial condition of the
taxpayer has significantly changed, the Tax Administrator may unilaterally
alter, modify, or terminate the installment agreement, but only if the
following conditions are satisfied:
         (a)   The Tax Administrator provides a notice of its findings to the
taxpayer no later than 30 days prior to the date of change of the installment
agreement; and
         (b)   The notice given by the Tax Administrator to the taxpayer
provides the reasons why the Tax Administrator believes that a significant
change, justifying a change to the installment agreement, has occurred.
      (4)   The Tax Administrator may unilaterally and without notification
alter, modify, or terminate an installment agreement entered into by the Tax
Administrator under this section if the taxpayer fails to do any of the
following:
         (a)   Pay any installment at the time it is due under the installment
agreement;
         (b)   Pay any other liability relating to an eligible tax at the time
the liability is due; or
         (c)   Provide a financial condition update as requested by the Tax
Administrator.
      (5)   No administrative appeal is permitted in the event of an
alteration, modification, or termination of an installment agreement. However,
an appeal may be made to the County Court of Common Pleas.
   (C)   Prepayment permitted. Nothing in this section shall prevent a taxpayer
from prepaying in whole or in part any eligible tax under any installment
agreement with the Tax Administrator.
(Ord. 1999-3, passed 12-21-1999)
§ 32.028 CONFIDENTIALITY OF TAX INFORMATION.
   (A)   Any information obtained by the Tax Administrator or Appeals Board, or
any of their respective officers, agents, legal counsel, financial accountants,
or employees as a result of any audit, assessment, return, report,
investigation, hearing, appeal, or verification of a taxpayer shall be
confidential tax information.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful, except for official purposes or as provided by
law, for such persons to:
      (1)   Divulge or make known in any manner any confidential information
obtained through any audit, return, assessment, investigation, report,
investigation, appeal, hearing, or verification of a taxpayer to any person
other than the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s authorized representative;
      (2)   Permit confidential tax information or any book containing any
abstract or particulars thereof to be seen or examined by any person other than
the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s authorized representative; or
      (3)   Print, publish, or make known in any manner any confidential tax
information of a taxpayer.
(Ord. 1999-3, passed 12-21-1999) Penalty, see §
32.999
§ 32.029 COLLECTIONS.
   If after the decision of an appeal, or if no appeal is requested by a
taxpayer, the Tax Administrator may engage in efforts to collect any eligible
tax determined to be legally due. Such efforts may include, but shall not be
limited to, obtaining additional information, auditing taxpayer records,
compromising the amount of tax, interest, or penalty owed, obtaining liens on
the taxpayer’s property, or obtaining wage attachments, levies, and seizures of
the taxpayer’s property. As provided in §
32.027, the Tax Administrator may enter into a written installment agreement
with the taxpayer if the Tax Administrator determines that an installment
agreement will facilitate collection. The Tax Administrator also reserves the
right to seek criminal prosecution of a taxpayer in appropriate circumstances.
(Ord. 1999-3, passed 12-21-1999)
§ 32.030 DISCLOSURE STATEMENT UNDER THE LOCAL TAXPAYERS BILL OF RIGHTS.
   (A)   General regulations. It is the obligation of all taxpayers to file all
local tax returns voluntarily and pay all local taxes to which they are
subject. However, when the duly appointed or elected tax collector or tax
collection agency for the municipality and/or school district in which the
taxpayer resides determines that a required return has not been filed, or a tax
liability has not been paid, the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights grants certain
legal rights to taxpayers, and imposes obligations on taxing authorities to
ensure that equity and fairness guide local governments in the collection of
taxes. In addition, the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights provides the local
government entity with certain legal methods to enforce taxpayer obligations.
This disclosure statement sets forth your rights as a taxpayer in connection
with any audit, examination, appeal, or refund claim of taxes for the township,
and any enforcement or collection actions taken by the “Tax Administrator” on
behalf of the township.
   (B)   Applicability/eligible taxes. This disclosure statement applies to all
eligible taxes levied by the township. For this purpose, eligible taxes do not
include real property taxes. The specific eligible tax(es) levied by the
township are: per capita tax, occupation privilege tax, and earned income tax.
Unless expressly provided in the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights, the failure of
any person acting on behalf of the Tax Administrator to comply with any
provisions of this disclosure statement, related regulations, or the Local
Taxpayers Bill of Rights will not excuse the taxpayer from paying the taxes
owed.
   (C)   Audit/or examinations. If the township contacts a taxpayer about his
or her tax return or payment of any eligible taxes, the township will send him
or her a letter with either a request for more information or a reason why the
township believes a change to his or her return or taxes may be needed. If the
township requests information, he or she will have 30 calendar days from the
date of the mailing to respond. Reasonable extensions of such time will be
granted upon application for good cause. The township will notify him or her of
the procedures to obtain an extension with the township’s initial request for
tax information. The township’s initial inquiry may include taxes inquired to
be paid or tax returns required to be filed no more than three years prior to
the mailing date of notice. If a taxpayer gives the township the requested
information or provide an explanation, the township may or may not agree with
the individual. If the township does not agree with the individual, the
township will explain in writing the township’s reasons for asserting that he
or she owes the township tax (which the township call “an underpayment”). The
explanation will include: the tax period or periods for which the underpayment
is asserted; the amount of the underpayment detailed by tax period; the legal
basis upon which the township have relied to determine that an underpayment
exists; and an itemization of the revisions made by the township to the return
or report that results in the township’s decision that an underpayment exists.
If he or she agrees with the changes, he or she should pay the additional tax.
   (D)   Requests for prior year returns. An initial request by the Tax
Administrator into prior year returns may cover tax returns required to be
filed as far back as three years prior to the mailing date of the notice. If
the Tax Administrator determines that the taxpayer failed to file a tax return,
underreported income, or failed to pay a tax for one or more of the tax periods
covered by the initial request, the Tax Administrator may request additional
information. The Tax Administrator may also require a taxpayer to provide
copies of federal and state tax returns when the Tax Administrator can show
that the taxpayer’s federal tax return(s) is/are reasonably necessary for the
enforcement or collection of tax, and the information is not available from
other sources or the state’s Department of Revenue.
   (E)   Appeals of decisions.
      (1)   If the township notifies a taxpayer that he or she owes more tax
(what the township calls an “assessment”) and he or she does not agree with the
township’s decision, he or she may appeal or seek review by filing a petition
for reassessment within 90 days of the date of the mailing of the assessment
notice. The petition must either be in the township’s possession or postmarked
by the U.S. Postal Service within this 90-day period. Receipts from other
carriers (such as Federal Express) are not accepted as proof of delivery.
      (2)   The petition must explain the legal basis for the taxpayer’s
position and include all supporting documents. For the taxpayer’s convenience,
a form for submission of a petition is available at the Township Office, R.R.
5, Box 39, Selinsgrove, PA 17870. The petition must be mailed or delivered to
the Secretary at the same address. A decision by the Board of Supervisors in
Executive Session, which has been appointed by the township will be made within
60 days of the date your complete and accurate petition is received. If the
taxpayer does not agree with the decision of the Board of Supervisors in
Executive Session, he or she may appeal to the appropriate County Court of
Common Pleas. The taxpayer must file your appeal within 30 days after notice of
the decision of the Board of Supervisors in Executive Session.
   (F)   Refunds. Taxpayers may file a claim for refund (“refund claim”) if he
or she thinks he or she paid too much tax (what the township calls an
“overpayment”). The taxpayer must file the refund claim within three years of
the due date for filing the return as extended or one year after actual payment
of the tax, whichever is later. If no report or local tax return is required
for the tax, the refund claim must be made within three years after the due
date for payment of the tax or within one year after actual payment of the tax,
whichever is later. If the refund claim relates to amounts paid as a result of
a notice asserting an underpayment of tax, the request for refund claim must be
filed within one year of the date of payment. Refund claims must be made on
forms prescribed by the township and must include supporting documentation. The
taxpayer can obtain forms for refund claims by contacting the township at the
Township Office, R.R. 5, Box 39, Selinsgrove, PA 17870. The refund claim must
be filed with the township at the same address. If the taxpayer files a tax
return showing an overpayment of tax, the township will treat that as a request
for a cash refund unless the taxpayer indicates otherwise. If the refund claim
is denied, the taxpayer may file a petition contesting the denial of the
refund. Any petition must be filed within the same time limits that apply for a
refund claim. Alternatively, a taxpayer may file a petition for a refund
without first filing a refund claim. A hearing date will be set after the
petition is received and a decision by the Board of Supervisors in Executive
Session will be made within 60 days of the date your complete and accurate
petition is received. The Appeals petition form must be used to request a
review of a refund claim denial. The petition must be mailed or delivered to
the attention of the Secretary at the following address: the Township Office,
R.R. 5, Box 39, Selinsgrove, PA 17870.
   (G)   Enforcement procedures. Once it has been determined that the taxpayer
owes a tax, the township will take all action the township is legally permitted
to take to enforce our claim. Such action may include obtaining additional
information from the taxpayer, auditing taxpayer records, entering into a
settlement with the taxpayer of the disputed amount of the tax, or obtaining
liens on his or her property, wage attachments, levies, and seizures and sales
of your property in appropriate circumstances. The township may enter into a
written agreement with the taxpayer for payment of the tax in installments if
the township believes that such an agreement will facilitate collection. The
township may also impose interest and applicable penalties on the tax a
taxpayer owes, and may seek criminal prosecution of him or her in appropriate
circumstances.
   (H)   Tax information confidentiality. Information gained by the Tax
Administrator or Board of Supervisors as a result of any audit, return, report,
investigation, hearing, appeal, or verification shall be confidential. However,
confidentiality will not preclude disclosure for official purposes, whether in
connection with legal proceedings or otherwise, and it will not preclude
disclosure to the extent required by applicable law.
   (I)   Taxpayer complaints. If a taxpayer has a complaint about any action
relating to the political subdivision’s taxes, the Secretary may be contacted
in writing at the Township Office, R.R. 5, Box 39, Selinsgrove, PA 17870. This
individual will attempt to facilitate resolution of your complaint by working
with the appropriate personnel of the Tax Administrator and/or Board of
Supervisors. For more information, please contact the Secretary, Monroe
Township Office, R.R. 5, Box 39, Selinsgrove, PA 17870.

CHAPTER 73: PARKING SCHEDULES
Schedule
      
I.   Parking Regulations
SCHEDULE I. PARKING REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Parking during periods of snowfall.
      (1)   Declaration of snow and ice emergency. In order to facilitate the
movement of traffic and to combat the hazards of snow and ice on the township
streets, the Township Road Foreman, in his or her discretion, may declare a
snow and ice emergency (“snow emergency”). Information on the existence of a
snow emergency may be given by the Township Road Foreman through radio,
television, or other media and information on termination of the emergency may
be given by the same media. Such notice shall be sufficient if announced by two
radio or television stations. When circumstances permit, notice may also be
given by publication of a news release in a newspaper of general circulation in
the township.
      (2)   Parking restrictions. Beginning three hours after the notice
(radio, television, and the like) that a snow emergency has been declared, it
shall be unlawful, at any time during the continuance of the emergency, to park
any motor vehicle or other vehicle on any public street or alley within the
township.
      (3)   Authorized towing of vehicles.
         (a)   Any employee of the township engaged in road work is hereby
authorized to remove or have removed any vehicle parked on any public street or
alley within the township in violation of this division (A) and to take or have
taken the vehicle to the nearest garage or place of safety. The registered
owner of such vehicle shall be promptly notified in writing of the fact of such
removal, the place to which said vehicle has been removed, and where he or she
may obtain such vehicle following payment of any and all towing and storage
charges. Neither the township, nor its officers and employees, shall be held
responsible for any damage to any vehicle occurring as a result of towing
impoundment or storage of a vehicle parked in violation of this division (A).
         (b)   No vehicle shall be removed under the authority of this division
(A) if, at the time of the intended removal, the owner or the person for the
time being in charge of the vehicle is present and expresses a willingness and
intention to remove the vehicle immediately; provided, however, that any
charges for towing already incurred due to a request for towing services having
been made prior to removal shall be the sole responsibility of the owner of the
vehicle. Upon failure to pay such charges within 20 days after notice by the
township of the charges, the same shall be collectible by the township pursuant
to the provisions of subsection (6) of this division (A). The mailing date of
the notice shall be considered notice by the township.
      (4)   Removal of snow, ice, and slush onto streets.
         (a)   It shall be unlawful for owners, occupants, or tenants of
property to dump, throw, shovel, pile, or push any snow or ice removed from
driveways or walkways into any public street or alley in the township. No snow,
ice, slush, or a combination thereof, shall be pushed or deposited into any
drainage area, stream, culvert, or catch basin.
         (b)   No snow, ice, slush, or a combination thereof, shall be
deposited, pushed, or maintained within a commercial, manufacturing,
industrial, or multiple-family zoning district parking facility or at or near
an intersection in any zoning district, in a manner or at a location which
creates a traffic hazard by impairing visibility from or on a public street or
alley in the township.
         (c)   No person shall damage any township property, including, but not
limited to, traffic signs, culverts, and the like while removing snow, ice,
slush, or a combination thereof. Any damage to township property shall be
repaired or replaced in accordance with the requirements of the township at the
expense of the property owner.
      (5)   Fire hydrants not to be covered.
         (a)   Fire hydrants shall not be covered. The property owner shall
remove or cause to be removed, all snow, ice, slush, or any combination thereof
or any accumulator and/or impediment which would limit access to, from, and/or
around all of the fire hydrants which are located on said property, so as to
provide immediate access by fire rescue personnel in cases of emergency. In
cases involving a storm, fire hydrants shall be cleared of all snow, ice slush,
or any combination thereof within 24 hours following the storm, and, in any
event, any accumulation shall be removed not less than once in every 24-hour
period.
         (b)   In all other cases involving the accumulation of natural and/or
man-made items around fire hydrants, the owner is responsible for the immediate
removal of said items. In either case, fire hydrants shall be cleared
sufficiently so emergency personnel have total access to hydrants. This is
necessary to allow for fire hose connections to be made to access water in the
event of a fire. The owner of a property shall be responsible for conforming to
the requirements of this subsection whether such property is occupied by said
owner, is occupied by another party, is unoccupied or is vacant.
         (c)   In cases where the owner shall fail, neglect, or refuse to
comply with any of the provisions of this subsection within the time period
required herein, the township may, in its discretion, proceed immediately to
clear the snow, ice, slush, or any combination thereof or accumulation and/or
impediment which would limit access to, from, and/or around fire hydrants and
to collect the expenses, with any additional amount allowed by law, from fine
or penalty imposed under the penalty section of this division (A). In no case
is the township liable if it does not exercise the township’s option for
removal of snow, ice, slush, any combination thereof or accumulation and/or
impediment which would limit access to, from, and/or around fire hydrants.
      (6)   Penalties. Any person, firm or corporation who shall violate any of
the provisions of this division (A) shall, upon conviction thereof, be
sentenced to pay a fine of not less than $300 or more than $1,000, and in
default of payment of said fine, be subject to imprisonment for a term of not
more than 30 days. Each day that a violation of this division (A) continues,

value over $2,500,000. For buildings over $5,000,000, the fee is $5,000 plus
0.0004 of the valuation over $5,000,000.
      (2)   Special consideration may be given in computing plan review fees
for buildings such as large warehouses or indoor recreational facilities due to
their plan review simplicity. Such considerations may also be given to
buildings with repetitive floor plans such as high-rise buildings.
      (3)   The plan review fee for mechanical, plumbing, and electrical
reviews is computed at 25% of the building plan review fee for each discipline
($200 minimum).
      (4)   The plan review fee for accessibility and energy reviews is
computed at 50% of the building plan review fee for each discipline ($200
minimum).
      (5)   The sprinkler review is simply based on the number of sprinkler
heads: 1-100; $250; 101-200, $300; 201-300, $325; 301-400, $350; 401-500, $400;
over 500, $450 plus $0.30 per sprinkler over 500. For hydraulically-designed
systems, multiply the fee by two.

STREET NUMBERING
§ 151.110 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   The owners of all buildings or structure/property within the township
to which street numbers have been assigned shall have the street number
prominently displayed by December 31, 2006 and at all times thereafter in
accordance with the following standards. For purposes of this subchapter, a
STREET NUMBER is an address number established in accordance with the county
wide 911 public safety system with reference to the adjacent road or street,
assigned and given to a particular building or structure/property by county 911
and the U.S. Postal Service. For specific sections of roadways with an existing
addressing system that is approved by county 911, the “street number” is the
retained street number in the existing addressing system that is established in
conjunction with the county addressing project.
   (B)   Each building to which a street number has been assigned shall have a
street number displayed upon the building, except for buildings which are
located a distance greater than 200 feet from the nearest edge of the cartway
of the public roadway or upon which signage cannot be attached which would be
readable from the nearest public roadway by reason of natural or human-made
obstructions. The owner of said structure/property shall be required to provide
posted street number signage at a location near the edge of the cartway of the
public roadway which will obviously indicate to emergency responders the street
address of the owner’s structure/property. The post shall not be in a location
where a snow plow or other municipal maintenance activities will disturb it,
and shall have affixed thereon at a height of not less than four feet or more
than seven feet the street number which has been assigned to the structure/
property. Any property owner proposing to place a post at a distance greater
than 30 feet from the nearest edge of the cartway of the public roadway shall
obtain location approval from the township prior to placement.
   (C)   The assigned street numbers shall be either affixed directly to the
building or post or displayed on a sign affixed to the building or post. The
street number shall be displayed in such a manner that the number will contrast
in color with the background and will be observed and readable from the nearest
public or private roadway. All numbers shall be in standard Arabic numerals,
not less than four inches in height and not less than one-half inch in width.
It is recommended that the numbers be reflective for greater nighttime
visibility.
   (D)   If, for any reason the street number of a particular building is not
readily identifiable by posted signage along the roadway whether due to the
proximity of multiple buildings with different street numbers or some other
reason, the street number should be affixed to the building as well as posted
by the road. Similarly, if a single building has multiple street numbers or
apartment numbers such as professional buildings or apartments, a building
directory should be posted at the maintenance of the building.

not been numbered in accordance with these regulations, of the violation and
the need to comply.
   (B)   In the event that people persist in refusing to comply with these
regulations despite notices to do so, the supervisors may issue a written order
directing the owners, occupants, or others in possession of the building or
structure/property in violation of this subchapter to comply with the
applicable requirements of this subchapter. Any person who is aggrieved by any
order issued pursuant to this subchapter may appeal to the Township Supervisors
by filing a written notice of appeal to the office of the Township Secretary
within ten days of the date of the subject order or notice.
   (C)   In the event the structure/property owners, occupants, or possessors
fail or refuse to take action in accordance with the notices and an order
issued pursuant to this subchapter, the Township Supervisors may provide the
signage, as necessary, in order to bring the structure/property owner into
compliance with the standards promulgated in this subchapter. The township may
recover the cost of materials and labor for the purchase and installation of
signage from the structure/property owners, occupants, or possessors reasonable
administrative fees, interest, or other charges allowed by law. In the event
the owners, occupants, or possessors of the subject structure/property fail to
pay the loss of such installation as determined and approved, then the township
may institute proceedings at law to collect the full cost together with all
penalties, interest, fees, and other charges against the premises and the
owners thereof and collect same as a municipal lien or may take other action to
collect these sums as may be permitted by law.

   (B)   No more than 500 feet longitudinally shall be opened in any street at
any one time.
   (C)   The work of excavation shall be so conducted as not to interfere with

tunnel excavation shall be made only in the presence of the Road Foreman or an
inspector designated by him or her, and shall be done only in a method approved

   (E)   All openings or excavations shall be backfilled promptly and

   (G)   On concrete base streets, such base shall be replaced with concrete
and the minimum size of the opening or excavation shall be 16 square feet.
   (H)   During the making of any excavation in the street, every necessary and
reasonable precaution shall be taken by the applicant and the parties making
the same to keep the street in a safe and passable condition both day and night
by guards, barriers, lanterns, and other devices, and all excavating permits
granted hereunder are granted under and subject to the express condition that
the person to whom the same is issued shall indemnify, save, and keep harmless
the township from any loss in damages, or otherwise whatsoever, which may or
shall be occasioned at any time by the said excavation, or by any leak,
explosion, or other injury from any pipe, apparatus, conduit, or any other
matter placed in the said excavation.
   (I)   The applicant shall notify the Road Foreman when the opening or
excavation is ready for backfilling before any backfilling is done, when
backfilling work is completed, when the temporary paving has been installed,
and when the street has been permanently restored so that inspections may be
made.
   (J)   In the event that any work performed by or for a permit holder shall,
in the opinion of the Road Foreman, be unsatisfactory and the same shall not be
corrected in accordance with his or her instructions within the time fixed by
him or her, or in the event that the work for which the permit was granted is

proceed to correct such unsatisfactory work or complete any such work not
completed and charge the cost thereof, plus 20% to the applicant.

hazardous condition endangering the property, life, health, or safety of
individuals which necessitates opening or excavating the street; or
         (b)   The Board of Supervisors determines that the property owner
would suffer undue hardship not caused by the property owner’s action,
inaction, or unreasonable lack of foresight and that permitting the excavation
of the street will not significantly reduce the normal life of the street. The
Board of Supervisors shall not make such a determination until it has received
and reviewed a written application from the property owner: identifying the
property, the street, and the scope of intended excavation; explaining the
undue hardship; and requesting relief under this division (L).

      (2)   The Board of Supervisors determines that the property owner would
suffer undue hardship not caused by the property owner’s action, inaction, or
unreasonable lack of foresight and that permitting the excavation of the new

property, the road, and the scope of intended excavation, explaining the undue
hardship, and requesting relief under this division (B)(2).
