   (A)   No insurance company, association or exchange (hereinafter “insurer”)
doing business in the Commonwealth shall pay a claim of a named insured for
fire damage to a structure located within the borough where the amount
recoverable for the fire loss to the structure under all policies exceeds
$7,500, unless the insurer is furnished by the Borough Treasurer with a
certificate pursuant to 40 P.S. § 638(b) and unless there is compliance with
the procedures set forth in 40 P.S. § 638(c) and (d).
   (B)   Where there are delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties or user
charges against the property (“municipal claims”), or there are expenses which
the borough has incurred as a cost for the removal, repair or securing of a
building or other structure on the property (collectively “municipal
expenses”), the Borough Manager shall immediately render a bill for such work,
if he or she has not already done so. Upon written request of the named insured
specifying the tax description of the property, the name and address of the
insurer and the date of receipt by the insurer of a loss report of the claim,
the Treasurer shall furnish a certificate within 14 working days after the
request, to the insurer, a certificate (or at his or her discretion an oral
notice confirmed in writing) either:
      (1)   Stating that there are no unpaid municipal claims or municipal
expenses against the property;
      (2)   Specifying the nature and amount of such claims or expenses,
accompanied by a bill for such amounts; or
      (3)   Taxes, assessments, penalties and user charges shall be deemed
delinquent for this purpose if a lien could have been filed for such claims
under applicable law. Upon receipt of a certificate and bill pursuant to
division (A) above, the insurer shall transfer to the Treasurer an amount from
the insurance proceeds sufficient to pay such sums prior to making payment to
the named insured, subject to the provisions of division (C) below.
   (C)   When all municipal claims and municipal expenses have been paid
pursuant to division (B) above, or where the Treasurer has issued a certificate
described in division (B)(1) above indicating that there are no municipal
claims or municipal expenses against the property, the insurer shall pay the
claim of the named insured; provided, however, that if the loss agreed upon by
the named insured and the insurer equals or exceeds 60% of the aggregate limits
of liability on all fire policies covering the building or structure, the
following procedures must be followed.
      (1)   The insurer shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the
Treasurer, in the aggregate, $2,000 for each $15,000 of such claim or fraction
thereof.
      (2)   If at the time a loss report is submitted by the insured, such
insured has submitted to the insurer, with a copy to the borough, a
contractor’s signed estimate of the cost of removing, repairing or securing the
building or other structure in an amount less than the amount calculated under
the foregoing transfer formula, the insurer shall transfer to the Treasurer
from the insurance proceeds the amount specified in the estimate. If there is
more than one insurer, the transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by
all insurers insuring the building or other structure.
      (3)   Upon receipt of the above described portion of the insurance
proceeds, the Treasurer shall do the following:
         (a)   Place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used solely as
security against the total municipal expenses anticipated by the borough to be
required in removing, repairing or securing the building or structure as
required by this chapter. Such costs shall include, without limitation, any
engineering, legal or administrative costs incurred by the borough in
connection with such removal, repair or securing or any proceedings related
thereto;
         (b)   Mail to the named insured, at the address received from the
insurer, a notice the proceeds have been received by the borough and that the
procedures under this division (C)(3)(b) shall be followed;
         (c)   After the transfer, the named insured may submit to the borough
a contractor’s signed estimate of the cost of removing, repairing or securing
the building or other structure, in which event the Treasurer shall, if such
estimate is deemed by the Treasurer to be reasonable, return to the insured the
amount of the funds transferred to the borough in excess of that required to
pay the municipal expenses; provided, the borough has not commenced to remove,
repair or secure the building or other structure, in which case the borough
will complete the work;
         (d)   Pay to the Borough Manager, for reimbursement to the borough
General Fund, the amount of the municipal expenses paid by the borough;
         (e)   Pay the remaining balance in the fund (without interest) to the
named insured upon receipt of a certificate issued by the Borough Manager that
the repair, removal or securing of the building or other structure has been
completed in accordance with all applicable codes and regulations of the
borough; and
         (f)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ability
of the borough to recover any deficiency in the amount of municipal claims or
municipal expenses recovered pursuant to this chapter, or to insurance
proceeds, by an action at law or in equity to enforce the codes of the borough
or to enter into an agreement with the named insured with regard to such other
disposition of the proceeds as the borough may deem responsible.

General Assembly of July 2, 2008 (P.L. 197) and known as Act No. 32, as may be
amended and supplemented from time to time. In all enforcement of the

amended, shall take precedence.

corporate officer.

established to govern each tax collection district for the purpose of income
tax collection. This term shall include a joint tax collection committee.

Collection District as established under the Act.
   TAX OFFICER. A political subdivision, public employee, tax bureau, county,
excluding a county of the first class, or private agency which administers and
collects earned income and net profits for one or more tax collection
districts. Unless otherwise specifically provided, for purposes of the
obligations of an employer, the term shall mean the TAX OFFICER or tax

The earned income and net profits tax shall continue in force on a calendar
year or taxpayer fiscal year basis without the need for annual enactment or re-
enactment, unless the rate of the tax is subsequently changed. For a taxpayer
whose fiscal year is not a calendar year, the Tax Officer shall establish
deadlines for filing, reporting and payment of taxes which provide time periods
equivalent to those provided for a calendar year taxpayer.
(Ord. 2012-1, passed 1-9-2012; Ord. 2019-01, passed 2-12-2019)
§ 35.005 DECLARATION AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)   Application.
      (1)   Income taxes shall be applicable to taxable income earned or
received based on the method of accounting used by the taxpayer in the period
beginning January 1 of the current year and ending December 31 of the current
year; except that taxes imposed for the first time and changes to existing tax
rates shall become effective on January 1 or July 1, as specified in this
subchapter, and the tax shall continue in force on a calendar year or taxpayer
fiscal year basis, without annual reenactment, unless the rate of the tax is
subsequently changed.
      (2)   For a taxpayer whose fiscal year is not a calendar year, the Tax
Officer shall establish deadlines for filing, reporting and payment of taxes
which provide time periods equivalent to those provided for a calendar year
taxpayer.
   (B)   Partial domicile. The taxable income subject to tax of a taxpayer who
is domiciled in a political subdivision for only a portion of the tax year
shall be an amount equal to the taxpayer’s taxable income multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar months during the
tax year that the individual is domiciled in the political subdivision, and the
denominator of which is 12. A taxpayer shall include in the numerator any
calendar month during which the taxpayer is domiciled for more than half the
calendar month. A day that a taxpayer’s domicile changes shall be included as a
day the individual is in the new domicile and not the old domicile. If the
number of days in the calendar month in which the individual lived in the old
and new domiciles are equal, the calendar month shall be included in
calculating the number of months in the new domicile.
   (C)   Declaration and payment. Except as provided in division (A)(2) above,
taxpayers shall declare and pay income taxes as follows.
      (1)   Every taxpayer shall, on or before April 15 of the succeeding year,
make and file with the resident Tax Officer, a final return showing the amount
of taxable income received during the period beginning January 1 of the current
year and ending December 31 of the current year, the total amount of tax due on
the taxable income, the amount of tax paid, the amount of tax that has been
withheld under §
35.007 and the balance of tax due. All amounts reported shall be rounded to the
nearest whole dollar. At the time of filing the final return, the taxpayer
shall pay the Tax Officer the balance of the tax due or shall make demand for
refund or credit in the case of overpayment.
      (2)   (a)   Every taxpayer making net profits shall, by April 15 of the
current year, make and file with the Tax Officer a declaration of the
taxpayer’s estimated net profits during the period beginning January 1 and
ending December 31 of the current year, and shall pay to the Tax Officer in
four equal quarterly installments the tax due on the estimated net profits. The
first installment shall be paid at the time of filing the declaration, and the
other installments shall be paid on or before June 15 of the current year,
September 15 of the current year and January 15 of the succeeding year,
respectively.
         (b)   Any taxpayer who first anticipates any net profit after April 15
of the current year, shall make and file the declaration required on or before
June 15 of the current year, September 15 of the current year or December 31 of
the current year, whichever date next follows the date on which the taxpayer
first anticipates such net profit, and shall pay to the Tax Officer in equal
installments the tax due on or before the quarterly payment dates that remain
after the filing of the declaration.
         (c)   Every taxpayer shall, on or before April 15 of the succeeding
year, make and file with the Tax Officer a final return showing the amount of
net profits earned or received based on the method of accounting used by the
taxpayer during the period beginning January 1 of the current year, and ending
December 31 of the current year, the total amount of tax due on the net profits
and the total amount of tax paid. At the time of filing the final return, the
taxpayer shall pay to the Tax Officer the balance of tax due or shall make
demand for refund or credit in the case of overpayment. Any taxpayer may, in
lieu of paying the fourth quarterly installment of the estimated tax, elect to
make and file with the Tax Officer on or before January 31 of the succeeding
year, the final return.
         (d)   The Department, in consultation with the Department of Revenue,
shall provide by regulation for the filing of adjusted declarations of
estimated net profits and for the payments of the estimated tax in cases where
a taxpayer who has filed the declaration required under this division (C)(2)(d)
anticipates additional net profits not previously declared or has overestimated
anticipated net profits.
         (e)   Every taxpayer who discontinues business prior to December 31 of
the current year, shall, within 30 days after the discontinuance of business,
file a final return as required under this subchapter and pay the tax due.
      (3)   Every taxpayer who receives any other taxable income not subject to
withholding under 53 P.S. § 6924.512(a)(3) of the Act shall make and file with
the resident Tax Officer a quarterly return on or before April 15 of the
current year, June 15 of the current year, September 15 of the current year,
and January 15 of the succeeding year, setting forth the aggregate amount of
taxable income not subject to withholding by the taxpayer during the three-
month periods ending March 31 of the current year, June 30 of the current year,
September 30 of the current year, and December 31 of the current year,
respectively, and subject to income tax, together with such other information
as the Department may require. Every taxpayer filing a return shall, at the
time of filing the return, pay to the Tax Officer the amount of income tax due.
The Department shall establish criteria under which the Tax Officer may waive
the quarterly return and payment of the income tax and permit a taxpayer to
file the receipt of taxable income on the taxpayer’s annual return and pay the
income tax due on or before April 15 of the succeeding year.
      (4)   The TCC may, by regulation, waive the requirements for a quarterly
return and payment of income tax under specified circumstances, including those
instances where a taxpayer’s annual taxable income is less than a specified
amount.

   (B)   Any employer who, for two of the preceding four quarterly periods, has
failed to deduct the proper tax or any part thereof or who has failed to pay
over the proper amount of tax to the Tax Officer may be required by the Tax

combined returns and make combined payments with the Tax Officer for each place

change the location of an employee’s place of employment for purposes of
nonresident tax liability.
   (D)   On or before February 28 of the succeeding year, every employer shall
file with the Tax Officer or other designated Tax Officer to whom tax, which
has been deducted, has been remitted as required herein:

every employer who willfully or negligently fails or omits to make the
deductions required by this section shall be liable for payment of the taxes
which the employer is required to withhold to the extent that such taxes have
not been recovered from the employee. The failure or omission of any employer
to make the deductions required by this section shall not relieve any employee
from the payment of the tax or from complying with the requirements of this
subchapter relating to the filing of declarations and returns.
   (H)   No employer shall be required to deduct or withhold taxes, file
returns or pay taxes with regard to residents of Maryland.

Every employer and every taxpayer and every person whom the Tax Officer
reasonably believes to be an employer or taxpayer is hereby directed and
required to give to the Tax Officer or to any agent designated by him or her
any means, facilities and opportunity for such examination and investigations
as are hereby authorized. Such examination or audits shall be conducted by the
Tax Officer and any agents designated by the Tax Officer shall be conducted in

otherwise provided by law.
   (G)   The Tax Officer is authorized to establish different filing, reporting

§ 35.009 SUIT FOR COLLECTION OF TAX.
   (A)   The Tax Officer may sue in the name of the political subdivision
within the TCD for the recovery of taxes due and unpaid under this subchapter.
   (B)   Any suit brought to recover the tax imposed by this subchapter shall
be begun within three years after:
      (1)   Such tax is due;
      (2)   The declaration or return has been filed; or
      (3)   A redetermination of compensation or net profits by the
Pennsylvania Department of Revenue whichever date is later; provided, however,
that this limitation shall not prevent the institution of a suit for the
collection of any tax due or determined to be due in the following cases:
         (a)   Where no declaration or return was filed by any person although
a declaration or return was required to be filed by him or her under provisions
of this subchapter, there shall be no limitation;
         (b)   Where an examination of the declaration or return filed by any
person or of other evidence relating to such declaration or return in the

subchapter and has failed to pay the amounts so deducted to the Tax Officer or
where any person has willfully failed or omitted to make the deductions

was induced by fraud or misrepresentation of material fact.
   (D)   This section shall not be construed to limit the municipality from
recovering delinquent taxes by any other means provided by the Act. Further,
nothing set forth herein shall be construed to limit a Tax Officer, a tax
collection district or political subdivision from recovering delinquent taxes
by any other means provided by the Act.
(Ord. 2012-1, passed 1-9-2012; Ord. 2019-01, passed 2-12-2019)
§ 35.010 INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   (A)   Except as may be provided for in division (B) below, in the event any
tax imposed in this subchapter is not paid when due, interest shall accrue at
the same rate a taxpayer is required to pay to the Commonwealth as provided in
72 P.S. § 806, known as the Fiscal Code, or such successor legislation, on the
amount of said tax and an additional penalty of 1% of the unpaid tax for each
month or fraction thereof during which the tax remains unpaid shall be added
and collected but the amount of penalty shall not exceed 15% in the aggregate.
Where an action is brought for the recovery of tax, the taxpayer liable for the
tax shall, in addition, be liable for the costs of collection, interest and
penalties, including, but not limited to court costs and attorney fees.
   (B)   Pursuant to the Act, the Department may establish conditions under
which a Tax Officer, with the concurrence of the TCC, may abate interest or
penalties that would otherwise be imposed for the nonreporting or
underreporting of income tax liabilities or for nonpayment of taxes previously
imposed and due if the taxpayer files delinquent returns and pays the tax in
full.
   (C)   The provisions of division (B) above shall not affect or terminate any

honorable circumstances from active service if, as a result of military

shall annually file an exemption certificate with the borough and with the
person’s employer affirming that the person reasonably expects to receive
earned income and net profits from all sources within the borough of less than
$12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is filed. In
the event the borough utilizes a tax collection officer, it shall provide a
copy of the exemption certificate to that officer. The exemption certificate
shall have attached to it a copy of all the employee’s last pay stubs or W-
2 forms from employment within the borough for the year prior to the fiscal
year for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax. Upon
receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise instructed by the
borough or except as required by subsection (2), the employer shall not
withhold the tax from the person during the calendar year or the remainder of
the calendar year for which the exemption certificate forms are readily
available to employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a
form at the time of hiring.
      (2)   With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the person or
by the borough that the person has received earned income and net profits from
all sources with the borough equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar
year of that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer’s payment to the person of earned income
within the borough in an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that
calendar year, an employer shall withhold the local services tax from the
person under subsection (3).
      (3)   If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year from
the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under subsection (2),
the employer shall withhold the tax for the remainder of that calendar year,
the employer shall withhold from the person, for the first payroll period after
receipt of the notification under subsection (2), a lump sum equal to the
amount of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per payroll amount due
for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld per payroll period
for the remaining payroll periods in that calendar year shall be the same
amount withheld for other employees. In the event the employment of a person
subject to withholding of the tax under this clause is subsequently severed in
that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any outstanding balance of
tax due, and the borough may pursue collection under this act.
      (4)   Except as provided in subsection (2), it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating exemption
certificates, monitoring tax exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption
eligibility or exempting any employee from a local services tax.

in a calendar year that do not exceed $1. The Borough Manager or the Collector
shall determine eligibility for refunds to exempt persons and provide refunds.

§ 35.029 DUTY OF EMPLOYERS TO COLLECT.
   (A)   Each employer within the borough, as well as those employers situated
outside the borough who engage in business within the borough, is hereby
charged with the duty of collecting the tax from each of his or her employees
engaged by him or her or performing for him or her within the borough and
making a return and payment thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is
hereby authorized to deduct this tax from each employee in his or her employ,
whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and whether or not
all such services are performed within the borough.
   (B)   A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro
rata share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person for a
payroll period shall be determined by dividing the combined rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods established by
the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of determining the pro rata
share, an employer shall round down the amount of the tax collected each
payroll period to the nearest one-hundredth of a dollar. Collection of the tax
shall be made on a payroll period in which the person is engaging in an
occupation, except as provided in division (D) of this section. For purposes of
this division, COMBINED RATE shall mean the aggregate annual rate of the tax
levied by the school district and the borough.
   (C)   No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
   (D)   In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement from a
principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the length of the
payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a statement from the
employee that the pay statement is from the employee’s principal employer and
the employee will notify other employers of a change in principal place of
employment within two weeks of its occurrence. The employee’s statement shall
be provided on the form approved by DCED.
   (E)   The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The borough shall provide a taxpayer a receipt of
payment upon request by the taxpayer.
   (F)   No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or
for the payment of the withheld tax money to the borough if the failure to
withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the employee as
to the employee’s place or places of employment, the employee’s principal
office or where the employee is principally employed. Further, an employer
shall not be liable for payment of the local services tax in an amount
exceeding the amount withheld by the employer if the employer complies with the
provisions of §
35.029(B) and this section and remits the amount so withheld in accordance with
this subchapter.
   (G)   Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.

fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her to
an employee, except as provided hereafter in this subchapter, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.
(Ord. 1, passed 1-7-2008)
§ 35.031 DATES FOR DETERMINING TAX LIABILITY AND PAYMENT.

calendar quarter of each such tax year.
(Ord. 1, passed 1-7-2008)
§ 35.032 SELF-EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS.

pro rata portion of the tax due to the Collector on or before the 30th day
following the end of each quarter.
(Ord. 1, passed 1-7-2008) Penalty, see §
35.999
§ 35.033 INDIVIDUALS ENGAGED IN MORE THAN ONE OCCUPATION OR EMPLOYED IN MORE
THAN ONE POLITICAL SUBDIVISION.
   (A)   The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day
the person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the event
a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is, concurrent
employment, or an occupation which requires the person working in more than one
political subdivision during a payroll period, the priority of claim to collect
the local services tax shall be in the following order:
      (1)   First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
      (2)   Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision; and
      (3)   Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
   (B)   In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that
calendar year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.

engage in any occupation or profession within the borough do, by virtue
thereof, agree to be bound by and subject themselves to the provisions,
penalties and regulations promulgated under this subchapter with the same force
and effect as though they were residents of the borough. Further, any
individual engaged in an occupation with the borough and an employee of a
nonresidential employer may, for the purpose of this subchapter, be considered
a self-employed person, and in the event his or her tax is not paid, the
borough shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer of
employee for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.

nonpayment thereof, where suit is brought for the recovery of this tax or other

MERCANTILE LICENSE AND BUSINESS PRIVILEGE TAXES GENERAL REGULATIONS
§ 36.050 INTRODUCTION.
   Individuals or entities conducting business in the borough are required to
comply with the borough’s business privilege tax and mercantile license tax
provisions, referred to collectively herein as the “tax provisions” and to pay
a business privilege and/or mercantile tax to the borough. These regulations
provide a formal interpretation of the tax provisions and shall be construed,
whenever possible, to be consistent with the tax provisions. In the event that
these regulations are inconsistent with the tax provisions, the provisions of
the tax provisions shall prevail.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.051 DEFINITIONS.
   Words used in the business privilege tax ordinance, the mercantile license
tax ordinance, and/or these regulations, but not defined in the tax provisions,
these regulations, by state statute, or by the state judiciary, will be
interpreted using the common and ordinary meaning afforded to such words in a
local tax context. Any taxpayer may request in writing a written determination
of taxability from the Tax Collector with respect to the application of the
provisions of the tax provisions or these regulations. For the purpose of §§
36.050 through
36.057,
36.070 through
36.081,
36.095 through
36.099 and
36.110 through
36.121, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly
indicates or requires a different meaning.
   AGENT. A person with the legal authority to act on behalf of another, called
a principal.
   ALLOCATION OF GROSS RECEIPTS. The calculation of a share of total gross
receipts for a particular base of operations when more than one base of
operations exists. The allocation formula is based on a single payroll factor.
   APPORTIONMENT OF GROSS RECEIPTS. The calculation of a share of gross
receipts to be included in the tax base, resulting from the performance of
services in Philadelphia and/or outside the state, by or in conjunction with a
base of operations with substantial nexus with the borough. See §
36.057 regarding interstate commerce for apportionment formula and
applicability.
   ASSESSMENT. The determination of the amount of tax principal, penalty and/or
interest due by a taxpayer.
   ATTRIBUTION. The process of specifically identifying gross receipts directly
or indirectly connected to a particular base of operations of the taxpayer.
   BASE OF OPERATIONS.
      (1)   A physical location used by a taxpayer to conduct significant
business activities.
      (2)   Indicia of significant business activities include, but are not
limited to:
         (a)   Providing workers with a place to work;
         (b)   Providing a base from which operations are managed, directed or
controlled;
         (c)   Storage of inventory or other business assets;
         (d)   Administrative, executive or marketing activities, including
meetings;
         (e)   Maintaining business records;
         (f)   Business communications via telephone, fax, mail or electronic
means;
         (g)   Utilization of business equipment;
         (h)   The holding out to others, through the use of signage,
advertising, legal registry or stationery to indicate a business location; and
         (i)   Rental or sublet of real estate by a landlord or tenant.
      (3)   Whether a location constitutes a BASE OF OPERATIONS is a factual
determination based upon the totality of the circumstances, and no one factor
is necessarily controlling. A taxpayer with a single location is deemed to have
a BASE OF OPERATIONS at that location. A taxpayer claiming that a location is
not a BASE OF OPERATIONS, must demonstrate that another location functions as a
BASE OF OPERATIONS. A taxpayer claiming multiple business locations has the
burden of proof to demonstrate that any given location constitutes a BASE OF
OPERATIONS as defined herein.
      (4)   HOME OFFICE. An area of a personal residence is recognized as a
BASE OF OPERATIONS if it is used for business, and no other BASE OF OPERATIONS
is reasonably available to conduct business activities. A HOME OFFICE used for
the convenience of an employee, owner or other worker, does not qualify as a
BASE OF OPERATIONS. Use of a HOME OFFICE is deemed to be simply for the
convenience of an employee or owner, if there is another business office where
the same activities are performed.
      (5)   Use of a customer’s or client’s facility by a taxpayer does not
qualify as a BASE OF OPERATIONS of the taxpayer if the business activity at the
facility by the taxpayer is incidental with respect to the taxpayer’s overall
business activity. Business activity of sufficient size, duration and
complexity will constitute a BASE OF OPERATIONS of the taxpayer.
         (a)   Example 1.
            1.   A consultant with no office in the borough spends three weeks
working at a client’s location in the borough. The client provides the
consultant with a place to work and access to other facilities during the three
weeks. The consultant also works at other client locations and at his or her
own office.
            2.   The consultant does not have a base of operations at his or
her client’s location because the activity in the borough lacks sufficient
size, duration and complexity.
         (b)   Example 2.
            1.   A property management firm headquartered outside the borough
manages a building located in the borough under a three-year service contract.
Several full-time employees of the management firm provide maintenance and
administrative services, on a daily basis, and exclusively at the building in
the borough. The building owner provides office space and a maintenance
facility for the use of the property management firm’s employees.
            2.   The property management firm has a BASE OF OPERATIONS in the
borough because the business activity is of sufficient size, duration and
complexity.
      (6)   Real estate located in North York Borough constitutes a BASE OF
OPERATIONS of the owner, of the lessee and of the operator.
   BOROUGH. The Borough of North York, a municipality located in York County
and a political subdivision of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
   BROKER. In general, is one who holds himself or herself out for employment
by others, and acts as an intermediate negotiator between parties to a
transaction, and in a sense is the agent of both parties. The determination of
who is a BROKER is fact specific. In industries that require a specific license
to act as a BROKER, BROKER is defined by the requirements for the specific
license.
   BUSINESS ACTIVITY. Any significant participation, by a person, to offer a
service or sale to another, or to engage in commercial transactions.
   COMMONWEALTH. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
   EXEMPT FROM TAX or EXEMPT. Refers to the status of persons not subject to
the borough’s business privilege tax and/or mercantile license tax under the
laws of the Commonwealth, for example, institutions of purely public charity,
government entities or manufacturers. See §
36.056.
   EXEMPTION. Also refers to certain receipts excluded from gross receipts and
not subject to tax as provided by state law, borough ordinance or these
regulations. Similarly, nontaxable receipts are also referred to as
“exclusions”’in the ordinances and regulations. Any person claiming exemption
from tax or an exclusion of gross receipts has the burden to demonstrate his or
her legal right to such EXEMPTION or exclusion.
   GROSS RECEIPTS. A term used in the business privilege tax, is defined by the
business privilege tax ordinance, as codified in §§
36.025 through
36.035.
   GROSS VOLUME OF BUSINESS. A term used in the mercantile license tax and
defined by mercantile license tax ordinance, as codified in §§
36.001 through
36.011, generally is intended to be synonymous with the definition of gross
receipts as stated in the business privilege tax ordinance §
36.026.
   MANUFACTURING. Consists of the application of labor and skill to material
whereby the original article is changed into a new, different and useful
article. Whether or not an article is a manufactured product depends upon
whether or not it has gone through a substantial transformation in form,
qualities and adaptability in use from the original material, so that a new
article or creation has emerged. See §
36.056(B)(6).
   PERSON. Any individual, partnership, limited partnership, association,
corporation, limited liability company, estate, trust, trustee, fiduciary or
any other legally recognized entity, except such as are wholly exempt from
taxation under the Act of December 31, 1965, P.L. 1257, as amended (Act 511),
being 53 P.S. §§ 6924.101 et seq. and the Institutions of Purely Public Charity
Act (Act 55).

seeking to determine whether a person is subject to tax. TAXPAYER also includes
such a person.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.052 WHO MUST FILE A RETURN.
   (A)   Every person who has carried on or exercised business activity
connected to a base of operations within the borough must file a mercantile and
business privilege tax return, whether or not tax is due.
   (B)   Tax returns are filed at the business entity level. In the case of a
partnership, for example, the partnership entity, rather than the individual
partners, should file the tax return and pay the tax.
      (1)   Mercantile license tax. Wholesale and retail vendors or dealers in
goods, wares and merchandise and operators of restaurants and other places
where food or beverages are sold, are subject to the mercantile license tax.
      (2)   Business privilege tax. All other persons doing business within the
borough (primarily service providers) are subject to the business privilege
tax.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.053 SUBJECT AND IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   The business privilege tax and the mercantile license tax are levied on the
privilege of doing business in the borough. A person exercises the privilege of
doing business by engaging in any commercial or business activity with a
substantial connection to a base of operations in the borough to promote the
sale of goods or services.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.054 BASE AND RATE OF TAX.
   (A)   Tax base. The tax is based on gross receipts attributable or allocable
to doing business in the borough. To determine whether gross receipts are
attributable to doing business in the borough, see §
36.055. Receipts from certain activities are excluded from taxation, see §§
36.056 and
36.057.
   (B)   Tax rate. The business privilege tax and the mercantile license tax
impose tax rates as set forth in §§
36.001 through
36.011 and
36.025 through
36.035, and as may be changed from time to time by ordinance.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.055 DETERMINATION OF GROSS RECEIPTS; ATTRIBUTION, ALLOCATION AND
APPORTIONMENT OF GROSS RECEIPTS.
   Generally, in determining the tax base, the attribution or allocation of
receipts among multiple bases of operations, and the apportionment of receipts
with interstate characteristics, must fairly reflect the business activity
connected to a base of operations in the borough and avoid the possibility of
double taxation.
   (A)   Attribution. Attribution is the process of specifically identifying
gross receipts directly or indirectly connected to a particular base of
operations of the taxpayer.
      (1)   For taxpayers with a single base of operations, 100% of intrastate
gross receipts will be attributed to that single base of operations. Receipts
cannot be attributed to job sites, or customer or subcontractor locations that
do not qualify as a base of operations of the taxpayer.
      (2)   For taxpayers with multiple bases of operations, gross receipts
resulting from business activity managed, controlled or directed from a base of
operations are attributed to that base of operations. Receipts will be
considered attributable to a base of operations in the borough if any
significant aspect of the transaction occurs or arises out of that base of
operations in the borough. Generally, receipts paid to a particular base of
operations will be attributed to that base of operations. A taxpayer with more
than one base of operations must maintain accounting records to support
attribution of receipts to the various business locations.
         (a)   Example 1.
            1.   A plumbing contractor has a single business location in the
borough. He or she provides services to customers in numerous surrounding
municipalities.
            2.   One hundred percent of his or her gross receipts are
attributed to his or her North York Borough base of operations because all work
is managed, directed and controlled from his or her sole business location.
         (b)   Example 2.
            1.   An engineering firm has two offices; one in North York Borough
and another in Allentown. The firm separately accounts for revenues and
expenses for each location.
            2.   Gross receipts separately identified for the North York
Borough location are attributed to North York Borough. Gross receipts
attributed to the Allentown base of operations are excluded from the North York
Borough tax base, provided no part of the Allentown activity is managed,
directed or controlled from the North York Borough office.
      (3)   Gross receipts must be determined through attribution if possible.
If determination of gross receipts through attribution is not possible, gross
receipts are determined through allocation. If attribution of receipts under
this section does not accurately or fairly reflect a taxpayer’s activity
connected to a base of operations in the borough, the Tax Collector may
determine gross receipts using the allocation or apportionment formulas.
   (B)   Allocation. Allocation is the calculation of a share of total gross
receipts for a particular base of operations when more than one base of
operations exist, and the taxpayer is unable to determine gross receipts
through attribution. The allocation formula is based on a single payroll
factor.
      (1)   The allocation of gross receipts for a particular base of
operations is calculated by multiplying total gross receipts by a fraction, the
numerator of which is payroll for workers connected with a particular base of
operations, and the denominator of which is total payroll for all locations.
      (2)   (a)   For the purpose of computing the payroll factor other forms
of compensation must be included when relevant. Other forms of compensation may
include: self-employment income of a proprietor or a single member of a limited
liability company; an active partner’s share of partnership income; an active
member’s share of the income of a limited liability company; or an active
shareholder’s ordinary income from an “S” corporation.
         (b)   Example:
            1.   A law firm is based in North York Borough and has a second
office in West Chester. The accounting system does not segregate receipts by
location. Gross receipts total $1,225,000 for the year. Total payroll and
partners’ compensation is $860,000. Payroll and partners’ compensation for
workers based in North York Borough is $570,000.
            2.   The allocation of gross receipts to the North York Borough
office is as follows: Payroll Allocation Factor = $570,000/$860,000 or 66.3%.
 
Total Gross Receipts $1,225,000
Allocation Factor    X 66.3%
Borough Receipts     $812,175
 
      (3)   If a taxpayer has no payroll or payroll cannot be identified by
location, the square footage of each base of operations must be used to
determine the allocation factor.
      (4)   (a)   Furthermore, the Tax Collector may authorize the use of
another objective and measurable basis of allocation when unusual circumstances
exist that result in an allocation that does not fairly reflect the activity
connected to a base of operations in Springettsbury Township. In such
circumstances, the taxpayer must request authorization in writing to use a
method of allocation other than payroll or square footage, and such
authorization is prospective in nature.
         (b)   Example:
            1.   A taxpayer owns and operates two coin-operated laundromats,
one in North York Borough and one in a neighboring municipality. Receipts are
not tracked separately for each location. There is no payroll.
            2.   The Tax Collector may authorize the taxpayer to allocate gross
receipts using a formula based on the water usage for each location as
reflected on the water or sewer invoices.
   (C)   Apportionment. Apportionment of gross receipts is the calculation of a
share of gross receipts to be included in the tax base, resulting from the
performance of services in Philadelphia and/or outside the state, by or in
conjunction with a base of operations in North York Borough. See §
36.057 regarding interstate commerce for apportionment formula and
applicability.
   (D)   Taxpayers subject to Philadelphia business privilege tax.
      (1)   Philadelphia imposes its business privilege tax under a different
state law than other Pennsylvania municipalities. Philadelphia may impose its
business privilege tax on taxpayers that do not have a base of operations in
Philadelphia. In order to avoid the possibility of double taxation, taxpayers
subject to the Philadelphia business privilege tax may apportion gross receipts
subject to tax in Philadelphia.
      (2)   Apportionment of gross receipts subject to tax in Philadelphia will
be made under the following formula:
 
(Receipts within Pennsylvania x 100%) - (Receipts within Pennsylvania x
Philadelphia apportionment factor) = Gross receipts included in tax base
 
      (3)   (a)   The Philadelphia apportionment factor shall be the product of
averaging the following percentages:
            1.   Wages, salaries, commissions and other compensation in
Philadelphia, as a percentage of total Pennsylvania wages, salaries,
commissions and other compensation;
            2.   Value of the tangible personal property and real property
owned or leased and situated within Philadelphia as a percentage of total
Pennsylvania tangible personal and real property owned or leased. The value of
leased property is eight times the annual rental, for the purpose of this
calculation; and
            3.   Philadelphia gross receipts, as a percentage of total
Pennsylvania gross receipts.
         (b)   Example:
            1.   A taxpayer based in North York Borough operates a janitorial
service and has total Pennsylvania receipts of $1,000,000, and total
Pennsylvania payroll of $450,000; the value of owned and leased property in
Pennsylvania is $650,000. Gross receipts from services performed in
Philadelphia were $220,000, and Philadelphia wages totaled $88,000. Cleaning
equipment kept at customer locations in Philadelphia had a value of $7,500. The
taxpayer has no Philadelphia base of operations.
            2.   a.   Gross receipts subject to North York Borough’s business
privilege tax are as follows: Pennsylvania gross receipts @ 100% = $1,000,000
               b.   Less: receipts apportioned to Philadelphia by formula:
Philadelphia Wages    $88,000                                    = 19.56%
Pennsylvania Wages    $450,000
Philadelphia Property $7,500                                     = 1.15%
Pennsylvania Property $650,000
Philadelphia Receipts $220,000                                   = 22.00%
Pennsylvania Receipts $1,000,000
                      Total All Percentages:                     42.71%
Philadelphia apportionment factor = Average of percentages (divide total by
3) = 14.24%
Pennsylvania receipts ($1,000,000) x 14.24% receipts apportioned = ($142,400)
to Philadelphia
                      Borough Gross Receipts:                    $857,600
Note: the percentages for wages, property and receipts, used in the
apportionment formula must be consistent with those reported by a taxpayer on
its Philadelphia business privilege tax return, a copy of which should be
attached to the taxpayer’s North York borough’s bp/mercantile tax return.
 
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.056 EXEMPTIONS AND EXCLUSIONS.
   (A)   Any person claiming exemption from tax or claiming an exclusion of
gross receipts has the burden to demonstrate his or her legal right to such
exemption or exclusion.
   (B)   As a condition to claiming any exemptions or exclusions, a taxpayer
must disclose on his or her tax return its total gross receipts and then
itemize any claimed exclusions and exemptions on a separate schedule that
should be attached to and submitted with the tax return.
      (1)   State preemption.
         (a)   Generally. Persons with activity which has been judicially
determined to be preempted by the Commonwealth may exclude receipts from such
activity from taxable receipts. To date, local taxation has been preempted by
the Commonwealth only as to the banking industry, the sale of insurance
contracts subject to the state gross premiums tax, the alcoholic beverage
industry and harness racing. Preemption has been judicially determined not to
exist as to attorneys, the real estate industry, nursing homes and the
securities industry.
         (b)   Important note. Preemption does not relieve a taxpayer from all
municipal taxation. Gross receipts which are unrelated to the aspect of
business operations the taxation and regulation of which has been preempted by
the Commonwealth remain subject to tax by the borough. Taxable activity does
not lose its character as such merely through association with preempted
activity.
      (2)   Duplicate state tax. In the event the Commonwealth imposes a tax on
the same subject matter as is taxed by the borough, and the state tax is
measured by the same gross receipts sought to be taxed by the borough, the
state tax shall prevail, and the same subject shall not also be taxed by the
borough.
      (3)   Governmental entities. Agencies of the government of the United
States, the various states and the Commonwealth, and any political subdivision
thereof, are not subject to the tax.
      (4)   Utilities. Receipts from utility services provided by any person
whose rates of service are fixed and regulated by the Pennsylvania Public
Utility Commission are excluded from taxable receipts. Receipts from ancillary
activities not governed by rate regulation are subject to tax.
      (5)   Tax exempt nonprofit corporations or associations.
         (a)   A tax exempt nonprofit corporation or organization is an
institution that qualifies as a Pennsylvania Purely Public Charity. To quality,
an organization must pass all parts of the following five part test.
         (b)   An institution must:
            1.   Advance a charitable purpose (requires I.R.C. § 501(c)(3)
status);
            2.   Operate entirely free from private profit motive;
            3.   Donate or render gratuitously a substantial portion of its
services;
            4.   Benefit legitimate subjects of charity; and
            5.   Relieve the government of some of its burden.
         (c)   The exemption for such purely public charities is limited to
activities connected to the organization’s charitable purpose. The exemption
does not extend to activities competing commercially with any person subject to
the tax.
            1.   Example: a church meets the five-part test of a purely public
charity and is exempt from the business privilege tax. However, this church has
a large hall that is rented to parishioners and/or to non-parishioners for
wedding receptions and parties.
            2.   The gross receipts from the rental activity are subject to tax
because it is unrelated to the church’s charitable purpose. Also the rental
activity competes with other businesses that are subject to the tax.
         (d)   Receipts generated from sales to religious, charitable,
educational, governmental or other entities not themselves subject to the tax,
are not excluded from taxable gross receipts.
      (6)   Manufacturers, producers and processors of by-products of
manufacture.
         (a)   Generally. Receipts generated by engaging in the following
activities (described more fully below) are not subject to the tax:
            1.   Manufacturing;
            2.   Producing; and
            3.   Processing of by-products of manufacturing.
         (b)   Manufacturing.
            1.   Manufacturing consists of the application of labor and skill
to material whereby the original article is changed into a new, different and
useful article. Whether or not an article is a manufactured product depends
upon whether or not it has gone through a substantial transformation in form,
qualities and adaptability in use from the original material, so that a new
article or creation has emerged.
            2.   Whether an activity constitutes manufacturing for purposes of
the business privilege or mercantile tax depends on the facts involved and each
question is reviewed on a case-by-case basis. State courts have held that
manufacturing includes commercial bookbinding, production of apparel,
lithography, commercial printing, oil refining and steel milling. The courts
have determined that manufacturing does not include: radio and television
broadcasting; steel annealing and galvanizing; commercial illustration; work
product which is primarily intellectual or clerical in nature (e.g., work of an
attorney, architect, computer software engineer and the like); scrap metal
bundling; dyeing and finishing of cloth; purification through pasteurization,
filtration and testing for bacteria and impurities; the preparation of potato
salad, coleslaw, bread filling and like examples of “cooking;” adding water to
concentrated juice slurry or powdered drink mix to make a finished product; and
printing designs and wording on ready-made clothing.
            3.   Whether a particular activity qualifies as “manufacturing” or
“processing” under the provisions of the Pennsylvania Capital Stock and
Franchise Tax is not dispositive in determining whether receipts are excludable
for purposes of the borough tax.
         (c)   Producers.
            1.   The production, preparation or processing of natural resources
or farm products (by manufacturers, producers and farmers with respect to the
goods, articles and products of their own manufacture, production or growth) is
not subject to the tax.
            2.   Example: taxpayer owns an organically grown vegetable farm and
sells to a specialty grocery store. Taxpayer’s receipts are excluded from the
tax.
         (d)   Processing by-products of manufacturing.
            1.   By-products of manufacturing consist of secondary or
additional products produced in addition to a principal product. Processing of
by-products is not taxable activity, whether performed by the original
manufacturer or by others.
               a.   Example 1:
                  i.   Taxpayer takes molten slag, a waste product discarded by
a steel manufacturer, and subjects it to a process which enables the iron
component to be separated and sold back to the steel manufacturer.
                  ii.   Taxpayer’s activity of processing by-products of
manufacturing is not subject to the tax.
               b.   Example 2:
                  i.   Taxpayer is in the business of annealing and galvanizing
rolls of steel thereby making the steel more malleable.
                  ii.   Taxpayer’s activity is not manufacturing since no “new”
product is created; nor is it “processing of a by-product of manufacturing”
because rolls of steel are not secondary or additional products, but are
themselves the principal product of the original manufacturer.
            2.   Receipts excludable under this division (B)(6)(d)2. are
excluded whether the product is manufactured, produced or processed within or
outside of the borough.
               a.   Example:
                  i.   Taxpayer manufactures computer equipment in New York. It
then leases or sells the equipment to customers within the borough.
                  ii.   Receipts from sale or lease of equipment by the
manufacturer thereof are not subject to the tax.
               b.   Receipts excludable under this division (B)(6)(d)2.b. are
excluded whether the product is sold to others or used by the taxpayer in its
own operation. Example:
                  i.   Taxpayer produces asphalt both for sale to others and
for its own use in fulfillment of paving contracts.
                  ii.   Taxpayer is entitled to exclude receipts from sale of
product to others, plus an additional amount equal to the cost of producing
product for its own use.
               c.   A manufacturer’s receipts from activities other than
manufacturing are not excluded. Example:
                  i.   Twenty percent of the gross receipts realized by
taxpayer, a manufacturer of small engine parts, are generated by providing
maintenance services for products not manufactured by taxpayer.
                  ii.   Receipts from such unrelated activity are not excluded.
      (7)   Receipts excluded from gross receipts (exclusions). State law or
the tax provisions provide that the following specified receipts are excluded
in the computation of tax:
         (a)   Freight delivery or transportation charges paid by the seller
for the purchaser;
         (b)   Sales of trade-ins, up to the amount given the prior owner as a
trade-in allowance;
         (c)   Refunds, credits or allowances given customers for defective
goods returned;
         (d)   Taxes collected as agent for the United States of America or the
Commonwealth or the borough other than for the payment of the borough business
privilege or mercantile tax;
         (e)   Exchanges between sellers of identical goods, but not to the
extent of any additional cash payment accompanying the exchange;
         (f)   Sales to other sellers in the same line of business at the same
price for which the seller acquired the merchandise;
         (g)   Transfers between one department, branch or division of a
business entity and another, recorded as interdepartmental transfers;
         (h)   In the case of a financial business, the costs of securities and
other property sold, exchanged, paid at maturity or redeemed and moneys or
credits received in repayment of advances, credits and loans (not to exceed the
principal amount of such advances, credits and loans) and deposits; and
         (i)   Payments received by an agent for the account of his or her
principal are excluded by the agent. The exclusion is limited to the amount
subsequently remitted to such principal. See §
36.076.
      (8)   Important note. Section 300-39 of the borough business privilege
tax provisions excludes from gross receipts certain commissions and fees
between brokers. It has been judicially determined that this type of broker
exclusion violates the uniformity requirement, and is therefore
unconstitutional in the state. Consequently, the invalid provision is severed
and the broker exclusion is no longer allowed.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.057 INTERSTATE COMMERCE.
   (A)   Gross receipts resulting from transactions with interstate
characteristics are includable in the tax base on an apportioned basis,
provided the activity that produced the receipts had a substantial nexus to a
base of operations in the borough. “Transactions with interstate
characteristics” within the meaning of this section include the performance of
services by a taxpayer outside the state and the sale and delivery of goods to
a non-Pennsylvania buyer in another state or country. The sale of interstate
passenger tickets constitutes transactions with interstate characteristics.
   (B)   Apportionment of gross receipts will be made under the following
formula:
 
(Total gross receipts x apportionment factor) = Gross receipts apportioned to
the state
 
   (C)   The apportionment factor shall be the product of averaging the total
of the following percentages:
      (1)   (a)   Wages, salaries, commissions and other compensation in the
state, as a percentage of total wages, salaries, commissions and other
compensation; and
         (b)   For the purpose of computing the payroll factor, other forms of
compensation must be included when relevant. Other forms of compensation may
include self-employment income of a proprietor or a single member of a limited
liability company, an active partner’s share of partnership income, an active
member’s share of the income of a limited liability company, or an active
shareholder’s ordinary income from an “S” corporation.
      (2)   Value of the tangible personal property and real property owned or
leased and situated within the state as a percentage of total tangible personal
and real property owned or leased. The value of leased property is eight times
the annual rental, for the purpose of this calculation; and
      (3)   Gross receipts from state sales and/or services, as a percentage of
total gross receipts from sales and/or services.
   (D)   The Tax Collector may authorize unequal weighting of the three factors
when unusual circumstances exist such that a straight average results in an
apportionment that does not fairly reflect the activity connected to a base of
operations in the borough. In such circumstances, the taxpayer must request
authorization in writing to use an unequal weighting of the factors and the Tax
Collector, in his or her discretion, may grant or deny such authorization in
writing. In no event shall any of the three factors be weighted less than 20%.
   (E)   For taxpayers whose only base of operations is located in the borough,
the tax base constitutes gross receipts apportioned to the state.
   (F)   For taxpayers with more than one base of operations in the state,
gross receipts apportioned to the state may be further allocated. Refer to §
36.055 of these regulations for provisions governing attribution or allocation
of receipts between or among multiple Pennsylvania locations.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.058 WAIVER OF INTEREST/PENALTIES.
   The following policy is adopted as the borough/township’s uniform policy
related to relief requested from interest and/or penalty associated with the
collection of delinquent business privilege and mercantile license tax (“MBP
tax”):
   (A)   if a delinquent taxpayer voluntarily approaches the York Adams Tax
Bureau (“YATB”) prior to receipt of any delinquent or non-filing notice from
the YATB and within 30 days of such approach, (1) files all delinquent tax
returns and 2) makes payment of all delinquent MBP tax, then the YATB, in its
discretion, may waive the interest and penalty associated therewith.
   (B)   If, after receipt of a delinquent or non-filing notice from YATB, the
delinquent taxpayer
(1) files all delinquent tax returns and (2) makes payment of all delinquent
MBP tax, within 30 days of receipt of such notice, then the YATB, in its
discretion, may waive the penalty associated therewith only.
(Res. 2019-09, passed 10-8-2019)
PARTICULAR BUSINESSES OR TRANSACTIONS
§ 36.070 GENERAL APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   Gross receipts of any taxpayer include the gross amount of cash,
credit or property of any kind or nature received in both cash and credit
transactions allocable or attributable to the borough by reason of any sale
made, service rendered or commercial or business transactions in connection
with any business, trade, occupation or profession.
   (B)   Gross receipts upon which the tax is imposed are undiminished by any
costs of doing business, other than as specifically provided in §
36.056.
   (C)   Gross receipts may be measured using the cash or accrual method of
accounting, provided the return is filed in accordance with the method of
accounting regularly employed in keeping the books of the taxpayer and the
method is consistent from year to year. Use of the completed-contract or
percentage-of-completion methods of accounting is prohibited for the purpose of
determining gross receipts.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.071 ADMINISTRATIVE OR EXECUTIVE OFFICES.
   Maintaining a base of operations in the borough used for administrative or
executive activities is an exercise of a business privilege and is subject to
the tax. Administrative and executive functions contribute to the management
and control of business operations. Gross receipts attributed to administrative
or executive offices are determined in accordance with §
36.055.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.072 AFFILIATED COMPANIES.
   (A)   Gross receipts from transactions between separate entities, affiliated
through direct or indirect common ownership, are included in taxable gross
receipts.
   (B)   Example:
      (1)   Taxpayer is a wholly-owned corporate subsidiary of ABC Company. All
of ABC’s accounting and administrative functions are performed by taxpayer.
Taxpayer bills ABC a “management fee” equal to its costs and expenses so that,
by design, no profit is generated by taxpayer. ABC purports to “reimburse”
taxpayer all of its expenses.
      (2)   So long as taxpayer and ABC Company are separate legal entities,
the intercompany management fees paid by ABC to taxpayer are taxable gross
receipts.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.073 RECEIPTS FROM LEASE, USE OR RENTAL OF PERSONAL OR REAL PROPERTY.
   Receipts from the lease, use or rental of personal or real property are
deemed to be receipts from the performance of services and subject to the
business privilege tax.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.074 “UNEARNED” RECEIPTS.
   (A)   Gross receipts from unearned investment income, such as interest,
dividends and gain on the sale of capital assets, are generally included in the
tax base if the receipts are in connection with a business activity or business
transactions. The investment of business assets is deemed to be in connection
with business transactions. For purposes of calculating gain on sale of capital
assets, adjusted cost basis may be deducted from the gross sales price.
   (B)   Unearned investment income may be excluded if any one of the following
conditions is met:
      (1)   The taxpayer has no business activity (see §
36.051 for the definition of business activity);
      (2)   The investment activity does not qualify as a business activity,
and the taxpayer has no other business activity; and
      (3)   The taxpayer’s business activity is exempt from the business
privilege tax. In the case where the taxpayer has both exempt and non-exempt
business activities, gross receipts from unearned investment income may be pro-
rated.
         (a)   Example 1:
            1.   A taxpayer owns and operates an apartment building. The
taxpayer sells the building for $2,500,000. The original cost of the building
was $1,200,000. Because of capital improvements and depreciation taken, the
adjusted cost basis of the building was $700,000 at the time of sale.
            2.   The taxpayer must include $1,800,000 ($2,500,000 - $700,000
NBV) as gross receipts from the sale of the building for business privilege tax
purposes. The building is a business asset connected to the taxpayer’s business
activity of apartment leasing.
         (b)   Example 2:
            1.   An individual actively manages his or her own portfolio of
stocks, bonds and other investment instruments on his or her own account.
Interest, dividends and capital gains from the investment activity exceed
$100,000 annually. The investor has no other business activity.
            2.   The gross receipts from the investment activity are not
subject to the business privilege tax because the investment activity does not
qualify as a business activity, and the taxpayer has no other business
activity. A business activity must involve offering a service or sale to
another. Self-management by an individual of his or her own investments is not
a business activity.
         (c)   Example 3:
            1.   An educational institution is exempt from tax as a purely
public charity. Eighty percent of the institution’s gross receipts are from
educational related sources, and 20% are from rental activities involving third
parties. The institution also received $50,000 in interest income during the
year.
            2.   The institution is subject to the business privilege tax on
its non-exempt rental receipts. Also included in the tax base is $10,000 of
interest income on a pro-rated basis ($50,000 x 20%).
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.075 ACCOUNTANTS, ARCHITECTS, ENGINEERS, ATTORNEYS, CONSULTANTS AND OTHER
PERSONS PROVIDING PROFESSIONAL SERVICES.
   Any professional who maintains a base of operations in the borough, except
as an employee of another, is subject to tax on his or her entire gross
receipts regardless of the location of his or her client, except for receipts
allocated or apportioned in accordance with §§
36.050 through
36.057 of these regulations.
   (A)   Example 1: physicians. A physician with a base of operations in the
borough, who also renders services at a hospital or other location outside of
the borough, must clearly demonstrate that the other location constitutes a
base of operations, in order to attribute receipts thereto. If the only base of
operations is in the borough, all gross receipts will be attributed to the
borough.
   (B)   Example 2: attorneys. An attorney-client relationship may be
equivalent to an agent- principal relationship. Accordingly, an attorney may
exclude that portion of the receipts from legal services which are distributed
directly to or on behalf of a client, such as the distribution of funds
recovered in a lawsuit, the sale of real estate, or the proceeds in a
collection matter, but only in accordance with the provisions of §
36.076.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.076 PRINCIPALS AND AGENTS.
   (A)   Revenue collections by agent. Gross receipts from revenues received by
an agent for the account of his or her principal are to be reported by the
principal. It is immaterial whether the client or customer remits directly to
the principal or the agent for transmittal to the principal. The agent is
required to report the commission withheld by him or her as compensation for
his or her services before remitting to his or her principal and/or any
commission paid to him or her after the receipts are remitted to his or her
principal. An agent is also required to include in gross receipts other
receipts not for the account of his or her principal. No deduction from gross
receipts may be taken by the principal for commission paid to or withheld by
the agent.
   (B)   Dollar-for-dollar payments and reimbursements.
      (1)   Money or property received by an agent for transmittal to a third
party on behalf of his or her principal or as a reimbursement of such a
transmittal, is not to be reported by the agent as gross receipts, provided the
receipt and/or subsequent payment contains no commission, markup or rebate. The
dollar-for-dollar requirement of such pass-through payments or reimbursements
must be documented in a written agent-principal arrangement or evidenced as a
separate item on governing invoices.
      (2)   Example:
         (a)   Taxpayer Allen (agent) is retained by Paul (principal) to
locate, purchase and arrange delivery of a specific work of art. The agreement
provides for a 10% finder’s fee and the reimbursement of certain expenses.
Allen finds, inspects and purchases the artwork in Paul’s name and has it
delivered. Allen is paid by Paul as follows:
 
Cost of artwork         $50,000 (remitted to seller)
Finder’s fee          $5,000
Delivery cost           $1,200 (paid to delivery company)
Allen’s travel expense$4,497(actual airfare, lodging and the like)
Total                   $60,697
 
         (b)   Allen must include the finder’s fee and the reimbursed travel
expenses ($6,147) in gross receipts for business privilege tax purposes. The
cost of the artwork, and the delivery charge are excluded, since these costs
were paid to third parties by Allen on behalf of Paul. Allen’s travel expenses
were incurred and paid in connection with services rendered by Allen, but these
expenses were not paid to third parties on behalf of Paul and therefore, are
not excludable.
   (C)   Factors to be considered in establishing an agency relationship. A
person will be regarded as acting as an agent for the purpose of collecting
revenue or receiving reimbursement of an expense on behalf of a principal when
all of the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The contract or agreement between such persons clearly and legally
establishes the relationship of principal and agent and is evidenced in
writing;
      (2)   The books and records of the agent show the name of the principal
on whose behalf the sale is made or the expense is incurred;
      (3)   The credit risk is assumed by the actual owner of the property or
the person for whom the service is rendered; and
      (4)   The books and records of the agent show the amount of gross
receipts and an itemization of commission due and/or other revenue or expenses.
   (D)   Manufacturer’s representative. A manufacturer’s representative will be
taxed on his or her gross commissions provided he or she does not take title to
the property being sold. Persons who take title to the property being sold will
be treated as vendors-dealers under the mercantile license tax provisions. No
deduction is allowed for commissions paid to independent sales representatives
or subagents.
   (E)   Agent as employee. Income earned as an employee is not subject to the
tax. Any agent asserting status as an employee must provide a copy of federal
form W-2 and/or such other documentation as the Tax Collector may reasonably
require to establish employment. Receipts earned by independent agents are
subject to the tax even though such persons qualify as “statutory employees”
for purposes of federal income taxation.
   (F)   Advertising: and marketing agencies. Advertising and marketing
agencies must include all gross receipts from consulting services and/or the
development and production of marketing programs and materials. No exclusion is
allowed for production costs, such as printing. Gross receipts representing the
reimbursement of advertising costs incurred by the agency on behalf of its
client (principal) may be excluded, provided that the reimbursement is dollar-
for-dollar, and the reimbursement is separately stated at cost on the agency’s
invoice.
      (1)   Example 1:
         (a)   A vendor retains a marketing agency to develop an advertising
concept, design a printed flyer, and arrange for the flyer to be distributed as
an insert through a newspaper publisher. The marketing agency also subcontracts
the printing of the flyer as part of the engagement. The contract between the
vendor and the marketing firm clearly establishes a principal agent
relationship and provides for a fixed fee of $30,000 for the design, printing
and placement of 450,000 flyers, plus the advertising fee paid to the newspaper
at cost. The agency incurs costs for subcontracted photography ($1,250),
printing ($4,675) and placement fees paid to the newspaper ($18,000). The
marketing agency invoices the vendor $48,000, showing the exact cost of the
placement fee on the face of the invoice.
         (b)   The marketing agency may exclude the $18,000 dollar-for-dollar
reimbursement of the advertising cost from gross receipts.
      (2)   Example 2:
         (a)   Same facts as Example 1, except the marketing agency takes a 15%
agency discount on the placement fee, paying the newspaper $15,300, but charges
the vendor $48,000, showing the advertising cost as $18,000 on the invoice.
         (b)   No exclusion from gross receipts is allowed by the agency
because the reimbursement was not dollar-for-dollar.
   (G)   Insurance agents, brokers and underwriters. General agents for
insurance companies are required to report as gross receipts the entire
commissions received as compensation on policies sold by them directly as well
as the overriding commissions received by them upon business produced by
brokers and subagents. Brokers and subagents are required to report as gross
receipts the commissions received as compensation for their services. No
deduction is allowed for commissions paid to solicitors, subagents, brokers or
others.
   (H)   Real estate brokers and agents.
      (1)   Real estate brokers and agents are required to report as gross
receipts the commissions and fees received for services rendered in promoting
the purchase, sale, rental and/or management of property for others. Gross
receipts include commissions on properties not located in the borough if the
transaction is handled through personnel connected to a base of operations in
the borough.
      (2)   Similarly, gross receipts include commissions on transactions
managed, controlled or directed through a borough base of operations, even
though settlement is conducted at a location outside the borough.
         (a)   No deduction from gross receipts is allowed for commissions paid
by real estate brokers to real estate agents.
         (b)   If a real estate broker takes title to real property in his or
her own name or in a straw name and sells the property, he or she is required
to include the gross selling price of the property as taxable receipts,
undiminished by the cost of the property or other expenses. However, if the
sale qualifies as the sale of a capital asset under the Internal Revenue Code,
the cost of the property may be deducted from gross receipts. See §
36.074.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.077 PERSONS WHO REPAIR, ALTER OR IMPROVE TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY.
   Persons with a base of operations in the borough, who repair, alter or
improve tangible personal property are required to include total customer
charges in gross receipts without deduction of materials or costs of any kind.
This provision applies regardless of whether or not there is a markup of the
costs to the customer. Gross receipts from work performed outside the borough
are included in the tax base unless they may be excluded through allocation or
apportionment as provided in these regulations.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.078 PERSONS ERECTING BUILDINGS OR ALTERING, REPAIRING OR IMPROVING REAL
PROPERTY.
   (A)   A contractor or subcontractor with a base of operations in the
borough, in the business of erecting buildings, or altering, repairing or
improving real property, or any other construction, installation or demolition
work, shall include in gross receipts all receipts derived from the performance
of such contract. In the case of a general contractor, prime contractor or
subcontractor, no deduction or exclusion from gross receipts is allowed for
amounts paid for materials, suppliers and/or subcontractors.
   (B)   Contractors must include in gross receipts 100% of receipts from work
in the state that is connected to a base of operations in the borough. Gross
receipts from work performed outside of the state may be apportioned in
accordance with §
36.057.
   (C)   No exclusion or deduction from gross receipts is allowed for receipts
attributed from contracts that involve the use of a job-site trailer unless
such trailer qualifies as a base of operations as specifically provided under §
36.051 (definition of base of operations).
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.079 PERSONS PAYING TAXES TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   Where a taxpayer files a return and pays a business privilege or mercantile
tax to another municipality, receipts reported to that municipality may be
excluded only if the taxpayer has a base of operations in such other
municipality and has properly attributed receipts to the base of operations in
that municipality.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.080 BUILDING OPERATORS.
   (A)   Persons operating hotels, apartment houses, boarding houses, nursing
homes, eldercare facilities, offices or commercial real property are subject to
the business privilege tax. Gross receipts include rents, management fees,
expense reimbursements (including utilities, insurance and taxes), commissions,
common area maintenance charges, furnishing of meals, and charges for any other
services rendered, and receipts connected to any business activity attributed
to a base of operations in the borough.
   (B)   Persons holding real property who employ rental agents or a real
estate management company to assist with the rental and/or management of the
property are subject to the tax.
   (C)   Persons with a base of operations in the borough and operating
buildings or other real property outside the borough must allocate receipts in
accordance with §
36.055.
   (D)   Co-operatives and/or condominium associations may exclude from gross
receipts membership dues received from unit owners so long as the receipts are
not connected to services that could be in competition with a commercial
business subject to the business privilege tax.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.081 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.
   The development of intellectual property, whether for sale, use or lease, is
a service and is subject to the business privilege tax. Intellectual property
includes, but is not limited to, works of art, inventions, software,
information systems, manuscripts and other works of authors, and other property
that can be protected by patent or copyright.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
DECLARATION AND PAYMENT OF TAX
§ 36.095 EXTENSION OF TIME FOR FILING RETURNS.
   The borough will recognize any federal extension of time to file returns for
business privilege and mercantile license tax purposes, so long as all tax is
paid to the borough by the original due date for the return(s), and a copy of
the federal extension is submitted. An extension of time to file a return is
not an extension of time to pay tax associated with the return. No extension of
time to pay tax is allowed.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.096 FILING TO BE COMPLETE.
   Returns shall be completed in full and certified as true and correct by the
taxpayer. Taxpayers must attach copies of federal tax returns, schedules and
worksheets, to support the gross receipts that are reported and to support any
claimed exclusions or exemptions. Tax returns that omit proper supporting
documentation are considered incomplete and not properly filed.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.097 BUSINESS TERMINATION.
   Any taxpayer going out of business or ceasing to do business must file a
final return within 30 days from the date the operations cease. The final
return must show the actual gross receipts generated during the tax year in
which the taxpayer ceased doing business. At the time of filing the final
return, the taxpayer must pay any tax properly due. If the final return
properly shows that excess tax has been paid due to estimated taxes previously
paid for the final year, the taxpayer shall be entitled to a refund of the
excess tax paid.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.098 ACCOUNTING METHODS (CASH OR ACCRUAL) AND PERIODS.
   The tax return may be filed on a cash basis or on an accrual basis, but the
return must be prepared in accordance with the method of accounting regularly
employed in keeping the books of the taxpayer.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.099 RECORDS TO BE KEPT.
   Every taxpayer is required to keep such accounts and records as will enable
the filing of true and accurate declarations and returns. Such accounts and
records shall be sufficiently complete to enable the Tax Collector to verify
the accuracy of the declarations or returns filed. Accounts and records are to
be preserved for a period of not less than six years from the end of the
taxable year in question.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 36.110 VERIFICATION OF RECORDS, AUDITS, RESPONSE PERIODS, PRIOR YEAR RETURNS.
   The Tax Collector, or authorized designee, is authorized to examine any of
the books, papers and records of any person or business entity who the Tax
Collector reasonably believes has engaged in taxable activity within the
borough, in order to verify the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
has been made, to arrive at a reasonable assessment of the amount of tax,
interest and penalty due.
   (A)   Issuance of subpoenas to compel attendance and production. The Tax
Collector is authorized to issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of persons
deemed by the Tax Collector to be necessary to examine as witnesses, and to
compel the production of books, records and papers relating to any person or
business entity under examination.
   (B)   Minimum time periods for taxpayer response. Taxpayers shall have at
least 30 calendar days from the mailing date to respond to an initial request
for information from the borough. The Tax Collector shall notify any taxpayer
from whom information is initially requested of the procedures to obtain an
extension of time in which to respond, and shall grant reasonable extensions of
time in which to respond for good cause shown. No action shall be taken against
a taxpayer for the tax year in question until the expiration of the response
period, including extensions.
   (C)   Inquiry as to prior year returns. Except as provided below, an initial
inquiry regarding a taxpayer’s compliance with the tax provisions may include
taxes required to be paid or tax returns required to be filed no more than
three years prior to the mailing date of the notice of such inquiry. If, after
the initial request, the Tax Collector determines that the taxpayer failed to
file a tax return, underreported income, or failed to pay a tax for one or more
of the tax periods covered by the initial request, subsequent requests for tax
returns or supporting information may be made. Subsequent requests will be
limited to two additional years (for a total of five years prior to the first
date of initial inquiry), unless the taxpayer filed no return or filed a
fraudulent return, in which case the borough may request information for
another additional year (for a total of six years prior to the first date of
initial inquiry). Note, however, that in the event the Tax Collector has
sufficient information to indicate that a taxpayer has failed to file a
required return or pay tax which was due more than three years prior to the
date of the notice, an initial request is not limited to three years and may
include as many as six years prior to the date of the initial inquiry.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.111 PROCEDURES FOR THE CONDUCT OF TAXPAYER AUDITS.
   The following procedures shall be followed during the conduct of an audit of
a taxpayer’s books and records.
   (A)   Notice of audit. The taxpayer shall be notified in writing of a
scheduled audit at least 30 days in advance. The notice of audit shall contain
the following information:
      (1)   The tax years subject to audit;
      (2)   The date, place and time for the audit to be conducted;
      (3)   A description of the information, books and records to be produced;
and
      (4)   A copy of the borough’s local taxpayer’s bill of rights disclosure
statement or a fair summary of the taxpayer’s rights and obligations under the
local taxpayers bill of rights act, together with a reference to where the
taxpayer can obtain a complete copy of the disclosure statement.
   (B)   Rescheduling audit. The taxpayer may request that the audit be
rescheduled, provided that it is rescheduled within a reasonable time not
exceeding 30 days.
   (C)   Representation at audit. The taxpayer may have a representative
present during the audit.
   (D)   Use of estimates. In the event that the information, books and records
provided by the taxpayer, are not sufficient for the purpose of verifying the
correct amount of tax, the Tax Collector is authorized to ascertain the amount
of tax due through the use of estimates.
   (E)   Audit results. In the event a notice of assessment is issued as a
result of an audit, the taxpayer shall be provided with a copy of the auditor’s
report of findings and conclusions, including the calculation of any tax,
interest and/or penalty found to be due.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.112 EXAMINATION OF RETURN, NOTICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   Examination of return.
      (1)   The Tax Collector shall examine every return as soon after filing
as practical to determine the correct amount of tax according to the filing. If
the Tax Collector finds that the amount of tax shown on the return is less than
the correct amount, the Tax Collector shall notify the taxpayer in writing of
the amount of the underpayment (deficiency) assessed. A notice of assessment,
whether as a result of an examination of a return, as a result of an audit, or
otherwise, shall be in writing and include:
         (a)   The tax period or periods for which the underpayment is
asserted;
         (b)   The amount of the underpayment detailed by tax period;
         (c)   The legal basis upon which the borough has relied to determine
that an underpayment exists;
         (d)   An itemization of the revisions made by the borough to a return
filed by the taxpayer that result in the determination that an underpayment
exists; and
         (e)   A copy of the borough’s local taxpayer’s bill of rights
disclosure statement or a fair summary of the taxpayer’s rights and obligations
under the local taxpayers bill of rights act, together with a reference to
where the taxpayer can obtain a complete copy of the disclosure statement.
      (2)   If the Tax Collector finds that the tax that has been paid by the
taxpayer is more than the correct amount, the Tax Collector shall credit the
overpayment against any taxes owed by the taxpayer to the township and shall
refund the difference to the taxpayer. Written notice of such action by the Tax
Collector shall be provided to the taxpayer.
   (B)   No return filed. If a taxpayer fails to file any return of tax
required to be filed, the Tax Collector may estimate from any available
information, the taxpayer’s gross receipts and the tax due thereon, and notify
the taxpayer in writing of the amount assessed against the taxpayer as a
deficiency.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.113 PETITION FOR REASSESSMENT.
   Within 90 days of the date of a notice of assessment, the taxpayer may make
a request for reassessment by completing and submitting a petition for
administrative appeal which will be forwarded for decision to an administrative
hearing officer appointed by the borough. See §
36.121.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.114 REFUND OF OVERPAYMENTS, INTEREST ON OVERPAYMENTS.
   (A)   Taxpayer request for refund of overpayments. Any taxpayer who has made
an overpayment of tax to the borough may file a written request with the Tax
Collector for a refund or credit. A request for refund shall be made within
three years of the due date for filing the tax return (as extended), or one
year after actual payment of the tax, whichever is later. If no return (or
report) is required, the request shall be made within three years after the due
date for payment of the tax or within one year after actual payment of the tax,
whichever is later. A request for refund shall not be considered complete and
filed unless and until all information necessary for the borough to determine
the merits of the request have been received by the borough.
      (1)   Overpayment on tax return. For purposes of this section, a tax
return filed by the taxpayer with the borough showing an overpayment of tax
shall be deemed to be a written request for a cash refund unless otherwise
indicated on the tax return.
      (2)   Refund request not a petition for appeal. A request for refund
under this section shall not be considered a petition for administrative appeal
and shall not preclude a taxpayer from submitting a petition for administrative
appeal. See §
36.121.
      (3)   Refund after notice of assessment. For amounts paid as a result of
a notice asserting or informing a taxpayer of an underpayment, a written
request for refund shall be filed with the borough within one year of the date
of the payment.
   (B)   Interest on overpayments. All overpayments of tax due to the borough
shall bear simple interest from the date of the overpayment until the date of
resolution. (See 53 Pa.C.S. § 8426.)
      (1)   Rate of interest. Interest on overpayments shall be allowed and
paid at the same rate as the Commonwealth is required to pay pursuant to 72
P.S. § 806.1, known as the Fiscal Code, or any successor statute governing such
rate of interest.
      (2)   Seventy-five days before interest accrues. No interest shall be
allowed if an overpayment is refunded (or applied against any other tax,
interest or penalty due the borough) within 75 days after the last date
prescribed for filing the report of the tax liability or within 75 days after
the date the return or report of the liability due is filed, whichever is
later.
      (3)   No interest on overpayments of interest and penalty. Overpayments
of interest or penalty shall not bear any interest.
   (C)   Acceptance of refund check. The taxpayer’s acceptance of the borough’s
refund check shall not prejudice any right of the taxpayer to claim any
additional overpayment and interest thereon. Tender of a refund check by the
borough shall be deemed to be acceptance of the check by the taxpayer.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.115 ABATEMENT OF CERTAIN INTEREST AND PENALTY.
   (A)   Errors and delays. In the case of any underpayment, the Tax Collector
may abate all or any part of interest for any period for the following:
      (1)   Any underpayment of tax finally determined to be due attributable
in whole or in part to any error or delay by the borough in the performance of
a ministerial act, provided, however, that no significant aspect of the error
or delay is caused by the taxpayer after the borough has contacted the taxpayer
in writing with respect to the underpayment of tax finally determined to be due
or payable; and
      (2)   Any payment of a tax to the extent that any error or delay in the
payment is attributable to an officer, employee or agent of the borough being
erroneous or dilatory in performance of a ministerial act. The Tax Director
shall determine what constitutes timely performance of ministerial acts.
   (B)   Erroneous written advice by borough. The borough shall abate any
portion of any penalty or interest attributable to erroneous advice furnished
to the taxpayer in writing by an officer, employee or agent of the borough,
acting in his or her official capacity if:
      (1)   The written advice was reasonably relied upon by the taxpayer and
was in response to specific written request of the taxpayer; and
      (2)   The portion of the penalty or addition to tax or excess interest
did not result from a failure by the taxpayer to provide adequate or accurate
information.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.116 INSTALLMENT AGREEMENTS.
   If, in the sole opinion of the Tax Collector, it will facilitate collection,
the borough may enter into a written agreement with any taxpayer under which
the taxpayer is allowed to satisfy liability for the tax in installment
payments.
   (A)   Termination of installment agreement. The Tax Collector may terminate
any installment agreement if:
      (1)   Information provided to the borough prior to the date of the
agreement was inaccurate or incomplete; or
      (2)   The Tax Collector believes that collection of the tax under the
agreement is in jeopardy.
   (B)   Alteration of installment agreement. If the Tax Collector finds that
the financial condition of the taxpayer has significantly changed, the Tax
Collector may alter, modify or terminate the agreement, but only if:
      (1)   Notice of the Tax Collector’s finding is provided to the taxpayer
no later than 30 days prior to the date of such action; and
      (2)   The notice contains the reasons why the Tax Collector believes a
significant change has occurred.
   (C)   Breach of installment agreement. The Tax Collector may alter, modify
or terminate an installment agreement if the taxpayer fails to do any of the
following:
      (1)   Pay any installment at the time the installment is due under the
agreement;
      (2)   Pay any other tax liability at the time tire liability is due; and
      (3)   Provide a financial condition update as requested by the borough.
   (D)   Prepayment permitted. Taxpayer may prepay, in whole or in part, any
tax under any agreement with the borough.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.117 PAYMENT UNDER PROTEST.
   The Tax Collector is authorized to accept “payment under protest” of the
amount of tax in order for the taxpayer to avoid liability for additional
interest, penalties and fines. Further, the Tax Collector may accept partial
payment of any amount due without waiver of the borough’s right to collect the
balance due.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.118 VIOLATIONS, INTEREST ON UNDERPAYMENT AND PENALTIES.
   Failure to comply with the provisions of the tax ordinance or these
regulations may result in sanctions, including:
   (A)   Interest on underpayment. If any amount of tax imposed by the tax
provisions is not paid on or before the last date prescribed for payment,
interest on such amount at the rate of 1% per month, or fraction of a month,
shall be payable for the period from such last date to the date such amount is
paid; and
   (B)   Penalty. If any amount of tax imposed by the tax ordinance is not paid
on or before the last date prescribed for payment, there shall be added to the
tax for the taxable year an amount equal to 10% of the amount of the tax due.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.119 CONFIDENTIAL NATURE OF TAX INFORMATION.
   Any information obtained by the Tax Collector or any official, agent or
employee of the borough as a result of any audit, return, report,
investigation, hearing or verification required or authorized by the Tax
Collector shall be confidential tax information.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.120 DISHONORED CHECKS.
   If any check received in payment of taxes is returned unpaid by the bank,
there shall be added to the tax due the sum charged for dishonored checks
established by the borough.
(Ord. 2015-5, passed 4-28-2015)
§ 36.121 TAXPAYER’S ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS.
   (A)   Must file. In order to appeal any assessment, determination or denial
of refund of tax, the taxpayer must file a petition for administrative appeal
with the York Area Tax Bureau.
   (B)   Petitions. All petitions shall be mailed or delivered to: York Area
Tax Bureau, 1415 North Duke Street, York, PA 17404.
      (1)   Petitions for administrative appeal. Petitions shall be in writing
on a form substantially similar to that attached as an addendum. A petition is
timely filed if the envelope transmitting the petition is postmarked by the
United States Postal Service on or before the final day on which the petition
is required to be filed. If hand delivered, a petition will be deemed to be
filed on the date received at the address shown above.
      (2)   Contents of petition (or administrative appeal). Petitions shall:
         (a)   State the name, address and telephone number of the taxpayer and
taxpayer’s authorized representative (if any);
         (b)   Identify the tax and tax period(s) to which the petition
pertains;
         (c)   State the amount of tax appealed and the legal basis for the
appeal (i.e., state how or why the assessment is incorrect; or why a refund
request should have been granted);
         (d)   Provide copies of all supporting documentation and calculations;
         (e)   State whether a hearing is requested; and
         (f)   Certify under penalty of perjury that the facts in the petition
are true and correct and that the petition is not filed for purposes of delay.
   (C)   Deadlines for filing petition for administrative appeal.
      (1)   Refund petitions shall be filed within three years after the due
date for filing the report as extended, or one year after actual payment of an
eligible tax, whichever is later. If no report is required, the petition shall
be filed within three years after the due date for payment of the tax or within
one year after actual payment, whichever is later.
      (2)   Petitions for reassessment of tax shall be filed within 90 days of
the date of the assessment notice.
   (D)   Administrative appeals process and procedure.
      (1)   Generally. Upon receipt of a timely filed petition for
administrative appeal, the Tax Collector will:
         (a)   Promptly schedule a hearing if a hearing has been requested by
the taxpayer (if a hearing is not requested, the petition will be determined on
the record before the hearing officer);
         (b)   Provide the taxpayer with a notice of hearing (setting forth the
time, date and location of the hearing); and
         (c)   Forward the taxpayer’s petition to an administrative hearing
officer appointed by the borough. Unless the date of the hearing is agreed upon
by all parties, the Tax Collector shall give at least seven days’ written
notice of the hearing to all parties.
      (2)   Hearings. Hearings will be held at the Borough Municipal Building,
unless otherwise directed by the hearing officer. Hearings will be informal in
nature and technical rules of evidence will not be applicable.
         (a)   Representation. Taxpayers may appear before the administrative
hearing officer with or without benefit of representation. Any person seeking
to represent a taxpayer at the hearing must first be so authorized by the
taxpayer in writing. A taxpayer’s representative need not be a licensed
professional, but should be familiar with the tax ordinance, these regulations
and the facts of the case.
         (b)   Presentation of evidence. Evidence may be submitted and
considered which possesses probative value commonly accepted by reasonably
prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. Unless waived by the parties,
testimony shall be under oath or affirmation, administered by the hearing
officer. Copies or photographs of all records and other exhibits shall be
provided to all parties and to the hearing officer. Any party may have a
recording or a transcript made of the hearing at the party’s expense.
         (c)   Failure to appear. The hearing may proceed in the absence of any

division (A)(2) above shall be provided to contain all waste materials
generated between regularly scheduled collections.

directly in the rear of such building or property; provided, however, that
where the side of such building abuts on a street or public alley it shall be
permissible to place the container along the curb or edge of the sidewalk at

collection is to be made and shall be removed back into the building or
property from which the container came during the same day after their contents
shall have been emptied, and it is hereby made the duty of each of said owners,

accumulation of refuse within three days after the effective date of this
subchapter shall be deemed a violation of same.
   (G)   Certain materials, such as scrap lumber and firewood, may be stored
and kept on the premises, but they shall be stored so that a minimum clear
space of 12 inches above the ground surface is provided. Tires and outsized

      (21)   Detergents, surface-active agents or other substances that might
cause excessive foaming in the POTW or its effluent.
   (C)   The federal pretreatment regulations do not allow a waiver of
pretreatment standards, or local limits, for categorical industrial users. The
borough hereby incorporates by reference all federal categorical pretreatment
standards at 40 C.F.R. Chapter I, Subchapter N, as if they were fully set forth
herein, and such standards shall be the standards applied under this subchapter
to the appropriate classes of industrial user.
      (1)   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in
terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
general manager may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits as allowed
by federal pretreatment regulation.
      (2)   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are
expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the
general manager may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed
either as a mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for
purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual
industrial users.
      (3)   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the general manager
shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e).
      (4)   A categorical industrial user may obtain a net/gross adjustment to
a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with the requirements of 40
C.F.R. § 403.15.
      (5)   When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that the general
manager convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to
convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the
general manager. The general manager may establish equivalent mass limits only
if the industrial user meets all of the requirements of 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(c)(5)
(i)(A) through 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(c)(5)(i)(E).
      (6)   The general manager may, at his or her discretion, convert the mass
limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 C.F.R. Parts 414, 419
and 455, and other parts as EPA may amend from time to time, to concentration
limits for the purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual
industrial users. The industrial user shall meet the requirements of 40 C.F.R.
§ 403.6(d) regarding dilution and 40 C.F.R. § 403.17 regarding bypass, and, for
those industrial users that mix process effluent prior to treatment with
wastewater other than those generated by the regulated process, shall provide
information regarding the pollutant concentrations and wastestream flows at the
sample point.
      (7)   Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with
the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated
categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived.
      (8)   Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum monthly average, or four- day average, limitations. Where
such standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be
used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitations.
      (9)   Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating
equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based
standard shall notify the general manager within two business days after the
user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will
significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the
general manager of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or
concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of
the long term average production rate.
      (10)   The general manager may impose mass limitations in addition to
concentration limitations. The general manager may approve accepting discharges
from a permitted industrial user that are of unusual strength or character
based on water conservation or other resource conservation measures employed by
the industrial user. Mass limitations may be determined where allowed by
federal and local regulations, such as converting concentrations to mass,
allocating maximum allowable headworks loadings or any other method deemed
appropriate.
   (D)   The general manager may develop best management practices (BMPs) in
individual wastewater discharge permits to implement local limits, the
requirements of division (B) above and 40 C.F.R. § 403.5(a)(1) and (b), and
certain established categorical pretreatment standards and effluent limits.
(2006 Code, § 18-203) (Ord. 2010-1, passed 12- -2010; Ord. 2012-2, passed 3-10-
2013) Penalty, see §
51.99
§ 51.23 INDUSTRIAL WASTES.
   (A)   Treatment of industrial wastes. This section sets forth uniform
requirements for users of the publicly owned treatment works and enables the
POTW to comply with all applicable state and federal laws, including the Clean
Water Act (33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq.) and federal pretreatment standards and
requirements (40 C.F.R. Chapter I, Subchapter N). The economy and desirability
of the combined treatment of industrial wastes and sanitary sewage is
recognized. However, not all types and quantities of industrial wastes can be
so treated. Hence it shall be the established policy of the borough and the
City of York to admit those types and quantities of industrial wastes that are
not harmful or damaging to the structures, processes or operation of the sewage
works or are not specifically prohibited by this subchapter. It is also
recognized that to provide this service, additional facilities are required,
the cost of which shall be borne by those persons receiving benefits.
Additionally, the borough and the City of York and industry shall comply with
federal pretreatment regulations. To correctly evaluate such users or potential
users, all facilities that would otherwise be subject to categorical
pretreatment regulations must submit a complete wastewater permit application
at least 90 days before the commencement of operations, regardless if the
facility intends to discharge wastewater or not. Each user must notify the
general manager of any significant changes to the user’s operations or system
that might alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater at least 30
days before the anticipated change.
   (B)   Approval required for industrial wastes.
      (1)   In order to control the admission of industrial waste, the
discharge into any sanitary sewer of any industrial waste having the following
characteristics shall be prohibited unless an industrial wastewater discharge
permit is obtained:
         (a)   A daily average BOD concentration greater than 300 mg/l;
         (b)   A daily average suspended solids concentration greater than 350
mg/l;
         (c)   An average daily flow greater than 25,000 gallons per day of
process wastewater;
         (d)   Any toxic pollutant that is found in concentrations greater than
found in domestic sewage; or
         (e)   Any wastes which are considered by the general manager to offer
possibilities of harm to structures, processes or operation of the sewage works
or to have significant impact, either singly or in combination with other
contributing industries, on the treatment process, the quality of sludge, the
system’s effluent quality or air emissions generated by the system.
      (2)   Industries defined as significant industrial users shall be
permitted and/or regulated in accordance with the federal pretreatment
requirements of 40 C.F.R. Chapter I, Subchapter N. Permits shall be granted by
the City of York upon the review and approval of the general manager. The City
of York reserves the right to deny new or existing contributions to the system
if, because of the volume or characteristics, such wastes are determined by the
City of York to be detrimental to the operation of the sewage works or have the
potential to cause or contribute to the violation of any laws, regulations,
orders or permit conditions applicable to the borough or the City of York or
the York City Sewer Authority.
   (C)   Survey data required. All persons who are now discharging, or are
planning to discharge, industrial wastes into any sanitary sewer shall upon the
request of the general manager or his or her designee, complete and file with
the general manager, a permit application which furnishes pertinent data,
inclusive of quantity of flow and analysis of the industrial wastes discharged,
as set forth in division (D) below. Any person desiring to make a new
connection, a new discharge, or a significant change in the volume, nature or
rate of a discharge, shall complete and file with the general manager a permit
application which furnishes pertinent or predicted data inclusive of quantity
of flow and an analysis of the industrial waste to be discharged into the
sewage works as set forth in division (D) below. Such permit application shall
be submitted at least 120 days before the expected or change in discharge is to
occur.
   (D)   Industrial wastewater discharge permit application.
      (1)   In order to receive a permit to discharge wastes requiring approval
under division (B) above, a completed permit application shall be filed with
the general manager.
      (2)   Information required for industrial users includes, but is not
limited to:
         (a)   Identifying and contact information, including the facility
name, address, and name of operator and owner;
         (b)   Operation information including a description of activities,
facilities and plant production processes, production rates for the types of
products and/or processes, number of employees and hours of operation. A
schematic process diagram, facility site plans, floor plans, mechanical plans
and plumbing plans may be required;
         (c)   A list of any state, federal or local environmental control
permits held by or for the facility;
         (d)   The type and amount of raw materials and chemicals used or
stored at the facility and the types and quantities of wastes generated;
         (e)   The time and duration of discharges from all processes, and the
location(s) for monitoring all wastes, including, process flow measurements and
wastewater flow measurement, and incoming water flow measurement and records;
         (f)   Results of wastewater sampling and analysis that identifies the
nature and concentration (or mass) of pollutants; and
         (g)   A baseline monitoring report if the industrial user is subject
to categorical standards and a description of any best management practices
that will be utilized.
      (3)   Any person discharging industrial wastes into any sanitary sewer at
the time of passage of this subchapter and requiring a permit shall apply
within 90 days after the effective date of this subchapter. All such persons
are considered to have a valid permit until such time as the city shall act
upon the permit application. It shall be the duty of the industrial and
commercial user to maintain operations in compliance with federal, state and
local regulations.
      (4)   The applicant shall submit to the general manager with the permit
application a nonrefundable permit application fee made payable to the City of
York. Such fee shall be assessed in accordance with a schedule established by
resolution of the Council of the City of York.
      (5)   No permit shall be granted to any person unless he or she agrees to
indemnify and to save the borough, the City of York, its officers, employees
and agents harmless from any and all claims, costs, damages and liabilities
which may accrue or be claimed to accrue by reason of the permitted waste
disposal activity. An indemnification and release shall be part of the permit
application.
   (E)   Permit conditions and contents. Industrial wastewater discharge
permits shall be expressly subject to all provisions of this subchapter and all
other applicable state, federal and local regulations, and user charges and
fees established by the borough or the City of York. Where federal pretreatment
regulations impose additional requirements or more stringent limits than those
stated in the permit, these requirements and limits become part of the permit
whether or not they are stated in the permit. The City of York and the borough
reserve the right to establish by ordinance or wastewater discharge permit,
more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW consistent
with the purpose of this subchapter. Permits may contain, but are not limited
to, the following:
      (1)   Limits on the average and maximum wastewater constituents and
characteristics, including best management practices;
      (2)   Limits on average and maximum rate and time of discharge or
requirements for flow regulation and equalization;
      (3)   Requirements for the installation and maintenance of inspection and
sampling facilities and equipment, including flow measurement and other
devices, and the calibration of such devices;
      (4)   Specifications for self-monitoring programs that may include
sampling locations, frequency of sampling, number, types and standards for
tests and reporting schedule;
      (5)   Compliance schedules;
      (6)   Requirements for submission of compliance reports, self-monitoring
reports and technical reports or discharge reports;
      (7)   Requirements for maintaining and retaining records relating to
wastewater discharge for a period of not less than three years, including
records documenting best management practices compliance, and affording the
borough and the City of York access thereto;
      (8)   Requirements for notification to the borough and the City of York
of any new introduction of industrial wastes, potential problems or slug
discharges, or substantial change in the volume or character of the industrial
wastes being introduced into any sanitary sewer;
      (9)   Requirements for submission of spill prevention plans, slug
discharge control plans and/or requirements to control slug discharges, and
implementation of best management practices (BMPs) necessary to adequately
prevent accidental, unanticipated or non-routine discharges;
      (10)   Requirements for installation of means to prevent spills of
hazardous materials, untreated waste, raw materials, intermediates or product
into the sewage works;
      (11)   Requirements for the installation of pretreatment technology,
pollution control or construction of appropriate containment devices, designed
to reduce, eliminate or prevent the introduction of pollutants into the
treatment works;
      (12)   Requirements for the development and implementation of waste
minimization plans to reduce the amount of pollutants discharged to the POTW;
      (13)   Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the borough or the City
of York to ensure compliance with this subchapter, and state and federal laws,
rules and regulations; and
      (14)   A statement of applicable civil and criminal penalties for
violation of pretreatment standards and requirements, permit and ordinance
requirements and any applicable compliance schedule.
   (F)   Compliance with permits.
      (1)   Permit holders shall comply with the conditions of the permit and
failure to do so constitutes a violation of this subchapter.
      (2)   Should a permit holder significantly change the volume of its
discharge or change its character for any reason, he or she shall immediately
notify the general manager of such changes and the general manager may require
an application for a new permit.
      (3)   A permit may be suspended or revoked in whole or in part, or
modified, by the general manager for cause including, but not limited to, the
following:
         (a)   Violation of any terms or conditions of the permit;
         (b)   Obtaining the permit by misrepresentation or failure to disclose
fully all relevant facts; and
         (c)   A change in any condition, including, but not limited to,
changes in state or federal regulations or changes in the treatment process
that require either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the
permitted discharge.
      (4)   All categorical industrial users are required to be regulated in
accordance with federal pretreatment regulations.
   (G)   Permit duration and evaluation. An industrial wastewater discharge
permit shall be issued for a specified time period not to exceed three years
from the effective date of the permit. A wastewater discharge permit may be
issued for a period less than three years at the discretion of the general
manager. A permit holder shall apply for permit reissuance by submitting a
complete permit application a minimum of 120 days prior to the expiration of
the existing permit. The general manager will evaluate the data furnished by
the user and may require additional information. The terms and conditions of
the permit may be subject to modification by the borough or the City of York
during the term of the permit should changes in federal pretreatment
regulations occur, changes at the facility occur, or other just cause exists.
Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time
schedule for compliance. The general manager may deny any application for a
wastewater discharge permit. All wastewater discharge permits issued to a user
are void upon the issuance of a new wastewater discharge permit to that user.
Wastewater discharge permits shall be void upon cessation of operations.
   (H)   Permit issuance procedures. A permit shall be issued with a minimum
30-day comment period between the issuance date and effective date. The permit
holder may submit written comments on the permit conditions during the comment
period for review and response by the general manager. The permit may be
modified by the general manager in response to comments. Upon the expiration of
the comment period, on the effective date of the permit, the permit shall
become effective, subject to the right of appeal as set forth in §
51.36.
   (I)   Permit transfer. Industrial wastewater discharge permits are issued to
a specific person for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall
not be reassigned, transferred, sold, applied to different premises or a new or
changed operation without the written approval of the general manager.
   (J)   Pretreatment. All persons using the sewage works shall provide
wastewater treatment as required to comply with this subchapter and with all
federal pretreatment standards, requirements and prohibitions within the time
limitations specified by federal regulation or other limits that may from time
to time be set by regulatory agencies.
      (1)   Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated
and maintained at the user’s expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities
and operating procedures shall be submitted to the general manager before such
facilities are constructed. The submission of such plans and operating
procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of
modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the
POTW under the provisions of this subchapter.
      (2)   Whenever deemed necessary, the general manager may require users to
restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate
points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams,
and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine
the user’s compliance with the requirements of this subchapter.
      (3)   The general manager may require any person discharging into the
POTW to install and maintain, on his or her property and at his or her expense,
a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. An
individual wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow
equalization.
      (4)   Users with the potential to discharge substances harmful to the
POTW, which includes the sewer system, (i.e., flammable substances, corrosive
substances) may be required to install and maintain detection meters or
monitoring devices.
   (K)   Certification of reports.
      (1)   Any person signing a permit application, baseline monitoring
report, periodic self-monitoring report, questionnaire, compliance schedule,
BMP submission or documentation, final compliance report, periodic compliance
report and any other required report shall make the following certification and
be signed in accordance with the signatory requirements of division (R) below:
“I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were
prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed
to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system,
or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the
information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true,
accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and
imprisonment for knowing violations.”
      (2)   A facility determined to be a non-significant categorical
industrial user by the general manager must annually submit the federally
required certification statement regarding non-significant categorical
industrial users and be signed in accordance with the signatory requirements of
division (R) below.
   (L) Sampling and analysis. The holder of an industrial wastewater discharge
permit shall furnish the general manager with written and signed reports of
sample analysis at a frequency specified in the industrial wastewater discharge
permit. Data used to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on samples
collected during the reporting period and must be representative of conditions
during the reporting period.
      (1)   If a user monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate
sampling location more frequently than required by the general manager, the
results of the monitoring shall be submitted to the City of York.
      (2)   Samples to be used for surcharge purposes shall be composite
samples and be representative of the discharge from the facility. Grab samples
may be used for surcharge purposes where the physical set-up of the facility so
dictates or wastewater is collected over a period of time and is discharged as
a daily basis or less frequent batch basis. Grab samples that may represent an
unusual discharge from the facility may be used for surcharge purposes for the
period of time and volume such discharges occurred.
      (3)   Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
      (4)   Samples shall be collected, preserved and analyzed promptly, in
accordance with 40 C.F.R. Part 136 to ensure accurate results. If 40 C.F.R.
Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant
in question, or where the EPA determines that the 40 C.F.R. Part 136 sampling
and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods
approved by the EPA. Pennsylvania laboratories or facilities that test or
analyze environmental samples to demonstrate compliance with an industrial
wastewater discharge permit, this subchapter or pretreatment standard shall be
in compliance with the laboratory accreditation requirements of Act 90 of 2002
(27 Pa.C.S. §§ 4101 through 4113) or the National Environmental Laboratory
Accreditation Program (NELAP), relating to environmental laboratory
accreditation. Laboratories or testing facilities outside of the state that
test or analyze environmental samples to demonstrate compliance with an
industrial wastewater discharge permit, this subchapter or pretreatment
standard shall be in compliance with the laboratory accreditation requirements
of the National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program (NELAP),
relating to environmental laboratory accreditation.
      (5)   The borough or the City of York representatives may sample and
inspect the waste by composite sample or by grab sample in order to verify the
analysis being submitted by the industry. If the results obtained by the
borough or the City of York differ from those obtained by the industrial user,
the borough or the City of York will notify the industrial user and conduct
confirmatory sampling and/or investigate the sampling, preservation and testing
methods employed.
      (6)   No person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently break,
damage, destroy, uncover, deface, tamper with or prevent access to any
structure, appurtenance or equipment, or other part of the POTW.
      (7)   If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user
must notify the general manager within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the
results of the repeat analysis to the general manager within 30 days after
becoming aware of the violation. Where the borough or the City of York has
performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the user, the borough or the
City of York must perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies
the user of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat analysis.
Resampling is not required if the borough or the City of York performs sampling
of the user between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the
time when the user, the borough or the City of York receives the results of
this sampling.
   (M)   Control manhole. Any significant industrial user, and any other
industrial user that the general manager deems, discharging industrial wastes
into any sanitary sewer shall construct and maintain at its expense a suitable
control manhole, or manholes, downstream from any treatment storage, or other
approved works, to facilitate observation, measurement and sampling of all
wastes, including domestic sewage, from the establishment. The control manhole
or manholes shall be placed at suitable locations to provide safe access and
representative sampling. The control manhole shall comply with applicable
construction standards and specifications in accordance with the general
manager’s requirements and shall be constructed and maintained in such a manner
to enable the placement of sampling equipment and to enable the general manager
to perform monitoring activities. The control manhole shall be accessible to
the general manager or his or her representatives at all times for sampling,
and shall not be obstructed or located within secure areas such that the
general manager cannot gain unrestricted access.
   (N)   Slug discharge.
      (1)   The person in charge of a facility shall notify the general manager
or his or her designated representative immediately in the case of any upset,
slug discharge or other discharge of unusual strength, volume or other
characteristics, whether or not such discharge is in violation of the
wastewater discharge permit. In such a case, in addition to the immediate
report, the user shall submit a written report within five days of the incident
specifying:
         (a)   Description of the upset, the cause thereof and the upset’s
impact on a user’s compliance status;
         (b)   Duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of
noncompliance, and if the noncompliance continues, the time by which compliance
is reasonably expected to occur; and
         (c)   All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of such an upset or other conditions of noncompliance.
      (2)   Whenever changes are made at a facility that may affect the
potential for a slug discharge to occur, the user shall notify the general
manager in advance, if possible, or within 24 hours of making such changes.
   (O)   Slug discharge control plans. The general manager shall evaluate
whether each significant industrial user needs a slug discharge control plan or
other action to control slug discharges. Such evaluation shall occur within one
year of an industrial user being identified as significant. The general manager
may require any user to develop, submit for approval and implement such a plan
or take such other action that may be necessary to control slug discharges.
Alternatively, the general manager may develop such a plan for any user. The
POTW may choose to require a significant industrial user to take specific,
preventative physical or procedural actions instead of requiring the
development of a slug control plan. Such preventative actions and any slug
control plan development requirements shall be included in the SIU’s control
mechanism. Any changes at a user’s facility can cause the general manager to
re-evaluate the need for a slug control plan. An accidental discharge/slug
discharge control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following, in addition
to any other items the general manager may determine:
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the general manager of any
accidental or slug discharges, as required by division (N) above; and
      (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental spills or
slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site run-off, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants (including solvents) and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
   (P)   Fees for sampling, analyses and inspections. The borough, the City of
York or its designated agent shall inspect properties discharging waste other
than domestic wastewater into the sewage works and obtain and analyze samples
therefrom to enforce provisions of this subchapter, to comply with local, state
and federal requirements, and to determine applicable surcharges. Fees for such
services shall be assessed in accordance with a schedule established by
administrative order based on costs. Fees for such services provided by
independent laboratories shall be invoiced at cost.
   (Q)   Spill prevention plans. Any person storing any material in excess of
the threshold planning quantity established by SARA III, the Emergency Planning
and Community Right to Know Act, shall submit a spill prevention, control and
countermeasure plan addressing the potential of an accidental discharge to the
sewer system to the general manager for review and approval. Any industrial
user storing flowable solids in bulk in excess of 500 pounds, or any liquids in
excess of 100 gallons (except for water and heating oil stored for use on the
premises), shall report this to the general manager annually, including the
quantity and nature of each such material, and shall develop and submit a spill
prevention, control and countermeasure plan if so directed by the general
manager.
   (R)   Signatory requirements. Industrial user reports and submissions
requiring signature and certification, which include, but are not limited to,
permit applications, industrial questionnaires, baseline monitoring reports,
compliance schedules, BMPs, final compliance reports and periodic compliance
reports, shall be signed by an authorized or duly authorized representative as
follows:
      (1)   By a responsible corporate officer, if the industrial user
submitting the reports is a corporation. For the purpose of this division (R)
(1) a responsible corporate officer means:
         (a)   A president, secretary, treasurer or vice-president of the
corporation in charge of a principle business function, or any other person who
performs similar policy or decision-making functions for the corporation; or
         (b)   The manager of one or more manufacturing, production or
operating facilities, provided, the manager is authorized to make management
decisions which govern the operation of the regulated facility including having
the explicit or implicit duty of making major capital investment
recommendations, and initiate and direct other comprehensive measures to assure
long-term environmental compliance with environmental laws and regulations; can
ensure that the necessary systems are established or actions taken to gather
complete and accurate information for control mechanism requirements; and where
authority to sign documents has been assigned or delegated to the manager in
accordance with corporate procedures.
      (2)   By a general partner or proprietor if the industrial user
submitting the reports is a partnership or sole proprietorship respectively;
      (3)   By a duly authorized representative of the individual designated in
divisions (R)(1) or (R)(2) above if:
         (a)   The authorization is made in writing by the individual described
in divisions (R)(1) or (R)(2) above;
         (b)   The authorization specifies either an individual or a position
having responsibility for the overall operation of the facility from which the
industrial discharge originates, such as the position of plant manager,
operator of a well, or well field superintendent, or a position of equivalent
responsibility, or having overall responsibility for environmental matters for
the company; and
         (c)   The written authorization is submitted to the general manager of
the POTW.
      (4)   If an authorization under division (R)(3) above is no longer
accurate because a different individual or position has responsibility for the
overall operation of the facility, or overall responsibility for environmental
matters for the company, a new authorization satisfying the requirements of
division (R)(3) above must be submitted to the general manager of the POTW
prior to or together with any reports to be signed by an authorized
representative.
   (S)   Hauled wastewater.
      (1)   The general manager may prohibit or accept the disposal of hauled
industrial or non-industrial wastewater to the POTW. In no case shall any
hazardous waste as that term is defined by the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act be discharged as hauled waste. Hauled or trucked wastewater may be
introduced into the POTW only at locations designated by the general manager,
and at such times as are established by the general manager. The general
manager may refuse a hauler or generator the ability to discharge a particular
hauled wastewater load if it cannot be determined that the load will not
violate the requirements of this subchapter or any federal or state
pretreatment or waste requirements, or cause interference, pass-through or
biosolids contamination. The discharge of hauled wastewater is subject to all
other requirements of this subchapter and applicable state and federal laws.
The general manager may develop procedures to ensure compliance with this
subchapter and state and federal requirements.
      (2)   The general manager may require the haulers and/or generators of
hauled or trucked industrial or non-industrial wastewater to obtain wastewater
discharge permits.
      (3)   No individual load may be discharged into the POTW without the
prior consent of the general manager. The issuance of a permit to a hauler or
generator does not constitute consent to discharge nor guarantee the ability to
discharge any particular load. The general manager may collect samples of each
hauled load to ensure compliance with this subchapter, any federal pretreatment
standards and state and federal law. The general manager may require the
industrial wastewater hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to
discharge.
      (4)   Industrial wastewater haulers must provide a waste-tracking form
for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of
the industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and
addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. The
form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste
constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes.
   (T)   Additional measures. Whenever deemed necessary, the general manager
may require users to restrict their discharges during peak flow periods,
designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specified sewers,
relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams
from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to
protect the POTW and/or determine the user’s compliance with the requirements
of this subchapter or the user’s permit.
   (U)   Reports from unpermitted users. All industrial or commercial users not
required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate
reports to the general manager as the general manager may require.
   (V)   Compliance schedules. The following conditions shall apply to a
compliance schedule for meeting categorical pretreatment standards under 40
C.F.R. § 403.12:
      (1)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to,
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts
for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation);
      (2)   No increment referred above shall exceed nine months; and
      (3)   The user shall submit a progress report to the general manager no
later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of
compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it
expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for any delay,
and the steps being taken by the user to return construction to the established
schedule. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress
reports to the general manager.
   (W)   Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline.
      (1)   The following conditions shall apply to a compliance schedule for
meeting categorical pretreatment standards under 40 C.F.R. § 403.12.
      (2)   Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards or in the case of a new source
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any
industrial user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit
to the general manager a report containing the information required for a
baseline report required under 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b)(4) through (b)(6). For
industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established
by the borough or the City of York in accordance with the requirements of 40
C.F.R. § 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user’s
long-term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to
categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant
discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report
shall include the user’s actual production during the appropriate sampling
period.

identification shall be permitted to enter upon all properties at reasonable
times to carry out all inspection, surveillance, observation, measurement,
monitoring procedures, sampling and testing necessary to determine, independent
of information supplied by industrial users, compliance or noncompliance with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements and ordinance requirements
by industrial users. The general manager shall have the right to enter any
premises of any industrial user in which a discharge source or treatment system
is located, or in which records are required to be kept under 40 C.F.R. §
403.12(o), to ensure compliance with pretreatment standards or requirements,
any wastewater discharge permit, the requirements of this subchapter, or an
order issued hereunder.
   (B)   Users shall allow the general manager ready access to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and
copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
   (C)   The authority of the general manager shall be at least as extensive as
the authority provided under § 308 of the Clean Water Act, being 33 U.S.C. §
1318.
      (1)   Where a user has security measures in force that require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security personnel so that, upon
presentation of suitable identification, the general manager shall be permitted
to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific
responsibilities.
      (2)   The general manager shall have the right to set up on the user’s
property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling and/or metering of the user’s operations.
      (3)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
user at the written or verbal request of the general manager and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be the responsibility of the
user.
      (4)   If the general manager has been refused access to a building,
structure or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable
cause to believe that there may be a violation of this subchapter, or that
there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and
sampling program of the borough or the City of York designed to verify
compliance with this subchapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to
protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, the
general manager may seek issuance of a search warrant from the appropriate
court.

   (B)   Any drain in the floor or repair pit of any garage or other structure
for the housing, sale or repair of vehicles, shall have a special connection
discharging through an interceptor, which shall be located under the direction
of the borough or the City of York, before being connected to the house drain.
The interceptor shall be so arranged as to intercept all oils, gasoline or
other flammable fluids, as well as sand, silt and other solids, for the purpose
of excluding the same from the sewage works. It shall be water-tight, so
located as to be provided a suitable approved manhole frame and cover, and
shall be of design and capacity approved by the borough or the City of York.
The oils and other flammable fluids that accumulate in such interceptors shall
be pumped or otherwise removed, and the interceptors shall be so maintained as
to ensure the exclusion of the same from the sewage works. They shall be kept
free from sand, silt or other solids and shall be subject to regular inspection
by the borough or the City of York. The contents of the same shall be promptly
disposed of after removal to the satisfaction of the borough or the City of
York.
   (C)   Every garage or other structure used for the housing, sale or repair

§ 51.30 SEWER RENTAL SURCHARGES; DETERMINATION AND MEASURING VOLUME.
   (A)   Sewer rental surcharges for nondomestic wastes.
      (1)   In addition to sewer rent for collection and treatment of sewage
discharged into the sewage works by commercial and industrial users, further
charges shall be made for all sewage discharged into the sewage works having
values for certain parameters in excess of certain concentration thresholds as
listed below:
Parameters Concentration Thresholds in mg/l
Parameters                Concentration Thresholds in mg/l
Ammonia (as nitrogen)     15
Arsenic, total            0.004
BOD                       300
Cadmium, total            0.004
Chromium, total           0.06
Copper, total             0.1
Cyanide, total            0.05
Lead, total               0.06
Nickel, total             0.03

Silver, total             0.006
Suspended solids, total   350
Zinc, total               0.3
 
      (2)   The total surcharge shall equal the sum of each of the surcharges
applicable to the waste in accordance with the formula below:
 
SC = 8.34 x Q x (Value of Parameter - Concentration Threshold) x K/1,000,000
SC = Surcharge for parameter
Q = Volume in gallons
K = Cost factor for parameter
 
      (3)   Cost factors shall be established by administrative order based on
toxicity, impact on sludge disposal, pretreatment program goals and on costs
for treatment. The strength of any sewage subject to surcharge shall be
determined quarterly, or more frequently as the borough or the City of York
shall determine, based upon sampling and analysis by the borough or the City of
York or its designees. However, the borough or the City of York may if it so
elects, determine the strength of the sewage based upon the results of routine
sampling and analysis by the producer of such sewage or the results of analysis
and flow from previous quarters or from the results of analysis and flow of
sewage from similar customers.
   (B)   Methods of measuring volume for surcharge purposes.
      (1)   Whenever a person purchasing all water used from a public water
provider discharges all sewage to the POTW at one point, the volume of water
purchased shall be used as a measure of the quantity of sewage discharged.
      (2)   Whenever a person obtains water from other sources or claims that
alternate means of disposal reduces the volume of sewage discharged, or
whenever sewage is discharged at more than one point to the POTW, the borough
or the City of York shall require the person to install at his or her expense a
meter or meters, as may be required to measure the volume or volumes of sewage
discharged to the POTW at the point or points of entry. All meters or other
measuring devices installed or required to be used under any provision of this
subchapter may be tested or inspected by the borough or the City of York or by
its designee whenever deemed necessary by the borough or the City of York. The
owner of the property upon which such measuring device is installed shall be
responsible for its testing, maintenance and safekeeping, and all repairs
thereto shall be made at the property owner’s expense, whether such repairs are
made necessary by ordinary wear and tear or other causes. Owners shall test
and/or calibrate meters in a manner and at a frequency satisfactory to the
borough or the City of York.

51.99
§ 51.31 REMEDIES.
   (A)   Emergency suspension of service.
      (1)   The borough or City of York may for good cause shown suspend the
wastewater treatment service to any person when it appears to the borough or
City of York that an actual or threatened discharge presents or may reasonably
present an imminent or substantial danger to the health or welfare of persons
or to the environment, interferes with the operation of the POTW, or violates
any pretreatment standard or requirement imposed by this subchapter. In the
event of failure to comply voluntarily with a suspension order within the
specified time, the borough or City of York may commence judicial proceedings
to compel compliance with such order. Nothing in this section shall be
interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this
section. A user affected by an emergency suspension will be entitled to a
hearing afterwards at the user’s request pursuant to §
51.36.
      (2)   Any user notified of a suspension of its service shall immediately
stop or eliminate its discharge. In the event of a user’s failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the borough or
general manager may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream or endangerment to any individuals. The general manager
may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated
to the satisfaction of the general manager that the period of endangerment has
passed, unless the termination proceedings in division (B) below are initiated
against the user.
      (3)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the general manager prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under division (D) below.
   (B)   Revocation of treatment services.
      (1)   The borough or City of York may seek to terminate the wastewater
treatment services to any person and/or revoke a wastewater discharge permit,
for good cause, for, but not limited to, the following reasons:
         (a)   Failure to factually report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
         (b)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents or characteristics prior to discharge as
provided by §
51.23(C) and (F)(2);
         (c)   Violation of this subchapter or any permit or order issued under
this subchapter following within one year a prior violation of the same kind;
         (d)   Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant
facts in the wastewater discharge permit application;
         (e)   Falsifying self-monitoring reports and certification statements;
         (f)   Tampering with monitoring equipment;
         (g)   Being found to be in significant noncompliance, as defined in §
51.32;
         (h)   Failure to pay civil penalties assessed under this subchapter;
         (i)   Failure to pay sewer charges, surcharges or fees for services;
         (j)   Failure to meet compliance schedules;
         (k)   Failure to complete a wastewater survey or a wastewater
discharge permit application as provided by §
51.23(C); or
         (l)   Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of business
ownership of a permitted facility.
      (2)   Such person will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under division (D) below
why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the
borough or general manager shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking
any other action against the person.
   (C)   Notification of violation; administrative adjustment. Whenever the
borough or City of York finds that any person has engaged in conduct that
constitutes a violation of any provision of this subchapter or of a permit
issued hereunder, the borough or City of York may serve or cause to be served
upon such person, a written notice either personally or by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested, stating the nature of the alleged
violation. Within 30 days of the date of receipt of the notice, the person
shall respond in writing to the borough or City of York, advising of its
position with respect to the allegations. Thereafter, the parties shall meet to
ascertain the veracity of the allegations and where necessary, establish a plan
for the satisfactory correction thereof.
   (D)   Show cause hearing. Whenever a violation or series of violations occur
that may result in suspension of service, termination of service, summary
charges or other enforcement action, the borough or general manager may issue
an order to such violator to appear and show cause before a hearing board
assembled for the purpose, why the proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. The procedures for such a hearing shall be set forth in §
51.36 hereof. The notice of the hearing shall be served on the person either
personally or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested,
specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the borough or City of
York or its designee regarding the violation, the reasons why the enforcement
action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the
person to show cause before the borough or City of York, or its designee, why
the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing
shall be served no less than seven days before the hearing. Service may be made
on any authorized representative of the person or user or on anyone in apparent
authority found at the premises of such user. The proceedings at the hearing
shall be considered by the hearing board which board shall then instruct the
borough or general manager as to the enforcement action, if any, to be taken,
or as to additional actions to be taken by the borough or general manager. A
show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking
any other action against the person.
   (E)   Injunctive relief. When the borough or general manager finds that a
user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this subchapter,
an individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, the borough or general manager,
acting through the City Solicitor’s office, may commence an action in the Court
of Common Pleas for legal and equitable relief and, where deemed appropriate,
may seek a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction to restrain
violations of or compel compliance with the chapter, permit, order or other
requirement. The filing of such an action shall not be a bar to taking other
enforcement actions.
   (F)   Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this subchapter
are not exclusive. The borough or general manager may take any, all, or any
combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Further, the borough
or general manager is empowered to take more than one enforcement action
against any noncompliant user. The borough or City of York may take any actions
afforded to it under state law.
   (G)   Consent orders. The borough or general manager may enter into consent
orders, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall
include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance
within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall be
judicially enforceable as contracts, and violations of the terms thereof may be
deemed a violation of this subchapter subject to all of the penalties provided
herein.
   (H)   Compliance orders. When the borough or general manager finds that a
user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this subchapter, a
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the borough or general manager may issue
an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come
into compliance within a specified time. Any such order shall inform the person
of the opportunity to request a hearing before a hearing board constituted by
the Sanitary Sewer Board of Appeals, as set forth in §
51.36. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided,
sewer service may be discontinued unless the user demonstrates to the
satisfaction of the borough or general manager, a good faith effort to do so,
which may include evidence of hiring a consultant, ordering of pretreatment
equipment, creation of a pollution prevention plan, or other affirmative acts
aimed at achieving compliance in the shortest possible time. Compliance orders
also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including
additional self-monitoring and/or management practices designed to minimize the
amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order cannot extend
the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or
requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any
violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order
shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the user.
   (I)   Payment of outstanding fees and penalties. The borough or general
manager may decline to issue or reissue an individual wastewater discharge
permit to any user who has failed to pay any outstanding fees, fines or
penalties incurred as a result of any provision of this subchapter, a previous
individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder.
   (J)   Cease and desist orders.
      (1)   When the borough or general manager finds that a user has violated,
or continues to violate, any provision of this subchapter, an individual
wastewater discharge permit, or order, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, or that the user’s past violations are likely to recur, the
borough or general manager may issue an order to the user directing it to cease
and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
         (a)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
         (b)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and
desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user.
      (2)   Any such order shall inform the person of the opportunity to
request a hearing before a hearing board constituted by the Sanitary Sewer
Board of Appeals, as set forth in §
51.36.

§ 51.32 PUBLIC NOTICE OF SIGNIFICANT VIOLATORS.
   (A)   The borough or City of York shall annually provide public notification
in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice
within the jurisdiction(s) served by the POTW of industrial users which, at any
time during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
   (B)   For the purposes of this provision, a significant industrial user (or
any industrial user that violates divisions (B)(3), (B)(4) or (B)(8) below) is
in significant noncompliance if its violation meets one or more of the
following criteria:
      (1)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of all of the measurements taken for the same
pollutant parameter during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a
numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits,
as defined by 40 C.F.R. § 403.3(l);
      (2)   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those
in which 33% or more of all of the measurements taken for the same pollutant
parameter during a six-month period equal or exceed the product of the numeric
pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits, as defined
by 40 C.F.R. § 403.3(l) multiplied by the applicable TRC. There are two groups
of TRC:
         (a)   Group I for BOD, TSS, fats, oil and grease TRC = 1.4; and
         (b)   Group II for all other pollutants except pH TRC = 1.2.
      (3)   Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as
defined by 40 C.F.R. § 403.3(l) (daily maximum, long-term average,
instantaneous limit or narrative standard) that the POTW determines has caused,
alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through
(including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public);
      (4)   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment
to human health, welfare or to the environment or has resulted in the POTW’s
exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
      (5)   Failure to meet, within 90 days after the schedule date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a local control mechanism or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction or
attaining final compliance;
      (6)   Failure to provide, within 30 days after the due date, required
reports such as baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports,
periodic self-monitoring reports, reports on best management practices and
reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
      (7)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; and
      (8)   Any other violation or group of violations, which may include a
violation of best management practices, which the POTW determines will
adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment
program.

§ 51.33 HAZARDOUS WASTE.
   (A)   Users may not discharge to the POTW any hazardous waste which, if
otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 C.F.R. § 261 unless
written authorization is obtained from the general manager. It is at the
general manager’s discretion to accept such waste. Any request shall include
the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R. § 261, the EPA
hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other)
and other information that the general manager requires to make an informed
decision. If the general manager grants permission to the user to discharge
such waste, the user shall notify the EPA Regional Waste Management Division
and state hazardous waste authorities in writing in accordance with applicable
federal and state requirements. Any such notification submitted to the EPA
Regional Waste Management Division and state hazardous waste authorities shall
be copied to the general manager. This notification requirement does not apply
to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of this
subchapter.
   (B)   Users shall permit the borough or the general manager, or duly
authorized representatives, to inspect hazardous waste generation, treatment,
storage and disposal procedures, and the records generated from the management
of hazardous waste.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 53.001 SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “North York Borough
Stormwater Management Ordinance”.
(Ord. 2013-2, passed 10-7-2013)
§ 53.002 STATEMENT OF FINDINGS.
   The governing body of the borough finds the following.
   (A)   Inadequate management of accelerated run-off of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flows and velocities,
contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of
streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public facilities to
carry and control stormwater, undermines floodplain management and flood
control efforts in downstream communities, reduces ground water recharge,
threatens public health and safety and increases non-point source pollution of
water resources.
   (B)   A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including reasonable
regulation of development and activities causing accelerated run-off, is
fundamental to the public health, safety and welfare and the protection of
people of the Commonwealth, their resources and the environment.
   (C)   Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides ground water
recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams, which also protects and
maintains surface water quality.
   (D)   Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are required
to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer
systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES).
(Ord. 2013-2, passed 10-7-2013)
§ 53.003 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety and welfare within
the municipality and its watershed(s) by minimizing the harm and maximizing the
benefits described in §
53.002, through provisions designed to:
   (A)   Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim and restore
the existing and designated uses of the waters of this Commonwealth;
   (B)   Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible;
   (C)   Manage stormwater run-off close to the source;
   (D)   Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater planning
and management;
   (E)   Maintain ground water recharge to prevent degradation of surface and
ground water quality and to otherwise protect water resources;
   (F)   Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and stream beds;
   (G)   Provide proper operation and maintenance of all SWM BMPs that are
implemented within the municipality; and
   (H)   Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.
(Ord. 2013-2, passed 10-7-2013)
§ 53.004 STATUTORY AUTHORITY.
   The municipality is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect
stormwater impacts by the authority of the Borough Code and the Act of October
4, 1978, P.L. 864 (Act 167), 32 P.S. §§ 680.1 et seq., as amended, the
Stormwater Management Act.
(Ord. 2013-2, passed 10-7-2013)
§ 53.005 APPLICABILITY.
   All regulated activities and all activities that may affect stormwater run-
off, including land development and earth disturbance activity, are subject to
regulation by this chapter.
(Ord. 2013-2, passed 10-7-2013)
§ 53.006 REPEALER.
   Any other ordinance provision or regulation of the municipality inconsistent
with any of the provisions of this chapter is hereby repealed to give this
chapter full force and effect to the extent of the inconsistency only.
(Ord. 2013-2, passed 10-7-2013)
§ 53.007 SEVERABILITY.
   In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction declares any section,
clause or provision of this chapter invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of any of the remaining sections, divisions, clauses or provisions of
this chapter.
(Ord. 2013-2, passed 10-7-2013)
§ 53.008 COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER REQUIREMENTS.
   Approvals issued and actions taken under this chapter do not relieve the
applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for
activities regulated by any other code, law, regulation or ordinance.
(Ord. 2013-2, passed 10-7-2013)

   HYDROLOGIC SOIL GROUP (HSG). Infiltration rates of soils vary widely and are
affected by subsurface permeability as well as surface intake rates. Soils are
classified into four HSGs (A, B, C and D) according to their minimum
infiltration rate, which is obtained for bare soil after prolonged wetting. The
NRCS defines the four groups and provides a list of most of the soils in the
United States and their group classification. The soils in the area of the
development site may be identified from a soil survey report that can be
obtained from local NRCS offices or conservation district offices. Soils become
less pervious as the HSG varies from A to D (NRCS 3, 4).

of sewage, industrial waste, restaurant wastes or any other non-stormwater
waste into a separate stormwater drainage system. ILLICIT DISCHARGES can be
accidental or intentional.
   IMPERVIOUS SURFACE (IMPERVIOUS AREA). A surface that prevents the
infiltration of water into the ground. IMPERVIOUS SURFACES AND AREAS shall
include, but not be limited to, roofs, additional indoor living spaces, patios,
garages, storage sheds and similar structures, and any new streets and
sidewalks. However, any surface or area designed, constructed and maintained to
permit infiltration as specified herein shall be considered pervious, not
IMPERVIOUS. For the purposes of this chapter, a surface or area shall not be
considered IMPERVIOUS if such surface or area does not diminish the capacity
for infiltration of stormwater for storms up to, and including, a two-year 24-
hour storm event.

   (A)   Any regulated activity that meets the following exemption criteria is
exempt from the part(s) of this chapter as specified herein. However, the
requirements of the chapter shall otherwise remain in effect. The criteria for
exemption in this section apply to the total development proposed, including
instances in which the development is proposed to take place in phases. The
date of enactment of this chapter shall be the starting point from which future
development and the respective proposed impervious surface computations shall
be cumulatively considered and regulated.
   (B)   Exemption shall not relieve an applicant from implementing such
measures as necessary to meet the intent of this chapter, or compliance with
any NPDES permit requirements.
      (1)   (a)   Regulated activities that create impervious areas equal to or
less than those set forth on Table 1 (cumulative) shall be exempt from the SWM
site plan preparation requirements of this chapter, provided the activity will
not adversely affect downstream property owners and will not cause erosion. The
borough reserves the right to have its designee make the determination of
adverse affect after review of the stormwater permit application and review of
the proposed site.
         (b)   Subject to the requirements of § 111, and notwithstanding the
provisions of this division (B)(1) and Table 1, activities that would otherwise
be regulated activities pursuant to this chapter but are 100 square feet or
less shall be exempt from the stormwater management site plan preparation,
volume control, peak rate control and municipal review and approval provisions
of this chapter provided that the regulated activity does not adversely affect
adjoining properties or cause erosion. A stormwater permit application must
still be submitted for record purposes. All new impervious surfaces shall be
considered in the cumulative totals in determining exemption status.
      (2)   Regulated activities that do not receive an exemption from SWM site
plan preparation requirements per division (B)(1) above or regulated activities
that create impervious areas greater than those set forth on Table 1
(cumulative) may qualify for submission of a simplified SWM site plan per §
53.060(D). The borough’s designee shall determine if a simplified SWM site plan
may be submitted in lieu of a full SWM site plan (per § 53.060) after review of
the stormwater management permit application and review of the proposed site.
The simplified SWM site plan must demonstrate that the proposed activity will
not adversely affect adjoining property owners or cause erosion.
      (3)   Agricultural activity is exempt from the SWM site plan preparation
requirements of this chapter provided the activities are performed according to
the requirements of 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102 and no adverse impacts to adjoining
property owners will occur because of stormwater run-off.

§ 53.042 VOLUME CONTROLS.
   (A)   The low impact development practices provided in the BMP Manual shall
be utilized for all regulated activities to the maximum extent practicable.
Water volume controls shall be implemented using the design storm method in
division (B) below or the simplified method in division (C) below. For
regulated activity areas equal or less than one acre that do not require
hydrologic routing to design the stormwater facilities, this chapter
establishes no preference for either methodology; therefore, the applicant may
select either methodology on the basis of economic considerations, the
intrinsic limitations on applicability of the analytical procedures associated
with each methodology, and other factors.
   (B)   The design storm method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) is applicable to any
size of regulated activity. This method requires detailed modeling based on
site conditions.
      (1)   No plan shall increase the post-development total run-off volume
for all storms equal to or less than the two-year 24-hour duration
precipitation to more than the pre-development total run-off volume.
      (2)   For modeling purposes:
         (a)   Existing (pre-development) non-forested pervious areas must be
considered meadow; and
         (b)   Twenty percent of the existing impervious area of a project
site, when present, shall be considered meadow in the model for existing
conditions, if the existing impervious area is being altered by the proposed
regulated activity.
   (C)   (1)   The simplified method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual) provided below is
independent of site conditions and should be used if the design storm method is
not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated activities greater
than one acre or for projects that require design of stormwater storage
facilities.
      (2)   For new impervious surfaces:
         (a)   Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two
inches of run-off from all new impervious surfaces;
         (b)   At least the first one inch of run-off from new impervious
surfaces shall be permanently removed from the run-off flow, i.e., it shall not
be released into the surface waters of this Commonwealth. Removal options for
the first on inch of run-off include reuse, evaporation, transpiration and
infiltration; and
         (c)   Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed run-off; however, in
all cases at least the first one- half inch of the permanently removed
stormwater run-off shall be infiltrated.
(Ord. 2013-2, passed 10-7-2013)
§ 53.043 RATE CONTROLS.
   (A)   For computation of pre-development peak discharge rates, 20% of the
existing impervious area of a project site, when present, shall be considered
meadow, if the existing impervious area is being altered by the proposed
regulated activity.
   (B)   Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the pre-development
discharge rates for the one-, two-, five-, ten-, 25-, 50- and 100-year 24-hour
storms. If it is shown that the peak rates of discharge indicated by the post-
development analysis are less than or equal to the peak rates of discharge
indicated by the pre-development analysis for one-, two-, five-, ten-, 25-, 50-
and 100-year, 24-hour storms, then the requirements of this section have been
met. Otherwise, the applicant shall provide additional controls as necessary to
satisfy the peak rate of discharge requirement.

PennDOT and PTC roadways and associated facilities shall be consistent with Act
167 plans. DM-2.13.7.B (Policy on Antidegradation and Post Construction
Stormwater Management) was developed as a cooperative effort between PennDOT
and DEP. DM-2.13.7.C (Project Categories) discusses the anticipated impact on
the quality, volume and rate of stormwater run-off.
   (B)   Where standards in the Act 167 elements of the IWRP and this chapter
are impractical, PennDOT or the PTC may request assistance from DEP, in
consultation with the county, to develop an alternative strategy for meeting
state water quality requirements and the goals and objectives of the Act 167
elements within the IWRP.
   (C)   For the purposes of the Act 167 elements in the IWRP and this chapter,
road maintenance activities are regulated under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102.
(Ord. 2013-2, passed 10-7-2013)
§ 53.045 DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (A)   Stormwater collection system.
      (1)   The stormwater collection system shall be designed and approved
based upon the following criteria.
      (2)   Peak discharge shall be computed using the rational formula.
 
   Q = CIA
where:
   Q = Peak discharge in cubic feet per second
   C = Run-off factor expressed as a percent of the total water falling on an
area
   I = The rate of rainfall for the time of concentration of the drainage area in
inches per hour for a given storm frequency (rainfall Intensity)
   A = The drainage area expressed in acres
 
         (a)   The run-off factor “C” is a percentage factor which represents
the proportion of the total quantity of water falling on the area that remains
as run-off.
         (b)   The run-off factors for various types of drainage areas, as
presented in the following table, shall be used for design.
Run-off Factors for the Rational Equation
Type of Drainage Area or Surface Run-off Factor “C”
Run-off Factors for the Rational Equation
Type of Drainage Area or Surface Run-off Factor “C”
Cultivated field                                0.40
Impervious surfaces such as, but not limited
to, roof surface, pavement, concrete or         0.95
bituminous concrete, gravel
Lawn                                            0.25
Meadow                                          0.20
Wooded                                          0.15
Notes:
1.   Consideration should be given to future land use changes in the drainage area in
selecting the “C” factor.
2.   For drainage area containing several different types of ground cover, a weighted value
of “C” factor must be used.
3.   a.   In special situations where sinkholes, stripped abandoned mines and the like exist,
careful evaluation shall be given to the selection of a suitable run-off factor with
consideration given to possible reclamation of the land in the future.
   b.   Rainfall intensity “I” shall be per §
53.040(L) according to the following:
      (1)   Storm frequency:
         (a)   The following storm frequency shall be used for design:
            i.   Local streets -10-year, see storm duration;
            ii.   Culvert cross drains - 25-year rural, 50-year suburban, 100-year urban; and
            iii.   Swales - 100-year.
         (b)   When a pipe or culvert is intended to convey the discharge from a stormwater
management facility, its required capacity shall be computed by the rational method and
compared to the peak outflow from the stormwater management facility for the 100-year storm.
The greater flow shall govern the design of the pipe or culvert.
         (c)   A 100-year design storm frequency may be required for design of the stormwater
collection system to ensure that the resultant stormwater run-off from the post-development
design storm is directed into the stormwater management facility.
         (d)   In all cases where drainage is collected by means of a head wall or pipe end,
the pipe shall be designed as a culvert. The minimum diameter of the culvert shall be 18
inches. The minimum diameter of storm sewer shall be 15 inches, when located in a public
right-of-way or easement.
         (e)   Where the collection system may be under inlet or outlet control, the
Municipal Engineer may request additional calculations, such as, but not limited to,
hydraulic grade lines.
      (2)   Storm duration:
         (a)   A 5-minute storm duration shall be used if this duration does not result in a
maximum expected discharge that exceeds the capacity of a 30-inch pipe; and
         (b)   If a 5-minute storm duration results in a pipe size exceeding 30 inches, the
time of concentration approach shall be used in determining storm duration.
      (3)   Inlet placement: in general, catch basins shall be placed as required by
hydraulic capacity. For design purposes, a capture ratio (intercepted flow / design flow) of
70% or greater is required. However, the width of flow in a street cannot exceed one-half of
the travel lane. In any event, the maximum distance between conveyed inlets shall not exceed
400 feet.
      (4)   Pipe and swale capacity: Manning’s equation shall be used for the design of all
storm sewer pipes and for open channel design:
   V = 1.486 R2/3 S1/2
   n
         where:
         V = Velocity of the water in feet per second
         R = Hydraulic radius which is equal to the net effective areas (A) divided by the
wetted perimeter (W.P.):
   R =  A
    W.P.
            The wetted perimeter is the lineal feet of the drainage facility cross-section
which is wetted by the water.
         S = Slope of the hydraulic gradient (for approximation, use the water surface slope
in a wetted stream and the stream bed slope in dry stream or the pipe slope).
         n = The roughness coefficient. Roughness coefficients are as follows:
            Value of Manning’s roughness coefficient - n
               Bare earth channel0.020
               Concrete          0.012
               Grass-lined channe0.035
               Paved bituminous c0.016l
               Rip-rap           0.040
               Turf reinforcementPer manufacturer’s recommendation
            The maximum permitted velocity in a lined or unlined swale shall be in accordance
with the USDA Engineering Field Manual, PA DEP, applicable Pennsylvania codes and state law,
whichever is less.
            The maximum permitted velocity in storm sewer pipe is 20 FPS. If 20 FPS is
exceeded, the pipe must be anchored in accordance with the following table:
Velocity of Flow (FPS)                          Anchor Spacing (ft.)
20—24.99                                      20
25—30                                         10
Under no circumstances shall flow velocity exceed 30 FPS.
 
   (B)   Stormwater management facilities. The plan shall be designed and
approved based upon the following criteria.
      (1)   General. For drainage areas 320 acres or larger the peak discharge
and run-off shall be computed using the soil-cover complex method contained in
Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, Technical Release No. 55 published by the
Engineering Division, Soil Conservation Services, United States Department of
Agriculture, dated June, 1986 or latest revision, except as modified herein.
For drainage areas less than 320 acres the modified rational method may be
utilized. Alternate methods of analysis may be considered if approved by the
Municipal Engineer.
      (2)   Outflow determination.
         (a)   The maximum permitted stormwater discharge, in cubic feet per
second, from any site shall not exceed the calculated peak discharge from the
site at pre-development ground cover and soil conditions for all design storms
specified in § 101-16.B. For the purpose of this chapter, pre-development
ground cover conditions shall be assumed to be “meadow” for all non-forested
pervious areas as defined in Urban Hydrology for Small Water Sheds, Technical
Release No. 55 published by Engineering Division, Soil Conservation Service,
United States Department of Agriculture, dated June, 1986 or latest revision or
if using the modified rational method a “C” factor of 0.20 shall be used for
meadow conditions for all non-forested pervious areas. For existing impervious
surfaces see §
53.043(A). The maximum permitted stormwater discharge shall be calculated using
the SCS method or alternative method approved by the Municipal Engineer for
rainfalls having recurrence intervals of one, two, five, ten, 25, 50 and 100
years. Time of concentration (Tc) should be calculated using the SCS segmental
approach in accordance with the current recommendations by SCS. For the purpose
of this chapter, the rainfall depths shall be per §
53.040(L).
         (b)   Rainfall intensity shall be per §
53.040(L) for design if using the modified rational method.
         (c)   If alternate methods of analysis are utilized, the design storms
recurrence interval in years shall be the same as used in the SCS TR-55 Method.
      (3)   Minimum required detention storage. The minimum required detention
storage shall be determined by routing the approved post-development
hydrographs through the stormwater management facility, using either manual
methods or computerized routing. Routing shall be based upon the modified PULS
method; other routing methodologies shall be subject to the approval of the
Municipal Engineer.
      (4)   Emergency spillway. Emergency spillways or overflow structures
shall be designed to pass the peak flow resulting from a 100-year recurrence
interval design storm computed at post-development conditions, assuming that
the principal outlet structure is non-functional. All retention basins and
detention basins shall provide an emergency spillway. Emergency spillways shall
be located in cut where feasible, if not, adequate permanent stabilization is
required. All emergency spillways shall be permanently stabilized for the
design peak flow rate and velocity.
      (5)   Minimum bottom slope. All detention basins shall have a minimum
bottom slope of 2%, if not being utilized for infiltration purposes.
      (6)   Side slopes. The maximum side slopes for detention or retention
basins shall be three horizontal to one vertical in cut and four horizontal to
one vertical in fill.
      (7)   Freeboard. The stormwater management facility shall have a minimum
one-half foot of freeboard determined after routing the 100-year recurrence
interval design storm per division (B)(4) above or a minimum of one foot of
freeboard above the normal 100-year storm routing elevation, whichever is
greater.
      (8)   Seepage trench. All stormwater management detention basins shall
provide as a minimum a two-foot wide by ten-foot long by six-foot deep seepage
trench in the bottom of the basin near the outlet control structure, unless
field conditions deem the seepage trench nonfunctional and concurred by the
Municipal Engineer. This seepage trench is not required if the basin is being
utilized for infiltration purposes.
      (9)   Required installations. Fencing, trash racks and installation of
child-proof facilities may be required by the municipality.

cannot be achieved, or for minor subdivisions, the stormwater management
facilities shall be incorporated within individual lots so that respective lot
owners will own and be responsible for maintenance in accordance with this
section and the recorded deed restrictions, agreements and other related
documents. In addition, a nonrefundable deposit in an amount to be set by the
municipality shall be made by the developer for each stormwater management
facility that is intended for ownership by the lot owner to cover the cost of
inspections and necessary maintenance and repairs, except that the municipality
can waive this deposit, and require that the developer create covenants to
permit the municipality to place a lien on the residual tract of the
subdivision as well as the lot on which the facility is located, in the event
that a lot owner’s failure to maintain or repair the facility requires the
municipality to maintain or repair it.
            3.   Municipal ownership: the municipality reserves the right to
accept or reject the ownership, operation and maintenance responsibility for
any or all of the stormwater management facilities.

   WHEREAS, the SWM BMP Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Plan approved by the
municipality (hereinafter referred to as the “O&M Plan”) for the property
identified herein, which is attached hereto as Appendix A and made part hereof,
as approved by the municipality, provides for management of stormwater within
the confines of the property through the use of BMPs; and
   WHEREAS, the municipality, and the landowner, his or her successors and
assigns, agree that the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the
municipality and the protection and maintenance of water quality require that
on-site SWM BMPs be constructed and maintained on the property; and
   WHEREAS, the municipality requires, through the implementation of the SWM
Site Plan, that SWM BMPs as required by said SWM Site Plan and the Municipal

   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing promises, the mutual
covenants contained herein, and the following terms and conditions, the parties
hereto agree as follows.
   1.   The landowner shall construct the BMPs in accordance with the plans and

   4.   In the event the landowner fails to operate and maintain the BMPs per
division 2. above, the municipality or its representatives may enter upon the
property and take whatever action is deemed necessary to maintain said BMP(s).
It is expressly understood and agreed that the municipality is under no
obligation to maintain or repair said facilities, and in no event shall this
agreement be construed to impose any such obligation on the municipality.
   5.   In the event the municipality, pursuant to this agreement, performs

within ten days of receipt of invoice from the municipality. Expenses shall
include, but not be limited to, any and all legal, engineering or other
professional expenses incurred in the furtherance of this agreement or in
enforcement of this agreement.
   6.   The intent and purpose of this agreement is to ensure the proper

any party for damage alleged to result from or be caused by stormwater run-off.
   7.   The landowner, its executors, administrators, assigns and other
successors in interests, shall release the municipality from all damages,
accidents, casualties, occurrences or claims which might arise or be asserted

STREET OPENINGS AND EXCAVATIONS
§ 94.001 SHORT TITLE.
   This subchapter shall be known and referred to as the “North York Borough
Street Opening Ordinance.”
(Ord. 2019-2, passed 2-12-2019)
§ 94.002 PERMIT REQUIRED; PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for a person to make an excavation or opening in
any street or alley right-of-way in the borough without first having obtained a
permit from the borough. For purposes of this subchapter, the term “street”
shall include the paved cartway, the shoulder and any portion of the right-of-
way. The permit shall be issued by the Secretary upon submission of a completed
application and payment of a permit fee, which fee shall be for the use of the
borough to cover the cost of issuance of the permit and of the supervision and
inspections required under this subchapter. The permit fee shall be established
by resolution of Borough Council from time to time.
   (B)   The permit fee includes up to five hours of engineering and inspection
time. The borough reserves the right to establish an escrow account for
engineering and inspection fees required due to the size, nature or complexity
of the street openings or excavations, which, in the opinion of the Borough
Engineer, would necessitate engineering and inspection fees beyond the five
hours of engineering and inspection time included in said permit fee. The
borough shall notify the permit holder of the amount to be placed in escrow
within ten days of the date of receipt of the application or issuance of the
permit, whichever is later. The amount to be placed in escrow shall be
supported by a written estimate of time required by the Borough Engineer and
the amount shall be based upon the current rates charged by the Borough
Engineer to the borough as set forth in the borough Fee Resolution, which
resolution may be amended by resolution enacted by Borough Council from time to
time. Permit holder shall place such amount in escrow within five days after
written notice from the borough. In the event permit holder fails to place such
amount in escrow as provided hereunder it shall result in the suspension or
revocation of the permit until such time as the amount it placed in escrow.
   (C)   When such additional engineering and inspection fees are incurred, the
Borough Engineer shall provide a written invoice detailing the specific
project, time spent, the hourly rate per employee and a description and date of
services performed. The borough shall provide a copy of such invoice to the
permit holder, who may dispute such invoice in accordance with those dispute
provisions set forth in § 503 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,
as amended. In the event the permit holder does not dispute said invoice within
45 days of the date of invoice, the borough shall withdraw the fees due from
said escrow account.
   (D)   If the escrow account is reduced to 25% percent or less of the initial
escrow account and the Borough Engineer determines that the work that remains
to be completed will require engineering and inspection fees in excess of those
remaining in the escrow account, the Borough Engineer shall prepare a
supplemental estimate of engineering and inspection fees that will be required
through the completion of the excavation and the borough may require the permit
holder to remit such additional amount into escrow. In the event the permit
holder fails to remit funds into escrow within ten business days of receipt of
notice to do so, the borough may suspend or revoke the permit issued until such
time as the funds are deposited into escrow.
   (E)   If any funds remain in escrow upon completion of the work contemplated
by the permit, the borough shall return such funds remaining to the permit
holder within 30 days of the date of the final invoice from the Borough
Engineer for services provided pursuant to such permit. If the funds in escrow
are not sufficient to pay the final invoice from the Borough Engineer, such
balance shall be invoiced to the permit holder and shall be due within 45 days,
subject to the dispute provisions set forth above. Should the permit holder
fail to pay for such invoice within the time frame provided herein, the borough
shall be authorized to recover such fees from the financial guarantee provided
for below.
   (F)   The permit holder shall deposit with the borough financial security as
provided below, as a guarantee that the permit holder will fill the excavation,
restore the surface of the street disturbed by the work done under the permit
and pay any additional engineering and inspection fees beyond those included in
the permit fee, as required hereunder.
      (1)   Cash deposits. Any person applying for a permit under this
subchapter may deposit a sum in cash as financial security. The amount of the
cash deposit shall be set by the formula attached to Ord. 2019-2, which formula
may be amended by Borough Council by resolution from time to time with input
from the Borough Engineer. Upon completion of the work covered by the permit
and upon satisfactory inspection by the Borough Engineer, one- half of such
cash deposit shall be promptly refunded by the borough to the permit holder.
The balance of the cash deposit shall be held by the borough for a period of
one year from the date of the expiration of the permit.
      (2)   Surety bond. The applicant may provide to the borough a surety bond
naming the borough as beneficiary in an amount equal to the difference between
any cash deposit given and the guarantee amount set in accordance with division
(A) above. The borough may accept a “blanket” surety bond from utilities who
intend to apply for multiple openings and excavations within the borough on an
annual basis. Such “blanket” surety bond shall be in an amount, in the opinion
of the borough, sufficient to guarantee the filling of excavations and
restoration of the surface of streets for all openings or excavations made
within the borough in any annual period. The required surety bond shall:
         (a)   Be with a surety company satisfactory to the borough.
         (b)   Be with a surety company authorized to transact business in the
Commonwealth.
         (c)   Be satisfactory to the Borough Solicitor in form and substance.
         (d)   Be conditioned upon the permit holder’s compliance with this
subchapter and further conditioned upon filling, restoring and placing in good
and safe condition, as near as to the condition prior to disturbance by the
permit holder, and to the satisfaction of the Borough Engineer.
         (e)   Be for a term that commences on the date of the permit and ends
upon the expiration of one year from the date of expiration of the permit.

3; Ord. 2019-2, passed 2-12-2019) Penalty, see §
94.999
§ 94.003 CONDITIONS OF PERMIT.
   Every permit issued under this subchapter shall state, as conditions of the
permit, the purpose for which the opening or excavation is authorized; the
location and approximate surface area of the opening; the dates when the work
under the permits is to be commenced and to be completed; the name of the
contractor or subcontractor completing such opening or excavation, and the
number of days for which the permit shall be valid. It shall be the duty of the
permit holder to do all work under this subchapter in conformity with all these
conditions, and a failure to comply with any of the conditions shall constitute
a violation of this subchapter.
(Ord. 2019-2, passed 2-12-2019) Penalty, see §
94.999
§ 94.004 DUTIES OF PERMIT HOLDER.
   (A)   It shall be the duty of the holder of every permit issued under this
subchapter:
      (1)   At all times to take every necessary and reasonable safety
precaution, including the installation and maintenance of guards, barriers and
warning signs and, during hours of darkness and restriction visibility, warning
lights or flares.
      (2)   To backfill the excavation, with materials prescribed, compacted
into eight-inch layers, and to resurface the portion of the street disturbed by
the excavation with the same material that was at the location before the
excavation, as set forth in the guidelines for “Paving Maintenance and
Restoration” attached to Ord. 2019-2, which represent the minimum standards for
completion of the work permitted. The Borough Council may amend the guidelines
for Paving Maintenance and Restoration by resolution adopted from time to time.
      (3)   Before the date of expiration of the permit, to remove all tools,
equipment, debris and other material and ordnances used in connection with or
accumulating by reason of the opening or excavation and the work pertaining to
the excavation.
      (4)   To save and hold the borough, its employees, officers, agents and
servants, harmless from and indemnify it against all actions, suits, demands,
payments, costs and charges for or by reason of the opening or excavation, and
all damages to persons or property resulting in any manner from the opening or
excavation, or occurring in the prosecution of the work connected with it or
from any other matter, cause or thing relating to it at any time when the
permit is in effect and for a period of one year after the date of expiration
of the permit, provided a permit holder who occupies a street under a franchise
previously granted by the borough shall also be responsible for adhering to any
conditions contained in that franchise pertaining to the subject matter of this
subchapter or to making, guarding or refilling openings or excavations in
streets or restoring the surfaces of the street afterward.
      (5)   To provide satisfactory written evidence that the permit holder has
in force and will maintain public liability insurance of not less than
$1,000,000 for any one person and $1,000,000 in the aggregate and property
damage insurance of not less than $500,000 from a duly licensed insurance
company authorized to do business in this Commonwealth.
      (6)   To contact and comply with the Pennsylvania One Call System.
      (7)   To secure and clearly mark equipment or vehicles that remain
overnight so as not to create a threat to the health, safety or welfare of any
borough resident or to anyone using streets located within the borough.
      (8)   Except in the event of an emergency as defined in §
94.006, at least 24 hours prior to the start of excavation or street opening,
the permit holder shall notify the borough or its designated agent as indicated
in the permit application to schedule an inspection for the work. No work shall
occur without notification and inspection by the borough or its designated
agent except in the event of an emergency as defined in §
94.006.
      (9)   In the event the permit holder fails to notify the borough or its
agent and have such inspection, the permit holder shall be required to reopen
the area of the street restored so that the borough or its agent may inspect
the backfilled area as required herein.
      (10)   Should the permit holder fail to notify the borough or its agent
and have the work inspected as provided in this section, the permit holder
shall be required to pay an additional permit fee of $200 to cover
administrative costs and additional engineering and inspection fees.
   (B)   Restoration of surface.
      (1)   The permit holder shall restore the surface of all streets broken
into or damaged as a result of the excavation work to the street’s original
condition. The permit holder may be required to place a temporary surface over
openings made in paved traffic lanes. Except when the pavement is to be
replaced prior to the opening of the cut to traffic, the fill above the bottom
of the paving slab shall be made with suitable material, well tamped into
place, and the fill shall be topped with a minimum of at least one inch of
bituminous mixture which is suitable to maintain the opening in good condition
until permanent restoration can be made. The crown of the temporary restoration
shall be flush with the adjoining pavement. The permit holder shall exercise
special care in making such temporary restorations and must maintain such
restorations in safe traveling condition until such time as permanent
restorations are made. The asphalt which is used shall be in accordance with
the specifications of the Borough Engineer. If, in the judgment of the Borough
Engineer, it is not expedient to replace the pavement over any cut or
excavation made in the street upon completion of the work allowed under such
permit by reason of the looseness of the earth or weather conditions, the
Borough Engineer may direct the permit holder to lay a temporary pavement of
suitable material designated by him over such cut or excavation, to remain
until such time as the repair of the original pavement may be properly made.
      (2)   Permanent restoration of the street shall be made by the permit
holder in strict accordance with the guidelines for Paving Maintenance and
Restoration. Disturbed portions of the street, including but not limited to
slopes and appurtenances and structures such as guide rails, curbs, signs,
markings, drainpipes, driveways and vegetation, shall be restored by the permit
holder to a condition at least equal to that which existed before the start of
work authorized by the permit. Additional restoration may also be required,
upon written notification, to restore the structural integrity of the pavement
or shoulder.
         (a)   If the permit holder opens pavement having bituminous concrete
surface, and the borough street’s wearing course is less than five years old,
the permit holder shall, in addition to the restoration conditions outlined in
the permit and this subchapter, overlay the pavement in accordance with the
following conditions:
            1.   When a longitudinal opening longer than 100 linear feet has
been made in the pavement, the permit holder shall overlay the traffic lanes in
which the opening was made for the entire length of the street that was opened,
in a manner authorized by the borough.
            2.   When two or more transverse openings have been made within 100
linear feet of pavement, the permit holder shall overlay traffic lanes in which
the openings were made for the entire length of the street between the
openings, in a manner authorized by the borough.
            3.   When four or more openings have been made by the same permit
holder within 200 linear feet of pavement within any 12-month period, the
permit holder shall overlay traffic lanes in which the openings were made for
the entire length of the street between the openings, in a manner authorized by
the borough.
            4.   If disturbance lanes adjacent to undisturbed lanes are
overlaid, the edge of the disturbed lane shall be saw cut or milled to a depth
of one and one- half inches or the depth of the existing surface course,
whichever is less, for the length of the opening to ensure a smooth joint, with
proper elevation and cross section. A full-width overlay may be authorized on
various streets instead of saw cutting or milling the disturbed lane.
            5.   If disturbed lanes adjacent to shoulders are overlaid, the
shoulder shall be raised, with material and in a manner authorized by the
borough for the type of existing shoulder, so that the overlaid pavement and
shoulder edges are at the same elevation.
            6.   A one foot cut-back of the wearing surface may be required on
a case by case basis, in a manner authorized by the borough.
         (b)   Regardless of the age of the wearing course:
            1.   If more than 100 linear feet of longitudinal or transverse
openings, or both, are made in the pavement, the borough may require the permit
holder to overlay traffic lanes in which the openings were made for the entire
length of street that was opened, if the borough determines that the
rideability or structural integrity of the pavement has been impaired by the
openings.
            2.   If four or more openings are made by the same permit holder
within 200 linear feet of pavement within any 12-month period, the borough may
require the permit holder to restore the entire disturbed pavement between the
openings by milling, planing or other authorized method and overlaying the
entire disturbed pavement.
            3.   Acceptance or approval of any excavation work by the Borough
Engineer shall not prevent the borough from asserting a claim against the
permit holder for defective work if discovered within 24 months from the
completion of the excavation work. Further, the Borough Engineer’s presence
during the performance of any excavation work shall not relieve the permit
holder of its responsibilities hereunder.
            4.   A one foot cut-back of the wearing surface may be required on
a case by case basis, in a manner authorized by the borough.
(Ord. 2019-2, passed 2-12-2019) Penalty, see §
94.999
§ 94.005 WORK PERFORMED BY BOROUGH; COSTS.
   If any work required under a permit issued under this subchapter shall not
be completed within the time required by the permit or shall not be completed
and maintained as required in §
94.004 above by the permit holder, the borough or the person designated for the
purpose by the borough shall have authority to have the work completed or
rectified, as the case may be, by borough personnel or by any person or firm
engaged by the borough for the purpose. Any settlement of the surface within
the said one-year period shall be determined to be conclusive evidence of
defective workmanship, and the borough may use any or all of the deposit or
proceed against such bond to perform the necessary repair work. The cost of
such work including design, engineering and legal fees, with an additional
charge of 10%, shall be charged to the permit holder and shall be due and
payable to the borough within 30 days of the date of such invoice. In the event
the permit holder fails to pay said invoice, the deposit or surety bond filed
with the borough under §
94.002 shall be used as a source for the money due from the permit holder under
this section, and if the deposit or bond is not sufficient, the amount
remaining due shall be collected from the permit holder by the borough. The
borough may collect such amounts due through any legal means, including, but
not limited to an action in assumpsit and the Municipal Lien and Tax Claim Law.
No subsequent permit shall be issued to any person who owes any amount to the
borough under this section.

§ 130.01 PURPOSE.
   The minors’ curfew is not intended to infringe upon the freedoms of resident
youth, but rather to assure that minors have adequate parental/guardian
supervision during focal times of the day, and to offer support to minors and
parents/guardians experiencing curfew concerns.
(2006 Code, § 6-201) (Ord. 2008-4, passed 5-5-2008)
§ 130.02 FINDINGS.
   (A)   This is a substitution for the borough’s curfew Ord. 91-11 of November
4, 1991, as previously amended and revised, prescribing, in accordance with
prevailing community standards, regulations for the conduct of minors on
streets at night, for the protection of younger children in the borough from
each other and from other persons on the streets during nighttime hours, for
the enforcement of parental control and responsibility for their children, for
the protection of the public from nocturnal criminal mischief by minors and for
the reduction of the incident of juvenile criminal activity, all for the good
of minors, for the furtherance of family responsibility and for the public
good, safety and welfare.
   (B)   The Borough Council finds that the minors curfew meets a very real
local need, has been over the years a significant factor in minimizing juvenile
delinquency and should be updated and amplified in the light of the borough’s
local situation and facts.
   (C)   The community sense of the proper time for cessation of outdoor
activities by minors on the streets is reflected in the curfew hours declared
by this chapter which takes into consideration also the danger hours for
nocturnal crime and for accumulations of minors with potential risks incident
to immaturity.
   (D)   Adequate indoor living space in the borough permits minors to
healthfully occupy their time.
   (E)   Commercial recreational facilities are almost nonexistent, and there
is little or nothing for minors to do outdoors but roam the streets after the
curfew hours.
   (F)   The borough is a stable family community. Parental responsibility for
the whereabouts of children is the norm, legal sanctions to enforce such
responsibility have had a demonstrated effectiveness over the years, as
parental control increases likelihood of juvenile delinquency decreases, and
there is a continuing need for the nocturnal curfew for minors which has
achieved and will continue to achieve under local conditions the purposes
hereinbefore stated.
(2006 Code, § 6-202) (Ord. 2008-4, passed 5-5-2008)

Zone in the Flood Insurance Study prepared by the FEMA. The term shall also
include floodway areas which have been identified in other available studies or
sources of information for those floodplain areas where no floodway has been
identified in the Flood Insurance Study;
      (2)   FF (FLOOD-FRINGE AREA). The remaining portions of the 100-year
floodplain in those areas identified as an AE Zone in the Flood Insurance
Study, where a floodway has been delineated. The basis for the outermost
boundary of this area shall be the 100-year flood elevations as shown in the
flood profiles contained in the Flood Insurance Study;
      (3)   FE (SPECIAL FLOODPLAIN AREA). The areas identified as Zone AE in
the Flood Insurance Study, where 100-year flood elevations have been provided,
but no floodway has been delineated; and
      (4)   FA (GENERAL FLOODPLAIN AREA). The areas identified as Zone A in the
FIS for which no 100-year flood elevations have been provided. When available,
information from other federal, state and other acceptable sources shall be
used to determine the 100-year elevation, as well as a floodway area, if
possible. When no other information is available, the 100-year elevation shall
be determined by using a point on the boundary of the identified floodplain
area which is nearest the construction site in question.
   (B)   In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional
engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the
technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.

GENERAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES
§ 153.075 APPLICATION.
   The following principles, standards and requirements will be applied by the
Council of the borough and Planning Commission to evaluating plans for proposed
subdivision or land developments. The standards and requirements outlined
herein shall be considered minimum standards and requirements for the promotion
of the public health, safety, morals and general welfare. Where literal
compliance with the standards herein specified is clearly impractical, the
Council of the borough may modify or adjust the standards to permit reasonable
utilization of property while securing substantial conformance with the
objectives of this chapter.
(2006 Code, § 22-501) (Ord. 90-9, passed 9-10-1990, § 501)
§ 153.076 LAND REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Land shall be suited to the purposes for which it is to be subdivided
or developed.
   (B)   (1)   Land which is unsuitable for development because of hazards to
life, safety, health or property, shall not be subdivided or developed until
such hazards have been eliminated or unless adequate safeguards against such
hazards are provided for in the subdivision or land development plan.
      (2)   Land included as having unsuitable characteristics would be the
following:
         (a)   Land subject to flooding or which has a high ground water table;
         (b)   Land which, if developed, will create or aggravate a flooding
condition upon other land;
         (c)   Land subject to subsidence;
         (d)   Land subject to underground fires;
         (e)   Land containing significant areas of slopes greater than 10%;
         (f)   Land which, because of topography or means of access, is
considered hazardous by the Council of the borough; and
         (g)   Land which is subject to ground pollution or contamination.
   (C)   Proposed subdivisions or land developments shall be coordinated with
existing nearby neighborhoods so that the community as a whole may develop
harmoniously.
   (D)   Proposed land uses shall conform to the borough zoning ordinance (
Chapter 154 of this code of ordinances).
(2006 Code, § 22-502) (Ord. 90-9, passed 9-10-1990, § 502) Penalty, see §
153.999
§ 153.077 STREET SYSTEM.
   (A)   Proposed streets shall be properly related to such street plans or
parts thereof as have been officially prepared and adopted by the borough and
shall be coordinated with existing or proposed streets in adjoining
subdivisions or land developments.
   (B)   Proposed streets shall further conform to such county and state road
and highway plans as have been prepared, adopted or filed as prescribed by law.
   (C)   Streets shall be related to the topography so as to produce usable
lots and acceptable grades.
   (D)   Access shall be given to all lots and portions of the tract in the
subdivision or land development and to adjacent unsubdivided territory unless
the topography clearly indicates that such connection is not feasible. Streets
giving such access shall be improved to the limits of the subdivision or land
development and shall be improved to borough specifications. Reserve strips and
land-locked areas shall not be created.
   (E)   Streets shall be laid out to preserve the integrity of their design.
Local access streets shall be laid out to discourage their use by through
traffic and, where possible, arterial streets shall be designed for use by
through traffic.
   (F)   Where the proposed subdivision or land development contains or is
adjacent to an existing or proposed arterial street or a highway designated as
a limited access highway by the appropriate highway authorities, provisions
shall be made for marginal access streets at a distance acceptable for the
appropriate use of the land between the arterial street or limited access
highway and the marginal access streets. The Council of the borough may also
require rear service areas, double frontage lots or such other treatment as
will provide protection for abutting properties, reduction in the number of
intersections with primary streets, and separation of local and through
traffic.
   (G)   Half or partial streets will not be permitted in new subdivisions or
land developments except where essential to reasonable subdivision or
development of a tract in conformance with the other requirements and standards
of this chapter and where, in addition, satisfactory assurance for dedication
of the remaining part of the street can be secured.
   (H)   Wherever a tract to be subdivided or developed borders an existing
half or partial street, the entire street shall be shown on the plan.
   (I)   Dead-end streets shall be prohibited, except as stubs (with adequate
turning capability) to permit future street extension into adjoining tracts, or
when designed as cul-de-sacs.
   (J)   New reserve strips, including those controlling access to streets,
shall be forbidden.
   (K)   Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the arrangement of streets
in a proposed subdivision or land development shall be made to provide for the
proper projection of streets into the unsubdivided land.
   (L)   Street names shall be coordinated with existing or platted street
names, and if new street is a continuation of or is aligned with an existing or
platted street, it shall bear the same name as the exiting or platted street.
   (M)   No street shall be laid out or opened which extends to or crosses any
boundary between the borough and any other municipality except with the
specific approval of the Council of the borough and upon such conditions as the
Council of borough may impose. If the street is proposed to serve a commercial
area, an industrial area or a residential area of 50 dwelling units or more,
located in another municipality, the street shall not be approved unless the
area is also served by a street in the other municipality and unless the
relevant traffic facilities of the borough are adequate to handle the
anticipated volume.
   (N)   All streets shall have a uniform width throughout their respective
lengths except where otherwise required by the Council of the borough pursuant
to §
153.078(B) and (C).

§ 153.078 STREET DESIGN.
   (A)   Street classification. Three functional classifications are hereby
established for the streets and roads in the borough.
      (1)   Arterial. This classification includes highways which provide
intra-county or inter-municipal traffic of substantial volumes where the
average trip lengths are usually five miles or greater. Generally these
highways should accommodate operating speeds of 35 to 55 mph.
      (2)   Collector. This classification is intended to include those
highways which connect local access highways to arterial highways. They may
serve intra-county and intra-township traffic. They may serve as traffic
corridors connecting residential areas with industrial, shopping and other
service. They may penetrate residential areas. Generally, these highways will
accommodate operating speeds of 35 mph.
      (3)   Local access. This classification is intended to include streets
and roads that provide direct access to abutting land and connections to higher
classes of roadways. Traffic volumes will be low and travel distances generally
short. These streets and roads should be designed for operating speeds of 25
mph or under.
   (B)   Right-of-way widths.
      (1)   Minimum widths for each type of public street shall be as follows:
 
Type of Street Right-of-way Width Cartway Width
Arterial       80 ft.—120 ft.   46 ft.
Collector      60 ft.             34 ft.
Local access   50 ft.             30 ft.
 
      (2)   Where a proposed subdivision abuts or contains an existing public
street or road having a right-of-way width less than would be required if said
street or road where created under this chapter, sufficient additional width
for right-of-way shall be provided and dedicated to meet the foregoing
standards.
      (3)   Additional right-of-way and cartway widths may be required by the
Council of the borough to promote public safety and convenience when special
conditions require it and to provide parking space in areas of intensive use.
   (C)   Cul-de-sac streets.
      (1)   Cul-de-sac streets, whether permanent or temporary, shall be
provided at the closed end with a turnaround having a minimum radius to the
edge of the finished street or curb line of not less than 40 feet and right-of-
way not less than 50 feet.
      (2)   Unless future extension is clearly impractical or undesirable, the
turnaround right-of-way shall be placed adjacent to a property line and a
right-of-way as to permit future extension of the street into the adjoining
tract. At such time as such a street is extended, the overage created by the
turnaround outside the boundaries of the extended street shall revert in
ownership to the property owners fronting on the cul-de-sac turnaround.
      (3)   Commercial and industrial cul-de-sacs shall be reviewed for
adequacy by the Borough Engineer. His or her recommendations will be given to
the Council of the borough who shall have final authority in this matter.
      (4)   Permanent cul-de-sac streets shall be kept to a minimum and shall
not exceed 600 feet in length.
   (D)   Street alignment.
      (1)   Whenever street lines are deflected by more than five degrees,
connection shall be made by horizontal curves.
      (2)   The minimum radius at the centerline for horizontal curves on
collector and arterial streets shall be 300 feet, and for local streets the
minimum radius shall be 100 feet.
      (3)   On local access streets, the minimum tangent between reverse curves
shall be at least 100 feet; on collector and arterial streets, the minimum
tangent be at least 250 feet.
      (4)   Minimum vertical sight distance measured three and one-half feet
above grade shall be 300 feet for collector and arterial streets and 100 feet
for access streets.
   (E)   Street grades.
      (1)   The minimum grade on all streets shall be 1%.
      (2)   The maximum grade on collector or arterial streets shall be 7% and
on local access streets 10%.
      (3)   Multiple intersections involving the junction of more than two
streets shall be avoided. Where this proves impossible, such intersections
shall be designed with extreme care for both pedestrian and vehicular safety.
      (4)   Streets shall be all laid out to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles. Local streets shall not intersect collector or arterial streets
at an angle of less than 75 degrees. The intersection of two local streets
shall not be at an angle of less than 60 degrees.
      (5)   Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two local streets shall
be at least 20 feet; and minimum curve radius at an intersection of a local
street and a collector or arterial street shall be at least 25 feet.
      (6)   There shall be provided and maintained at all intersections clear
sight triangles of 75 feet in all directions measured along the centerline from
the point of intersection. Nothing which obstructs the vision of a motorist
shall be permitted in this area.
      (7)   Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever
practical. Where the grade of any street at the approach to an intersection
exceeds 7%, a leveling area shall be provided having a grade of not greater
than 4% for a distance of 25 feet measured from the nearest right-of-way line
of the intersecting street.
   (F)   Pavement design.
      (1)   Specifications. All components of the pavement structure shall be
designed and constructed in accordance with Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation Specifications, Form 408.
      (2)   Minimum requirements. The following shall be considered to be
minimum standards for street construction in the borough: one and one-half inch
ID-2 wearing, two inch ID-2 binder and eight inch 2A stone base.
   (G)   Alleys and driveways.
      (1)   Alleys are prohibited in residential developments.
      (2)   Driveways serving properties located adjacent to an intersection
shall be offset from the intersection of the curb line a distance not less that
the required setback dimension.

   (A)   Curbs.
      (1)   Curbs shall be provided on all streets and parking compounds
located within multi-family and apartment building developments. Curbs shall
also be required on new streets in subdivisions or land developments in which
the average lot width of interior lots at the required building setback line is
100 feet or less. Curbs may also be required in any subdivision in which the
lot areas or lot widths exceed the above minimum, when the centerline street
grade of any street exceeds 3%. In such cases, curbs or other drainage controls
shall be installed to properly control surface drainage and protect the streets
from erosion. The requirement of curbs may be waived at the discretion of the
Council of the borough.
      (2)   All curbs shall be depressed at intersections to sufficient width
to accommodate wheelchairs. Depression shall be in line with sidewalks where
provided.
      (3)   Curbs may be either the vertical or type of slant curb and gutter
type. The transition from one type of curb to another shall occur only at
street intersections.
      (4)   All curbs shall be constructed of Portland cement concrete with
expansion joints every 20 feet, and shall follow PennDOT standards where
applicable.
   (B)   Sidewalks.
      (1)   Sidewalks shall be provided on all streets and parking compounds
located within multi-family and apartment building developments. Sidewalks
shall also be required on new streets in subdivisions or land developments in
which average lot width of interior lots at the required building setback line
is 100 feet or less. The requirement of sidewalks may be waived at the
discretion of the Council of the borough.
      (2)   Minimum widths for sidewalks along each type of public street shall
be four feet, and shall follow PennDOT specifications where applicable.

153.999
§ 153.080 STORMWATER DRAINAGE.
   (A)   Lots shall be laid out and graded to provide positive drainage away
from buildings. The Council of the borough may require a grading and drainage
plan for individual lots indicating a buildable area within each lot, complying
with the setback requirements, for which positive drainage is assured.
   (B)   No person, corporation or other entity shall block, impede the flow
of, alter, construct any structure, or deposit any material or thing, or commit
any act which will affect normal or flood flow in any communal stream or
watercourse without having obtained prior approval from the borough or
Department of Environmental Protection, whichever is applicable. In addition,
all applicants for subdivision and/or land development approval shall comply
with the borough stormwater management ordinance (
Chapter 53 of this code of ordinances), if applicable.
   (C)   Where a subdivision or land development is traversed by a natural
watercourse, there shall be provided a drainage easement or right-of-way
conforming substantially with the line of such watercourse and of such width as
will be adequate to preserve natural drainage.
   (D)   The borough will assure that all permanent streams, not under
jurisdiction of other official agencies, are maintained open and free flowing.
   (E)   The subdivider or developer, and each person, corporation or other
entity which makes any surface changes shall be required to:
      (1)   Collect on-site surface run-off and dispose of it to the point of
discharge into the common natural watercourse of the drainage area;
      (2)   Design drainage facilities to handle run-off from upstream areas,
assuming full development of those areas, based upon the Comprehensive Plan for
the borough; and
      (3)   Design, construct and/or install such drainage structures and
facilities as are necessary to prevent erosion damage to the subdivision or
land development, adjacent property and downstream property. Such structures
and facilities shall satisfactorily convey such surface waters to the nearest
practical street, storm drain, detention pond or natural watercourse.
   (F)   Storm sewers, culverts and related installations shall be provided to
permit unimpeded flow of natural watercourses, to drain all low points along
streets, and to intercept stormwater run-off along streets at intervals
reasonably related to the extent and grade of the area drained.
   (G)   Storm sewers, as required, shall be placed in front of the curb or
curb line when located in a street right-of-way. When located in undedicated
land, they shall be centered within an easement not less than 20 feet wide, as
approved by the Borough Engineer, who may require additional width of easement
as circumstances warrant.
   (H)   Street drainage will not be permitted to cross intersections or the
crown of the road.
      (1)   Maximum spacing of street inlets shall not exceed 400 feet.
      (2)   All street inlets shall be PennDOT Type C or M. Inlet tops shall be
cast in place reinforced concrete or precast concrete.
      (3)   All culvert ends shall be provided with either reinforced concrete
headwalls or pipe end sections.
      (4)   Minimum pipe size shall be 15-inch diameter.
      (5)   When material for storm drain systems is not specified, PennDOT
specifications will govern.
   (I)   All springs and sump pumps discharge shall be collected so as not to
flow in the streets.
   (J)   Storm roof drains shall not discharge water directly over a sidewalk.
   (K)   Stabilized outlets shall be provided for footer drains, floor drains
and downspouts.
   (L)   The Soils Cover Complex Method of the Soil Conservation Service of the
U.S. Department of Agriculture shall be used as the primary means of estimating
stormwater run-off.
   (M)   The rational method may be used for analysis of storm sewer systems
and for stormwater management facilities in minor subdivisions.
   (N)   Where the estimated run-off based upon the above methods is doubtful,
several recognized methods should be studied and compared.
   (O)   The minimum design criteria shall be a ten-year storm. Higher
frequency conditions shall be used in sensitive areas and where an overflow
would endanger public or private property, at the desecration of the Borough
Engineer.
   (P)   Run-off calculations must include complete hydrologic and hydraulic
design and analysis of all control facilities.
   (Q)   Control facilities (stormwater basins).
      (1)   Permanent control measures/facilities shall be designed to assure
that the maximum rate of stormwater run-off is not greater after development
than prior to development for a ten- year storm frequency. More stringent
criteria may be required in sensitive areas where stormwater problems presently
exist.
      (2)   Control facilities shall be designed to meet, as a minimum, the
design standards and specifications of the County Conservation District.
         (a)   Detention ponds may be waived by the Council of the borough on
the recommendation of the Borough Engineer at sites in close proximity to the
major streams. This is to facilitate drainage prior to stream flooding.
         (b)   In areas underlain, with limestone geology, ponds shall be
limited to the detention (dry) type unless the developer can show a special
need for a retention pond, in which case it shall have a lining. Detention
ponds shall be prohibited in areas of known sinkholes unless the pond is lined.
If a sinkhole develops in a pond or channel before acceptance by the borough, a
lining shall be required.
         (c)   Any ponds with slopes steeper than a maximum three to one side
slopes shall be fenced with a six-foot fence with a type subject to the
approval of the borough.
      (3)   A maintenance program for control facilities must be included as
part of the grading and drainage plan.
         (a)   Maintenance during development activities of a project shall be
the responsibility of the contractor, developer and owner.
         (b)   Arrangement for maintenance of permanent control facilities
after completion of development activities shall be made before approval of
final plans is given by the borough.
         (c)   In cases where permanent control facilities are owned by an
entity, it shall be the responsibility of that entity to maintain control
facilities (e.g., homeowners’ association). In such cases a legally binding
agreement between the owner and the borough shall be made providing for
maintenance of all permanent erosion control facilities, including the
inspection by the borough.

153.999
§ 153.081 LOT GRADING FOR SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENTS.
   (A)   Blocks and lots shall be graded to provide proper drainage away from
buildings and to prevent the collection of stormwater in pools. Minimum 2%
slopes away from structures shall be required.
   (B)   Lot grading shall be of such design as to carry surface waters to the
nearest practical street, storm drain or natural watercourse. Where drainage
swales are used to deliver surface waters away from buildings, their grade
shall be not less than 1% nor more than 4%. The swales shall be sodded, planted
or lined as required. A grading and draining plan shall be required for all
subdivisions and land developments, except minor subdivisions.
   (C)   No final grading shall be permitted with a cut face steeper in slope
than two horizontal to one vertical except under one or more of the following
conditions.
      (1)   The material in which excavation is made is sufficiently stable to
sustain a slope steeper than two horizontal to one vertical, and a written
statement of a civil engineer, licensed by the Commonwealth and experienced in
erosion control, to that effect is submitted to the Borough Engineer and
approved by him or her. The statement shall state that the site has been
inspected and that the deviation from the slope specified hereinbefore will not
result in injury to persons or damage to property.
      (2)   A concrete or stone masonry wall constructed according to sound
engineering standards for which plans are submitted to the Borough Engineer for
review and approval is provided.
   (D)   No final grading shall be permitted which creates any exposed surface
steeper in slope that three horizontal to one vertical except under one or more
of the following conditions.
      (1)   The fill is located so that settlement, sliding or erosion will not
result in property damage or be hazardous to adjoining property, streets,
alleys or buildings.
      (2)   A written statement from a civil engineer, licensed by the
Commonwealth and experienced in erosion control, certifying that he or she has
inspected the site and that the proposed deviation from the slope specified
above will not endanger any property or result in property damage, is submitted
to and approved by the Borough Engineer.
      (3)   A wall is constructed to support the face of the fill.
   (E)   The top or bottom edge of slopes shall be a minimum of three feet from
property or right-of-way lines of streets or alleys in order to permit the
normal rounding of the edge without encroaching on the abutting property. All
property lines, where walls or slopes are steeper than one horizontal to one
vertical and five feet or more in height shall be protected by a protective
fence no less than three feet in height approved by the Borough Engineer.
   (F)   All lots must be kept free of any debris or nuisances whatsoever.

7-10-2006)
§ 153.082 BLOCKS AND LOTS.
   (A)   The length, width, shape and design of blocks shall be determined with
due regard to the provision of adequate sites for buildings of the type
proposed, to the land use and/or zoning requirements of the borough, the
topography of the land being subdivided, and the requirements for safe and
convenient vehicular and pedestrian circulation.
   (B)   Unless the topography of the land being subdivided or the existing
pattern of development in the immediately adjacent area shall be otherwise than
herein required, the following minimum standards for the design and size of
blocks and lots shall prevail.
      (1)   Blocks shall not exceed 1,600 feet in length nor be less than 500
feet in length.
      (2)   Residential blocks shall generally be of sufficient depth to
accommodate two tiers of lots, except where reverse frontage lots bordering an
arterial or collector street are used, or where due to the contour of the land,
or the necessary layout of the subdivision, there is insufficient depth between
intersecting streets for such two tier design.
      (3)   Crosswalks or interior pedestrian walks shall be required in blocks
exceeding 1,000 feet in length to provide for pedestrian circulation or access
to community facilities. Such walks shall be paved for width of not less than
four feet, shall be located in easements not less than ten feet in width, and
shall, insofar as possible, be located in the center of any such block.
      (4)   Blocks for commercial and industrial areas may vary from the
elements of design contained in this section if the nature of the use requires
other treatment. In such cases, off-street parking for employees and customers
shall be provided along with safe and convenient limited access to the street
system. Space for off-street loading shall also be provided with limited access
to the street system. Extension of streets, railroad access right-of-way and
utilities shall be provided as necessary.
      (5)   Lot lines intersecting street lines shall be substantially at right
angles or radial to street lines.
      (6)   Lots shall, in general, front on a street which has already been
dedicated to the borough, or which the subdivider or developer proposes to
dedicate to the borough in connection with approval of the final plan. In
commercial or industrial subdivisions or land developments where access is
proposed to be provided by private streets within the subdivision or land
development, this requirement may be waived by the Council of the borough.
      (7)   The borough shall assign house numbers to each lot within a
subdivision.
      (8)   Minimum lot sizes shall be in accordance with the borough zoning
ordinance (
Chapter 154 of this code of ordinances).
      (9)   Remnants of land, smaller than required for a lot, shall not be
permitted within any subdivision. Such remnants shall be incorporated in
existing or proposed lots, or dedicated to public use if acceptable to the
Council of the borough.
      (10)   No residential lots shall be created which front upon an arterial
or collector street, as defined in §
153.078(A).

§ 153.083 DEVELOPMENT ON PRIVATE STREET DISCOURAGED.
   (A)   It is the policy of this borough that all subdivided lands shall have
immediate access to a public street. Because of unique property configuration
and location, this borough recognizes the need for limited exceptions to the
foregoing general policy.
   (B)   No subdivision will be approved on a private street or road if more
than two lots already front on such street or road or if after subdivision more
than two lots will front on such private street or road.

153.999
§ 153.084 OPEN SPACE, LOT SITING, PLANTING AND BEAUTIFICATION FOR SUBDIVISION
AND LAND DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   Generally. In order to promote the highest environmental quality
possible, the degree to which the applicant of a subdivision or land
development plan has preserved existing salient natural features and land forms
intrinsic to the site shall be assessed. Terms of approval of a plat may be
subject to the manner in which the layout or design of the plan has preserved
existing natural features, such as, but not limited to, trees, wooded areas and
watercourses.
   (B)   Open space. Where the applicant is offering for dedication, or is
required by ordinance to establish a reservation of open space or preserve an
area of scenic or historic importance, a “limit of work”, which will confine
excavation, earth moving procedures and other changes to the landscape, may be
required to ensure preservation and prevent despoliation of the character of
the area in open space.
   (C)   Tree preservation. Whenever possible, trees shall not be removed
unless they are located within the proposed street right-of-way, within the
proposed building area, or within utility locations and equipment access areas.
In areas where trees are retained, the original grade level shall be
maintained, if possible, so as not to disturb the trees.
   (D)   Topsoil preservation. All of the topsoil from areas where cuts and
fills have been made should be stockpiled and redistributed uniformly after
grading. All areas of the site shall be stabilized by seeding or planting on
slopes of less than 10% and shall be stabilized by sodding on slopes 10% or
more than planted in ground cover on slopes 20% or greater.
   (E)   Landscaping. For all multi-family, apartment, office, commercial and
industrial subdivisions or land developments, a landscaping plan shall be
provided and shall include sufficient plantings for the required open space,
planting strips, screenings, formal gardens, shade trees and natural barriers.
   (F)   Buffer planting requirements. Buffer yard requirements should be as
specified in the borough zoning ordinance (
Chapter 154 of this code of ordinances).
   (G)   Preserved landscaping. When there is a conscientious effort to
preserve the existing natural integrity and character of a site and where such
preservation effectuates areas of woodland and trees comparable to required
planting improvements, i.e., landscaping and buffer screening, the plan may be
received in lieu of additional landscaping requirements.
   (H)   Trees. The planting of trees within the street right-of-way line shall
not be permitted. The planting of any trees within the private property of each
residential lot shall be at the discretion of the property owner or developer.
   (I)   Watercourse protection. Where a subdivision or land development is
traversed by a natural watercourse, there shall be provided a drainage easement
or right-of-way conforming substantially with the line of such watercourse and
of such width as will be adequate to preserve natural drainage. Such easement
shall be in addition to the open space required in division (B) above.

§ 153.085 CONTRIBUTION FOR RECREATION PURPOSES.
   (A)   It is the policy of this borough to provide recreational facilities
for all the residents of the borough. Centralized facilities are preferred over
local neighborhood facilities. New and additional facilities are required in
direct proportion to increase in population. Developers causing increases in
population by new residences must share in the cost of additional recreational
facilities.
   (B)   A contribution for recreation purposes shall be made at the rate of
$200 per dwelling unit payable upon and as a condition of obtaining an
occupancy permit pursuant to the ordinances of this borough.
   (C)   The requirements of division (B) above shall be noted upon the final
subdivision plan, which notation shall be deemed not to constitute a lien or
encumbrance on the title of the land.
   (D)   All moneys paid to the borough in this manner shall be kept in a
capital reserve fund established as provided by law. Moneys in such fund may be
combined for investment purposes, if permitted by law, but shall be used only
for the acquisition of land or capital improvements for open space and park and
recreation purposes.
   (E)   The foregoing provisions of this section shall not apply to any
subdivision for which a preliminary plan has been approved by this borough
before the effective date of this chapter which provides for active
recreational facilities (i.e., swimming pool, tennis courts, baseball/softball
fields and the like) as distinguished from passive recreational facilities
(i.e., yards, open play fields, walking trails and the like), it being the
intention of this borough to extend a credit against the monetary contribution
above provided to any developer who has heretofore planned to provide active
recreational facilities agreeable to the borough.

153.999
§ 153.086 EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL.
   (A)   General purpose.
      (1)   The Council of the borough finds that the minimization of erosion
and control of sedimentation in connection with land development and
subdivision are in the public interest, affecting public health, safety and
welfare, and therefore those regulations governing erosion control and
sedimentation control are necessary for the borough.
      (2)   No changes shall be made in the contour of the land, no grading,
excavating, removal or destruction to the topsoil, trees or other vegetative
cover of the land shall be commenced until such time that a plan for minimizing
erosion and sedimentation has been processed with and reviewed by the County
Conservation District, or there has been a determination by the above entities
that such plans are not necessary.
      (3)   No subdivision or land development plan shall be approved unless:
         (a)   There has been an erosion and sedimentation control plan
approved by the County Conservation District that provides for minimizing
erosion and sedimentation consistent with this section, and an improvement bond
or other acceptable securities are deposited with the borough in the form of an
escrow guarantee which will ensure installation and completion of the required
improvements; or
         (b)   There has been a determination by the County Conservation
District that a plan for minimizing erosion and sedimentation is not necessary.
      (4)   Where not specified in this chapter, measures used to control
erosion and reduce sedimentation shall as a minimum meet the standards and
specifications of the County Conservation District. The Borough Engineer, or
other officials as designated, shall ensure compliance with the appropriate
specifications, copies of which are available from the County Conservation
District.
   (B)   Performance principles. The following measures are effective in
minimizing erosion and sedimentation and shall be included where applicable in
the control plan.
      (1)   Stripping vegetation, regarding or other development shall be done
in such a way that will prevent all but minor erosion.
      (2)   Development plans shall preserve salient natural features, keep
cut-fill operations to a minimum, and ensure conformity with topography so as
to create the least erosion potential and adequately handle the volume and
velocity of surface water run-off.
      (3)   Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected
and supplemented.
      (4)   The disturbed area and the duration of exposure shall be kept to a
practical minimum.
      (5)   Disturbed soils shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable.
      (6)   Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect
exposed critical areas during development.
      (7)   The permanent final vegetation and structural erosion control and
drainage measures shall be installed as soon as practical in the development.
      (8)   Provisions shall be made so effectively accommodate the increased
run-off caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after
development. Where necessary, the rate of surface water run-off will be
structurally retarded.
      (9)   Sediment in the run-off water shall be trapped until the disturbed
area is stabilized by the use of debris basins, silt traps or similar measures.
   (C)   Grading for erosion and other environmental controls. In order to
provide suitable sites for building and other uses, improve surface drainage
and control erosion, the following requirements shall be met.
      (1)   Streets shall be improved to a mud-free or otherwise permanently
passable condition as one of the first items of work done on a subdivision or
development. The wearing surface shall be installed in accordance with §
153.078(F) and as approved in the final plan.
      (2)   Provisions shall be made to prevent surface water from damaging the
cut face of excavations or the sloping surfaces of fills, by installation of
temporary or permanent drainage across or above these areas.
      (3)   Fill shall be placed and compacted so as to minimize sliding or
erosion of the soil.
      (4)   Fills placed adjacent to watercourses shall have suitable
protection against erosion during periods of flooding.
      (5)   During grading operations, necessary measures for dust control will
be exercised.
      (6)   Grading equipment will not be allowed to enter into flowing
streams. Provisions will be made for the installation of temporary or permanent
culverts or bridges.
   (D)   Responsibility.
      (1)   Whenever sedimentation damage is caused by stripping vegetation,
grading or other development, it shall be the collective responsibility of the
land developer and subdivider, and of the contractor, person, corporation and
other entity causing such sedimentation to remove it from all adjoining
surfaces, drainage systems and watercourses and to repair any damage at his or
her expense as quickly as possible.
      (2)   Maintenance of all erosion and sedimentation control facilities
during the construction and development period is the responsibility of the
land developer or subdivider.
      (3)   It is the responsibility of any developer or subdivider, and any
person, corporation or other entity doing any act on or across a communal
stream, watercourse or swale, or upon the floodplain or right-of-way, to
maintain as nearly as possible in its present state the stream, watercourse,
swale, floodplain, or right-of-way during the pendency of the activity and to
return it to its original or equal condition after such activity is completed.
      (4)   The subdivider or land developer shall provide and install, at his
or her expense, in accordance with County Conservation District requirements,
all drainage and erosion control improvements (temporary and permanent) shown
on the erosion and sediment control plan.
   (E)   Compliance with regulations and procedures.
      (1)   The Council of the borough, in their consideration of all
preliminary plans of subdivision and land development, shall condition its
approval upon the execution of erosion and sediment control measures as
contained in divisions (B) and (C) above.
      (2)   The installation and design of the required erosion and sediment
control measures shall be in accordance with standards and specifications of
the York County Conservation District.
   (F)   Stream channel construction. Stream channel construction shall conform
to criteria established by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection.

§ 153.087 FLOODPLAIN AREA REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Purpose. The specific purposes of these special provisions are:
      (1)   To regulate the subdivision or development of land within any
designated floodplain area in order to promote the general health, welfare and
safety of the community;
      (2)   To require that each subdivision lot in flood prone areas be
provided with a safe building site with adequate access; and that public
facilities which serve such uses be designed and installed to preclude flood
damage at the time of initial construction; and
      (3)   To prevent individuals from buying lands which are unsuitable for
use because of flooding by prohibiting the improper subdivision or development
of unprotected lands within the designated floodplain districts.
   (B)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. To the extent that this section
imposes greater requirements or more complete disclosure than any other
provisions of this chapter, in any respect, or to the extent that the
provisions of this section are more restrictive than such other provisions, it
shall control such other provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   Disclaimer of municipal liability. The grant of a permit or approval
of a plan for any proposed subdivision or land development to be located within
any designated floodplain area shall not constitute a representation, guarantee
or warranty of any kind by the borough or by any official or employee thereof
of the practicability or safety of the proposed use, and shall create no
liability upon the borough, its officials, employees or agents.
   (D)   Application procedures and requirements.
      (1)   Pre-application procedures.
         (a)   Prior to the preparation of any plans, it is suggested that
prospective developers consult with the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection concerning soil suitability when on-site sewage
disposal facilities are proposed.
         (b)   Prospective developers shall consult the County Conservation
District representative concerning erosion and sediment control and the effect
of geologic conditions on the proposed development. At the same time, a
determination should be made as to whether or not any flood hazards either
exist or will be created as a result of the subdivision or development.
      (2)   Preliminary plan requirements. The following information shall be
required as part of the preliminary plan and shall be prepared by a registered
engineer or surveyor:
         (a)   Name of engineer, surveyor or other qualified person responsible
for providing the information required in this section;
         (b)   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision or land
development with respect to any designated floodplain area, including
information on, but not limited to, the 100-year flood elevations, boundaries
of the floodplain area or areas, proposed lots and sites, fills, flood or
erosion protective facilities, and areas subject to special deed restrictions;
         (c)   Where the subdivision or land development lies partially or
completely within any designated floodplain area, or where the subdivision or
land development borders on a floodplain area, the preliminary plan map shall
include detailed information giving the location and elevation of proposed
roads, public utilities and building sites. All such maps shall also show
contours at intervals of two feet, and shall identify accurately the boundaries
of the floodplain areas; and
         (d)   Such other information as is required by this chapter.
      (3)   Final plan requirements. The following information shall be
required as part of the final plan and shall be prepared by a registered
engineer or surveyor:
         (a)   All information required for the submission of the preliminary
plan incorporating any changes requested by the Council of the borough;
         (b)   A map showing the exact location and elevation of all proposed
buildings, structures, roads and public utilities to be constructed within any
designated floodplain area. All such maps shall show contours at intervals of
two feet within the floodplain area and shall identify accurately the
boundaries of the flood-prone areas; and
         (c)   Submission of the final plan shall also be accompanied by all
required permits and related documentation from the Department of Environmental
Protection, and any other Commonwealth agency, or local municipality where any
alteration or relocation of a stream of watercourse is proposed. In addition,
documentation shall be submitted indicating that all affected adjacent
municipalities have been notified in advance of the proposed alteration or
relocation. The Department of Community and Economic Development and the
Federal Insurance Administration shall also be notified in advance of any such
proposed activity and proof of such notification shall be submitted in advance
of the Planning Commission meeting at which such plan is to be considered.
   (E)   Design standards and improvements in designated floodplain areas.
      (1)   General.
         (a)   Where not prohibited by this or any other laws or ordinances,
land located in any designated floodplain area may be platted for development
with the provision that the developer construct all buildings and structures to
preclude flood damage in accordance with this and any other laws and ordinances
regulating such development.
         (b)   No subdivision or land development, or part thereof, shall be
approved if the proposed development or improvements will, individually or
collectively, increase the 100-year flood elevation more than one foot at any
point.
         (c)   Building sites for residences or any other type of dwelling or
accommodation shall not be permitted in any floodway area. Sites for these uses
may be permitted outside the floodway area in a floodplain area if the lowest
floor (including basement) is elevated to the regulatory flood elevation. If
fill is used to raise the elevation of a site, the fill area shall extend
laterally for a distance of at least 15 feet beyond the limits of the proposed
structures and access shall meet the requirements of division (E)(3) below.
         (d)   Building sites for structures or buildings other than for
residential uses shall not be permitted in any floodway area. Sites for such
structures or buildings outside the floodway in a floodplain area shall be
protected as provided for in division (E)(1)(c) above. However, the Council of
the borough may allow the subdivision or development of areas or sites for
commercial and industrial uses at an elevation below the regulatory flood
elevation if the developer otherwise protects the area to that height or
assures that the buildings or structures will be flood-proofed to the
regulatory flood elevation.
         (e)   If the Council of the borough determines that only a part of a
proposed plat can be safely developed, it shall limit development to that part
and shall require that development proceed consistent with this determination.
         (f)   When a developer does not intend to develop the plat himself or
herself and the Council of the borough determines that additional controls are
required to ensure safe, development, it may require the developer to impose
appropriate deed restrictions of the land. Such deed restrictions shall be
inserted in every deed and noted on every recorded plat.
      (2)   Drainage facilities.
         (a)   Storm drainage facilities shall be designed to convey the flow
of surface waters without damage to persons or property. The system shall
ensure drainage at all points along streets, and provide positive drainage away
from buildings and on-site waste disposal sites.
         (b)   Plans shall be subject to the approval of the Council of the
borough. The Council of the borough may require a primary underground system to
accommodate frequent floods and a secondary surface system to accommodate
larger, less frequent floods. Drainage plans shall be consistent with local,
county and regional drainage plans. The facilities shall be designed to prevent
the discharge of excess run-off onto adjacent properties.
      (3)   Streets and driveways. The finished elevation of proposed streets
and driveways shall not be more than one foot below the regulatory flood
elevation. Profiles and elevations of streets and driveways to determine
compliance with this requirement and as required by other provisions of this
chapter shall be submitted with the final plan. Drainage openings shall be
sufficient to discharge flood flows without unduly increasing flood heights.
      (4)   Sewer facilities. All sanitary sewer systems located in any
designated floodplain area, whether public or private, shall be flood-proofed
up to the regulatory flood elevation.
      (5)   Water facilities. All water systems located in any designated
floodplain area, whether public or private, shall be flood-proofed up to the
regulatory flood elevation.
      (6)   Other utilities and facilities. All other public or private
utilities and facilities including gas and electric, shall be elevated or
flood-proofed up to the regulatory flood elevation.

§ 153.111 COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS OR GUARANTEE THEREOF PREREQUISITE TO FINAL
PLAT APPROVAL.
   (A)   No plat shall be finally approved unless the streets shown on such
plat have been improved to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable
condition, or improved as may be otherwise required by this chapter and any
walkways, curbs, gutters, street lights, fire hydrants, shade trees, water
mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers and other improvements as may be required
by this chapter have been installed in accordance with this chapter. In lieu of
the completion of any improvements required as a condition for the final
approval of a plat, including improvements or fees otherwise required by this
chapter, the developer may deposit with the borough financial security in an
amount sufficient to cover the costs of such improvements or common amenities
including basins and other related drainage facilities, recreational
facilities, open space improvements, or buffer or screen plantings which may be
required.
   (B)   When requested by the developer, in order to facilitate financing, the
Borough Council shall furnish the developer with a signed copy of a resolution
indicating approval of the final plat contingent upon the developer obtaining
satisfactory financial security. The final plat or record plan shall not be
signed nor recorded until the financial improvements agreement is executed. The
resolution or letter of contingent approval shall expire and be deemed revoked
if the financial security agreement is not executed within 90 days, unless a
written extension is granted by the Borough Council; such extension shall not
be unreasonably withheld and shall be placed in writing at the request of the
developer.
   (C)   Without limitation as to other types of financial security which the
borough may approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, federal
or Commonwealth chartered lending institution irrevocable letters of credit and
restrictive or escrow accounts in such lending institutions shall be deemed
acceptable financial security for the purposes of this section.
   (D)   Such financial security shall be posted with a bonding company or
federal or Commonwealth chartered lending institution chosen by the party
posting the financial security, provided such bonding company or lending
institution is authorized to conduct such business within the Commonwealth.
   (E)   Such bond, or other security, shall provide for, and secure to the
public, the completion of any improvements which may be required on or before
the date fixed in the formal action of approval or accompanying agreement for
completion of the improvements.
   (F)   The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of
the required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost of completion
estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for completion by the
developer. Annually, the borough may adjust the amount of the financial
security by comparing the actual cost of the improvements which have been
completed and the estimated cost for the completion of the remaining
improvements as of the expiration of the ninetieth day after either the
original date scheduled for completion or a rescheduled date of completion.
Subsequent to said adjustment, the borough may require the developer to post
additional security in order to assure that the financial security equals said
110%. Any additional security shall be posted by the developer in accordance
with this division (F).
   (G)   The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an
estimate of the cost of completion of the required improvements, submitted by
the applicant or developer and prepared by a professional engineer licensed as
such in this Commonwealth and certified by such engineer to be a fair and
reasonable estimate of such cost. The borough, upon recommendation of the
Borough Engineer, may refuse to accept such estimate for good cause shown. If
the applicant or developer and the borough are unable to agree upon an
estimate, then the estimate shall be recalculated and recertified by another
professional engineer licensed as such in this Commonwealth and chosen mutually
by the borough and the applicant or developer. The estimate certified by the
third engineer shall be presumed fair and reasonable and shall be the final
estimate. In the event that a third engineer is so chosen, fees for the
services of said engineer shall be paid equally by the borough and the
applicant or developer.
   (H)   If the party posting the financial security requires more than one
year from the date of posting of the financial security to complete the
required improvements, the amount of financial security may be increased by an
additional 10% for each one-year period beyond the first anniversary date from
posting of financial security or to an amount not exceeding 110% of the cost of
completing the required improvements as re-established on or about the
expiration date of the preceding one-year period by using the above bidding
procedure.
   (I)   In the case where development is projected over a period of years, the
Borough Council may authorize submission of final plats by sections or stages
of development subject to such requirements or guarantees as to improvements in
future sections or stages of development as it finds essential for the
protection of any finally approved section of the development.
   (J)   As the work for installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request the Borough Council to
release, or authorize the release, from time to time, of such portions of the
final security necessary for payment to the contractor or contractors
performing the work. Any such requests shall be in writing addressed to the
Borough Council, and the Borough Council shall have 45 days from the receipt of
such request within which to allow the Borough Engineer to certify, in writing,
to the Borough Council that such portion of the work upon the improvements has
been completed in accordance with the approved plat. Upon such certification
the Borough Council shall authorize release by the bonding company or lending
institution in an amount as estimated by the Borough Engineer fairly
representing the value of the improvements completed or, if the Borough Council
fails to act within said 45-day period, the Borough Council shall be deemed to
have approved the release of funds as requested. The Borough Council may, prior
to final release at the time of completion and certification by its Engineer,
require retention of 10% of the estimated cost of the aforesaid improvements.
   (K)   When the Borough Council accepts dedication of all or some of the
required improvements following completion, the Borough Council may require the
posting of financial security to secure structural integrity of said
improvements as well as the functioning of said improvements in accordance with
the design and specifications as depicted on the final plat for a term not to
exceed 18 months from the date of acceptance of dedication. Said financial
security shall be of the same type as otherwise required in this section with
regard to installation of such improvements, and the amount of financial
security shall not exceed 15% of the actual cost of installation of said
improvements.
   (L)   If water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with apparatus
or facilities related thereto, are to be installed under the jurisdiction and
pursuant to the rules and regulations of a pubic utility or municipal authority
separate and distinct from the borough, financial security to assure proper
completion and maintenance thereof shall be posted in accordance with the
regulations of the controlling public utility or municipal authority and shall
not be included within the financial security as otherwise required in this
section.
   (M)   If financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion of
improvements required as a condition for final approval of a plat as set forth
in this section, the borough shall not condition the issuance of building,
grading or other permits relating to the erection or placement of improvements,
including buildings, upon the lots or land as depicted upon the final plat.
Moreover, if said financial security has been provided, occupancy permits for
any building or buildings to be erected shall not be withheld following the
improvement of the streets providing access to and from existing public roads
to such building or buildings to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable
condition, as well as the completion of all other improvements as depicted upon
the approved plan, either upon the lot or lots in question if such improvements
are necessary for the reasonable use of or occupancy of the building or
buildings.

appropriate improvements, the developer shall notify the Borough Council in
writing, by certified or registered mail, of the completion of the aforesaid
improvements and shall send a copy thereof to the Borough Engineer.
      (2)   The Borough Council shall, within ten days after receipt of such
notice, direct and authorize the Borough Engineer to inspect all of the
aforesaid improvements.
      (3)   The Borough Engineer shall, thereupon, file a report in writing
with the Borough Council, and shall promptly mail a copy of the same to the
developer by certified or registered mail. The report shall be made and mailed
within 30 days after the receipt by the Borough Engineer of the aforesaid
authorization from the Borough Council; said report shall be detailed and shall
indicate approval or rejection of said improvements, either in whole or in
part, and if said improvements, or any portion thereof, shall not be approved
or shall be rejected by the Borough Engineer, said report shall contain a
statement of reasons for such disapproval or rejection.
   (B)   The Borough Council shall notify the developer, within 15 days of
receipt of the Engineer’s report, in writing by certified or registered mail,
of the action of said Borough Council with relation thereto.
   (C)   If the Borough Council or Borough Engineer fails to comply with the
time limitation provisions contained herein, all improvements will be deemed to
have been approved and the developer shall be released from all liability
pursuant to its performance guaranty bond or other security agreement.
   (D)   If any portion of the said improvements shall not be approved or shall
be rejected by the Borough Council, the developer shall proceed to complete the
same and, upon completion, the same procedure of notification, as outlined
herein, shall be followed.
   (E)   Nothing herein, however, shall be construed in limitation of the
developer’s right to construct or question by legal proceedings or otherwise,
any determination of the Borough Council or the Borough Engineer.
   (F)   Where herein reference is made to the Borough Engineer, he or she
shall be as a consultant thereto.
   (G)   The applicant or developer shall reimburse the borough for the
reasonable and necessary expense incurred for the inspection of improvements
according to a schedule of fees adopted by resolution of the Borough Council
and as from time to time amended. Such expense shall be reasonable and in
accordance with the ordinary and customary fees charged by the Borough Engineer
or consultant for work performed for similar services in the community, but in
no event shall the fees exceed the rate or cost charged by the Engineer or
consultant to the borough when fees are not reimbursed or otherwise imposed on
applicants.
      (1)   In the event the applicant disputes the amount of any such expense
in connection with the inspection of improvements, the applicant shall, within
ten working days of the date of billing, notify the borough that such expenses
are disputed as unreasonable or unnecessary, in which case the borough shall
not delay or disapprove a subdivision or land development application or any
approval or permit related to development due to the applicant’s request over
disputed engineer’s expenses.
      (2)   If, within 20 days from the date of billing, the borough and the
applicant cannot agree on the amount of expenses which are reasonable and
necessary, then the applicant and the borough shall jointly, by mutual
agreement, appoint another professional engineer, licensed as such in the
Commonwealth, to review the said expenses and make a determination as to the
amount thereof which is reasonable and necessary.
      (3)   (a)   The professional engineer so appointed shall hear such
evidence and review such documentation as the professional engineer in his or
her sole opinion deems necessary and render a decision within 50 days of the
billing date.
         (b)   The applicant shall be required to pay the entire amount
determined in the decision immediately.
      (4)   In the event that the borough and applicant cannot agree upon the
professional engineer to be appointed within 20 days of the billing date, then,
upon application of either party, the president judge of the Court of Common
Pleas of the judicial district in which the borough is located (or if at the
time there is no president judge, then the senior active judge then sitting)
shall appoint such engineer, who, in that case, shall be neither the Borough
Engineer nor any professional engineer who has been retained by, or performed
services for, the borough or the applicant within the preceding five years.
      (5)   (a)   The fee of the appointed professional engineer for
determining the reasonable and necessary expenses shall be paid by the
applicant if the amount of payment required in the decision is equal to or
greater than the original bill.
         (b)   If the amount of payment required in the decision is less than
the original bill by $1,000 or more, the borough shall pay the fee of the
professional engineer, but otherwise the borough and the applicant shall each
pay one-half of the fee of the appointed professional engineer.

installed as provided in this chapter or in accord with the approved final
plat, the Borough Council is hereby granted the power to enforce any corporate
bond or other security by appropriate legal and equitable remedies.
   (B)   If the proceeds of such bond or other security are insufficient to pay
the cost of installing or making repairs or corrections to all the improvements
covered by said security, the Borough Council may, at its option, install part
of such improvements in all or part of the subdivision or land development and
may institute appropriate legal or equitable action to recover the moneys
necessary to complete the remainder of the improvements.
   (C)   All of the proceeds, whether resulting from the security or from any
legal or equitable action brought against the developer, or both, shall be used
solely for the installation of the improvements covered by such security, and
not for any other borough purpose.

from such penalties or from the remedies herein provided.
   (B)   The borough may refuse to issue any permit or grant any approval

      (1)   The owner of record at the time of violation;
      (2)   The vendee or lessee of the owner of record at the time of such
violation without regard as to whether such vendee or lessee had actual or
constructive knowledge of the violation;
      (3)   The current owner of record who acquired the property subsequent to
the time of violation without regard as to whether such current owner had
actual or constructive knowledge of the violation; and
      (4)   The vendee or lessee of the current owner of record who acquired
the property subsequent to the time of violation without regard as to whether
such vendee or lessee had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
   (C)   As an additional condition for issuance of a permit or the granting of
an approval to any such owner, current owner, vendee or lessee for the
development of any such real property, the borough may require compliance with
the conditions that would have been applicable to the property at the time the
applicant acquired an interest in such real property.
(2006 Code, § 22-805) (Ord. 90-9, passed 9-10-1990, § 805; Ord. 94-02, passed

enforcement proceeding commenced by the township, pay a judgment of not more
than $500 plus all court costs, including reasonable attorney fees incurred by
the borough as a result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed,
levied or payable until the date of the determination of a violation by the
district justice. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the
judgment, the borough may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules
of civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate violation, unless the district justice determining that there has been
a violation further determines that there was a good faith basis for the
person, partnership or corporation violating this chapter to have believed that
there was no such violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have been
only one such violation until the fifth day following the date of the
determination of violation by the magisterial district judge and, thereafter,
each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation.
   (B)   The Court of Common Pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of stay,
upon cause shown, tolling the per diem judgment pending a final adjudication of
the violation and judgment.
   (C)   Nothing contained in this section shall be construed or interpreted to

action for enforcement pursuant to this section.
   (D)   Magisterial district judges shall have initial jurisdiction in
proceedings under this section.

5-2-1994, Art. IV)
§ 153.172 FLOOD WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   (A)   The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this
chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
acceptable engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare
occasions. Flood heights may be increased by human-made or natural cause, such
as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not
imply that areas outside the floodplain, or that land uses permitted within
such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages.
   (B)   This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the borough or
any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages which result from
reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
(2006 Code, § 22-808) (Ord. 90-9, passed 9-10-1990, § 808; Ord. 94-02, passed
5-2-1994, Art. IV)
§ 153.173 MUNICIPAL LIABILITY.
   The grant or permit or approval of a subdivision and/or land development
plan shall not constitute a representation, guarantee or warranty of any kind
by the borough or by an official or employee thereof of the practicability or
safety of the proposed use, and shall create no liability upon the borough, its
officials or employees.
(2006 Code, § 22-809) (Ord. 90-9, passed 9-10-1990, § 809; Ord. 94-02, passed
5-2-1994, Art. IV)
§ 153.174 INTERPRETATION.
   The provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements to
meet the purposes of this chapter. When provisions of this chapter impose
greater restrictions than those of any statute, other ordinance or regulations,
the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. When provisions of any statute,
other ordinance or regulation impose greater restrictions than those of this
chapter, the provisions of such statute, ordinance or regulation shall prevail.
(2006 Code, § 22-810) (Ord. 90-9, passed 9-10-1990, § 810; Ord. 94-02, passed

faith basis for the violator to believe that there was no violation.
   (B)   The description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or
other document used in the process of selling or transferring shall not exempt
the seller or transferor from such penalties or from the remedies herein
provided.

      (1)   The proposed use would be equal or less intensive in external
impacts and nuisances than uses that are permitted in the district;
      (2)   The proposed use would be closely similar in character to uses
permitted in that district, considering the same standards as are listed in §
154.144(F)(2);

Officer’s determination.
      (2)   If an applicant disagrees with the Zoning Officer’s determination
and believes that this chapter should be interpreted in the applicant’s favor,
the applicant may appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board. See §
154.011.

§ 154.011 ZONING HEARING BOARD ACTIONS AND VARIANCES.
   (A)   Membership of Board.
      (1)   Generally. The Zoning Hearing Board shall consist of residents of
the borough appointed by Borough Council. The existing terms of office shall
continue, with terms of office being three years, and with the terms being so
fixed that the term of office of one member shall expire each year. Members of
the Board shall hold no other office in the borough.
      (2)   Alternate members. Borough Council may appoint alternate members of
the Zoning Hearing Board within the applicable provisions of the Municipalities
Planning Code, 53 P.S. §§ 10101 et seq. (Note: as of to adoption date of this
chapter such provisions were in § 903(c) of such Act, 53 P.S. § 10103(c).)
   (B)   Vacancies. Appointments to fill vacancies shall be only for the
unexpired portion of a term.
   (C)   Organization. The applicable provisions of the Municipalities Planning
Code, as amended, 53 P.S. §§ 10101 et seq., shall apply. (As of the adoption
date of this chapter, these provisions were in § 906(a), (b) and (c) of such
Act, 53 P.S. § 10906(a), (b) and (c).)
   (D)   Zoning Hearing Board jurisdiction and functions. The Zoning Hearing
Board shall be responsible for the following.
      (1)   Appeal of a decision by the Zoning Officer.
         (a)   The Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by
an affected person, entity or Borough Council that the Zoning Officer has
improperly acted under the requirements and procedures of this chapter.
         (b)   See time limitations for appeals in division (E) below.
      (2)   Challenge to the validity of the ordinance or map. The applicable
provisions of the Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, shall apply. (Note:
as of the adoption date of this chapter, these provisions were primarily in §§
909.1 and 916.1 of such Act, 53 P.S. §§ 10909.1 and 10916.1.)
      (3)   Variance.
         (a)   Requests. The Board shall hear requests for variances filed with
the borough staff in writing.
         (b)   Standards. The Board may grant a variance only within the
limitations of state law. Note: as of the adoption date of this chapter, the
Municipalities Planning Code provided that all of the following findings must
be made, where relevant:
            1.   There are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape, or
exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions
and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of
this chapter in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located;
            2.   Because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property call be developed in strict conformity with
the provisions of this chapter and a variance is therefore necessary to enable
the reasonable use of the property;
            3.   Such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant;
            4.   The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare; and
            5.   The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulation in issue.
         (c)   Reasonable conditions. In granting any variance the Board may
attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may, deem necessary to
implement the purposes of this chapter.
      (4)   Special exception.
         (a)   Hearing. The Board shall hear and decide requests for all
special exceptions filed with the borough staff in writing. The Board shall
only permit a special exception that is authorized by this chapter. See §
154.016.
         (b)   Conditions. In granting a special exception, the Zoning Hearing
Board may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to
those expressed in this chapter as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes and intent of this chapter.
      (5)   Persons with disabilities. After the Zoning Officer receives a
complete written application the Zoning Hearing Board shall grant a special
exception allowing modifications to specific requirements of this chapter that
the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing Board are
necessary to provide a “reasonable accommodation” under applicable federal law
to serve persons who the applicant proves have “disabilities” as defined in and
protected by such laws.
         (a)   Such reasonable accommodations shall be requested in accordance
with the United States Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, being 42 U.S.C. §§
3601 et seq. or the Americans with Disabilities Act, being 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101
et seq.
         (b)   If the applicant is requesting a reasonable accommodation under
the United States Fair Housing Amendments Act or the Americans with
Disabilities Act, the applicant shall identify the disability which is
protected by such statutes, the extent of the modification of the provisions of
this chapter necessary for a reasonable accommodation, and the manner by which
the reasonable accommodation requested may be removed when such person with a
protected disability no longer will be present on the property.
      (6)   The Zoning Hearing Board shall also hear any other matters as set
forth in the Municipalities Planning Code, as amended. (Note: as of the
adoption date of this chapter, such provisions were primarily within § 909.1 of
such law, 53 P.S. § 10909.1.)
   (E)   Time limits for appeals. The applicable provisions of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, shall apply. (Note: as of the
adoption date of this chapter, these provisions were in § 914.1 of such Act, 53
P.S. § 10914.1.)
   (F)   Stay of proceedings. The stay of proceedings provisions of the
Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, shall apply. (Note: as of the
adoption date of this chapter, such provisions were in § 915.1 of such Act, 53
P.S. § 10915.1.)
   (G)   Time limits on permits and approvals.
      (1)   Generally. Unless otherwise provided by the Zoning Hearing Board or
Borough Council in a decision granting approval, after a variance is approved
or other zoning approval is officially authorized, then any applicable zoning
and building permits shall be secured by the applicant within 12 months after
the date of such approval or authorization. The work authorized by such permits
shall then be completed within 12 months after the issuance of the permits.
      (2)   Extension. Unless otherwise provided by the Zoning Hearing Board of
Borough Council in a decision granting approval, in response to an applicant
stating good cause in writing, the Zoning Officer may extend in writing the
time limit for completion of work to a maximum total of 36 months after permits
are issued.
      (3)   Failure to obtain the necessary permits or begin construction. If
an applicant fails to obtain the necessary permits or begin construction within
the above time periods, or allows interruptions in substantial construction of
longer than 12 months, the Zoning Officer may conclusively presume that the
applicant has waived, withdrawn or abandoned approvals and permits under this
chapter and may consider all such approvals and permits to have become null and
void.

timely request for such notice. Any such notices should be mailed or delivered
to the last known address.

DISTRICTS, PERMITTED USES AND YARD REQUIREMENTS
§ 154.045 DESIGNATION OF DISTRICTS AND PURPOSES.
   (A)   Zoning districts. For the purposes of this chapter, the borough is
hereby divided into the following zoning districts, with the following
abbreviations:
 
R1 Low Density Residential District
R2 Medium Density Residential District
NC Neighborhood Commercial/Residential District
MU Mixed Use District
IC Light Industrial Commercial District
 
   (B)   Official zoning map. For the purposes of this chapter, the zoning
districts named in this section shall be of the number, size, shape and
location shown on the official zoning map.
   (C)   Overlay districts. The floodplain area, as defined by §
154.083, shall serve as an overlay district o the applicable underlying
districts.
   (D)   Purposes of each district. In addition to the overall purposes and
objectives of this chapter and the Comprehensive Plan, the purposes of each
zoning district are summarized below.
      (1)   R1 Low Density Residential District. To provide for low density
residential neighborhoods; to protect these areas from incompatible uses; to
encourage neighborhood stability.
      (2)   R2 Medium Density Residential District. To provide for medium
density residential neighborhoods, with a mix of housing types; to protect
these areas from incompatible uses; to encourage “one home on one lot” (which
may be attached to another home) in order to promote home ownership and
neighborhood stability; and to make sure that infill development is consistent
with neighboring development.
      (3)   NC Neighborhood Commercial/Residential District. To promote
pedestrian-oriented commercial activities; to promote an appropriate mix of
retail, service, office, public, institutional and residential uses; to avoid
heavy motor vehicle-related commercial uses that are most likely to conflict
with nearby homes and the pedestrian-orientation, and which are most likely to
cause demolition of historic buildings; and to primarily provide for smaller
scale uses that utilize existing buildings, as opposed to uses that would
involve substantial demolition.
      (4)   MU Mixed Use District. To provide for a range of business uses and
some institutional and residential uses that would be compatible with the
surrounding neighborhood, and that would allow reuse of existing buildings.
      (5)   LIC Light Industrial Commercial District. To provide for a range of
light industrial uses; to recognize that there are no appropriate locations
within the borough for the heaviest types of industrial uses, because of the
proximity of homes to all areas of the borough, the locations of the creek, the
importance of preserving historic buildings, the congestion of the street
system and the very limited amounts of undeveloped land; and to carefully
control the types of industrial operations to avoid nuisances (such as
excessive noise) and hazards.

any district as shown on the official zoning map.
   (A)   District boundary lines are intended to follow or be parallel to the
centerline of street rights-of-way, creeks, railroads and lot lines as they
existed at the time of the adoption of this chapter, unless such district
boundary lines are fixed by dimensions as shown on the official zoning map.
   (B)   Where a district boundary is not fixed by dimensions and where it
approximately follows lot lines, such boundary shall be construed to follow
such lot lines unless specifically shown otherwise.
   (C)   The location of a district boundary that divides a lot shall be
determined by the use of the scale appearing on the zoning map unless indicated
otherwise by dimensions.
   (D)   Where a municipal boundary divides a lot, the minimum lot area shall
be regulated by the municipality in which the principal use(s) are located,
unless otherwise provided by applicable case law. The land area within each
municipality shall be regulated by the use regulations and other applicable
regulations of each municipality.

provisions shall be provided by uses proposed within the borough regardless of
whether such abutting existing dwelling or primarily residential zoning
district is located in an abutting municipality and/or in the borough.

ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SPECIFIC USES
§ 154.065 APPLICABILITY.
   This subchapter establishes additional specific requirements for certain
specific uses, in addition to the sign, parking, environmental and other
general requirements of this chapter and the requirements of each district.
Wherever two requirements conflict, the stricter requirement shall apply. For
uses allowed within a specific zoning district as “special exception” uses, see
also the procedures and standards in §
154.016.
(2006 Code, § 27-401) (Ord. 12/18/2003, passed 12-18-2003, § 401)
§ 154.066 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SPECIFIC PRINCIPAL USES.
   Each of the following uses shall meet all of the following requirements for
that use.
   (A)   Adult use. (This is limited to the following: adult bookstore; adult
movie theater; massage parlor; or adult live entertainment use.)
      (1)   Purposes: the regulations on adult uses are intended to serve the
following purposes, in addition to the overall objectives of this chapter:
         (a)   To recognize the adverse secondary impacts of adult uses that
affect health, safety and general welfare concerns of the municipality. These
secondary impacts have been documented in research conducted across the nation.
These secondary impacts typically include, but are not limited to: increases in
criminal activity; increases in activities that increase the risk of
transmission of sexually transmitted diseases; increases in activities that
increase the risk of transmission of other communicable diseases; increases in
blight decreases in the stability of residential neighborhoods; and decreases
in property values for surrounding homes; and decreases in the marketability of
nearby commercial business space. The research conducted across the nation
concludes that adult uses typically involve insufficient self-regulation to
control these secondary effects;
         (b)   To limit adult uses to locations where these secondary impacts
can be minimized, particularly as they affect residential neighborhoods and
downtown revitalization; and
         (c)   To not attempt to suppress any activities protected by the “free
speech” protections of the U.S. Constitution, but instead to control secondary
effects.
      (2)   (a)   No portion of a building occupied by an adult use shall be
located within any of the following distances:
            1.   Two hundred and fifty lineal feet of any residential zoning
district boundary or any public park;
            2.   One hundred lineal feet of the lot line of any existing;
primarily residential use; and
            3.   Five hundred lineal feet from the lot line of any existing
primary or secondary school, place of worship, daycare center or child nursery.
         (b)   A minimum setback required by this division (A)(2)(b) shall not
apply if the adult use would be separated from the residential district, park,
residential use or other such use by an expressway.
      (3)   No such use shall be located within 1,000 lineal feet of any
existing “adult use”.
      (4)   A 50-foot buffer yard shall be provided, regardless of zoning
district, along the side and rear lot lines in accordance with §
154.142, but with plantings of an initial minimum height of six feet.
      (5)   No pornographic material, displays or words shall be placed in view
of persons who are not inside of the establishment. Definite precautions shall
be made to prohibit minors from entering the premises.
      (6)   An adult use shall not be used for any purposes that violate any
federal, state or municipal law.
      (7)   See §
154.123 for prohibited signs.
      (8)   The use shall not include the sale or display of “obscene”
materials, as defined by state law, as may be amended by applicable court
decisions.
      (9)   Adult uses shall be prohibited in all districts except where
specifically permitted by §§
154.045 through
154.051. A minimum lot area of 10,000 square feet is required.
      (10)   For public health reasons, private or semi-private viewing booths
of any kind are prohibited. This specifically includes, but is not limited to,
booths for viewing adult movies or nude dancers.
      (11)   No use may include live actual or simulated sex acts nor any
sexual contact between entertainers nor between entertainers and customers.
This shall specifically prohibit, but not be limited to, entertainers dancing
on the laps of customers.

be performed in a massage parlor.
      (13)   All persons within any adult use shall wear non-transparent
garments that cover their genitals and the female areola, except for
entertainers within a permitted lawful “adult live entertainment use”.
      (14)   (a)   Any application for such use shall state the names and home
addresses of:
            1.   All individuals intended to have more than a 5% ownership in
such use or in a corporation owning such use; and
            2.   An on-site manager responsible to ensure compliance with this
chapter on a daily basis.
         (b)   Such information shall be updated at the beginning of each year
in writing to the Zoning Officer.

§ 154.101 GENERAL REGULATIONS FOR OFF-STREET PARKING.
   (A)   General. Parking spaces, aisles and driveways shall be laid out to
result in safe and orderly use and to fully take into account all of the
following: vehicular access onto and off the site; vehicular movement within
the site; loading areas; pedestrian patterns; and any drive- through
facilities. No parking area shall cause a safety hazard or impediment to
traffic off the lot.
   (B)   Existing parking. Any parking spaces serving such pre-existing
structures or uses at the time of adoption of this subchapter shall not in the
future be reduced in number below the number required by this subchapter.
   (C)   Change in use or expansion. A structure or use in existence at the
effective date of this subchapter that expands or results in a change of use of
an existing principal building shall be required to provide all of the required
parking for the entire size and type of the resulting use, except as follows.
      (1)   If an existing lawful use includes less parking than would be
required, and the applicant proves to the Zoning Officer that there is
insufficient area on the lot to meet the required amount of parking, then that
deficit of parking shall be grandfathered for new uses. For example, if an
existing store included three parking spaces and was required to provide seven
spaces, there is a deficit of four spaces. Therefore, if that store is
converted to an office that would need ten spaces, the office would need to
provide a total of six spaces (ten minus the pre-existing deficit of four).
      (2)   If a use expands by an aggregate total maximum of 10% in the
applicable measurement (such as building floor area) beyond what existed at the
time of adoption of this subchapter, and the applicant proves to the Zoning
Officer that there is insufficient area on the lot to meet the required amount
of parking, then no additional parking is required. For example, if an existing
building included 3,000 square feet, and a single minor addition of 300 square
feet was proposed, then additional parking would not be required.
   (D)   Continuing obligation of parking and loading spaces.
      (1)   All required numbers of parking spaces and off-street loading
spaces shall be available as long as the use or building which the spaces serve
still exist, and such spaces shall not be reduced in number below the minimum
required by this subchapter.
      (2)   No required parking area or off-street loading spaces shall be used
for any other use (such as storage or display of materials) that interferes
with the area’s availability for parking.
   (E)   Location of parking.
      (1)   Required off-street parking spaces shall be on the same lot or
abutting lot with the principal use served, unless special exception approval
is granted. The only standard that must be met to obtain the special exception
approval is for the applicant to prove to the satisfaction of the Zoning
Hearing Board that a method of providing the spaces is guaranteed to be
available during all of the years the use is in operation within 200 feet
walking distance from the entrance of the principal use being served. This
distance may be increased to 300 feet for employee parking. A written and
signed lease shall be provided.
      (2)   The Zoning Hearing Board may require that the use be approved for
period of time consistent with the lease of the parking, and that a renewal of
the permit shall only be approved if the parking lease is renewed.
   (F)   Flexibility in parking. As a special exception, an applicant may prove
to the satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing Board that the minimum amount of off-
street parking should be modified for a specific application because of one or
more of the following characteristics:
      (1)   The applicant proves that parking will be shared with another use
that will reduce the total amount of parking needed because the uses have
different peak times of parking need, and that there is a legally guaranteed
method to make sure that the parking will continue to be available during all
of the years that the use is in operation; and
      (2)   The applicant proves that the parking demand for a particular use
is unusually low because of some unusual and peculiar characteristic of the
use.

§ 154.102 DESIGN STANDARDS FOR OFF-STREET PARKING.
   (A)   General requirements.
      (1)   Backing onto a street. No parking area shall be designed to require
or encourage vehicles to back into a public street in order to leave a parking
space, except for a single-family dwelling with its access onto a local street
or parking court. Parking spaces may back onto an alley.
      (2)   Design. Every required parking space shall be designed so that each
motor vehicle may proceed to and from the parking space provided for it without
requiring the moving of any other vehicle, except for spaces serving a single-
family, twin or townhouse dwelling.
      (3)   Restrictions. Parking areas shall not be within a required buffer
yard or street right-of-way.
      (4)   Separation from street. Except for parking spaces immediately in
front of individual dwellings, all areas for off street parking, off-street
loading and unloading and the storage or movement of motor vehicles shall be
physically separated from the street by a continuous grass or landscaped
planting strip, except for necessary and approved vehicle entrances and exits
to the lot.
      (5)   Stacking and obstructions. Each lot shall provide adequate area
upon the lot to prevent back-up of vehicles on a public street while awaiting
entry to the lot, or while waiting for service at a drive-through facility.

         (c)   The buffer yard may include areas within a required front, side
or rear yard, or a paved area setback area provided the larger yard requirement
shall apply in case of overlap.
      (3)   Characteristics of buffer yards.
         (a)   The buffer yard shall be a landscaped area free of structures,
dumpsters, commercial, industrial storage or display, manufacturing or
processing activity, materials, loading and unloading areas or vehicle parking
or display. Buffer yards shall primarily include evergreen plants, in addition
to any required shade trees.
         (b)   As a special exception use, the applicant may prove to the
satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing Board that an alternative method of
screening will satisfactorily avoid conflicts between uses and provide an
attractive appearance. For example, the Board may approve a decorative brick
wall to be placed between a loading area and an abutting street.
      (4)   Plant screen.
         (a)   Each buffer yard shall include a planting screen of trees or
shrubs extending the length of the lot line.
         (b)   Each planting screen shall meet the following requirements.
            1.   Plant materials needed to form the visual screen shall have a
minimum height when planted of three feet. An initial height of two feet may be
used where a parking area is intended to be visible from a street for security
purposes. In addition, an average of one deciduous shade tree, with a minimum
trunk diameter of two inches measured six inches above the ground level, shall
be placed for each 50 feet of length of the buffer yard. The shade trees may be
clustered or spaced unevenly. Where street trees are approved and provided in
the right-of-way, or healthy existing trees will be preserved, those trees may
serve in place of this shade tree requirement.
            2.   Plants needed to form the visual screen shall be of such
species, spacing and size as can reasonably be expected to produce within five
years a mostly solid year-round visual screen at least six feet in height.
            3.   The plant screen shall be placed so or sidewalk.
            4.   The plant visual screen shall be interrupted only at:
               a.   Approved points of approximately perpendicular vehicle or
pedestrian ingress and egress to the lot;
               b.   Locations necessary to comply with safe sight distance
requirements; and
               c.   Locations needed to meet other specific state, borough and
utility requirements.
            5.   American arborvitae and similar weak-stem plants shall not be
used to meet the buffer yard requirements. If more than 20 evergreen plants are
proposed, no more than 50% shall be of one species.
            6.   Where space allows, evergreen trees should be planted at
diagonal off sets so that there is room for future growth of the trees.
      (5)   Parking lot screening. If six or more new off-street parking spaces
are provided within 30 feet from the right-of-way of North George Street in the
NC District, a six-foot wide planting area shall be provided between the
parking and the street right-of-way. To provide security and oversight of the
parking area from a street, species of plants should be used that can be
trimmed to a height of less than four feet. This provision shall not apply if a
more intense buffer is required under division (D)(1) above (such as for truck
parking).
      (6)   Buffer yard plans. See §
154.143.
      (7)   Fences. Any fence in a buffer yard shall be placed on the inside of
any required plant screening. As a condition of any variance or special
exception approval, the Zoning Hearing Board may require the installation of a
fence in addition to a buffer yard. As a condition of any land development
approval, Borough Council may require the installation of a fence in addition,
to a buffer yard.

§ 154.143 LANDSCAPING.
   (A)   Generally. Any part of a commercial, industrial, institutional or
apartment lot which is not used for structures, loading areas, parking spaces
and aisles, sidewalks and designated storage areas shall be provided with an
all-season, well-maintained vegetative groundcover, and shall be landscaped
with trees and shrubs. Landscaped areas shall be kept free of debris, rubbish
and noxious weeds.
   (B)   Buffer yard provisions. See also the buffer yard provisions in §
154.142.
   (C)   Parking area trees.
      (1)   Requirement. One deciduous tree shall be required for every ten new
off-street parking spaces.
      (2)   Landscaped areas to be provided. If a lot will include 20 or more
new parking spaces, landscaped areas shall be provided within the parking area.
Otherwise, the trees may be planted around the parking area.
      (3)   Standards. Trees required by this section shall meet the following
standards.
         (a)   Type of trees permitted. Required trees shall be chosen from the
following list of approved street trees, unless the applicant proves to the
satisfaction of the Zoning Officer, or his or her designee, that another type
of tree would shade paved areas, be resistant to disease, road salt and air
pollution and be attractive.
         (b)   Quality of trees. Required trees shall be of symmetrical growth
and free of insect pests and disease.
         (c)   Minimum size. The trunk diameter (measured at a height of six
inches above the level) shall be a minimum of two inches or greater.
         (d)   Planting and maintenance. Required trees shall be:
            1.   Planted with adequate unpaved surface around each for water
and air; and
            2.   Properly protected by curbs, curb stops, distance or other
devices from damage from vehicles.

      (4)   Street trees. As part of the construction of any new street or any
new principal nonresidential building or any new apartment building, street
trees shall be required to be planted. An average of one street tree shall be
planted for every 50 feet of street length. The street trees do not need to be
planted at specific intervals, but may be moved to fit with utilities,
driveways and other features. The street trees shall meet this division (C).
         (a)   The trees shall be in locations approved by the Zoning Officer.
These locations may or may not be within the street right-of-way, depending
upon the circumstances of the site. If the trees are not located in the right-
of-way, they shall be placed within the yard immediately adjacent to the right-
of-way.
         (b)   New street trees shall not be required where existing healthy
street trees will be preserved and will serve the same purpose.
      (5)   Landscaping maintenance. All shade tree, buffer yard and other
landscaping required by this subchapter shall be perpetually maintained by the
property owner. Any landscaping needed to meet an ordinance requirement that
dies, is removed or is severely damaged shall be replaced by the current
property owner as soon as is practical considering growing seasons, within a
maximum of 150 days.
      (6)   Review. Where landscaping is required by this subchapter, the
applicant shall submit a site plan showing proposed initial sizes, locations
and species of plantings and locations of any fencing in sufficient detail to
determine compliance with this section. Such landscaping plan should be
provided to the Zoning Officer for approval.

§
154.999
§ 154.144 NONCONFORMITIES.
   (A)   Proof and registration of nonconformities. It shall be the
responsibility of, with the burden of proof upon, a party asserting a
nonconformity to provide the evidence that it is lawful. A property owner may
request a written statement of nonconformity from the Zoning Officer after
providing sufficient evidence.
   (B)   Continuation. A lawful nonconforming use, structure or lot as defined
by this subchapter may be continued and may be sold and continued by new
owners. Any expansion of, construction upon or change in use of a nonconformity
shall only occur in conformance with this section.
   (C)   Expansion of or construction upon nonconformities.
      (1)   Nonconforming structure.
         (a)   Generally. The Zoning Officer shall permit a nonconforming
structure to be reconstructed or expanded provided:
            1.   Such action will not increase the severity or amount of the
nonconformity (such as the area of the building extending into the required
yard) or create any new nonconformity (except as provided by division (C)(1)(c)
below); and
            2.   Any expanded area will comply with the applicable setbacks in
that district and other requirements of this subchapter.
         (b)   Nonconforming structure which is used by a nonconforming use. In
the case of a nonconforming structure which is used by a nonconforming use, any
expansion shall also meet the requirements of this section regarding
nonconforming uses.
         (c)   Extension along a nonconforming setback. If an existing building
has a lawfully nonconforming building setback, additions may occur to increase
the height above such setback or to extend other portions of the building out
to the nonconforming side or rear setback line, provided that:
            1.   The structure shall not be extended beyond the existing
nonconforming setback line;
            2.   No additional nonconformity shall be created;
            3.   The new nonconforming extension shall not be greater than 25%
of the existing floor area;
            4.   All other requirements of this subchapter shall be met; and
            5.   Such addition shall not be permitted for a nonresidential
building that abuts an existing primarily residential use.
      (2)   Nonconforming lots.
         (a)   Permitted construction on a nonconforming lot. New permitted
structures for a single permitted by right principal use and its customary
accessory uses may be constructed, reconstructed or expanded on a nonconforming
lot of record held in single and separate ownership as a permitted by right use
if minimum setback requirements are met.
         (b)   Lot width. The fact that an existing lawful lot of record does
not meet the minimum lot width requirements of this subchapter shall not by
itself cause such lot to be considered to be a nonconforming lot.
      (3)   Expansion of a nonconforming, nonresidential use. A nonconforming
use or a building used by a nonconforming use shall not be expanded, except in
accordance with the following provisions.
         (a)   An expansion of more than 5% in total building floor area shall
require exception approval from the Zoning Hearing Board under §§
154.001 through
154.018.
         (b)   Such reconstruction or expansion shall be only upon the same lot
that the use was located upon at the time the use became nonconforming.
         (c)   1.   The total building floor area used by a nonconforming use
or the total land area covered by the nonconforming use, whichever is more
restrictive, shall not be increased by greater than 25% beyond what existed in
the nonconforming use at the time the use first became nonconforming.
            2.   The above maximum increase shall be measured in aggregate over
the entire life of the nonconformity. All expansions of the nonconforming use
and/or building(s) that occurred since the use originally became nonconforming
shall count towards the above maximum increase.
         (d)   Any expansion of a nonconforming use shall meet the required
setbacks and other requirements of this subchapter, unless the Zoning Hearing
Board grants a variance.
      (4)   Expansion of a nonconforming residential use. An existing
nonconforming residential use may be expanded as a permitted by right use
provided that:
         (a)   The number of dwelling units or rooming house units are not
increased;
         (b)   The expansion meets all applicable setbacks;
         (c)   No new types of nonconformities are created;
         (d)   A nonconformity is not made more severe; and
         (e)   All other dimensional requirements of this chapter are met.
      (5)   Nonconforming sign. The provisions of this subchapter shall not be
interpreted to provide a right to expand or extend a nonconforming sign.
Instead, any expansions or extensions of a nonconforming sign shall comply with
this subchapter.
   (D)   Damaged or destroyed nonconformities.
      (1)   A nonconforming structure that has been destroyed or damaged may be
rebuilt in a nonconforming fashion only if:
         (a)   The application for a building permit is submitted within 18
months after the date of damage or destruction;
         (b)   Work begins in earnest within 12 months afterwards and
continues; and
         (c)   No nonconformity may be created or increased by any
reconstruction.
      (2)   The property shall be properly secured during such time in such a
way to keep out trespassers and to avoid harm to neighboring properties.
   (E)   Abandonment of a nonconformity.
      (1)   If a nonconforming use of a building or land is discontinued,
razed, removed or abandoned for 12 or more months, subsequent use of such
building or land shall conform with the regulations of the district in which it
is located, except as provided for in division (D) above.
      (2)   The applicant shall be responsible to provide evidence that the
nonconformity was no abandoned.
      (3)   An existing lawful separate dwelling unit may be unrented for any
period of time without being considered “abandoned” under this subchapter.
   (F)   Changes from one nonconforming use to another.
      (1)   Once changed to a conforming use, a structure or land shall not
revert to a nonconforming use.
      (2)   A nonconforming use may be changed to a different nonconforming use
only if permitted as a special exception by the Zoning Hearing Board. However,
special exception approval is not needed for a simple change within an existing
building from one lawful nonconforming retail store use to another retail store
use or from one lawful nonconforming personal service use to another personal
service use provided that the new use complies with any Zoning Hearing Board
conditions that applied to the previous use and is not more objectionable in
external effects than the previous use.
      (3)   Where special exception approval is required for a change of a
nonconforming use, the Board shall determine whether the applicant has provided
sufficient proof to show that the proposed new use will be equal or less
objectionable in external effects than the pre-existing nonconforming use with
regard to:
         (a)   Traffic safety and generation (especially truck traffic);
         (b)   Noise, dust, fumes, vapors, gases, odor, glare, vibration, fire,
hazardous substances and explosive hazards;
         (c)   Amount and character of outdoor storage;
         (d)   Late night and early morning hours of operation if the use would
be close to dwellings; and
         (e)   Compatibility with the character of the surrounding area.
      (4)   A nonconforming use shall not be changed to a nonconforming adult
use.
   (G)   District changes. Any uses, structures or lots that become
nonconforming because of a zoning district change shall be regulated under this
section on nonconformities.

§
154.999
§ 154.145 DUMPSTER SCREENING AND LOCATION.
   (A)   Generally. Any newly placed solid waste dumpster shall be screened on
all sides as necessary to screen views from public streets and dwellings. Such
screening shall consist of decorative masonry walls, mostly solid weather-
resistant wood fencing or fencing of a similar appearance (such as white vinyl
vertical planks). Primarily evergreen plantings are also encouraged in addition
to the fence or wall. The fence or wall shall include a self-latching door or
gate.
   (B)   Setback from dwellings. An outdoor solid waste container with a
capacity of over 25 cubic feet shall be kept the maximum distance that is
feasible from any abutting dwelling, in the determination of the Zoning
Officer, provided that the container is not in the minimum front yard. In any
case, an outdoor solid waste container shall be kept a minimum of 15 feet from
an abutting dwelling. A solid waste dumpster shall not be located in a front
yard.
   (C)   Movement of dumpster. If a solid waste dumpster is moved from one part
of a lot to another part of a lot, then it shall come into compliance with this
section.
   (D)   Enclosed; location. All waste containers shall be completely enclosed,
and the lid shall be kept in place. The locations of all dumpsters shall be
shown on all site plans and land development plans submitted to the borough.
   (E)   Application. This section shall not apply to dumpsters temporarily
placed during actual construction or demolition on the premises, or for
recycling containers that do not involve garbage.
(2006 Code, § 27-806) (Ord. 12/18/2003, passed 12-18-2003, § 806) Penalty, see
§
154.999
§ 154.999 PENALTY.
   Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated or
permitted the violation of the provisions of this chapter shall, upon being
found liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the
borough, pay a judgment of not more than $500 plus all court costs, including
the reasonable attorney fees incurred by the borough as a result thereof. No
judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or be payable until the date of
the determination of a violation by the magisterial district judge. If the
defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the borough may enforce
the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that
a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation unless a
magisterial district judge determining that there has been a violation further
determines that there was a good faith basis for the person, partnership or
corporation violating this chapter to have believed that there was no such
violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have been only one such
violation until the fifth day following the date of the determination of a
violation by the magisterial district judge, and thereafter each day that a
violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. All judgments, costs
and reasonable attorney fee collected for the violation of this chapter shall
be paid over to the borough. Imprisonment shall not be authorized by this
chapter.
