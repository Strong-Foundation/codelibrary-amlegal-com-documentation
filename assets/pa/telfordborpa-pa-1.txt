Foreword
History
   This comprises the codification of the ordinances of the Borough of Telford.
In the year 1737, Conrad Detterer purchased the land on which Telford
ultimately developed. It included about 120 acres and evolved quite early into
a small, farm service oriented village. Telford was accessible by road and
railroad with the completion of County Line Road in 1752. The name Telford,
adopted in 1867, was given in recognition of Thomas Telford who was an
Englishman known for his roadmaking skills. In 1886, the Borough petitioned the
Bucks County Court for a Borough charter which was granted. However, it was not
until 1897 that the Montgomery County Court granted Telford a charter and
allowed it to secede from Franconia Township. At the time, Telford (Montgomery
County) was known as West Telford. In 1937, the boroughs of Telford and West
Telford merged by order of the Governor. 1
   The Code of Ordinances of the Borough of Telford was prepared by Keystate
Publishers, Inc., and adopted by the Borough of Telford Borough Council on July
7, 2014, by Ord. 401.
Organization
   The Code contains four parts which are (1) the valid current ordinances of
the Borough of Telford contained in Chapters 1 through 27, (2) the Appendix,
which lists by abstracted title all ordinances of a temporary or “one time”
nature, (3) the Table of disposition of each ordinance ever enacted by the
Borough of Telford, and (4) the Index, which is an alphabetical arrangement of
subjects.
   In the Code each Chapter is separated by a divider tab, and specific
ordinances can be located by subject on the contents page at the beginning of
each Chapter. The Index may also be used to search for a subject when one is
looking for general information on a particular subject, or if it is not known
in which Chapter the subject might be found. The Appendix consists of several
general categories containing a chronological listing of short subject
descriptions along with a reference to the original ordinance and its date of
enactment, if known.
   The Table of disposition indicates what action has been taken by the Borough
of Telford Borough Council with regard to every ordinance ever enacted. An
ordinance has either been (1) specifically repealed, (2) superseded by another
ordinance, (3) is located in a Chapter of the Code book, or (4) is located in
the Appendix. Annual tax rate and budget ordinances are located only in the
Table of Disposition. The Table of Disposition is a cross reference to the
original ordinance books of the Borough of Telford, and to the location within
the Code of each ordinance by number.

§ 1-104.   Headings.
   Chapter, Subchapter, Part, Subpart, Section, Subsection, Paragraph,
Subparagraph, Clause, and Subclause headings contained in the Code may not be
deemed to govern, limit, modify or affect the scope, meaning or intent of the
Code. The headings of Sections, Subsections or other divisions of this Code are
intended as mere captions to indicate the contents of the Section, Subsection
or other division and shall not be deemed to be taken as titles of such
Section, Subsection or other division, nor as any part of said Section,
Subsection or other division unless expressly so provided.
(Ord. 401, 7/7/2014)
§ 1-105.   Tenses, Gender and Number.
   Except as may be otherwise stated in any provision of this Code, the present
tense includes the past and future tenses, and the future the present; the

masculine and neuter, and the neuter includes the masculine and feminine; and

(Ord. 401, 7/7/2014)
§ 1-106.   Construction.
   1.   Except as may be otherwise specifically provided by any provision of
this Code, the Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S.A. §1501 et seq.,
shall be applied in construing this Code.
   2.   Effect of Repeal or Expiration of Code Section.
      A.   The repeal of a Code Section or ordinance, or its expiration by
virtue of any provision contained therein, shall not affect any right accrued
or any offense committed, any penalty or punishment incurred, or any proceeding
commenced before the repeal took effect or the ordinance expired.
      B.   When any ordinance repealing a former Code Section, ordinance,
clause or provision shall itself be repealed, such repeal shall not be
construed to revive such former Code Section, ordinance, clause or provision,
unless it shall be expressly so provided.
   3.   Saving Clause. The provisions of this Code, so far as they are the same
as those ordinances and regulations in force immediately prior to the adoption
of this Code, are intended as a continuation of such ordinances, resolutions
and regulations and not as a new enactment. The provisions of this Code shall
not affect any suit or prosecution pending or to be instituted to enforce any
of the prior ordinances or regulations. Except as specifically stated in this
Code or in the ordinance adopting this consolidation, codification and revision
of the ordinances and regulations, it is the intention of the Borough Council
that no ordinance or regulation of the Borough be amended, revised or repealed
by implication.
   4.   Resolutions. The provisions of this Code of Ordinances may contain
resolutions, that is, actions of the Borough Council (in written form and
designated "resolution”) which did not require prior public notice in
accordance with the provisions of the Borough Code, 53 P.S. §45101 et seq., at
the time of their passage by the Borough Council. Such "resolutions” are
included herein for ease of reference and the Borough Council does not intend
by their inclusion herein to require prior public notice before amending,
revising or repealing such resolution or resolutions as may have been included
herein in the future. It is the intention of the Borough Council that such
actions of the Borough Council that may be included in this Code and
specifically cited and designated as a resolution shall not become an ordinance
(requiring prior public notice before amendment, revision or repeal) by the
simple fact of inclusion in this Code.
(Ord. 401, 7/7/2014)
§ 1-107.   Normal Numbering.
   1.   Chapters. Chapters are numbered sequentially in Arabic throughout this
Code.
   2.   Parts. Parts are numbered sequentially in Arabic throughout this Code.
   3.   Whenever other divisions are necessary, Chapters shall be divided into
Subchapters, Parts into Subparts and designated with the Chapter or Part number
followed by a capital letter. For instance, Chapter 1 may be divided into
Subchapters 1A and 1B.
   4.   Sections. Sections are numbered sequentially throughout a Chapter and a
Part such that the first number or numbers is the Chapter number, followed by a
hyphen, followed by the Part number, followed by the Section number within the
Part. For example, "§1-101” designates Chapter 1, Part 1, Section 1. Similarly,
“§27-305” designates Chapter 27, Part 3, Section 5.
   5.   Internal Divisions of Sections. Whenever internal divisions are
necessary, Sections shall be divided into Subsections, Subsections into
Paragraphs, Paragraphs into Subparagraphs, Subparagraphs into Clauses, and
Clauses into Subclauses, and Subclauses into Items, designated as follows:
      1.   Subsection.
         A.   Paragraph.
            (1)   Subparagraph.
               (a)   Clause.
                  1)   Subclause.
                     a)   Item.
                        i.   Subitem.
(Ord. 401, 7/7/2014)
§ 1-108.   Special Numbering Problems.
   1.   Addition of New Units Between Existing Units. If it becomes necessary
to introduce a new Chapter, Part or Section between existing Chapters, Parts or
Sections, the new Chapter, Part or Section shall be designated by the addition
of a capital letter suffix to the preceding Chapter, Part or Section number.
Thus, a Chapter introduced between Chapters 5 and 6 would be Chapter 5A and
Sections in that Chapter would be numbered, for instance, “§5A-101.” If it
becomes necessary to introduce a Part between existing Parts 5 and 6 the new
Part would be Part 5A and Sections in that Part would be numbered, for
instance, “§5-5A01.” A new Section introduced between existing Sections 5 and 6
would be “§5-105A.” When a number of new Parts or Sections have been introduced
the Chapter or Part shall be renumbered.
   2.   If it becomes necessary to introduce a Subsection between Subsections,

Boards and Commissions
A.   Indian Valley Regional Planning Commission
§ 1-301.   Creation, Membership and Terms.
   The Borough of Telford shall join with the municipalities of Souderton
Borough and Salford, Upper Salford, Lower Salford and Franconia Townships, to
create the Indian Valley Regional Planning Commission as per the guidelines as
set forth under §1102 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, Act 247
of July 31, 1968, 53 P.S. §11102, as reenacted and amended. Each participating
municipality shall appoint two members. The term of each member shall be 2
years; however, initially each municipality shall appoint one member for a 1-
year term and a second member for a 2- year term so that the term of membership
of the members appointed by the individual municipalities shall be on staggered
basis. Qualification of members, the removal of members, the conduct of
business, etc., shall be governed by Article II and Article XI of the

(Ord. 347, 2/16/1999, §1)
§ 1-302.   Purpose.
   1.   The six municipalities of the Indian Valley have come to recognize that
the issues associated with the growth and development, such as, but not limited
to, traffic congestion, air and water pollution and loss of open space, are too
large for any one municipality to deal with. They further recognize that
current growth and anticipated growth, if not properly managed, will lead to
the diminution of the Region’s quality of life. They are concerned that current
zoning requirements which call for each and every municipality to provide for a
full range of uses, regardless of historic development patterns, is inefficient
and potentially destructive to the Region's economic and social structure.
   2.   To this end, the six municipalities of the Indian Valley hereby embark
on a course of action to implement regional planning. That only through
regional planning can growth and development be rationally and fairly managed.
Therefore, the Borough of Telford empowers the Indian Valley Regional Planning
Commission to undertake the development of a joint municipal comprehensive plan
that shall encompass the six municipalities of the Indian Valley. Upon the
successful completion of the joint municipal comprehensive plan and its
adoption by all the participating municipalities, the participating
municipalities may so instruct the Regional Planning Commission to undertake
the development of a joint municipal zoning ordinance and zoning map.
(Ord. 347, 2/16/1999, §2)
§ 1-303.   Powers and Duties.
   The Indian Valley Regional Planning Commission shall have the responsibility
to prepare a joint municipal comprehensive plan. To this end, the powers and
duties of the Commission are as follows:
      A.   To prepare a joint municipal comprehensive plan pursuant to Article
III and Article XI of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S.
§§10301 et seq., 10901 et seq.
      B.   In the preparation of the joint municipal comprehensive plan, the
members of the Commission shall represent the interests of their respective
municipalities, and shall cast one vote per municipality on all matters that
require action.
      C.   Any vote taken by Commission members pertaining to regional planning
and regional zoning must be unanimous for it to pass. All other nonplanning and
zoning related matters may be approved by simple majority.
      D.   Upon completion of the joint municipal comprehensive plan by the
Commission and its adoption by all the participating municipalities, the
Commission may be instructed by the participating municipalities to prepare a
joint municipal zoning ordinance and zoning map which shall be presented to the
participating municipalities for their consideration and adoption.
      E.   If so directed by the participating municipalities to develop a
regional zoning ordinance and zoning map, the regional zoning ordinance and
zoning map shall be prepared pursuant to Article VI and Article VIII-A of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §§10601 et seq., 10801-A.
      F.   Should joint municipal zoning be formally adopted by the
participating municipalities, the Regional Planning Commission shall review all
proposed changes to the joint municipal zoning ordinance and zoning map and
shall make a formal recommendation to the participating municipalities
regarding said change. The recommendation of the Commission shall be advisory
only.
(Ord. 347, 2/16/1999, §3)
§ 1-304.   Local Planning Commissions and Zoning Hearing Boards.
   Each municipality shall retain its own municipal planning commission and
zoning hearing board. The participating municipalities agree that for all
matters relating to lot line changes, subdivisions, land developments,
variances, special exceptions and conditional uses or any other matter of a
planning or zoning nature in which jurisdiction resides within the governing
body of a municipality, shall not be a joint planning or joint zoning activity.
(Ord. 347, 2/16/1999, §4)
§ 1-305.   Withdrawal.
   Any participating municipality may withdraw from the Regional Planning
Commission after 1 month formal notice. Upon receiving notice that a
municipality wishes to withdraw from the Regional Planning Commission, the
governing bodies of the remaining municipalities shall promptly schedule a
meeting to consider whether the remaining municipalities wish to continue with
the Regional Planning Commission. Should joint municipal zoning be enacted,
notice of withdrawal shall be pursuant to the standards set forth in the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §10101 et seq.
(Ord. 347, 2/16/1999, §5)
B.   Borough Planning Commission
§ 1-311.   Planning Commission Created; Membership, Powers and Duties.
   A Borough Planning Commission, composed of five members, is hereby created

planning agencies. Provided, the members of the Borough Planning Commission in

         (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the Telford
Borough Authority wastewater collection and treatment system that will
interfere with its operation, contaminate the biosolids generated at the
respective POTW, or will otherwise be incompatible with the POTW.
         (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the Authority’s
wastewater collection system within the Borough that will be inadequately
treated and thus will pass-through the system into the receiving waters or the
atmosphere.
         (3)   To protect the environment, the general public, the Authority,
Borough and any POTW personnel against the hazards associated with discharges
of toxic or otherwise incompatible pollutants into the sewer system.
         (4)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim industrial
wastewaters and biosolids from the wastewater treatment system.
         (5)   To provide for equitable distribution of the cost for the
development and implementation of the POTW’s Industrial Pretreatment Program,

National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, biosolids use
and disposal requirements, the Clean Water Act, the general pretreatment
regulations, and any other State or Federal laws with which the Borough or the
appropriate POTW must comply.
      B.   The provisions of this Part will be implemented and enforced by the
Authority Manager through issuance of wastewater contribution permits to those
industrial/commercial users meeting the EPA’s definition of a significant
industrial user (SID); through monitoring, reporting, and enforcement of the
Part with these significant industrial users and all other users. This Part
also assumes that the capacity of the sewer system allocated to existing
customers will not be pre-empted, and provides for the setting of fees for the
equitable distribution of costs resulting from development and implementation
of the program established herein.
      C.   Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of this Part and
any Authority resolution with the subject matter shall be administered,
implemented, and enforced by the Authority Manager and will be coordinated (if

§ 18-202.   Regulations.
   1.   General. No user or significant industrial user may contribute or cause
to be contributed, directly or indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater that
will cause a pass- through or interference in the Authority’s wastewater
collection and treatment system, will create a hazard to the environment, the
general public, Authority, Borough or PWTA personnel, or will cause either POTW
to violate any general pretreatment regulation, NPDES permit or biosolids
requirement. These general prohibitions apply to all such users of a wastewater
collection and treatment system, whether or not the user is subject to national
categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, State, or local
pretreatment standards or requirements, including those promulgated by the
PWTA.
   A user or significant industrial user may not contribute the following
substances to the wastewater collection and treatment system:
      A.   Any liquids, solids, or gases that by reason of their nature or
quantity are, or may be sufficient either alone or by interaction with other
substances to cause fire or explosion, or be injurious in any other way to the
wastewater collection and treatment system or will disrupt the operation of the
wastewater collection and treatment system. At no time shall two successive
readings on an explosion hazard meter at the point of discharge into the system
(or at any point in the system) be more than 5 percent, nor any single reading
over 10 percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL). Prohibited materials
include, but are not limited to, gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, benzene, toluene,
xylene, ethers, alcohols, ketones, hydrides, sulfides, aldehydes, peroxides,
chlorates, perchlorates, bromates and carbates, and any other substance that
presents a fire hazard or other hazard to the sewer system or either POTW
treatment plant, including any material or waste stream exhibiting a closed cup
flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit (i.e., waste streams whose
vapors ignite or burn at temperatures below 140 degrees Fahrenheit).
      B.   Solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction to the flow
in a sewer or other interference with the operation of the POTW or either POTW
treatment facilities, such as, but not limited to grease, garbage with
particles greater than ½ inch in any dimension, animal guts or tissues, paunch
manure, bones, hair, hides, fleshings, entrails, whole blood, feathers, ashes,
cinders, sand, spent lime, stone or marble dust, metal, glass, straw, shavings,
grass clippings, rags, spent grains, spent hops, waste paper, wood, plastics,
gas, tar, asphalt residues, mud, glass grinding, polishing wastes, petroleum
oil, and non-biodegradable cutting oil or mineral oil products that will
interfere with or cause a pass-through at either POTW treatment plant.
      C.   Any wastewater having a pH less than 6.0, or greater than 11.0
standard units, or wastewater having any other corrosive property capable of
causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment, and or personnel of the POTW
and either POTW treatment system.
      D.   Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity,
either alone or in conjunction with other pollutants, that will cause a pass-
through or interference in the Authority’s wastewater collection and treatment
system, will create a hazard to the environment, the general public or
Authority or Borough personnel, or will cause the POTW or either POTW treatment
plant to violate any general pretreatment regulation, NPDES permit or biosolids
requirement. These general prohibitions apply to all such users of the
wastewater collection and treatment system, whether or not the user is subject
to national categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, State, or
local pretreatment standards or requirements. A toxic pollutant shall include,
but not be limited to, any pollutant identified pursuant to § 307(a) of the
Act.
      E.   Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, vapors, solids, or fumes
that either alone or in conjunction with other wastes are sufficient to create
a public nuisance or hazard to life, cause health and safety problems, or are
sufficient to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance and repair.
      F.   Any substance that may cause either POTW treatment plant effluent or
any other product of the wastewater collection and treatment system such as
residues, biosolids, or scums to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse, or
which will interfere with the reclamation process. In no case shall a substance
discharged to the wastewater collection and treatment system cause the
appropriate POTW treatment plant to be in noncompliance with its biosolids use
or disposal criteria, guidelines, or regulations developed under § 405 of the
Act; or developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act,
the Toxic Substance Control Act, or State criteria applicable to the biosolids
management method being used.
      G.   Any substance that will cause either POTW to violate its NPDES
permit or the receiving stream water quality standards.
      H.   Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in the treatment
process such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning
solutions.
      I.   Any wastewater having a temperature that will inhibit biological
activity in the wastewater collection and in either POTW treatment plant
resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater with a temperature at the
introduction into the wastewater collection system that will result in a
wastewater treatment plant influent flow exhibiting a temperature which exceeds
40 degrees C (104 degrees F).
      J.   Any pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, COD,
etc.), released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentrations that cause
interference to the wastewater collection and treatment system. In no case
shall wastewater be discharged at a flow rate or containing concentrations or
quantities of pollutants that exceed for any time period longer than 15 minutes
more than five times the average 24-hour concentration, quantities, or flow
during normal operation.
      K.   Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such
half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the Manager in
compliance with applicable State or Federal regulations.
      L.   Any wastewater that causes a hazard to human life or creates a
public.
      M.   Stormwater, groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, or
cooling water.
      N.   Trucked or hauled wastes except at a point of discharge indicated by
the POTW treatment plant Manager or his duly authorized agent.
      O.   Wastewater having an oil and grease concentration greater than 100
mg/l.
   When the Authority determines that a user or significant industrial user is
contributing to the wastewater collection and treatment system any of the above
prohibited substances to the system, the Manager may advise the user of the
impact of such contributions on the wastewater collection and treatment system
and develop effluent limitations and compliance schedules which the user must
meet to correct the violation.
   The Authority may take enforcement action(s) against the noncomplying user
or significant industrial user regardless of whether the user or significant
industrial user was given prior notification of the violation by the Authority.
   2.   Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards. Upon the promulgation of
the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards for a particular industrial
subcategory, the Federal standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed
under this Part for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede
the limitations imposed under this Part. Each user or significant industrial
user shall be responsible to notify the Authority of changes to his status
under the Federal, State, or local regulations. The categorical pretreatment
standards found in 40 CFR, Chapter I, Subchapter N, Part 405- 471, are also
hereby incorporated into this Part.
      A.   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the Manager may
impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR, Part
403.6(c).
      B.   When process wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment
standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the
Manager shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula
in 40 CFR Part 403.6(e).
      C.   A user may obtain a variance from EPA from a categorical
pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and
substantive provisions in 40 CFR Part 403.13, that factors relating to his
facilities discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by
the EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard.
      D.   A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical
pretreatment standard in accordance with 40 CFR, Part 403.15.
   3.   Modification of Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards. Where the
respective POTW treatment plant achieves consistent removal of pollutants
limited by Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards, the respective POTW may
apply to the approval authority for modifications of specific limits in the
Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards. “Consistent removal” shall mean the
reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the
pollutant by either POTW treatment plant to a less toxic or harmless state in
the effluent, which is achieved by the system in 95 percent of the samples
taken when measured according to the procedures set forth in § 403.7(c)(2) of
Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 403, “General Pretreatment
Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution,” promulgated pursuant to
the Act. The Authority may then modify the pollutant discharge limits in the
Federal Pretreatment Standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR, Part
403, § 403.7 are fulfilled, and prior approval from the approval authority is
obtained.
   4.   Specific Pollutant Limitations.
      A.   All wastewater entering the sanitary sewer system shall be
pretreated to typical domestic levels unless otherwise stated in writing by
PWTA by way of the significant industrial user permit. Typical domestic levels
and specific pollutant limitations may require periodic change because of
changing NPDES requirements, required reevaluations of the local limits
analysis, or other reasons. At the time when such change becomes necessary,
modified local limits will be established and formally adopted by the PWTA
after modifications have been approved by the approval authority (USEPA). Upon
recommendation and approval by PWTA, industrial pre-treatment limitations shall
be established and revised by Telford Borough by amendment of the sewer use
ordinance. All existing limitations shall apply, even after recommendation and
approval of modifications by PWTA, until such time that the amendment to the
sewer use ordinance is lawfully adopted and effective.
      B.   Typical domestic levels for compatible pollutants shall be:
 
Parameter                  Maximum Concentration
                           (mg/l)
Biochemical Oxygen Demand  250(1)
(BOD5)
Total Suspended Solids     250(1)
(TSS)
Phosphorus (Total)         10 as P(1)
Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen    40 as N(1)
(TKN)
1Users may exceed the maximum concentrations listed for these parameters, but
will be surcharged according to the Authority’s and/or PWTA’s “High-Strength”
Surcharge Formula. Copies of this formula can be obtained from the Manager.
 
      C.   No user shall contribute toxic pollutants to the PWTA sewer system
in excess of the local limits identified in the PWTA’s most recent USEPA
approved local limits evaluation. The approved local limits evaluation is
available for public inspection at the offices of the Authority, 180 Maple
Avenue, Sellersville, Pennsylvania during the regular business hours of the
PWTA. At its discretion, the PWTA may establish alternate mass limits for
specific toxic pollutants in individual wastewater contribution permits, but
only in accordance with regulatory requirements. At no time shall the total
loading allocated to the users in their permits for a specific pollutant be
greater than the allowable wastewater treatment plant industrial loading as
determined in the PWTA’s most recent USEPA approved local limits evaluation.
The local limits, if more stringent than the national categorical standards
shall supersede the national categorical standards.
Pollutant Local Limit
          (mg/l)
Pollutant       Local Limit
                (mg/l)
Arsenic         0.04
Cadmium         0.04
Chromium, total 1.4
Copper          0.75
Cyanide         0.34
Lead            0.07
Mercury         0.001
Molybdenum      0.09
Nickel          1.0
Selenium        0.3
Silver          0.1
Zinc            1.5
Phenols         1.0
 
      D.   The PWTA, at its sole discretion, may develop best management
practices (BMPs) to comply 40 CFR § 403.5 (c)(1). Such BMPs shall be considered
local limits and pretreatment standards for the purposes of 40 CFR § 403 and §
307(d) of the Clean Water Act. The PWTA, also at its sole discretion, may allow
a user to implement BMPs to meet the prohibitions listed in 40 CFR 403.5(a)(1)
and (b) and this Section of this Part. BMPs may also be implemented in addition
to an approved limit or prohibition. If BMPs are allowed, they will be
implemented through user permits. Authorization of BMPs, in place of or in
addition to approved limits or prohibitions, does not relieve the user of
responsibility to comply with approved limits or prohibitions.
   5.   PWTA’s Right of Revision. The PWTA reserves the right to request the
Borough to establish by ordinance, limitations or requirements as least as
stringent as those promulgated by the PWTA for those users within its
jurisdiction whose wastewater is ultimately treated by the PWTA, in order to
comply with the objectives presented in §
18-201.1 of this Part.
   6.   Dilution. No user or significant industrial user shall ever increase
the use of process water or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a
partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance
with the limitations contained in the Federal Categorical Pretreatment
Standards, or with any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by the
Authority, the PWTA, State, or Federal agencies.
   7.   Slug Discharge. Each user shall provide protection from a slug
discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this Part.
To prevent the discharge of prohibited materials, suitable facilities shall be
provided and maintained at the user’s or significant industrial user’s own cost
and expense. In the case of a slug discharge which has the potential to violate
any of the specific provisions contained in 40 CFR 403.5, or to pass- through
or interfere with either POTW treatment plant, it is the responsibility of the
user to immediately telephone and notify the Authority and PWTA of the
incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste,
concentration and volume, and corrective actions taken to minimize and
eliminate the violation.
   Also, within 5 days following a slug discharge, the user shall submit to the
Authority and the PWTA (if applicable) a detailed written report that shall
contain the following information:
      A.   The cause of the noncompliance.
      B.   The approximate time that this condition occurred and whether it has
been corrected.
      C.   The steps taken by the user to reduce and minimize the impact of the
noncompliance.
      D.   The steps taken by the user to prevent are-occurrence of the
conditions that caused or led to the accidental spill or slug loading.
   Submission of such a report shall not relieve the user or significant
industrial user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability that may be
imposed as described in this Section, the Authority Enforcement Response Plan,
or any other applicable law.
   In addition, each POTW treatment plant will evaluate at least once per year
whether a significant industrial user needs to develop or update a slug control
plan.
    Detailed slug control plans–showing facilities and operating procedures to
provide slug control protection shall be submitted to the Authority for review
and approval prior to implementation. A slug control plan shall contain, at a
minimum, the following information:
      A.   A description of discharge practices, including routine or non-
routine batch discharges.
      B.   A description of new and spent chemical storage procedures.
      C.   Procedures for immediately notifying the Manager of any accidental
or slug discharge, including personnel responsible for such notifications.
      D.   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from an accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures shall include, but are not limited to, inspection
and maintenance of chemical storage areas, handling and transferring of raw and
finished products and chemicals, control of site runoff, worker training,
building of containment structures, available containment equipment, and
contracted environmental services that assist the user to fulfill these plans.
   A significant industrial user who commences contribution to the wastewater
collection and either POTW’s treatment system after the effective date of this
Part shall not be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until a
slug control plan has been approved by the Authority. Review and approval of
such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the significant
industrial user from the responsibility to modify his facility, as necessary,
to meet the requirements of this Part.
   All users are required to notify the POTW immediately of any changes at
their facilities affecting the potential for an accidental discharge and/or
slug discharge to the POTW.
   8.   Discharge Monitoring Equipment. The Manager reserves the right to
require any user of the Authority’s sewer system to install permanent sampling
equipment, at the user’s sole cost, in order to determine compliance with this
Part. The type of sampling equipment and installation location must be reviewed
and approved by the Manager.
   9.   Notice to Employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the
significant industrial user’s bulletin board or other prominent place advising
employees who to call in the event of an accidental or slug discharge.
Employers shall ensure that all employees who may be involved with hazardous
materials are aware of such emergency notification procedures.

system.
      E.   Details of control measures taken by the user to prevent and control
stormwater, drainage, roof runoff, from entering the sewer system.
   In addition, all users are required to provide details of any significant
changes to the nature or quantity of their discharge, including increased flows
of 25 percent or more, or the promulgation of a categorical pretreatment
standard that applies to their discharge, at least 90 days prior to commencing
the “changed” discharge.
   Costs incurred for developing the information described above shall be paid
by the user and are in addition to all other sewer use, permit, and surcharge
fees charged by the Authority or PWTA.
   The user shall be responsible for obtaining and submitting all applicable
Borough, County, regional, State, or Federal permits or planning documents
required for approval of a sewer connection. It is also the responsibility of
each user to notify the Borough and the POTW of wastewater discharges
containing materials which would be considered hazardous if disposed of in any
other manner.
   2.   Significant Industrial User Permits. All users proposing to, or already
connected into the Authority’s sewer system, which are deemed a significant
industrial user through review of the waste questionnaire or permit
application, must obtain a wastewater contribution permit from the Authority
and/or the PWTA 90 days prior to commencing discharge.
   In addition, whenever an existing significant industrial user becomes
subject to a new categorical pretreatment standard, the user must re-apply to
the Authority and/or the PWTA for a significant industrial user wastewater
contribution permit within 180 days of the promulgation of the categorical
standard. Based on the review of this data, the Authority and/or the PWTA may
re-issue the wastewater contribution permit for this significant industrial
user as soon as possible after incorporating the applicable standards.
      A.   Permit Application. Any user required to obtain a significant
industrial user permit shall complete and file with the Authority an
application in the form prescribed by the Authority (or its designated agent),
accompanied by the required permit filing fee. In support of the application,
the significant industrial user shall submit in units and terms appropriate for

         (15)   Requirements for development and implementation of best
management practices (BMPs) and record keeping and reporting for BMPs.
      C.   Reporting Requirements in Permits.
         (1)   Compliance Data Report. Following the date for final compliance
with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new
source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the sewer
system, any significant industrial user subject to Federal categorical
pretreatment standards shall submit to the Authority and, if applicable, the
PWTA a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the
discharge from the regulated process that are limited by pretreatment standards
or requirements. The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis, and if not, what
additional O&M and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the significant
industrial user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of
the significant industrial user and certified by a qualified professional
engineer.
         (2)   Periodic Compliance Reports.
            (a)   Every significant industrial user shall have his wastewater
sampled and analyzed at a frequency specified in the wastewater contribution
permit, but in no case less than two times per year. The frequency and number
of pollutants analyzed for will be specific for each industry. The sampling
must be representative of the user’s typical discharge during that reporting
period. The Authority and, if applicable, the PWTA may at any time require the
significant industrial user to perform additional sampling if it (or they)
believes the conditions of this Part are not being met. The significant
industrial user must submit to the Authority and PWTA, if applicable, during
the months of June and December, unless required more frequently by the
Authority and PWTA, an update report indicating any process, production, or
flow rate changes that have occurred during the previous 6-month period and all
sampling requirements specified above. This report will also include a record
of all daily flow that, during the reporting period, exceeded the average daily
flow allowed in the permit or contract. At the discretion of the Authority and
in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holiday,
budget cycles, etc., the Authority may agree to alter the months during which
the above reports are to be submitted.
            (b)   The Authority may impose mass limitations on significant
industrial users that combine non-regulated waste streams with categorical
process waste streams prior to the sampling point or requirements, or in other
cases’where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases,
the report required by subparagraph (1) of this Section shall indicate the mass
of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the
significant industrial user. These reports shall contain the results of
sampling and analysis of the discharge including the flow and the nature and
concentration or production and mass of pollutants contained therein that are
limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring
shall be prescribed in the applicable pretreatment standard. All analyses shall
be performed in accordance with procedures established pursuant to §304(g) of
the Act, and contained in 40 CFR, Part 136, and amendments thereto, or with any
other EPA-approved test procedures. Sampling shall be performed in accordance
with approved techniques.
   When the results of this sampling indicate noncompliance with any
requirement of this Part, the user must notify the Manager within 24-hours
after becoming aware of the violation(s). The user must also re-sample his
discharge and submit these results to the Authority within 25 days.
Additionally, all wastewater discharge sampling results obtained by the User,
whether or not required specifically by his wastewater contribution permit,
must be submitted to the Authority and to the PWTA, if applicable.
   All measurements, tests, and analyses required for determining the
characteristics of waters and wastewaters to which reference is made in this
Part shall be performed in accordance with 40 CFR Part 136. Sampling methods,
locations, times, durations, and frequencies are to be determined on an
individual basis and will be specified in the individual wastewater
contribution permits issued to the significant industrial users. If the
Authority or the PWTA performs the required monitoring of the user’s wastewater
discharge, the Authority or the PWTA will either perform any required repeat
sampling and analysis within 30 days of becoming aware of a violation or direct
the user to perform any required repeat sampling and analysis within 30 days of
becoming aware of a violation.
         (3)   BMP Compliance Information. If a user must implement a BMP to
comply with Federal Pretreatment Standards or Requirements, the PWTA’s
prohibited discharge standards, local limits, or any other condition of this
Part, the user shall submit any and all documentation required by the PWTA or
the pretreatment standard at the frequency specified by the PWTA or
pretreatment standard to evaluate compliance. The user must include information
on compliance with any applicable BMPs in baseline monitoring reports, 90-day
compliance reports and periodic compliance reports. The PWTA may also require
any user to submit additional BMP related information or data at any frequency
it deems necessary to determine compliance with Federal Pretreatment Standards
or Requirements or the PWTA’s rules and regulations.
      D.   Permit Duration. Permits shall be issued by the Authority for a
specified time period, not to exceed 5 years. Each significant industrial user
shall apply for are issuance of his wastewater contribution permit a minimum of
180 days prior to the expiration of his existing permit. The terms and
conditions of the permit may be subject to modification by the Authority or the
PWTA during the term of the permit, as limitations or requirements as
identified in §18-202 are modified or other just cause exists. A significant
industrial user shall be informed of any proposed changes in his permit as
least 30 days prior to the effective date of change. Where necessary, a
schedule for complying with these changes or new conditions may also be issued
by the Authority or the PWTA.
      E.   Permit Modifications. Upon the promulgation of a categorical
pretreatment standard, a significant industrial user subject to such standards
shall have his wastewater contribution permit revised to require compliance
with such standards.
      F.   Permit Transfer. Wastewater contribution permits are issued to a
specific significant industrial user for a specific operation. These permits
shall not be reassigned, transferred, or sold to a new owner, used for
different premises, or used for a new or changed operation.
      G.   Signatory Requirement. All reports, applications, or other
information required to be submitted under this Part shall be signed by an
authorized representative of the user and shall contain the following
certification:
   “I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were
prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed
to ensure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system,
or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the
information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true,
accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information, including the possibility of civil and criminal
penalties.”
   3.   Monitoring Facilities. The Manager or his duly authorized
representative shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether
the purpose of this Part is being met and all compliance requirements are being
met. Persons or occupants of premises connected to the PWTA’s wastewater
collection and treatment system shall allow the Manager or his representative
ready access at all times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, records examination and/or copying of same, or in the
performance of any of his duties. The Authority (or its designated agent) has
the right to set upon a user’s property such devices as are necessary to
conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring, and/or metering
operations. Where a user has security measures in force that require proper
identification and clearance before entry into his premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with any security guards so that upon presentation
of suitable identification, personnel from the Authority or the PWTA will be
permitted to enter without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific
responsibilities.
   4.   Pretreatment. Users and significant industrial users shall provide
necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this Part and any
applicable Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards within the time
limitations as specified by the Authority or in the Federal Pretreatment
Regulations. Any equipment or facilities required by the user to pretreat
wastewater to a level acceptable to the Authority shall be provided, operated,
and maintained at the user’s expense. The Authority may require that detailed
plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures to be
submitted for review and be deemed acceptable to the Authority before
construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures
will in no way relieve a user from the responsibility of modifying his facility
as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the Authority under the
provisions of this Part. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities
or method of operation, or any change that may result in a new or increased
discharge of pollutants, shall be reported to and be accepted by the Authority
prior to the initiation of the changes.
   5.   Record Keeping Requirements.
      A.   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this Part shall
maintain, and make available for inspection and copying by the Authority or the
PWTA, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities
required by this Part, any additional records of information obtained pursuant
to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such
requirements and records associated with implementation of BMPs. Records shall
include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of
the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who
performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the
results of such analyses and any other information or data deemed necessary by
the Authority or the PWTA. These records shall remain available for a period of
at least 3 years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration
of any litigation concerning the user, the Authority or the PWTA, or where the
user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the
Authority or the PWTA.
      B.   All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall
be made available to the Borough, the Authority, the PWTA, the PADEP or EPA
upon request.
   6.   Confidential Information. Information and data on a user or significant
industrial user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications,
permits, monitoring programs, and inspections, shall be made available to the
public or governmental agencies without restriction unless the user or
significant industrial user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to
the satisfaction of the Authority that the release of such information would
divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection
as trade secrets of the user or significant industrial user.
   When requested by the person furnishing a report, those portions of a report
that might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public but shall be made available, upon
written request, to governmental agencies for uses related to this Part, the
NPDES permit, biosolids disposal/re-use forms, and/or the general pretreatment
regulations. Any such portions of a report shall also be available for use by
any State agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the
person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will
not be recognized as confidential information.
   Information accepted by the Authority as confidential shall not be
transmitted to the general public by the Authority until after a 10-day
notification is given to the user or significant industrial user.
   7.   Falsifying Information. Any person who knowingly makes any false
statements, representations, or certification in any application, record,
report, plan, or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to
this Part or user or significant industrial user permit, or who falsifies,
tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method
required under this Part shall be punished as provided by law and shall be
subject to the fines set forth in §18-207.
(Ord. 387, 9/6/2011, § 2)
§ 18-205.   Sampling Requirements.
   Wastewater samples collected to comply with any provision of this Part shall
meet the following requirements:
      A.   Samples shall be collected using 24-hour flow proportional composite
collection techniques. In the event that flow proportional composite sampling
is not warranted in the opinion of the PWTA, the PWTA may authorize the use of
time proportional composite sampling or grab sampling. Where time proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling are authorized by the PWTA, the samples
must be representative of the discharge and the PWTA will solely determine the
number of grab samples required.
      B.   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using standard grab
collection techniques.
      C.   The PWTA may allow multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour
time period for certain parameters to be composited in the field or in the
laboratory prior to analysis if proper protocols specified in 40 CFR, Part 136,
and appropriate EPA guidance documents are followed. For cyanide, total phenols
and sulfides, the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field.
For volatile organics and oil and grease the samples may be composited in the
laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the
compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the PWTA, as appropriate.
      D.   Sampling techniques prescribed in 40 CFR, Part 136, as amended,
shall be followed.
      E.   The PWTA shall be notified a minimum of 48 hours prior to the
collection of a sample(s) by a user and may observe the collection of any
sample.
      F.   If a user does not follow proper sample collection protocols and/or
techniques, all samples collected inappropriately shall be discarded and re-
collected at the sole expense of the user.
      G.   Sampling facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and
maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep
its sampling location or facility in good working order shall not be grounds
for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its
discharge.
      H.   All sampling locations utilized to meet the discharge monitoring
provisions of this Part shall be approved by the PWTA.
      I.   All samples collected to meet the provisions of the Federal
Pretreatment Regulations or this Part shall be representative of the user’s
wastewater discharge.
(Ord. 387, 9/6/2011, § 2)
§ 18-206.   Analytical Requirements.
   Wastewater pollutant analyses completed to comply with any provision of this
Part shall meet the following requirements:
      A.   All pollutant analyses shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques prescribed in 40 CFR, Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an
applicable categorical standard. If 40 CFR, Part 136, does not contain
analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, analyses must be performed
in accordance with procedures approved by the administrator.
      B.   The user shall provide the PWTA with the name, address and telephone
number of any contract laboratory intended to be utilized for pollutant
analyses at least 48 hours prior to the collection of any samples. The PWTA may
recommend the use of an alternate contract laboratory.
      C.   Copies of laboratory analysis results shall be forwarded to the user
and the PWTA simultaneously.
      D.   Laboratory analysis results obtained by a user following improper
protocols or deemed technically deficient by the PWTA shall be discarded and
samples shall be re- analyzed at the sole expense of the user.
(Ord. 387, 9/6/2011, §2)
§ 18-207.   Enforcement.
   1.   Notification of Violation. Whenever the Authority or the PWTA finds
that any user has violated or is violating this Part, his wastewater
contribution permit, or the general pretreatment regulations, the Authority or
the PWTA shall serve upon the user a written notice of violation (NOV). Within
15 days of the certified receipt of the NOV, the user must submit to the
Authority and the PWTA (if applicable), a written response that contains the
following information:
      A.   Cause of noncompliance.
      B.   Anticipated duration of the noncompliance and the time by which the
violation will be corrected.
      C.   Steps taken by the user to reduce and eliminate the noncomplying
discharge.
      D.   Steps taken by the user to prevent re-occurrence of the condition(s)
leading to the noncompliance.
      E.   The signature of an authorized representative of the user that
certifies to the validity of the report.
   2.   Show-Cause Hearing. When a response given by the user to a previous NOV
is inadequate, or when a violation results in conditions that could cause the
respective POTW treatment plant to violate its NPDES permit or biosolids
quality requirements, or results in a hazardous situation within the sewer
system, the Authority will notify a user by certified mail of the requirement
that the user attend a show-cause hearing. A show-cause hearing is an official
meeting between the Authority and a user to resolve conditions of continued
violations. The hearing may result in the Authority issuing an administrative
order to the user, or if conditions warrant, civil penalties or injunctive
relief.
   3.   Administrative Order. An administrative order is an official
enforcement document that directs a user or significant industrial user to
undertake or to cease specific activities and that carries specific legal
actions to be enforced when addressing continued noncompliance. The order may
contain a compliance schedule specifying the time frame by which the user must
perform certain activities that will ultimately result incompliance with all
requirements contained in the order. The order may also contain the requirement
that the user pay civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day per violation.
   4.   Public Notification of Noncompliance. The Authority and/or PWTA shall
publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that provides
meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction served by the Authority and
PWTA, a list of the users which, during the previous 12 months, were in
significant noncompliance (as defined in §
18-201 of this Part) with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
   5.   Harmful Contributions. The Authority or the PWTA may suspend the
wastewater treatment service and/or wastewater contribution permit when such
suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the Authority or the PWTA, in order
to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents, or may present, an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons and/or
the environment; which causes, or threatens to cause, interference to the POTW;
or causes, or threatens to cause, the respective POTW treatment plant to
violate any condition of its NPDES permit.
   Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/
or the wastewater contribution permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily
with the suspension order, the Authority or the PWTA shall take such steps as
deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to
prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any
individuals. The Authority or the PWTA may reinstate the wastewater
contribution permit and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the
elimination of the noncomplying discharge. A detailed written statement
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted by the user to the Authority
and the PWTA within 15 days of the date of occurrence.
   6.   Revocation of Permit. Any user who violates the following conditions of
this Part, or applicable State and Federal regulations, is subject to having
his permit revoked in accordance with the procedures of this Section:
      A.   Failure of the user to factually report the wastewater constituents
and characteristics of his discharge.
      B.   Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations, or
wastewater constituents and characteristics.
      C.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose
of inspection or monitoring.
      D.   Violation of conditions of the permit.
   7.   Right to Appeal.
      A.   Appeal. A user, upon receipt of notification of suspension or
revocation of a user permit or significant industrial user permit, may appeal
the decision in writing to the Authority and/or the PWTA, if applicable, with a
statement of reasons therefore within 10 days of the notice. Such an appeal
shall not be cause for the discharge to continue if the suspension or
revocation was issued to stop a harmful contribution under §
18-202.
      B.   Notice of Hearing. Thereafter, upon notice in writing given to the
permit holder or any agent or officer thereof at least 5 days prior to the time
fixed, the Authority and PWTA (if applicable) personnel shall convene and
conduct a hearing on the propriety or lack thereof of the notice of suspension
or revocation. The cost of the stenographic transcript of such a proceeding
shall be borne by the appellant who shall pay a filing fee of at least $300 to
the Authority.
      C.   Method of Decision. The findings and determinations of the Authority
and the PWTA (if applicable) shall be in writing and shall be mailed to the
user’s authorized representative within 48 hours of the hearing, with a
certified copy thereof to be filed with the Manager who originally served the
notice of suspension or revocation. The determination shall be binding both
upon the Authority and all parties in interest.
      D.   Action Following Appeal Decision. If the decision of the Authority
sustains the notice of suspension or revocation of permit, the user shall be
given 10 days notice of the new date of suspension or revocation by the
Authority.
(Ord. 387, 9/6/2011, § 2)
§ 18-208.   Civil Penalty Assessment/Injunctive Relief Policy.
   1.   Civil Penalty Assessment. In addition to the other enforcement actions
described within the enforcement response plan (ERP), the Authority and/or the
PWTA may also seek civil penalties and/or injunctive relief against any user
who fails to comply with the requirements of this Part or his wastewater
contribution permit.
   Civil penalties vary from $500 up to $25,000 per day per violation depending
on the severity of the violation and other factors. In civil penalty
assessment, the Authority will consider all of the following factors:
      A.   Damage to the respective POTW treatment plant or the Authority’s
collection system, the environment, or collection system personnel, resulting
from the violation.
      B.   The user’s history of past violations.
      C.   The level of cooperation obtained from the user.
      D.   The economic benefit gained by the users as a result of the
noncompliance.
      E.   Other relevant factors.
   The general civil assessment policy of the Authority and the PWTA is given
in Table 1 of the enforcement response plan. All fines were developed in
accordance with the Publicly Owned Treatment Works Penalty Law (Pennsylvania
Act 9), 35 P.S. § 752.1 et seq., and will be assessed on a per day, per
violation basis. The Authority has the right to increase, reduce or waive the
fines in certain circumstances.
   All civil penalties collected pursuant to the Civil Penalty Assessment
Policy will be placed in a restricted account and shall only be used by the
respective POTW treatment plant for the repair of damage and any additional
maintenance or other costs resulting from the violation(s) on which the penalty
was imposed, to pay any penalties imposed on the Authority or PWTA by a State
or Federal agency as a result of violating any pretreatment standards, for the
costs incurred by the Authority or PWTA to investigate and initiate enforcement
actions against the noncomplying discharge (including legal and engineering
fees), for additional monitoring costs associated with the noncomplying user,
and for capital improvements to the treatment plant or collection system
required by the pretreatment program. Any remaining funds may be used for
capital improvements to the treatment plant or collection system not required
by the industrial pretreatment program.
   The Authority or the PWTA’s ability to seek civil penalties against
noncomplying users shall apply to all users of the wastewater collection and
treatment system regardless of political boundary. The civil penalties may be
sought in the Court of Common Pleas where the POTW treatment plant is located,
where the activity took place, where the condition exists or the public was
affected, and to that end a jurisdiction is hereby conferred in law and equity
upon such courts.
   2.   Injunctive Relief. The Authority and/or PWTA shall be able to seek
injunctive relief for noncompliance by users with pretreatment standards or
requirements or related provisions. Injunctive relief is available for
violations of pretreatment standards or requirements, any requirement stated in
this Part or user permits, including, but not limited to:
      A.   A discharge from a user presents an imminent or substantial danger
to the environment.
      B.   A discharge from a user causes the respective POTW treatment plant
to violate any condition of its NPDES permit, biosolids application standards,
or other State or Federal requirement.
      C.   A discharge from a user presents an imminent or substantial danger
to the respective POTW treatment plant or collection system, Authority, Borough
or PWTA personnel, or the general public.
      D.   The user has shown a lack of ability or intention to comply with a
pretreatment standard.
   Injunctive relief may also be issued against a noncomplying user if the
court determines that other enforcement actions available to the Authority and/
or the PWTA would not be adequate to affect prompt correction of the condition
or violation. In addition to injunctive relief, the Authority and/or the PWTA
may also be granted civil penalties according to this Section of this Part.
   The Authority’s ability to seek injunctive relief against a noncomplying
user shall apply to all users regardless of political boundary. The injunctive
relief may be sought in the Court of Common Pleas where the POTW treatment
plant is located, where the activity took place, where the condition exists or
the public was affected, and to that end a jurisdiction is hereby conferred in
law and equity upon such courts.
   3.   Right to Appeal. The user charged with any penalty previously described
shall have 30 days to pay the proposed penalty in full, or, if the user wishes
to contest either the amount of the penalty or the fact of the violation, the
user must file an appeal of the action pursuant to the municipal law, or in the
absence thereof, within 30 days pursuant to Title 2 Pa.C.S.

landlords or rental agents of a single-family-occupied property may assign such
responsibility to the tenant or lessee occupying the property through a lease
or rental agreement or other written assignment.
   4.   Every person or entity must separate household hazardous waste and leaf
waste from the recyclable materials and other municipal waste. It is the
responsibility of a person or entity to dispose of household hazardous waste in

placed in the container) fashion, as established by the municipal waste
collector, subject to the rules and regulations of the NMCRC no recyclable
material container shall be placed at the curb or in the front yard of any
resident’s property except during the period beginning at 6 p.m. on the evening
prior to the day of scheduled collection, and the empty container shall be
removed by 12 midnight on the day of scheduled collection. The time for placing
and removing containers may be changed by the Borough by amendment of this Part
and providing written notification of the amendment to the Borough’s

through arrangements with a municipal waste collector, and source-separated or
commingled recyclable material containers or dumpsters may be utilized. The
containers or dumpsters must be provided at easily accessible locations, and
written instructions must be provided to the occupants concerning the use and
availability of such containers or dumpsters. Owners or landlords of multi-

Plan Filing, Submission, Processing and Review
§ 22-301.   Applicability.
   The standards, requirements and procedures contained in this Part shall
govern the submission and processing of all applications for subdivision and/or
land development in the Borough of Telford.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 300)
§ 22-302.   Types of Plans.
   All applications for subdivision and/or land development shall be classified
as sketch plans, preliminary plans, final plans or minor plans, as further
regulated herein.
      A.   Sketch Plans. The Borough of Telford strongly recommends applicants
submit a pre-application sketch plan for all plans in accordance with the
requirements of §
22-304, “Sketch Plan Submission Requirements,” and §
22-305, “Sketch Plan Review Procedure.” Where only a portion of the property is
currently proposed for subdivision or land development, a sketch plan shall
show how the immediate proposal can fit logically into an overall plan for the
entire site.
      B.   Preliminary Plans. A preliminary plan is required to be submitted
for all proposals for subdivision and/or land development in accordance with
the requirements of §
22-306, “Preliminary Plan Submission Requirements,” and §
22-307, “Preliminary Plan Review Procedure.”
      C.   Final Plans. A final plan is required to be submitted for all
proposals for subdivision and/or land development in accordance with the
requirements of §
22-308, “Final Plan Submission Requirements,” and §
22-309, “Final Plan Review Procedure.”
      D.   Minor Plans. Applications which qualify as minor plans may be
submitted for concurrent preliminary and final plan processing and approval, in
accordance with the standards and requirements of §
22-312, “Minor Plan Submission and Review Procedure.”
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 301)
§ 22-303.   Waiver of Land Development Procedure.
   1.   A request for a waiver may be submitted to the Borough at any time. All
requests shall be accompanied by a plan prepared at least to the minimum
standards of a sketch plan (see §
22-304, “Sketch Plan Submission Requirements”) with the appropriate fees and
shall identify:
      A.   The specific Section of this Chapter which is requested to be
waived.
      B.   Provisions proposed as an alternate to the requirements.
      C.   Justification for the waiver.
   2.   Borough Council will schedule a request for a waiver for action at a
regular public meeting following the receipt of review letters by the Borough
Engineer and/or other technical advisors when requested.
   3.   Borough Council shall have no later than 90 days to act on the request
unless the applicant has agreed in writing to an extension of the time period.
      A.   The 90-day time period shall be measured from the date of the next
regularly scheduled Telford Borough Council meeting following the date the
request was filed that such meeting shall occur at least 15 days after the date
the request was filed.
      B.   If an extension of the 90-day time period is applied, it shall be
measured from the expiration of the original 90-day period. A time extension
shall postpone the deadline and effects of the 90-day time period for the
additional number of days agreed to in writing prior to the last scheduled
Borough Council meeting within the 90-day plan review period.
   4.   Borough Council shall consider the request at one or more of its public
meetings during the 90 day time period, and/or extension thereof if applicable.
Borough Council will review the request to determine if compliance with the
provisions of this chapter creates an undue hardship or appears to be
unreasonable as it applies to the particular property or if the applicant
demonstrates that an alternative proposal will allow for equal or better
results and take such action as it shall deem necessary or advisable in the
public interest. Borough Council shall render a decision on the request
following receipt of the recommendations of the Telford Borough Engineer and/or
other technical advisors as requested.
   5.   Procedure Following the Borough Council Decision.
      A.   Borough Council shall send a written notice of the Council’s action
to the applicant at his last known address not later than 15 days following the
decision.
      B.   If Borough Council denies the request, Council will notify the
applicant, in writing, of the justification for denial. If Borough Council
grants the request, the final plan shall include a note which identifies the
specific waiver as granted.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 302)
§ 22-304.   Sketch Plan Submission Requirements.
   1.   Purposes. The purposes served by a sketch plan are as follows:
      A.   To inform the Borough of Telford of an applicant’s intent to
subdivide and/or develop a property, and graphically show the concepts and
extent of the proposal.
      B.   To allow the Borough of Telford to provide advice and guidance to an
applicant so that:
         (1)   Overall layout and circulation issues can be resolved prior to
preparation of preliminary plans.
         (2)   The preliminary plan approval process may then be able to
proceed more efficiently.
      C.   To show how a tract of land may be further subdivided or developed
in cases where only a portion of a property is currently under an active
proposal.
         (1)   This plan shall show a logical and efficient pattern of roads,
lots, and/or buildings, as appropriate for the type of plan proposed, and shall
not be 2023 S-1 acceptable if it proposes lotting or development which is
obviously impractical or questionable for reasons of floodplain, steep slopes,
relationships to other properties, or other site planning constraints.
         (2)   A plan may be shown on the preliminary plan for the subject site
in the form of a reduced-scale inset drawing, although larger scale drawings
are encouraged for review and discussion purposes.
      D.   Sketch plans shall have no legal standing with regard to the formal
plan approval process mandated by the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code, 53 P.S. §10101 et seq., but shall be considered as a tool for discussion
and guidance regarding development issues.
   2.   Sketch Plan Information. A sketch plan should be drawn legibly and to
scale, but it need not be a precisely surveyed or engineered plan, and it
should show the following information:
      A.   The entire tract boundary, total acreage and acreage of each lot.
      B.   Existing and proposed streets, lots, buildings and approximate
building envelopes.
      C.   Significant physical features such as floodplain, steep slopes,
woodlands and existing structures.
      D.   Contour lines at 5 to 10-foot intervals, based on U.S.G.S. datum.
      E.   Approximate locations for stormwater control facilities, if
necessary.
      F.   Location plan showing the relationship of the subject tract to the
surrounding road network and major physical features.
      G.   North point and scale.

explain the proposal.
   3.   The applicant shall make a request to the Telford Borough Manager to be
scheduled on the meeting agenda of the Telford Borough Planning Commission for
presentation and discussion of the sketch plan, provided the plan is received 7
business days prior to the next Telford Borough Planning Commission meeting.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 303)
§ 22-305.   Sketch Plan Review Procedure.
   The Planning Commission shall review sketch plans in accordance with the
criteria contained in this Chapter and with other applicable ordinances. It
shall provide informal dialogue with the applicant and advise them as promptly
as possible of the extent to which the proposed subdivision or land development
conforms to the Indian Valley Regional Comprehensive Plan and relevant
standards of this Chapter, and will discuss possible plan modifications that
would increase its degree of conformity. The applicant may also choose to
submit alternative sketch plans. A sketch plan review agreement may be used to
further define the roles and obligations of the applicant and Telford Borough
in the review process. Aspects of the sketch plan that shall be specifically
evaluated include but are not limited to:
      A.   The location of all areas proposed for disturbance (streets,
foundations, yards, septic disposal systems, stormwater management areas etc.)
with respect to notable features of natural or cultural significance as
identified on the applicant’s existing resources and site analysis plan.
      B.   The potential for street connections with existing streets, other
proposed streets, or potential developments on adjoining parcels.

(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 313)
Part 4
Design Standards
§ 22-401.   General Standards.
   The following principles, standards and design requirements shall be used in
the evaluation of all subdivision and land development proposals. Other design
requirements as established in the Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27] or other Telford Borough ordinances shall be used in addition to
the following:
      A.   All portions of a tract shall be designated as to their use, such as
lots, roads, open space, parking areas, etc.
      B.   Applicants shall preserve scenic areas, historic sites, other
community assets and landmarks, and natural amenities such as trees and
waterways.
      C.   Plans shall be designed to avoid excessive disturbance of vegetation
and movement of earth.
      D.   Floodplain land areas shall be governed by additional standards
contained in this Chapter, the Telford Borough Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27] and the Telford Borough’s Building Code [Chapter 5,
Part 1].
      E.   The applicant shall construct, install and guarantee, at no expense
to the Borough of Telford or its authorities, all improvements required as part
of plan approval, including, but not limited to, streets, curbs, sidewalks,
water and sewage facilities, stormwater management facilities, street lights,
fire hydrants, road signs, monuments, lot pins, utilities and shade trees.
      F.   The standards contained within this Chapter are the minimum
standards and requirements for the protection of the health, safety and welfare
of the residents of the Borough of Telford and are to be used in all
subdivisions and land developments. Applicants are always encouraged to exceed
minimum standards. In addition, the Borough Council reserves the right to
require standards in excess of the minimum requirements if warranted due to the
unique characteristics of a particular property.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 400)
§ 22-402.   Conformance with Plans.
   1.   Comprehensive Plans. Proposals for land development or subdivision
shall be generally consistent with the Indian Valley Regional Comprehensive
Plan, especially as to the use of land, intensity of development,
transportation, community facilities and resource protection. Residential
development should also be consistent with the housing element of the plan. All
proposals should be located in and around areas designated for development in
the future land use plan element and be serviced by currently available
infrastructure or infrastructure that will be developed concurrent with the
development, where available.
   2.   State, Regional, County and Municipal Plans. Proposals shall be
generally consistent with appropriate State, regional, County and municipal
adopted comprehensive and other plans. Where regional facilities are proposed
in the plan, such as highways, effort shall be made to preserve needed right-
of-way in the proposed land development or subdivision for future
infrastructure projects.
   3.   Public Service Improvements. Proposals shall be consistent with the
location and timing of public service improvements, such as water and sewage
facilities in accordance with the appropriate infrastructure plans governing
those facilities. In addition, the location of public service facilities as
outlined in a capital improvement program or official map should be considered
in locating and planning development.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 401)
§ 22-403.   Site Organization.
   Proposed land developments and subdivisions should address the opportunities
and limitations present on a site and its adjacent surroundings. Site
opportunities should be maximized to enhance the overall quality of the
development and sincere steps should be taken to lessen potential negative
impacts upon a site and the surrounding community. The physical, social and
psychological needs of the users of the site should be evaluated and
appropriately incorporated into the final subdivision layout or site design.
The impacts of the proposed development on the natural environment and
surrounding land uses should be given a high priority and made an integral part
of the overall design for the land development and subdivision. The following
site organization guidelines should be used:
      A.   Site Improvement Layout. Building placement should provide a
functional relationship with a site’s topography, existing vegetation,
surrounding land uses, taking into account energy conservation, solar access
and pertinent natural features.
      B.   Existing Natural Features. Existing natural features should be
recognized and integrated into the site layout. Natural features such as
streams, hillsides, wetlands, unique habitat, woods and similar natural
resources should be considered strong design determinants and be incorporated
into the overall site plan to strengthen the unique quality of the land.
      C.   Open Space and Scenic Views. The placement of open space and
preservation of scenic views should be a fundamental design decision. Open
space offers more than an opportunity to provide recreation. It can protect
important natural systems, reduce the perceived density of development and
effectively buffer different land uses.
      D.   Circulation. Movement within a site and access to the site should
consider the safety and convenience of various types of users. Cross access
between properties and joint access are encouraged to improve circulation.
      E.   Relationship to Surrounding Uses. The proposed design should
compliment positive surrounding uses through building set backs, buffers and
separation of uses. Various potential negative impacts upon surrounding land
uses including noise, light and loss of privacy should be mitigated.
      F.   Sustainable Development. The development of a site should use
methods that reduce energy, water and fuel consumption needs of the land
development. Opportunities to utilize renewable energy sources, conserve and
reuse water resources, and reduce fuel consumption should be considered.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 402)
 § 22-404.   Lots.
   1.   Lot Size and Width. Each lot shall meet or exceed the minimum area and
width requirements of the Zoning Ordinance and be generally sufficient in size
and shape to adequately accommodate the development or use proposed for it.
Lots that contain natural restrictions such as wetlands, water bodies, steep
slopes or other features shall be made large enough to provide suitable area
for the intended use of the lot without requiring encroachment upon natural
amenities. Lots with existing or planned public improvements such as fuel pipe
lines, underground utility easements, stormwater detention basins, high voltage
power lines or other facilities should be sized to allow suitable room for the
intended use of the lot without requiring encroachment on the public facilities
or easements. The lots shall further conform to the following requirement
designed to abate health hazards: Where water supply and/or sanitary sewage
disposal are provided by individual on-lot facilities, the Board shall require
that the applicant have such tests made as are necessary to determine the
adequacy of the proposed facilities in relation to the proposed lot size and
existing grade and soil conditions. In all such cases, certification by the
Montgomery County Health Department and/or Bucks County Health Department that
the proposed facilities will be adequate shall be a prerequisite to final
approval of the plan.
   2.   Lot Shape. Deep, narrow lots and wide, shallow lots are to be avoided
except that lots containing uniquely designed structures, such as certain types
of attached dwelling units, may receive special consideration. The depth of the
lot should not exceed 2½ times its width. Every lot shall contain a building
envelope suitable for the type(s) of development proposed.
   3.   Lot Frontage. Every lot shall have frontage along the right-of-way of a
public or private street, in accordance with the Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27]. Sufficient frontage is the minimum width required to site a
driveway into the property in accordance with the design requirements in this
Section and other appropriate State, Federal and local regulations. Corner lots
will have to meet lot frontage requirements on two streets.
   4.   Lot Lines. Lot lines shall be drawn parallel, concentric, at right
angles, or radial to the street right-of-way line unless not feasible or
undesirable due to existing, permanent, natural or man-made features. Where
possible lot lines shall coincide with abutting lot lines and lot lines across
streets. Generally, lot corners of several lots should coincide.
   5.   Reverse Frontage Lots. Reverse frontage lots may be used as an
alternative to marginal access streets, or normal lotting when the lots abut a
major collector street or street of a higher classification, or steep grades
(over 15 percent) at the street right- of-way line. When reverse frontage lots
are used and the total lot depth is less than 200 feet, an additional 25 feet
shall be added to the portion of the lot abutting major collector street or
street of a higher classification, to provide a landscaped buffer area in
accordance with §
22-434.2.
   6.   Rear or Flag Lots.
      A.   Purpose of Rear or Flag Lotting.
         (1)   To permit reasonable subdivision of land which is physically
constrained by unusual configuration of the tract or limited road frontage, and
which could not be subdivided in a desirable manner using conventional streets
and lotting patterns.
         (2)   To preserve farmland, woodland, scenic views, historic sites or
other environmental amenities by locating buildings away from roads.
         (3)   To avoid access to a major collector street or a street of a
higher classification.
         (4)   Shall not be used as a means to avoid building a road.
      B.   Parts of a Rear or Flag Lot. Rear or flag lots shall be comprised of
two parts, the access strip and the body of the lot, in compliance with the
following standards.
         (1)   The access strip shall be a minimum of 25 feet wide for its
entire length unless the body of the flag lot is likely to undergo further
subdivision in the future. If a rear lot is capable of subdivision in the
future and is not deed restricted against further subdivision, the access strip
must be at least 50 feet wide and be able to contain a road capable of meeting
all appropriate public street and intersection standards contained in this
Chapter. When an access strip is designed for a future road, a note shall be
placed on the plan reserving the access strip for a future road; however,
dedication is not required.
         (2)   The access strip shall be a fee-simple part of the rear or flag
lot, and shall not be a separate parcel or easement. This portion of the lot
shall not be used for any purpose other than the location of an access
driveway. Vehicle parking, sewage disposal systems, and the development of any
structures shall be specifically prohibited in the access strip.
         (3)   The body of a rear or flag lot shall comply with all the minimum
dimensional requirements of the zoning district in which it is located. The
area of the access strip shall not be counted toward the minimum lot area
requirement.
         (4)   The frontage of the rear or flag lot shall be parallel to the
frontage of the street and be measured based upon the rear yard setback
standard established in the appropriate zoning district. In the event the
access strip is proposed for a future road, a second front yard for the purpose
of establishing set backs shall be measured from the potential access road.
      C.   Review Factors. In unique situations, rear or flag lots may be
permitted by special exception by the Zoning Hearing Board in accordance with
the Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27]. In reviewing rear or flag lot proposals, the following factors
will be considered by the Borough Council, the Planning Commission and the
Engineer.
         (1)   The amount of road frontage and configuration of the property
being subdivided.
         (2)   The sizes and number of lots proposed, including both the total
number of lots and the number of flag lots.
         (3)   The type and character of road that the tract abuts.
         (4)   The type and character of the neighborhood and abutting parcels.
         (5)   The topography of the parcel being subdivided, with an emphasis
on saving trees, avoiding steep slopes and preserving floodplain, wetlands and
other environmental features if present.
         (6)   The location and safety of access points and street
intersections.
         (7)   The economic impact on Telford Borough of maintaining a road as
compared to using flag lots.
         (8)   The visual and physical impacts of road construction from
excessive regrading, for example, as compared to the use of access strips.
      D.   Design Standards for Rear Lots.
         (1)   The length of the access strip shall be kept to a minimum. As a
guide, the preferred length is approximately equal to the depth of one lot
which complies with the minimum lot width and area requirements of the district
in which it is located. No access strip should exceed two times the lot depth
described above, unless the primary purposes of the additional length are to
preserve farmland or other land for preservation of agriculture or rural
character, by locating new development remote from road frontage.
         (2)   The location of the access strip should be logical relative to
the body of the rear lot, surrounding lot configurations, and natural features
of the land, and it shall intersect the public street at a safe, visible
location.
         (3)   Turns greater than 45 degrees or with a radius less than 150
feet and vertical grades in excess of 10 percent are prohibited in access
strips. It may be necessary to widen the access strip at such sharp turns and
steep slopes to accommodate grading, drainage, tree preservation or emergency
vehicles. Access strips that may become future roads shall be configured to
accommodate horizontal curves required for roads.
         (4)   Driveways within access strips shall be paved from the edge of
road pavement to a distance of 15 feet from the ultimate right-of-way.
         (5)   Joint driveways are permissible between both front and rear
lots. No more than two access strips may abut each other. Each pair of access
strips must share a common access point and driveway from the edge of pavement
to a distance of at least 50 feet beyond the ultimate right-of-way line of the
road, from which point either one common driveway or two individual driveways
may continue. The shared portion shall be a minimum of 12 feet wide. Shared
portions of driveways may be wider where access is taken from major collector
streets or streets of a higher classification. Cross-access easements across
driveways guaranteeing access to adjacent lots shall be provided.
         (6)   Access points to flag lots, whether single or paired, shall be
separated by at least 300 feet as measured along the right of way. Separation
distance shall be measured from the center point of the nearest access strips
unless specific driveway access points have been clearly established.
         (7)   No more than one “tier” of flag lots shall be permitted on a
tract. In other words, a flag lot may not be located behind another flag lot.
         (8)   In a subdivision of five or more lots, flag lots may comprise no
more than 15 percent of the total number of lots, rounded to the nearest whole
number.
         (9)   Flag lots are not permitted at the bulb or turn-around of a cul-
de-sac.
         (10)   Flag lots are not permitted to gain access from a single access
street.
         (11)   The access strip must serve as the primary access point for the
lot.
   7.   Lot lines shall follow municipal and county boundaries rather than
cross them.
   8.   Where feasible, lot orientation shall provide for proper solar access.
This is achieved by building placement with the long access in a general east-
west direction.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 403)
§ 22-405.   Mud and Dust Control.
   1.   During construction, no mud may be tracked from the development onto
the surrounding roadways (whether or not they are dedicated), and no dust or
dirt from construction operations shall be permitted to settle on surrounding
properties.
   2.   At final plan review, a written plan to prevent mud from being tracked
onto surrounding roads and to control dust shall be submitted to and shall be
approved by the Borough.
   3.   If mud is tracked from the development onto surrounding roads or dust
or dirt generated on the site is permitted to settle on surrounding properties
in violation of this Section all construction on the site may be stopped by the
Telford Borough Zoning Officer until the mud is removed from the streets and
until an accepted plan is devised to prevent further mud from being tracked on
to the streets and/or until an acceptable plan is devised to control dust or
dirt on the site. Additionally, the developer may be fined pursuant to Borough
regulations.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 404)
§ 22-406.   Burying.
   No person or entity shall bury any trees, vegetation, garbage, refuse,
trash, debris, construction debris (including, but not limited to, wood,
plastic, plaster, metals, bricks and concrete, whether generated within Telford
Borough or elsewhere), or similar items, under ground during any phase of
construction of a subdivision or land development in Telford Borough.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 405)
§ 22-407.   Blocks.
   1.   The ideal block length is 1,200 feet. The minimum block length shall be
500 feet and the maximum block length shall be 1,600 feet unless the Zoning
Ordinance [
Chapter 27] specifies different minimum/maximum lengths.
   2.   The block width shall be two lot depth when the lots are laid out back
to back according to the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27]. When reverse lotting is designed, the block width shall be in
accordance with the reverse frontage lot standards (§
22-404.5).
   3.   Blocks shall be designed to continue the Telford Borough’s existing
street pattern and provide efficient, convenient, and safe pedestrian and
vehicular circulation, including the reduction of intersections with arterial
streets.
   4.   Blocks shall be designed to reflect natural features that may constrain
subdivision and land development. Unless a watercourse is located along the
rear of lots in the block, drainage should be away from the interior of the
block toward the abutting streets.
   5.   Where necessary for safe, convenient and direct pedestrian access to
commercial, institutional or open space/recreation areas as determined by the
Borough of Telford, walkways should be designed into block area. The walkways
should extend straight from one street to the other on an easement or public
right-of-way at least 10 feet in width.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 406)
§ 22-408.   Community Facilities.
   1.   The Borough Council shall determine the need for additional community
facilities to serve the proposed subdivision or land development.
   2.   Where deemed essential by the Borough Council upon consideration of the
particular type of development proposed, and especially in large-scale
residential developments, the Borough Council may require the dedication or
reservation of such areas or sites of an extent and location suitable to the
needs created by the development for schools, parks and other purposes in
accordance with the parks and open space plan, community facilities plan or
official map.
   3.   Areas provided or reserved for such community facilities shall be
adequate to provide for building sites, related activity areas, landscaping and
off-street parking as appropriate to the use proposed.
   4.   Where a proposed park, playground, school or other public use shown in
Telford Borough’s Parks and Open Space Plan is located in whole or in part in a
subdivision or land development, the Borough Council may require the dedication
or reservation of land within the subdivision or land development, in those
cases in which the Borough Council deems such requirements to be necessary in
accordance with §
22-409.10.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 407)
§ 22-409.   Recreational Facilities.
   1.   Purpose. Telford Borough requires the construction of recreational
facilities, payment of fees in lieu thereof, private reservation of land, or a
combination thereof, for park or recreation purposes as a condition precedent
to final plan approval; or as Borough Council selects and prefers for all
residential subdivisions and land developments of two dwelling units or more
and all nonresidential subdivisions and land developments with a building area
greater than 2,000 square feet.
   2.   Objectives.
      A.   Insure adequate recreational areas and facilities to serve future
residents of the Borough.
      B.   Maintain compliance with recreation standards as recommended by the
Telford Borough Park and Recreation Committee and the Telford Borough Council.
      C.   Minimize overuse of, and excessive demand for, existing recreational
areas and facilities by future residents.

to serve new residents.
      E.   Ensure that dedicated recreation land is suitable for the intended
use.
      F.   Uphold the goals and objectives stated in Telford Borough’s Park
Plan, July 2001 and Telford Borough’s Open Space Plan, November 2006.
   3.   General Requirements. Recreation land shall be defined as usable area
that can be developed for playgrounds, tot lots, neighborhood parks or
community parks for active or passive outdoor recreation. All residential and
nonresidential subdivision and land development plans shall provide for
suitable and adequate recreation land and/or fees as set forth in this Chapter
in order to fulfill the following purposes:
      A.   For all residential subdivisions and land developments of two or
more dwelling units, or for all nonresidential subdivisions and land
developments with 2,000 square feet or more of building area, recreational
facilities shall be provided by the developer.
      B.   Recreation facilities shall be constructed on recreation land when
such land is required by the Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27].
      C.   Recreation facilities shall be readily accessible to all development
residents or occupants; or in the case of recreation facilities dedicated to
the Borough, shall be easily and safely accessible to the general public. At
least one side of the recreation area shall abut a street for a minimum
distance of 50 feet for access of emergency and maintenance vehicles, and
parking facilities where deemed necessary by the Borough.
      D.   The configuration of recreation areas must be able to accommodate
recreation activities proposed by the subdivision and development plans.
Required minimum area shall not include narrow or irregular pieces of land

      E.   Recreation areas shall not be traversed by utility easements unless
said utilities are placed underground and no part of them or their supportive
equipment protrudes above ground level.
      F.   Recreation areas shall be located such that the use of recreational
facilities will not be a nuisance to the residents of nearby dwelling units.
Adequate buffering/fencing, as determined by the Borough, shall be constructed
to separate recreational facilities from private properties.
      G.   The developer shall be required to improve the recreation land so
that it is usable for the intended activity, including necessary facilities and
equipment. Proposed improvements, including facilities and equipment, shall be
acceptable to Telford Borough.
      H.   Telford Borough may, but shall not be required to, accept any
portion(s) of the recreational land/facilities provided. Recreational
facilities not dedicated to, or accepted by Telford Borough, shall be owned and
maintained by a homeowners association or other method acceptable to the
Borough.
      I.   Proposed recreation areas and facilities may be reviewed by the
Telford Borough Park and Recreation Committee pursuant to this Chapter as
deemed necessary by the Borough Council.
      J.   Sidewalk and/or a trail must be provided to the land being dedicated
to allow all residents of the subdivision to have access to the proposed park
and recreation facilities.
   4.   Minimum Recreation Facility Requirements: The following table lists
facilities required by this Section:
Total No. of Lots/ No. of Playfields No. of Tot Lots* No. of Basketball or

   9.   Consolidation of Facilities. Applicants are required to provide the
numbers and types of facilities as required in this Section, spaced for
convenient access by the residents. However, applicants are encouraged to
consolidate several facilities in fewer locations to better serve the
residents’ needs in the following possible ways:
      A.   By locating all required tennis or basketball courts in one area,
thereby restricting noise and light to one area, and precluding the need to
search the neighborhood for a free court.
      B.   By combining two 25,000 square feet playfields into one 50,000
square feet area to permit larger fields for softball, football, soccer or
other fields sports, while maintaining the neighborhood use character.
      C.   By creating one or more park-like facilities rather than simply
several sets of scattered facilities.
      D.   By locating some tot lots in combined areas while retaining others
on individual sites to guarantee short walking distances to tot lots.
   10.   Recreation Land Dedication Requirements.
      A.   All residential and nonresidential subdivision and land development
plan submissions to the Borough shall be required to provide for public
dedication of land suitable for park and/or recreation use in accordance with
the provisions of this Chapter.
      B.   A minimum of 0.0271 acres or 1,185 square feet of suitable
recreation land shall be provided per dwelling unit within all residential
subdivision or land developments, and in accordance with this Chapter, unless
the applicant agrees to a fee-in-lieu of as outlined in subsection .13. This
requirement is based on the following: a goal of providing 10.5 acres of
recreation land per 1,000 population in accordance with the standards of the
National Park and Recreation Association; and an average household size of 2.58
persons per household as determined by the U.S. Census of 2010. A minimum of
.0271 acres or 1,185 square feet of suitable recreation land shall be provided
per 2,000 square feet of building area for all nonresidential subdivision and
land development, unless an applicant agrees to a fee-in-lieu of as outlined in
subsection .13.
      C.   This recreation land requirement shall in no way diminish the
requirement for open space where an open space requirement is set by the
Borough’s Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 27].
      D.   The land dedicated to the Borough for park and recreation purposes
need not be a part of the land development or subdivision. It may be located on
a separate parcel of land provided that the Telford Borough Council, in its
sole discretion, determines that the land so dedicated is appropriate for the
particular circumstances.
   11.   Criteria For Determining the Location and Suitability of Recreation
Areas.
      A.   Site(s) must be easily and safely accessible, have good ingress and
egress and have access to a public road.
      B.   Site(s) must have suitable topography for the development as a
particular type of recreation area.
      C.   Size and shape of the site(s) must be suitable for the development
as a recreation area.
      D.   Site(s) must meet the minimum size with respect to usable acreage as
determined by the Park and Recreation Committee of Telford Borough and if the
minimum dedication requirement is determined by the Park and Recreation
Committee to be unusable for recreational facilities due to the size or
location of said land, the applicant shall then offer a fee-in-lieu of the
dedication of the recreation land as outlined in subsection .13.
      E.   Sites designated for recreation land shall not contain lands with
natural resources that are to be permanently protected and undeveloped,
stormwater detention facilities or lands designated for any other purpose.
      F.   The recreational activities and/or facilities for which the area is
intended must be specified on the development plans and recorded on the mylars.
The metes and bounds of the property must be shown on the plan that is
recorded.
      G.   Recreation areas shall not be traversed by utility easements unless
said utilities are placed underground and no part of them or their supportive
equipment protrudes above ground level.
      H.   The configuration of the recreation area must be able to accommodate
recreation activities proposed by the development plans. The required areas
shall not include narrow or irregular pieces which are remnants from lotting
and/ or street and parking areas.
      I.   On-site improvements shall be commensurate with the adjacent on-site
development improvements, including but not limited to grading, curb, sidewalks
and utilities.
      J.   Open space which is required by the Zoning Ordinance shall be
provided in addition to the recreation land required by this Chapter. Where
both open space and recreation land are required, the requirements for
mandatory dedication of recreation land shall be met in addition to the
requirements of open space.
   12.   Ownership/Dedication to Borough of Recreation Land.
      A.   The Borough of Telford Planning Commission and Park and Recreation
Committee will provide recommendations on any proposed recreation land
dedication and any proposed assessment of recreation fees in lieu of land
dedication.
      B.   If the Borough Council determines that recreation land dedication
would be in the public interest, such recreation land shall be owned and
maintained by an entity that the Borough Council determines is acceptable to
insure proper long- term oversight and maintenance of the land. This may be any
of, but not limited to, the following, providing such entity agrees to accept
such land for permanent recreation purposes:
         (1)   Retention by the owner of the development, if such dwelling
units are to be rented, subject to restrictions acceptable to the Borough
Solicitor which shall ensure the perpetual dedication of the land for
recreational use.
         (2)   Dedication to a formal homeowner or condominium association,
with such agreement subject to approval of the Borough Council, after review by
the Borough. If any entity responsible for such recreation land should dissolve
or become inactive or decide that it no longer wishes to be responsible for
such land, it shall offer such land at no cost to the Borough or to another
entity that the Borough so designates for continued use as recreation land.
         (3)   Dedication to an established State, county or regional
organization acceptable to the Telford Borough Council.
         (4)   Dedication to Telford Borough.
      C.   If the Borough Council deems it to be in the public interest to
accept dedication of land for recreational purposes, such acceptance shall be
by adoption of a resolution of the Borough Council and acceptance of a deed of
dedication from the developer. Acceptance of dedication of recreational land by
the Borough shall occur following a formal offer by the developer with title
insurance and other information and conditions as required by the Borough.
      D.   Recreation land shall include deed restrictions to permanently
restrict its use for recreation and to prohibit the construction of buildings
on the land, except building for noncommercial recreation or to support
maintenance of the land.
   13.   Fee in Lieu of Dedication. Where, upon agreement with the applicant or
developer, it is determined that the dedication of all or any portion of land
area required for recreational purposes is not feasible because of size, shape,
location, access, topography or other features of the land, or any need of the
Borough, the Borough shall require the applicant or developer to pay a fee in
lieu of dedication of any such land or to construct recreational facilities in
lieu of dedication of any such land. The fee shall not apply to any existing
dwelling units involved in the subdivision or land development.
      A.   The amount of the fee shall be specified in the Schedule of Fees
adopted by resolution of the Telford Borough Council.
      B.   Fees required under this Section shall be paid prior to the
recording of the approved final plan or as determined by the Telford Borough
Council. In the case of a phased development, fees shall be paid prior to the
recording of the approved final plan for each phase.
      C.   Limitations on Use of Fees:
         (1)   Any recreation fees collected under this Section shall be placed
within an interest-bearing “Recreation Fee Account” which shall function as a
capital reserve fund and shall be accounted for separately from other Borough
funds.
         (2)   All fees and interest within the Recreation Fee Account shall
only be used for acquisition of recreation land, development of, maintenance of
and capital improvement to, public recreational facilities, landscaping of
recreation land, engineering, legal, planning, architecture, landscape
architecture and the payment of debt directly resulting from such expenditures.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 408)
§ 22-410.   Preservation of Existing Vegetation.
   Preservation of existing woodlands, mature trees and unique vegetation is
required to maintain habitat, protect soil from erosion, reduce energy costs
and enhance local aesthetics.
      A.   Preservation of Existing Vegetation.
         (1)   All subdivisions and land developments shall be laid out in such
a manner as to minimize the removal or disturbance of healthy trees and shrubs.
Existing woodlands should be incorporated into common open space, buffer areas
and on large lots. Special consideration shall be given to mature trees and
ecologically significant woodlands.
         (2)   It shall be incumbent on the applicant to prove that tree
removal is minimized. If challenged by the Borough of Telford, the applicant
shall produce evidence, such as written documents or plans certified by a
registered landscape architect or other professional showing that no
alternative layouts are possible and that no alternative clearing or grading
plan would reduce the loss of mature trees, tree masses or woodlands.
         (3)   Mature trees, tree masses or woodlands proposed for removal by
the applicant during construction shall be labeled “TO BE REMOVED.” All other
trees, tree masses or woodlands shall be designated “TO REMAIN.”
            (a)   If a tree is proposed to be removed, proof must be submitted
that a certified arborist has determined that the tree is unhealthy and
suitable for removal.
         (4)   Trees over 6 inches in caliper within a tract proposed for
subdivision or land development shall not be removed unless any of the
following conditions exist:
            (a)   Immediate danger to life or property.
            (b)   Affliction by a disease which threatens to injure or destroy
other trees.
            (c)   There exists an approved land development plan showing
landscape material to be retained or removed. Tree removal pursuant to such a
plan shall be limited to those trees within 15 feet of a proposed structure, 6
feet of a proposed impervious surface or an area to be graded pursuant to an
approved grading plan.
         (5)   All mature trees which are not to be removed shall be preserved
in their natural condition.
         (6)   All subdivisions and land developments shall be laid out in such
a manner so as to preserve the healthy trees and shrubs on the site. However,
each tree having a caliper of 6 inches or more measured 6 inches above the
ground, that is removed shall be replaced with a tree species that is approved
by the Borough, which have a total caliper equal to or greater than the tree
removed. For example, if a tree having a caliper of 12 inches measured 6 inches
about the ground is removed, it may be replaced with a single tree of 12-inch
caliper, two trees of 6-inch caliper, three trees of 4-inch caliper or any
other combination of trees meeting the ordinance with a total caliper of 12
inches or greater. This requirement is in addition to any other required by
these subdivision and land development regulations.
      B.   Protection of Existing Vegetation.
         (1)   Existing vegetation to remain shall be identified “TO REMAIN” in
the field and on the erosion and sediment control plan prior to any clearing
and physically protected during construction. A temporary physical barrier such
as a snow fence shall be erected a minimum of 1 foot outside the dripline on
all sides of individual trees, tree masses and woodlands prior to clearing and
construction. The barrier shall be placed to prevent disturbance to or
compaction of soil inside the barrier, and shall remain until construction is
complete.
         (2)   It is recommended that trees to be preserved near developed
portions of a site are pruned and fertilized prior to beginning of construction
in order to ensure their health.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 409)
§ 22-411.   Wetland Protection.
   1.   The presence of hydric soils may indicate the presence of wetlands.
When hydric soils are indicated on the site, a wetlands study should be
conducted in accordance with the Federal Manual for Identifying and Delineating
Wetlands. In the event no wetland study is undertaken, the location of hydric
soils on site will be assumed to be wetlands for the purpose of this Chapter
and so noted on the plan.
   2.   Wetlands as defined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in accordance with § 404 of the Federal Clean
Water Act of 1977, 33 U.S.C.A. § 1294 et seq., and 25 Pa.Code, Chapter 105,
pursuant to the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Act Amendments of 1978, 35 P.S. §
691.1 et seq., shall be preserved in subdivisions and land developments.
Required permits shall be obtained at an early stage to determine the extent
and location in proposed subdivision and/or land development.
   3.   A 25-foot setback shall be maintained around the perimeter of all
wetlands. This area will be known as the “Wetland Buffer.” No removal of
vegetation, except the optional removal of dead trees or periodic mowing of
existing lawns or fields, shall take place within this buffer area without the
specific permission of the Borough of Telford.
   4.   Required building setbacks as described in the Zoning Ordinance
[Chapter 27] shall be measured from the edge of the wetland buffer.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 410)
§ 22-412.   Riparian Corridor Management.
   1.   Whenever a pond, watercourse, stream or intermittent stream as
identified in the Soil Surveys of Montgomery County and/or Bucks County is
located within a development site, it shall remain open in its natural state
and location and shall not be piped.
   2.   Unless otherwise described in the Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27] a 50-foot buffer (25 feet from each bank of the water body) shall
be maintained along all intermittent or perennial water courses and ponds. This
buffer area will be known as the “riparian corridor.” No removal of vegetation,
except for removal of dead trees and shrubs or periodic mowing of existing
lawns or fields, shall take place within this buffer area without the specific
permission of the Borough of Telford.
   3.   No stormwater detention basins shall be allowed within the 25-foot
buffer zone.
   4.   Within any riparian corridor, no construction, development, use,
activity or encroachment shall be permitted unless a corridor management plan
is submitted and approved by the Borough Council and the effects of such
development are mitigated by the implementation of the corridor management
plan. The corridor management plan shall meet the following requirements:
      A.   Plan Contents. The corridor management plan shall contain the
following information:
         (1)   Existing conditions, including the corridor boundaries, steep
slopes, swales, wetlands, streams, ponds, flood-plains, woodlands, other
vegetation and existing structures. A written description of unusual or
significant conditions should also be included.
         (2)   Management goals for the entire tract and long-range goals for
the riparian corridor.
         (3)   Proposed activities, including a plan drawn to scale that shows
all proposed activities within and adjacent to the corridor. The plan shall
differentiate areas that will be disturbed from those that will be protected
and preserved.
         (4)   Proposed management, including an explanation of how the goals
will be met given the proposed activities. The plan shall specify when the
construction, planting or other activities are to begin and end and shall
address long and short-term maintenance, mitigation and improvement activities
necessary for preservation of the corridor, including application of
herbicides, removal of invasive plants, spacing and types of newly planted
trees and shrubs, mowing schedules, farming practices and other related
functions.
      B.   Management, Mitigation, and Restoration Measures. The proposed
management plan shall comply with the following management, mitigation and
restoration measures:
         (1)   Management Practices. The following management practices shall
be integrated into the management plan:
            (a)   Existing woody and other vegetation should be preserved to
the greatest extent possible.
            (b)   Fallen branches and other organic material should be allowed
to remain where they have fallen, provided that they do not create a hazard.
            (c)   Stream crossings should be done at a 90-degree angle to the
stream.
            (d)   Streambanks should be stabilized in accordance with A
Streambank Stabilization and Management Guide for Pennsylvania Landowners, by
PADEP.
            (e)   Degraded landscapes should be restored or converted to a more
effective landscape for maintaining water resources.
      C.   Mitigation Measures. Disturbance of vegetation within the riparian
corridor shall be mitigated by at least one of the following measures, with a
total amount of mitigated area, measured horizontally, that is equal to or
greater than the total amount of disturbed area, measured horizontally:
         (1)   Increasing the Width of the Corridor. The width of the riparian
corridor, measured from the defined edge of a watercourse, is increased to at
least 75 feet.
         (2)   Converting to a More Effective Landscape. The existing landscape
is converted to a more effective landscape. The following landscapes are listed
in order of effectiveness, from most effective to least effective: woodland,
meadow, shrub, old-field, lawn.
         (3)   Increasing the Effectiveness of the Corridor. In existing
degraded wooded areas or proposed new wooded areas, the riparian corridor is
planted with three distinct layers of vegetation: (a) canopy trees, such as
oak, hickory, maple, gum, beech, sycamore, spruce, pine and fir, (b) shrubs
that provide an understory, such as elderberry, viburnum, azalea, rhododendron,
holly, laurel and alders, and (c) herbaceous plants that serve as ground cover,
including ferns, sorrel, trillium, violet, Virginia creeper, nettle, phlox,
aster and worts. All three layers shall be planted at a density sufficient to
create a fully- functioning, naturalized riparian corridor.
      D.   Restoration and Conversion of Landscapes.
         (1)   Landscapes shall be restored by removing invasive vines,
removing invasive trees, cleaning out trash, correcting soil erosion problems,
planting appropriate plants and properly maintaining all new plantings.
         (2)   Landscapes shall be converted to a more effective landscape by
removing existing, incompatible vegetation, planting plants that are
appropriate for the proposed landscape type and the site, and maintaining and
protecting the plantings from invasive plants, deer and other long-term
problems.
   5.   Vegetation Selection. To function properly, vegetation in the corridor
management plan shall be selected from the Recommended Plant Materials List in
Appendix 22-A. Plants not included on the list may be permitted by the Borough
Council when satisfactory evidence is provided from qualified sources
certifying their suitability. The Borough of Telford may require species
suitability to be verified by qualified experts in the Montgomery County
Conservation District, Bucks County Conservation District, Natural Resources
Conservation Service, Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission, the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, or State and Federal forest agencies.
      A.   Existing tree cover should be surveyed and inventoried to assess the
need for any new plantings. Existing species included on the Pennsylvania
Noxious Weed Control List should be removed where conditions warrant.
      B.   Adjacent to the watercourse, dominant vegetation shall be composed
of a variety of native riparian tree and shrub species and appropriate
plantings necessary for streambank stabilization.
      C.   Away from the watercourse, dominant vegetation shall be composed of
riparian trees and shrubs, with an emphasis on native species and appropriate
plantings necessary to stabilize the soil.
      D.   Disturbed areas shall be revegetated with riparian corridor plants,
in compliance with an approved corridor management plan.
         (1)   Canopy tree and shrub plantings shall be located along the
streambank to provide shade for the stream, soil erosion control and stormwater
benefits, according to accepted streambank restoration practices.
         (2)   New canopy trees shall be planted at a minimum rate of 15 feet
on center or one tree per 225 square feet in staggered naturalized rows or an
equivalent informal arrangement within the area within 25 feet of the top of
each bank of the stream. One new shrub or understory tree shall be planted for
every four new trees required for riparian corridor revegetation.
         (3)   New trees shall be a variety of sizes ranging from a minimum 4
to 5- foot branched whip to an approximate 1½ inch caliper balled and burlapped
planting stock.
      E.   Areas that cannot be revegetated shall be restored using management
practices accepted by experts qualified in riparian corridor management.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 411)
§ 22-413.   Top Soil Protection and Grading.
   1.   No topsoil shall be removed from the site or used as spoil. Topsoil
must be removed from the areas of construction and stored separately.
   2.   Following construction, the stockpiled soil shall be redistributed
uniformly on the site to a minimum depth of 6 inches.
   3.   All disturbed areas excluding the stockpile soil of the site shall be
stabilized and protected against erosion in compliance with the Pennsylvania
Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control Program Manual.
   4.   Any topsoil in excess of the 6 inches depth that existed prior to
subdivision or land development may be stockpiled separately for other uses by
the applicant. Top soil may be removed from the site only upon issuance of a
permit by the Borough Council to ensure that sufficient topsoil will remain on
the site and in Telford Borough.
   5.   Grading. All permanent and temporary cutting, filling, grading,
regrading and/or other forms of earth-moving activities shall be known as
“grading” and shall be conducted only in compliance with the standards as
described below.
      A.   All grading shall be set back from property lines at least 5 feet,
or a sufficient distance, to prevent any adverse effects on adjacent
properties.
      B.   No permanent excavation shall be made with a cut face steeper in
slope than three horizontal to one vertical.
      C.   Wherever grading will increase the volume or velocity of stormwater
flow toward a property line, the applicant shall install and maintain drainage
facilities sufficient to prevent adverse effects on the adjoining property. The
construction and operation of these drainage facilities shall not cause any
adverse effects on abutting properties.
      D.   Along property lines, where grading creates an abrupt drop-off from
the abutting property, in contrast to a previously existing gradual change, the
applicant shall be required to install a fence or other suitable protective
barrier.
   6.   Burying of trees, stumps or construction materials is prohibited. Trees
and stumps may be chipped or ground and spread on the site.

§ 22-414.   Erosion and Sediment Control.
   The requirements of this Section shall apply when they are more stringent
than those of PADEP or when PADEP has no jurisdiction.
      A.   General.
         (1)   For qualifying tracts, no changes shall be made in the contour
of the land; no grading, excavating, removal or destruction of the topsoil,
trees or other vegetative cover of the land shall be commenced until such time
that a plan for minimizing erosion and sedimentation has been approved by the
Montgomery County Conservation District and/or Bucks County Conservation
District.
         (2)   No subdivision or land development plan shall be approved
unless:
            (a)   There has been a plan approved by the Borough Council that
provides for minimizing erosion and sedimentation consistent with this Section,
and an improvement bond or other acceptable securities are deposited with the
Borough in the form of an escrow guarantee which will insure installation and
completion of the required improvements.
            (b)   There has been a determination by the Borough Council that a
plan for minimizing erosion and sedimentation is not necessary.
         (3)   The Borough Council, in its consideration of any preliminary
plan of subdivision and land development shall condition its approval upon the
execution of measures designed to prevent accelerated soil erosion and
resulting sedimentation, as required by PADEP. All applicable regulations and
permit requirements of said department as stipulated in its Soil Erosion and
Sedimentation Pollution Control Manual shall be followed by all parties engaged
in earth-moving activities. The manual is available at the office of the
Montgomery County Conservation District and/or Bucks County Conservation
District.
      B.   Performance Principles.
         (1)   Any effective methods of minimizing erosion and sedimentation
can be included in the plan. Any questionable method should be discussed with
the Telford Borough Engineer prior to submission.
         (2)   No unfiltered stormwater coming from an area which has been
disturbed shall be permitted onto an adjacent tract or discharge into any
waterbody.
      C.   Responsibility.
         (1)   Whenever sedimentation is caused by stripping vegetation,
regrading or other development activity, it shall be the responsibility of the
person, corporation or other entity causing such sedimentation to remove it
from all adjoining surfaces, drainage systems and watercourses and to repair
any damage at his expense as quickly as possible.
         (2)   It is the responsibility of any person, corporation or other
entity doing any act on or across a stream, watercourse or swale or upon the
floodplain or right-of-way thereof, to maintain, as nearly as possible, in its
present state the stream, watercourse, swale, floodplain or right-of-way during
the activity and to return it to its original or equal condition after such
activity is completed.
         (3)   No person, corporation or other entity shall block, impede the
flow of, alter, construct any structure or deposit any material or thing, or
commit any act which will affect normal or flood flow in any stream or
watercourse without having obtained prior approval from the Borough of Telford
or PADEP, whichever is applicable.
      D.   Compliance with Regulations and Procedures.
         (1)   Final plans for minimizing erosion and sedimentation as approved
will be incorporated into the agreement and bond requirements as required under
this Chapter.
         (2)   The approval of plans and specifications for the control of
erosion and sedimentation shall be concurrent with the approval of the final
plans of subdivision or land development, and become a part thereof.
         (3)   At the time that a building permit is applied for, a review
shall be conducted by the Telford Borough Engineer to insure conformance with
the plan as approved. During the construction further consultative technical
assistance will be furnished, if necessary, by the Telford Borough Engineer and
the Montgomery County Conservation District and/or Bucks County Conservation
District. During this development phase, the Telford Borough Engineer shall
inspect the development site and enforce compliance with the approved plans.
         (4)   Permission for clearing and grading after preliminary plan
approval may be obtained under temporary permits or other conditions
satisfactory to Telford Borough, at the applicant’s risk.
         (5)   In the event the developer proceeds to clear and grade prior to
recording plans, without satisfying conditions specified under this subsection,
the Borough Council may revoke the approval of the preliminary plan.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 413)
§ 22-415.   Historic Feature Preservation.
   The design of subdivisions and land developments should be done in a manner
which would preserve desirable cultural and historic features of a site
wherever reasonably possible.
      A.   No proposal will be approved with a property line extending through
any portion of an existing building, except where that property line follows a
party wall separating semi-detached or attached units, in accordance with the
Telford Borough Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27].
      B.   When existing buildings are retained:
         (1)   Minimum building setbacks shall be met or exceeded, in respect
to all new lot lines created, for the district in which the buildings are
located, even if this results in a lot area or dimensions in excess of the
otherwise applicable minimums.
         (2)   Building setbacks in excess of the applicable minimums are
encouraged, in respect to all new lot lines created, when the height and/or
bulk of the existing building significantly exceeds that of proposed, abutting
development. For tall buildings, a setback equal to the height of the building
is suggested as a minimum. For proportionally wide or deep buildings, a setback
equal to one-half the width or depth of the building is suggested as a minimum.
         (3)   Structurally deficient buildings shall be rehabilitated in
conformance with the Uniform Construction Code (UCC) [Chapter 5, Part 1] for
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
         (4)   Additions to retained buildings shall conform in all respects to

Chapter 27] applicable to the district in which the building is located, and
shall be in harmony with the character, design, building materials and other
architectural features of the building.
         (5)   Historical or culturally significant buildings shall retain
their respective characters, to the greatest extent practical. All of Telford
Borough’s historical and/or culturally significant buildings are listed in the
Cultural Resources section of the Indian Valley Regional Comprehensive Plan.
         (6)   New buildings abutting the retained building should reflect
their respective characters, to the greatest extent practical.
         (7)   In nonresidential districts retained buildings shall be provided
with adequate parking, service and landscaped areas in accordance with the
Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27] provisions for the intended use. If the applicant cannot specify
the intended use, then the most land consumptive provisions shall be applied,
to ensure sufficient land area for uses permitted in that district.
         (8)   The building setback lines, existing and proposed buildings,
driveways, parking areas, walks and other similar information shall be shown on
the plan, with a note added describing the buildings, and their intended
purposes.
         (9)   No plan approval will be granted to a subdivision or a land
development unless and until the above requirements are complied with to the
satisfaction of the Borough Council, upon recommendation of the Telford Borough
Planning Commission and Engineer.
      C.   When existing buildings will be removed:
         (1)   The plan must show the location and include a brief description
of the building(s) to be removed.

§ 22-416.   Sidewalks and Border Areas.
   Sidewalks shall be installed along all existing and proposed public and
private streets, common driveways and common parking areas.
      A.   General.
         (1)   Sidewalks and border areas shall be required on both sides of
the street within the ultimate or public right-of-way.
         (2)   Telford Borough Council may waive the sidewalk requirements if
an alternative pedestrian circulation concept can be shown to be more
desirable, especially when using open space areas, provided that appropriate
connections are provided between the open space walkways and the surrounding
pedestrian origins and destinations.
         (3)   If for any reason an interim waiver of these requirements is
made, a sufficient guaranty shall be posted for the eventual installation of
sidewalks, subject to approval by the Borough Council upon recommendation of
the Borough’s Engineer and Solicitor, in accordance with paragraph .B of this
Section.
      B.   Design and Layout.
         (1)   Sidewalks and border areas shall be provided in appropriate
locations to provide safe and efficient pedestrian access between parking
areas, buildings and other pedestrian destinations.
         (2)   Sidewalk and border areas widths are to follow the guidelines
set forth in Figure 22-4-1. Figure 22-4-2 illustrates levels of service offered
by varying widths of sidewalks.
         (3)   The border area shall exist between the curb line or edge of
cartway and the sidewalk.
            (a)   Border areas between sidewalks and the curb may contain
street lights, trees, benches, trash cans, mailboxes or newspaper boxes. No
obstacle in the border area may reduce the required sidewalk width for use by
pedestrian traffic as described in the guidelines in Figure 22-4-1.

            (b)   Border areas shall be maintained as a grass strip between the
sidewalk and the curb. If grass is impractical at the site, brick pavers or
similar surface may be used at the discretion of the Borough Council upon
recommendation of the Telford Borough Planning Commission and Engineer. In this
case, a wider sidewalk may be necessary in place of a border area to create a
safer pedestrian environment.
            (c)   Where a border area is proposed as a grass strip, in no case
shall its width be less than 3 feet.
         (4)   The Borough Council may require additional width in areas where
higher volumes of pedestrian traffic are anticipated. In no case shall sidewalk
width be less than 4 feet.
         (5)   All sidewalk widths are exclusive of any obstacle. Sidewalk
areas containing street lights, trees, benches, doors, trash cans, mailboxes,
newspaper boxes or similar feature are required to have additional width.
         (6)   Additional sidewalks or paved trails shall be required where
deemed necessary by the Borough Council to provide access to schools, religious
institutions, parks, community facilities, trails and commercial or employment
centers, and to provide necessary pedestrian circulation within land
development and/or subdivisions where otherwise required sidewalks would not be
sufficient for public safety and convenience.
         (7)   Sidewalks shall be designed to facilitate access and use by
persons that are physically disabled, in compliance with the Guidelines for
Buildings and Facilities, United States Architectural and Transportation
Barriers Compliance Board, as amended, promulgated by the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C.A. § 12101 et seq., and to the satisfaction
of the Telford Borough Engineer.
         (8)   The grade and paving of the sidewalk shall be continuous across
driveways except in certain cases where heavy traffic volume dictates special
treatment. The grade and alignment of all sidewalks shall be approved by the
Telford Borough Engineer.
         (9)   If the provision of sidewalks requires the destruction or
removal of valuable trees as determined by the Borough, consideration shall be
given to the retention of such valuable trees.
         (10)   Conflicts arising from the placement of street trees, utilities
and border areas should be discussed with the Telford Borough Planning
Commission and Engineer to determine appropriate placement and alignment.
         (11)   Proposed sidewalks shall maintain the width, pattern and style
of Telford Borough’s sidewalk network. Where proposed sidewalks meet existing
sidewalks which have a different width, a tapered transition shall be
constructed.
      C.   Sidewalk Construction and Driveway Crossing Engineering Standards.
Sidewalks shall be 4 inches thick 4,500 psi compression strength concrete,
placed upon a minimum 4-inch layer of AASHTO #57 (2B stone) stone bedding,
except at all driveway crossings where the concrete and stone thicknesses shall
be increased to 6 inches. Wire mesh shall be installed at all driveway
crossings. The sidewalk shall be built as to discharge drainage to the street,
the grade of which shall be ¼ inch per foot. The finished grade between the
outside of the sidewalk to the curb line (edge of the cartway) shall never
exceed a total vertical elevation change of 1 foot. Expansion joints shall be
placed every thirty (30') feet, with contraction joints every 5 feet and
minimum of 1 inch in depth. Additional expansion materials shall be placed
between any curb and driveway apron and in the side walk at drive way limits. A
contraction joint shall be cut between the side walk and apron. All sidewalks
shall receive a broom finish unless otherwise approved by the Borough of
Telford. An access ramp for physically disabled persons shall be placed at all
sidewalk intersections with roads.

for all proposals using private streets for access.
            (b)   Included in the deeds for all properties having these access
rights.
            (c)   Recorded in both the Montgomery County and/or Bucks County
Office of the Recorder of Deeds.
            (d)   Clear and specific with regard to property owner’s rights to
further subdivision or further land development, especially in regard to the
need to receive approval from the homeowners association and/or waiver from the
requirement of this Chapter. In the case where no homeowner’s association is
created, approval must be obtained from all legal landowners having access
rights.
         (6)   The private street may be owned by one or more of the property
owners who have right-of-access, or may be jointly owned by an association of
these property owners.
         (7)   Maintenance shall be guaranteed by the formation and
administration of an association or other legally binding organization of all
land owners with access rights.
            (a)   Documents governing such association shall be subject to
approval of the Borough Council upon the advise of the Telford Borough
Solicitor, shall be filed with the Borough of Telford and shall be recorded
with the deed for each property with access rights.
            (b)   All property owners in such an association shall have a share
in the rights and bear a share of the costs and other burdens of maintenance,
as specified in the access agreements and/or covenants. This share shall also
apply to the assessed costs for upgrading to public street standards, in
accordance with subsection .2.A(8), herein.
            (c)   If one or more property owners in the association believe
that the street is not being properly maintained, and cannot succeed in having
the association authorize or conduct proper remedies, then that/those property
owners may request the Borough of Telford to authorize an inspection of the
street by the Telford Borough Engineer. The cost of the inspection shall be
paid by those property owners requesting the inspection. If the Telford Borough
Engineer determines that the street is not being properly maintained, the
Borough of Telford may take corrective actions in accordance with subsection
.2.A(8), herein.
         (8)   The Borough Council reserves the right to order the private
street to be upgraded to meet all of the standards and requirements for a
public street, if, at any time, they deem the road to be a health or safety
hazard for reasons of improper or inadequate maintenance.
            (a)   The full costs of upgrading the street, including
engineering, legal and related costs, shall be assessed against the
association. With each association, the share of the assessment to be paid by
each property owner shall be as specified in the association’s legal access
agreements and/or covenants.
            (b)   Prior to such action by Borough Council, the landowners with
access rights shall be notified, in writing, by certified mail, of the pending
action. The landowners will have 30 days from the date of such notice to
propose an alternative solution acceptable to the Borough Council.
         (9)   Additional Provisions.
            (a)   Any vehicular accessway which provides the primary access to
three or more lots, but is not offered for dedication as a public street, shall
be considered a private street subject to these requirements.
            (b)   Not more than 10 dwelling units may be served by a private
street which has access to a public street (private dead-end or cul-de-sac
street).
            (c)   A private street with more than one access to a public street
or streets may have not more than 10 lots or dwelling units per public street
access.
            (d)   Emergency access may be required to a private street which
has only one public street access.
            (e)   For private cul-de-sac streets, a suitable turnaround shall
be provided, subject to the approval of the Telford Borough Engineer. A 60-
foot radius paved bulb turn around is encouraged, but other configurations may
be used if approved by the Telford Borough Engineer.
         (10)   Further subdivision or land development of any lot depending
upon a private road for vehicular access is prohibited if it would exceed the
number of lots permitted, maximum length of cul-de-sac or any other applicable
requirements contained in this Chapter. If an applicant requests such further
subdivision, the following standards shall apply:
            (a)   In order to permit such further subdivision one of the
following shall take place:
               1)   The street must be upgraded to meet all the standards and
requirements for public street construction, and must be offered for dedication
to the Borough of Telford.
               2)   Further subdivision may be permitted and the street may
remain private, if the Borough Council approves the waiver of necessary design
standards.
            (b)   The applicant shall apply in writing to the Borough Council
for approval to upgrade the street or to be granted appropriate waivers.
               1)   Application to the Borough Council shall include written
approval from the homeowners association for the applicant to seek Borough
approval for upgrading or waivers.
               2)   Upgrade of the street or waivers should not be approved by
the Borough Council unless approval is first received from the homeowners
association.
            (c)   The costs of upgrading a private street to public street
standards including the dedication, and/ or costs involved in granting waivers
shall be borne by the association of individual property owners in accordance
with the association’s legal access agreements and/or covenants.
         (11)   An Individual private driveway may be legally reclassified and
physically upgraded and improved to become a private street upon approval of
the Borough Council.
            (a)   A right-of-way shall be established to contain the private
street in compliance with the requirements herein.
            (b)   The private driveway shall be physically improved to comply
with private street construction and paving width standards, as well as
applicable dimension standards.
            (c)   Maintenance shall be guaranteed as established for private
street in this Chapter.
            (d)   Upgrading of existing individual driveways to private street
status is encouraged where it would take the place of several individually
owned and maintained access strips.
         (12)   Parking shall not be permitted within the minimum 18-foot wide
cartway of a private street, but may be permitted outside the cartway in a
manner that does not interfere with the free movement of emergency vehicles
along the private street.
            (a)   The legal access agreements and/or covenants shall guarantee
free unobstructed access throughout the minimum 18-foot wide cartway. If
violations occur, attempts should be made to resolve the problems within the
structure of the association. Under situations of repeated and/or flagrant
violations, individual property owners may request police enforcement of free
and unobstructed access.
            (b)   If there is a continuing access problem caused by improper
parking, the Borough Council shall notify the homeowners association, in
writing, that the problem must be corrected by some means satisfactory to the
Telford Borough Engineer or Solicitor, depending upon whether the solution is a
physical or legal remedy.
            (c)   If, after written notification, the homeowners association
fails to correct the parking problem, the Borough Council may order the
upgrading of the private street to public street standards as specified herein.
The homeowners association shall have 30 days from the date of written
notification to propose a solution to the parking problem.
         (13)   In considering applications for waivers of private street
standards, the Borough Council shall consider the following:
            (a)   Number of lots and/or dwelling units in excess of the
permitted maximum.
            (b)   Whether or not more lots could be proposed along the private
street, in conformance with the applicable zoning, in addition to those
proposed in conjunction with the waiver application. For example, one
additional unit may be acceptable in itself, but may not be acceptable if a
potential would exist for five more lots.
               1)   The Borough Council may require the applicant to submit a
sketch plan and/or information showing the approximate maximum number of lots
and/or dwelling units which could be created under the applicable zoning
requirements, on all lands serviced by the private street.
               2)   When conditions are considered favorable for limited
additional subdivision under the private street access, the Borough Council may
request deed restrictions against further subdivision as a condition of final
approval of the subdivision.
            (c)   Ability of a private street to be served by an emergency
access as a condition of granting a waiver.
            (d)   Characteristics of properties, neighborhood and private
street(s) involved:

(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 420)
§ 22-422.   Street Classifications.
   Every street, road or highway within the Borough of Telford shall be
classified by its function as one of the following, and shall be subject to the
requirements for its classification as contained in this Part, including
vehicular access analysis and other requirements. These classifications are
based on the Montgomery County Transportation Plan Element which incorporates
standards established by the American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials (AASHTO), and used by PennDOT, and are intended to
provide appropriate standards for each road, as well as to coordinate street
functions and improvements among neighboring municipalities, the region, and
the state. A map of Telford Borough’s street classifications is included in
Figure 22-4-6.
      A.   Arterials. Arterials provide a high degree of mobility in order to
better serve trips of longer length. Since access to abutting property is not
their major function, access controls are desirable to enhance mobility. The
arterial that is located within Telford Borough is classified as a minor
arterial. Minor arterials interconnect with and augment principal arterials in
serving major activity centers. They typically accommodate trips between 3 and
5 miles in length. They are spaced at intervals consistent with population
density and carry traffic within or between several municipalities of the
county. Lastly, they link other villages not connected by principal arterial
and provide key connections between roads of higher classification. The design
standards for minor arterials are included in
Figure 22-4-4.
      B.   Collectors. Collectors serve a dual function of providing a mix of
accessibility and mobility. They typically serve trips of up to 4 miles in
length and channel or distribute traffic to or from a road of a higher
classification. The collectors that are located within Telford Borough are
classified as minor collectors. Minor collectors provide a combination of
access and mobility with more emphasis on access. They allow more access to
abutting properties with little or no restriction. Individual driveway access
is permitted. Generally minor collectors accommodate trips only within a small
segment of a municipality. They are spaced at intervals to collect traffic from
local roads and neighborhoods and channel it to major collectors and arterials.
Finally, minor collectors may serve as a major road through a residential
neighborhood. The typical posted speed is 25 to 30 miles per hour. The design
standards for minor collectors are in
Figure 22-4-4.
      C.   Local Roads. Local roads and streets have relatively short trip
lengths generally not exceeding 1 mile. Because property access is their main
function, there is little need for mobility and high operating speeds. This
function is reflected by use of lower posted speed between 20 and 30 miles per
hour. Through traffic is discouraged from using local roads. They only provide
a link between property access and the collector road network.
         (1)   Residential Streets. New streets or extensions of existing
streets in residential developments function primarily to provide vehicular
access and street frontage for each lot. The design standards for residential
streets are in
Figure 22-4-4. Residential streets shall be assumed to have parking on both
sides unless no driveways take access on them or the development otherwise
provides significant off street public parking which is convenient to all the
proposed houses.
         (2)   Nonresidential Access Streets. Shall function primarily to
provide vehicular access and street frontage for industrial office, institution
and commercial lots and land uses. The standards for nonresidential access
streets are in
Figure 22-4-4.

   Sight distance, horizontal and vertical curvature, super-elevation, and
maximum and minimum street grades shall be determined by the Telford Borough
Engineer in compliance with the standards contained in A Policy on Geometric
Design of Highways and Streets, published by the American Association of State
Highway Transportation Officials, most recent edition, or PennDOT standards,
whichever is more restrictive. In addition, the following standards and
guidelines shall be complied with:

      C.   Curve-tangent relationships shall follow accepted engineering
guidelines for safety and efficiency. For example, minimum radius curves shall
not be used at the ends of long tangents.
      D.   Street grades shall be measured along the centerline in accordance
with the following:
         (1)   Minimum grade for all streets shall be 1 percent.
         (2)   Maximum grades for arterials and collectors shall be 5 percent
and for residential streets shall be 10 percent.
         (3)   Curve-grade combinations shall follow accepted engineering
guidelines for safety and efficiency. For example, minimum-radius horizontal
curves will not be permitted in combination with maximum grades.
         (4)   At all approaches to intersections, street grades shall not
exceed 4 percent for a minimum distance of 50 feet from the intersection of
curblines or edges of cartways.

         (5)   Street shall be designed to provide a minimum K value of 25.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, §422)
§ 22-424.   Street Intersection Design.
   All street intersections shall be governed by the standards of this Section
and Telford’s Engineering Standards.
      A.   Number of Streets. Not more than two streets shall intersect at the
same point.
      B.   Angle of Intersections.
         (1)   All intersection approaches shall be designed at 90 degree
angles for a minimum of 50 feet from the edge of the cartway of the road
intersection road unless sufficient reason exists to justify a lesser angle.
         (2)   Where angled intersections are used it is preferable to design
them so that the heavier traffic flow will make the obliquely angled turn
rather than the acutely angled turn.
      C.   Improvements to Existing Intersections. When existing streets
intersect at odd angles or have more than four approaches, the applicant shall
improve the intersection, to bring it into compliance with this Chapter, as
required by the Borough Council, who shall first seek the advice of the Telford
Borough Engineer and Planning Commission and other technical advisors or
agencies, as appropriate. For State and County highways, improvements shall
comply with the requirements of the appropriate agency.
      D.   Waiver of Improvements. The Borough Council may waive the above
requirements for improvements under one or more of the following conditions:
         (1)   When changes made on the applicant’s land will not improve the
intersections deficiencies.
         (2)   When other road improvements are already planned which would
correct the problem without changes required of the applicant.
         (3)   When not required by PennDOT where the intersections are under
their jurisdiction.
      E.   Approaches to Intersections. Approaches to intersections shall
follow a straight course for a minimum of 50 feet for local roads. All other
streets shall follow a straight course in accordance with accepted engineering
standards, but in no case less than 50 feet. Measurement shall be made from the
intersection of curblines or edges of cart-ways for each corner.
      F.   Single-Access Street Intersections.
         (1)   Intersections with single access shall be designed with the
single access street extending as a side street from the through street.
         (2)   Four-way intersections may be created using two permanent single
access streets intersecting directly opposite one another along a through
street, when the through street is a local access street.
      G.   All intersections shall provide clear sight distance in compliance
with PennDOT standards.
      H.   Street intersection spacing shall be in compliance with the
regulations contained in this Section, measured from centerline to centerline.
         (1)   The applicant shall prepare a vehicular access analysis for all
street intersections proposed along arterial and collectors.
         (2)   The spacings listed in
Figure 22-4-5 shall be considered minimum spacings. Where greater spacing is
required in compliance with AASHTO or PennDOT standards, the greater spacing
distances shall be applied, as determined by the Telford Borough Engineer, in
relation to the vehicular access analysis.
         (3)   Offset Intersections. In any case where the centerlines of
street intersections are, or would be, within 150 feet of each other, they
shall be made to coincide by relocating the street within the applicant’s land,
unless additional problems of sight distance or other safety-related problems
would be created. As an alternative, relocation further away from the offset
intersection may be done in compliance with the intersection spacing
requirements contained herein, when approved by the Borough Council.
         (4)   Street intersections with major collectors shall be spaced a
minimum of 500 feet apart.
         (5)   Street intersections with minor collectors shall be spaced a
minimum of 350 feet apart.
         (6)   Street intersections with local roads shall be spaced a minimum
of 300 feet apart.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 423)
§ 22-425.   Single-Access Street Regulations.
   Any street which is served by only one intersection with a through-street
shall be considered a single-access street, regardless of the street’s
configuration within the proposed subdivision or land development.
      A.   Single-access streets shall be classified as one of the following:
         (1)   Cul-de-sac streets.
         (2)   Single-access loop streets.
         (3)   Stub streets.
      B.   Single-access loop streets shall be subject to the requirements for
their classification of street, notwithstanding their single-access status.
         (1)   Shall not serve more than 20 dwelling units.
         (2)   In addition to required sidewalks, shall be served by an
appropriately located pedestrian accessway when required by the Borough Council
to connect surrounding neighborhoods and pedestrian destinations.
      C.   The Borough Council may request the applicant to provide a permanent
easement for snow removal. The easement shall have a minimum length along the
right-of-way line of 40 feet and a depth of 15 feet. When curbing is required,
a curb depression shall also be placed in this easement area. No shrubbery,
fence, mailbox or any other obstruction shall be placed within the easement to
hinder the placement of the snow.
      D.   Single-access loop streets shall not under any circumstances exceed
1,200 feet in length, measured from the intersection with the through street,
along the entire centerline around to its intersection with itself.
      E.   Cul-de-sac Streets.
         (1)   Shall be permanently closed to vehicular traffic at one end.
         (2)   Shall be identified by a standard warning sign stating “No
Outlet” when deemed appropriate by the Borough Council to help avoid mistaken
turning movements.
         (3)   Shall not be permitted when a through street is possible for the
tract under consideration. All cul-de-sacs must be approved by the Borough
Council, with the Borough of Telford reserving the right to reject any and all
cul-de- sacs proposed. The following shall be used to determine the necessity
of the cul-de-sac:
            (a)   Adverse topography such as steep slopes, floodplain, streams,
etc.
            (b)   The shape of the tract does not lend itself to a through
street.
         (4)   Shall be a minimum of 250 feet but not exceed 500 feet in
length. Measurement of the length shall be made from the centerline of the
abutting through road or point of intersection with another cul-de-sac to the
centerline of the turnaround, measured along the cul-de-sac street’s
centerline.
         (5)   Shall be provided with a vehicular turnaround at the closed end
with a right-of-way radius of at least 60 feet, and a paving radius of at least
50 feet. Alternative vehicular turnaround designs are encouraged to improve
traffic flow and overall design of the subdivision, but must be approved by the
Borough’s Engineer and Fire Marshal. If an off-set bulb turnaround is used, the
left side bulb configuration is preferable. In addition, parking is prohibited
on the cul-de-sac by order of the Fire Marshal.
         (6)   No more than four lots shall have frontage on the circular
turnaround portion of a cul-de-sac street, and no more than four driveways
shall have access to the circular turnaround portion.
         (7)   Shall not extend from a single-access loop street.
         (8)   Existing temporary cul-de-sacs and rights-of-way located on
adjacent parcels, whether improved or not, shall be used by the developer to
tie in their proposed roadway system. It shall be the responsibility of the
developer of the tract to complete all roadway improvements at his/her expense
within the existing rights-of-way of adjacent parcels to service his/her tract.
         (9)   Shall be served by an appropriately located and constructed
emergency accessway when required by the Borough Council using the following
standards:
            (a)   Minimum cartway width shall be 18 feet.
            (b)   Shall be reviewed and approved by the Borough’s Fire
Marshall.
            (c)   Pavement shall satisfy the standards of the Telford Borough
Engineer.
            (d)   When not paved, the cartway shall be constructed of crushed
stone of appropriate size, depth and compaction to support the largest Borough
fire trucks under all weather conditions. Placed on top of the 6 inches of
crushed stone and shall be an interlinked porous pavement constructed of fiber
reinforced polyethylene or concrete grass pavers. All void areas shall be
filled with topsoil and seeded with an appropriate grass mix.
            (e)   Markings or appropriate form of identification shall be
placed at the entrance to the emergency access way. If necessary, breakaway
bollards shall be installed at each end of the emergency access way.
            (f)   Emergency access ways shall be maintained through properly
recorded easements or deed restrictions which at a minimum prohibit the
planting of any vegetation except grass within the access way.
            (g)   May be made available for pedestrian access.
         (10)   Landscaped cul-de-sac islands are encouraged and shall conform
to the following standards.
            (a)   Shall be located within the bulb of a cul-de-sac and be
concave for use as part of the stormwater management infrastructure. Efforts
should be made to retain the existing vegetation on the site within these
islands.
            (b)   Shall have a maximum radius of 24 feet and be surrounded by
paving on all sides.
            (c)   Shall be designed to allow for emergency vehicle access into
the cul-de-sac.
            (d)   In the event that right-of-way grading will not permit the
retention of existing vegetation in a cul-de-sac, the landscaping proposed for
the island shall be of low-maintenance varieties as approved by the Borough
Council. The landscaping plan shall specifically describe the maintenance
required for any landscaping proposed on the landscape island and it is to be
maintained by one of the lot owners or the community association approved by
Borough Council.
         (11)   Drainage of cul-de-sac streets shall preferably be toward the
open end. If drainage is toward the closed end, water shall be conducted away
in an underground storm sewer or other means approved by the Borough. The grade
of the outer diameter of the turnaround shall not exceed 4 percent.
      F.   Stub Streets.
         (1)   Shall be provided in appropriate locations for vehicular access
to abutting undeveloped lands when required by the Borough Council, upon advice
of the Telford Borough Planning Commission and Engineer.
         (2)   Shall not be longer than:
            (a)   The depth of one building lot abutting the collector street.
            (b)   The width of two building lots abutting the stub street.
         (3)   Shall be provided with a vehicular turnaround.
         (4)   Shall be constructed to the property line in accordance with the
standards of this Chapter applicable to the classification of streets it will
be upon extension.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 424)
§ 22-426.   Roadway Improvements.
   1.   All adjacent structures and areas disturbed or damaged during
construction shall be properly repaired, restored or replaced to the
satisfaction of the Borough of Telford by the party causing the damage.
   2.   All trees, roots, stumps, brush, down timber, wood, rubbish and any
objectionable material shall be removed from the full legal right-of-way, or as
approved by the Telford Borough Engineer. Efforts shall be made during
construction of roadways to preserve any vegetation specifically for
preservation identified in the landscaping plan.
   3.   Paving. The pavement of all streets and all commercial, industrial and
multi- family parking areas and driveways into and out of parking areas shall
be installed as shown on the final plan and in accordance with the following
standards:
      A.   General. All paving shall be constructed both as to materials and
methods, generally in conformance with applicable portions of PennDOT
Specifications Publication 408, latest edition.

vehicular trips per day, based on trip generation standards.
   2.   The Telford Borough Planning Commission shall review the proposal in
accordance with the procedures of Part 3 of this Chapter.
   3.   Following evaluation by the Telford Borough Planning Commission, the
applicant may submit plans to the state or Telford Borough for formal review
and, as appropriate, approval and issuance of permits.
   4.   No driveway location, classification or design shall be considered
finally approved by the Borough of Telford unless permits have been granted by
the State and/or Borough and preliminary plan approval has been granted by the
Borough Council for the subdivision and/or land development which the driveway
(s) will serve.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 426)
§ 22-428.   Driveway Intersections.

   3.   Driveway intersections serving individual parcels of land may be
prohibited by the Borough Council where such intersections would create
congestion, interference and/or hazards to traffic flow and safety by reason of
street grades, land forms, vegetation, frequency of driveway intersections,
limited sight distances and/or high speed traffic flow. In such cases, the
Borough Council may permit reasonable alternative forms of vehicular access to
the parcel of land by means of:
      A.   Marginal access streets or driveways.
      B.   Reverse frontage lotting.
      C.   Other means which are legally and technically suitable in the
opinions of the Borough Solicitor and Engineer.
   4.   Where driveway intersections are prohibited by the Borough Council and
alternative forms of vehicular access would cause an undue burden upon an
applicant, the Borough Council may permit an alternative interim access
solution in compliance with the following:
      A.   It is the safest feasible alternative, acceptable to the Telford
Borough Engineer and/or PennDOT.
      B.   Suitable provisions are made for a preferable permanent access
solution, consistent with subsection .3, above, including legal agreements to
enable implementation of the permanent solution.
   5.   Distance from Street Intersections. Driveways shall be located as far
from street intersections as is reasonably possible but in no case less than 40
feet.
   6.   Choice of Streets. When streets of different classes are involved, the
driveway shall provide access to the street of lesser classification unless
this requirement is waived by the Borough Council for reasons of sight
distance, incompatibility of traffic, grading, drainage or other major reasons.
   7.   Stopping Areas. Regardless of the driveway classification, all
driveways shall be provided with a stopping area within which the grade shall
not exceed 6 percent. The stopping area shall be measured as follows:
      A.   The length of stopping area shall be a minimum of 20 feet, or the
length of the longest vehicles anticipated to use the driveway, whichever is
greater.
      B.   Stopping areas shall be measured from the cartway line for all
streets.
   8.   Maximum Grades for Driveways.
      A.   Residential driveways shall not exceed 10 percent grade.
      B.   All other driveways shall not exceed 7 percent grade.
      C.   All driveways shall be provided with a stopping area within which
the grade shall not exceed 4 percent.
      D.   Maximum grade requirements shall not be waived unless extremely
difficult circumstances exist and cannot be mitigated by alternative locations,
designs or lotting, in which case a safe, practical alternative may be
permitted by the Borough Council, upon recommendation of the Telford Borough
Engineer.
   9.   Sight Distance Determinations. Determination of sight distances at
intersections of new driveways and streets with existing Borough roads shall be
in accordance with the following provisions.
      A.   Access driveways shall be located at a point within the property
frontage limits which provides at least the minimum safe stopping sight
distance (SSSD), as determined by the standards within 67 Pa.Code, Chapter 441,
“Access to and Occupancy of Highways by Driveways and Local Roads.
      B.   If the minimum required SSSD’s cannot be achieved, the Borough may
exercise one or more of the following options:
         (1)   Prohibit left turns by exiting vehicles.
         (2)   Restrict turning movements to right turns in and out of a
driveway.
         (3)   Require installation of a right turn acceleration lane or
deceleration lane.
         (4)   Require installation of a separate left turn standby lane.
         (5)   Alter the horizontal or vertical geometry of the roadway.
         (6)   Deny access to the road.
   10.   All driveways shall be at least 5 feet from any side or rear lot line.
Common use of driveways by adjacent landowners is encouraged and, in case of a
common driveway, this requirement does not apply.
   11.   For properties abutting streets, the following standards shall apply
to the driveway apron at the street line:
      A.   Minimum curb cut or driveway width at the street line: 10 feet.
      B.   Maximum curb cut or driveway width at the street line: 20 feet.
   12.   The minimum width shall be 10 feet for single family residential
dwellings. The minimum width shall be 16 feet for single-family residential
dwellings serving more than four dwelling units and for all other
nonresidential uses the minimum width shall be 20 feet for two-way traffic and
12 feet for one-way traffic.
   13.   Driveways shall be subject to review and approval by the Borough Fire
Marshall.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 427)
§ 22-429.   Bridges and Culverts.
   1.   Bridges and culverts under any vehicular accessway or road shall be
designed to meet current PennDOT Standards to support expected loads and to
pass the 100- year design stormwater flows. They shall be constructed to the
full width of the planned right-of-way. Allowance for sidewalk must also be
made.
   2.   Where County-owned roads or bridges are involved, the County Engineer
must review and approve all proposals.
   3.   It is unlawful to construct any dam or other water obstruction, or to
make any change in or addition to, any existing water obstruction, or in any
manner change or diminish the course, current or cross-section of any stream or
body of water, without first having made written application to and obtained a
permit or consent in writing from PADEP.
   4.   The following information is required. Drawings to include location
plan; cross- section of present bridge if one exists; profile of stream for a
reasonable distance above and below bridge site, showing slopes of bed, normal
water surface and flood water surface. If the bridge is on a skew, give the
angle of the center line of the bridge with the direction of the line of flow.
In addition, the following information is required for new bridge construction:
the total drainage area above the bridge site; description of watershed; length
of stream from source to bridge site and to the mouth; character of stream bed
and banks; extent and depth of overflow during floods; effect of previous
floods upon bridges, their span and clearance; whether bridge will be within
backwater influence of parent stream.
   5.   A complete set of structural computations and drawings shall be
submitted with plans involving construction of bridges and culverts.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 428)
§ 22-430.   Street Names.
   1.   Street Names. Street names shall be approved by the Borough of Telford.
Street names should bear a reasonable relationship to significant natural
features or history of the community. Efforts should be made to reduce the
occurrence of similar names or similar sounding names within the Borough of
Telford or postal delivery area.
   2.   Street Signs. The developer shall erect at every intersection a street
sign or street signs having thereon the names of the intersecting streets. At
intersections where streets cross, there shall be at least two such street
signs and at the intersections where one street ends or joins another street,
there shall be at least one sign. Street signs shall be erected when the first
dwelling on the street is occupied. Temporary street signs may be erected with
the permission of the Borough Council. Any temporary signs shall be replaced
prior to roadway dedication. Street signs must have 6-inch white letters on a
green background and meet PennDOT reflectivity standards.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 429)
§ 22-431.   Parking and Related Internal Driveways.
   Parking and related internal driveways shall be governed by the following
regulations.
      A.   General.
         (1)   The specific purposes to be served by these requirements are:
            (a)   To add visual character and improve the appearance of parking
areas by reducing their massiveness into smaller units.
            (b)   To integrate parking areas into the pedestrian circulation
system.
            (c)   To provide shade for parked cars and reduce heat islands,
stormwater runoff and air pollution.
            (d)   To reduce random vehicular flow across parking areas.
            (e)   To permit a high level of visibility for those uses for which
visibility is an important factor.
            (f)   To facilitate snow removal and storm drainage, and to
conserve energy in construction and resurfacing operations, by laying out the
paving surface with minimal obstructions.
         (2)   The terms “parking lot,” “parking area” and “parking” are
interchangeable. “Parking” includes the driveway which provides direct access
to the parking spaces.
         (3)   Off-street parking facilities shall be provided in compliance
with the parking requirements of the Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27] and the regulations contained therein.
         (4)   Angled parking shall not be permitted along public or private
streets or within parking lots, except where specifically permitted by this or
other ordinances. Perpendicular parking shall not be permitted along public or
private streets unless approved by Borough Council.

the entrance(s) or exit(s) to parking areas with a capacity of 50 cars or more.
A minimum driveway length of 50 feet shall be provided between the road
ultimate right-of-way line and the first parking space or internal driveway
intersection for those parking areas with a capacity of 50 cars or more and 20
feet for all other parking areas.
         (2)   Parking areas shall be set back from tract boundary lines and
ultimate right-of-way lines in compliance with the requirements of the Zoning
Ordinance [
Chapter 27]. In any case not regulated by the Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27], parking areas shall not be located closer than 15 feet from any
tract boundary line and 10 feet from any legal right-of-way line.
         (3)   Where the edge of an existing parking area is located close to a
street, driveway or other parking area and the property is proposed for
subdivision and/or land development, a minimum separation of 10 feet shall be
provided between these features unless a shared parking or cross access
arrangement is proposed. This spacing shall consist of a landscaped area with
planting in conformance with §
22-434.5, herein.
         (4)   Dead-ended parking areas shall be discouraged when the required
parking capacity can be accommodated in a layout that permits more convenient
vehicular movements. However, extraneous through-traffic flow should be
avoided.
            (a)   Up to 30 parking spaces may also be located in a dead-ended
parking area if there is no more desirable alternative feasible and sufficient
back-up areas provided for the end stalls.
            (b)   More than 30 parking spaces may be located in a dead-ended
parking area only if a turnaround area is provided at the closed end, suitable
for passenger car turning. The turnaround area may be circular, “T” or “Y”
shaped, or other configuration acceptable to the Borough Council.
         (5)   Parking spaces designed for the exclusive use by disabled
persons shall be installed in all parking lots as close and convenient to
building entrances as is reasonable. The specific number and locations of
handicapped stalls shall be in conformance with the Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA).
         (6)   Provisions for pedestrian safety within a parking lot shall be
required by providing sidewalks and delineated crosswalks.
         (7)   It is encouraged that parking areas be constructed of porous
pavement or other materials besides stone or gravel that allow for the
infiltration of stormwater.
         (8)   Planting islands shall be constructed within all parking lots
with more than 12 spaces based on the following standards:
            (a)   One planting island shall be provided for every 10 parking
stalls. There shall be no more than 10 continuous parking stalls in a row
without a planting island.
            (b)   Alternative planting islands (without planting islands
located every 10 parking stalls) must provide one canopy tree for every 10
parking stalls in planting island areas and perimeter parking planting areas at
the discretion of the Borough Council.
            (c)   The ends of all parking rows shall be divided for driving
lanes by planting islands.
            (d)   Planting islands shall be a minimum of 9 feet by 20 feet in
area. Unless designed to function as part of the stormwater management system,
planting islands shall be underlain by soil mounded up to 6 inches minimum
above the paved parking or drive area and shall be protected by curbs or wheel
stops.
         (9)   Parking lots with more than 12 stalls shall require planting
strips around the entire perimeter of the parking lot except where buildings,
driveways, and walkways are located.
         (10)   Unless otherwise described in this Chapter, where required, all
planting strips shall be a minimum of 10-feet wide and run the length of the
parking row. Unless designed to function as part of the stormwater management
system, planting strips shall be underlain by soil mounded up to 6 inches above
the paved parking or drive area and shall be protected by curbs, wheel stops or
bollards.
      C.   Parking Area Dimensions.
         (1)   Parallel parking stalls shall have minimum dimensions of 9 feet
by 22 feet.
         (2)   Perpendicular parking stalls shall have minimum dimensions of 9
feet by 20 feet.
         (3)   At the discretion of the Borough Council the minimum length of
perpendicular parking stalls may be reduced by 1 foot if stalls are designed to
allow vehicles to overhang an area of grass or other pervious surface. Bumper
stops shall be provided which allow the parked vehicle to extend at least 1
foot over the edge of the pavement.
         (4)   Where parking stalls abut sidewalks, parked vehicles shall not
overhang the sidewalks unless the sidewalk is widened by 2 feet. Wheel stops
are encouraged in order to allow for full pedestrian use of the sidewalks.
         (5)   Parking spaces for physically disabled persons shall be equal in
depth to the spaces abutting them and in accordance with standards developed
under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
         (6)   Drive aisles for two-way traffic shall be a minimum of 22 feet
in width and drive aisles for one-way traffic shall be a minimum of 12 feet in
width.
      D.   Residential Parking Lots.
         (1)   Parallel rows of parking spaces, which are not separated by a
driveway, shall be separated by a planting strip.
         (2)   A single row of parking spaces located parallel to and between
two driveways, shall be separated from one of the driveways by a planting
strip, a minimum of 8 feet wide.
         (3)   Large parking lots shall be divided into smaller parking areas
of no more than 40 stalls by planting strips.
         (4)   No less than 20 feet of open area shall be provided between the
curb line of any parking area and the outside wall of the dwelling unit.
      E.   Nonresidential Parking Lots.
         (1)   Parking lots with a capacity from 41 to 100 cars shall require a
planting strip around the perimeter and one planting island for every 10 spaces
within the perimeter of the lot.
         (2)   Parking lots for more than 100 cars shall be divided into
sections no greater than 100 stalls each by planting strips.
            (a)   These planting strips shall be located parallel to the rows
of parking, to serve the following purposes:
               1)   To separate main access (entrance-exit) driveways from rows
of parking spaces.
               2)   To separate other major driveways (service drives, general
internal circulation) from rows of parking spaces.
               3)   To separate large parking areas into smaller units at
intervals of not more than four rows of parking stalls.
            (b)   For parking areas with an ultimate capacity greater than 400
cars, the requirements may be modified by the Borough Council to provide
separation into units at intervals of six rows of parking stalls, with each
unit capacity no greater than 100 cars.
            (c)   The applicant may request the Borough of Telford to permit an
alternative design which achieves the purposes of these parking area
requirements as well or better than the requirements herein. The final decision
to permit an alternative design shall be made by the Borough Council, with the
advice of the Telford Borough Planning Commission and Engineer.
         (3)   Shared Access. Applicants are strongly encouraged to create
agreements for shared vehicular access as the preferred means of reducing the
total number of curb cuts, for traffic safety and congestion reasons.
Figure 22-4-10 illustrates one generalized example of this concept.
            (a)   Lots shall provide cross-access easements for parking areas
and access driveways guaranteeing access to adjacent lots. Interconnections
shall be logically placed and easily identifiable to ensure convenient traffic
flow.
            (b)   When two or more abutting lots share an access driveway, the
driveway should be designed as the main access to those lots and one or more
existing access driveways should then be closed.
            (c)   Where development of three or more adjoining parcels
consolidates vehicular access into one shared driveway, that driveway may be
upgraded into a medium volume driveway according to PennDOT standards.
            (d)   Shared access may be located entirely on one lot or be split
among a common lot line.
            (e)   Access easement and maintenance agreements or other suitable
legal mechanisms shall be provided, acceptable to the Borough Council in
consultation with the Telford Borough Solicitor.

            (f)   Liability safeguards for all property owners and lessees
served by the shared access shall be guaranteed to the satisfaction of the
Borough Council in consultation with the Telford Borough Solicitor.
      F.   Driveways Within Sites Proposed for Nonresidential Development. The
following requirements apply to all driveways within all sites proposed for
land development.
         (1)   A smooth transition shall be provided between the driveway
section required for access to a public street and the driveway(s) required for
internal site circulation.
         (2)   Main access driveways (entrance-exit), and service driveways
handling large trucks shall be a minimum paved width of 30 feet, with one lane
in each direction, unless otherwise required by PennDOT standards governing the
volume of traffic anticipated.
         (3)   Interior storefront driveways in shopping centers shall be a
minimum paved width of 28 feet, to allow one lane in each direction and a drop-
off/pick- up lane along the sidewalks.
         (4)   Driveways along other nonresidential buildings shall be a
minimum paved width of 22 feet, except where a drop-off/pick-up lane is
proposed.
         (5)   Parking aisles shall be a minimum 22 feet wide with two-way
traffic flow for convenience and efficiency.
         (6)   Wherever feasible, internal circulation driveways shall extend
from access drives in locations which permit and encourage entering traffic to
turn and enter the parking aisles without first traveling along a building-
front driveway. This feature is intended to reduce the volume of vehicular
traffic along building-front driveway to make it safer for pedestrian traffic.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 430)
§ 22-432.   Curbing.
   Curbing shall be installed along all existing and proposed public and
private streets, common driveways and parking lots.
      A.   General.
         (1)   Regardless of small size of a land development or subdivision
proposal, curbs shall be required along all existing and proposed public
streets within the right-of-way, private streets, common driveways and parking
lots.
         (2)   When utilizing an approved stormwater management technique, the
Borough Council may waive curbing requirements in full or partially. Grass
swales and infiltration trenches along streets are encouraged in appropriate
locations in the Borough of Telford provided that pedestrian safety and traffic
circulation is addressed.
         (3)   If for any reason an interim waiver of these requirements is
made, a sufficient guaranty shall be posted for the eventual installation of
curbing, subject to approval by the Borough Council upon recommendation of the
Telford Borough Engineer and Solicitor, in accordance with paragraph .A(4) of
this Section.
         (4)   Curb Construction. All curbing shall be constructed both as to
materials and methods, generally in conformance with applicable portions of
PennDOT Specifications Publication 408, current edition. Curbs shall be
vertical profile with a minimum of 18 inch structure height. Expansion joints
shall be placed every 30 feet, at structures and at the end of the day’s work.
Concrete curb shall have contraction joints that shall be saw cut every 10 feet
at a minimum of 2 inches. Concrete shall be a minimum 4,500 psi in compression
strength.
         (5)   Intersections where sidewalks are provided shall be in
compliance with Americans with Disabilities Act and contain two separate curb
ramps (one curb ramp per crossing direction) at each roadway intersection
corner.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 431)
§ 22-433.   Survey Monuments.
   1.   Permanent monuments shall be indicated on the record plan. All
monuments shall be constructed of precast concrete or durable stone with metal
insert(s), and be 4 inches square with at least 36 inches extending below
ground level, or an alternate design approved by the Borough Council. Street
right-of-way reference monuments shall be located on the right-of-way lines at
corners, angle points, beginning and end of curves, and as otherwise required
by the Telford Borough Engineer for all new and existing streets. They shall be
placed after a new street and/or lot grading has been completed. Certified
copies of this reference information shall be given to both the Telford Borough
Engineer and the Telford Borough Office. When final easement grading has been
completed and before the issuance of occupancy permits, permanent monuments
shall be set by the subdivider, developer or builder, at all easement corners
and angle points, and at all street intersections and intermediate points as
may be required. Security may be required by the Borough of Telford at the time
of plan approval if the monuments have not already been set.
   2.   Lot Pin Requirements. All lots upon which construction is planned shall
be temporarily staked or pinned, or permanently monumented and certified to
such by a registered surveyor for the owner, subdivider, builder or developer,
before issuance of a building permit. A signed certificate of compliance must
be submitted with a building permit application. Temporary stakes or pins with
a surveyor’s ribbon attached may be acceptable on existing lots where
construction of an accessory building or an addition to the primary structure
is proposed, only if construction is begun within 30 days of the certificate of
compliance date. Temporary stakes or pins shall remain in place until witnessed
and accepted by the Telford Borough Building Inspector. Prior to final approval
of a new subdivision plan, all new lot corner markers shall be marked with a
minimum inch diameter metal pin extending at least 24 inches into the ground
and at least 1 inch revealed above the ground surface, or an equivalent metal
marker, approved by the Telford Borough Engineer.
   3.   Original Monuments. In situations where they may be of legal or
historical importance, the original monuments and marks must not be destroyed,
defaced, hidden or possibly confused by creating new monuments and marks unless
absolutely necessary, e.g.: the originals are decayed, destroyed or unsafe. In
some cases, to be determined by the Telford Borough Engineer, new monuments
should be set as a reference or witness to the original monument to avoid
disturbing the original. When in the opinion of the Telford Borough Engineer,
the angle point falls in a location that is not appropriate to set a concrete
monument, a written request for a waiver shall be submitted for consideration
by the Borough Council.
   4.   Bench Marks. The Borough elevations are based on the USGS datum.
Location and elevation is available to all Engineers and Surveyors upon request
to the Telford Borough Engineer’s Office. All contours and elevations shown on
the plan must be based on this system.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 432)
§ 22-434.   Landscaping and Plantings.
   1.   Required Landscaping Plan.
      A.   Applicants shall submit a landscaping plan as part of the
preliminary plan submission for all subdivisions and land developments, except
for residential subdivisions of three lots or less. The Borough Council may
seek the advice of a certified planting professional regarding compliance with
the ordinance standards.
      B.   For residential subdivisions of no more than three lots, a formal
landscaping plan is not required, but the applicant’s plans shall be required
to show compliance with the applicable planting requirements herein.
      C.   All subdivisions and land developments shall be laid out in such a
manner as to minimize the removal of healthy trees and shrubs. The following
guidelines shall be used in determining whether specific vegetation is to be
preserved or removed:
         (1)   A mature tree, tree masses or woodland shall remain only if it
meets the following criteria:
            (a)   The outermost branches of the tree are at least 5 feet from
any proposed buildings, structures, paving, parking or utilities-overhead or
underground.
            (b)   The outermost branches of the tree or trees are at least 5
feet from any proposed changes in grade or drainage, such as, excavations,
mounding or impoundments.
            (c)   The tree or trees are clear of any existing or proposed clear
sight triangles, and do not by their location or apparent health pose any undue
threat to the health, safety and welfare of community.
         (2)   It shall be the responsibility of the applicant, to demonstrate
that existing vegetation removal is minimized by showing that no alternative
layouts are possible, and that no alternative clearing or grading plan would
reduce the loss of mature trees, tree masses and woodlands.
         (3)   Each freestanding mature tree, tree mass, or woodland on the
site shall be designated “TO REMAIN” or “TO BE REMOVED.” Mature trees, tree
masses or woodlands must remain unless they are required to be removed.
         (4)   Tree Replacement Planting Requirements.
            (a)   Size Requirements. Any permitted removals (those listed “to
be removed”) of trees with 6 inches dbh or greater must be replaced with one or
more trees whose total trunk diameter (measured by caliper as nursery stock)
equals the total inches in dbh of the tree(s) removed.
            (b)   Replacement trees shall be planted on the site to mitigate
for the existing trees removed, in addition to other landscaping requirements.
Proposed replacement tree plantings shall be listed on the plan.
            (c)   If the site does not reasonably contain enough room for the
required replacement trees, the Borough Council may allow the developer to
locate some or all of the replacement trees on public lands or accept an
equivalent fee-in-lieu of plantings, at their discretion.
            (d)   Calculation and estimation of existing trees shall be
performed before any clearing commences and shall be documented on the plan.
            (e)   Calculation and estimation of the existing trees remaining
after construction shall be performed and compared with the calculations of the
approved plan. Any tree removals additional to those on the approved plan shall
be replaced as required by this Section prior to the issuing of any occupancy
permits.
      D.   Existing vegetation to remain shall be identified in the field prior
to any clearing and physically protected during construction. A temporary
physical barrier such as a wooden snow fence shall be erected a minimum of 1
foot outside the dripline on all sides of individual trees, tree masses and
woodlands prior to clearing and construction. The barrier shall be placed to
prevent disturbance to or compaction of soil inside the barrier, and shall
remain until construction is complete.
      E.   Mature trees or individual trees from woodlands or tree masses that
are to be removed may be transplanted with a tree spade from one area of the
site to another. The transplanted trees must be replanted in accordance with
standard practices of guying and be on the Recommended Plant Material List.
      F.   It is recommended that trees to be preserved near developed portions
of a site are pruned and fertilized prior to beginning of construction in order
to ensure their health.
   2.   Buffers and Screens. Buffer plantings shall be installed in
subdivisions and land developments to integrate new developments with
surroundings, to separate incompatible land uses by providing screening, and to
minimize or eliminate views to certain site elements.
      A.   Buffer plantings shall be required for the following types of
development and as otherwise specified in the Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27]:
         (1)   All nonresidential development.
         (2)   All single-family detached development over five units.
         (3)   All residential infill development.
         (4)   All multi-family and single-family attached development.
         (5)   Construction of any of the following items which exceeds 2,500
square feet in ground coverage:
            (a)   Public utility facilities or structures.
            (b)   Waste collection, storage and/or treatment facilities.
            (c)   Any other structure of similar character or impact.
      B.   An on-site investigation by the applicant shall determine the
adjacent land uses along each property boundary. In the case of vacant land,
the permitted zoning uses shall be used. The existing or zoned uses shall be
noted on the plan. In the case of several permitted uses on a site, the most
restrictive landscaping requirements shall apply. The Borough of Telford shall
have final approval of interpretation of land uses or Zoning Map.
      C.   Buffer Area Location and Dimensions.
         (1)   A buffer planting area of not less than 10 feet in width shall
be established along all property lines and external street boundaries of the
site proposed for subdivision or land development, unless otherwise specified
in the Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27].
         (2)   Unless otherwise specified in the Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27] the buffer area may be included within the front, side or rear yard
setback.
         (3)   The buffer area shall be a continuous pervious planting area
consisting of tall canopy trees, small understory trees and shrubs, with grass
or groundcover. No paving shall be permitted within the buffer areas except for
driveway crossings and/or walkways.
         (4)   Parking is not permitted in the buffer area unless a shared
parking and/or access arrangement exists.
         (5)   Stormwater management facilities are permitted in the buffer
area provided that the visual screening requirement of the buffer is still met.
         (6)   Reverse frontage lots shall follow the requirements described in
§
22-404.5.
      D.   The minimum planting requirements shall be determined by the
intensity of the proposed land use and the adjacent land use, vacant land or
zoning district, according to Figure 22-4-11.

A All uses in office/limited industrial parks shall be considered office/
institutional uses.
B All mixed uses that have a residential component shall be considered
residential.
C All residential infill development adjacent to other residents shall be
screened pursuant to this category.
 
         (1)   Screening buffers must be adequate to visually screen the
proposed land use or development from off-site view. Several different planting
options could be used to create an effective buffer. Grading treatments and
architectural features, such as walls, fences and/or naturally undulating berms
may be necessary in addition to the minimum planting quantities in order to
effectively provide a visual screen. The sufficiency of the buffer shall be
determined by the Borough Council upon recommendation of the Telford Borough
Planning Commission.
         (2)   The limited area buffer can be used in older developed areas
where space for planting is severely restricted. The planting screen would be
equivalent to an evergreen hedge planting. Alternative planting arrangements,
such as shade or flowering trees with deciduous shrubs, could be considered in
conjunction with a fence or wall, at the discretion of the Borough Council.
      E.   Minimum Plant Material Requirements. In accordance with
Figure 22-4- 11, for every 100 linear feet of property line and external street
boundaries of the site proposed for subdivision or land development to be
buffered, the minimum quantities, types and sizes of plant material shown in
Figure 22-4-12 shall be required. These are minimum standards; additional plant
material, grading treatments or architectural elements may be included in the
plan, at the applicant’s discretion. Generalized illustrations of buffer types
are presented in
Figures 22-4-13 through
22-4-15. Species shall be selected from Appendix 22-A, Recommend Plant
Materials List.

      F.   Mitigation of Visual Impacts. The use of a screening buffer shall be
required to mitigate the adverse visual impacts which proposed land uses or
site elements will have on the subject tract, adjoining properties and the
community in general. In addition to the requirements for buffer plantings as
listed in
Figure 22-4-12, the following proposed land uses and site elements shall be
screened from off-site with a screening buffer:
         (1)   Dumpsters, trash disposal, recycling areas and mechanical
equipment.
         (2)   Service and loading docks.
         (3)   Outdoor storage areas.
         (4)   Sewage treatment plants and pump stations.
      G.   Plant material that has been classified as invasive, destructive or
is no longer recommended for use is prohibited. The plant material listed in
Appendix 22-B is not permitted in the Borough of Telford.
      H.   Existing healthy trees, shrubs or woodlands may be substituted for
part or all of the required plant material at the discretion of the Borough
Council. The minimum quantities and or visual effect of the existing vegetation
shall be equal to or exceed that of the required screen.
      I.   Existing topography, such as embankments or berms, may be
substituted for part or the entire required site element screen at the
discretion of the Borough Council. The minimum visual effect shall be equal to
or exceed that of the required screen.
      J.   The applicant may propose the use of alternative screen types or
changes in plant materials or designs which fulfill the intent of these
regulations with the approval of the Borough Council. Plant materials shall
meet the specifications in the Technical and Engineering Standards and plant
materials shall be from the List of Recommended Plant Material.
   3.   Street Trees.
      A.   Street trees shall be required:
         (1)   Along all existing streets when they abut or lie within the
proposed subdivision or land development except where existing trees serve to
meet the planting requirement.
         (2)   Along all proposed streets.
         (3)   Along access driveways which serve two or more residential
dwelling units.
         (4)   Along access driveways that serve nonresidential properties.
         (5)   Along major walkways through parking lots and between
nonresidential buildings.
      B.   Street trees shall be located between the ultimate right-of-way line
and the building setback line, and shall meet these standards.
         (1)   Trees shall be planted at a rate of at least one tree per 40
linear feet of frontage or fraction thereof. Trees shall be distributed along
the entire frontage of the property.
         (2)   Trees shall be planted a minimum distance of 5 feet and a
maximum distance of 10 feet from the ultimate right-of-way line. However, in
certain cases, as follows, the Borough Council may permit trees to be planted
within the legal right-of-way:
            (a)   In areas where existing planting areas may already be located
within the legal right-of-way.
            (b)   In cases where closely spaced rows of street trees may be
desirable and future street widening is considered unlikely.
         (3)   In nonresidential developments, trees shall be located within a
planting area within the front yard setback, at least 10 feet in width, planted
in grass or ground cover. In areas where wider sidewalks are desirable, or
space is limited, tree planting pits may be used.
         (4)   Trees shall be located so as not to interfere with the
installation and maintenance of sidewalks and utilities. Trees shall be planted
a minimum of 3 feet from curbs and sidewalks, 12 feet from overhead lines, and
6 feet from underground utilities.
         (5)   Tree species shall be selected from the list in Appendix 22-
A based on appropriate growth rates and mature heights for use beneath and
adjacent to overhead utility lines.
   4.   Trail and Pathway Landscaping.
      A.   A filtering buffer as described in
Figure 22-4-14 shall buffer the trail from adjacent land uses. Upon
recommendation of the Telford Borough Planning Commission, the Borough Council
may permit breaks in the filtering buffer where adjacent land uses do not
require a full buffer.

      B.   Trees and shrubs shall be setback 6 feet from the trail surface.
Figure
22- 4-16 illustrates a generalized concept of trail landscaping.
      C.   If not required as a visual buffer, evergreen trees shall not be
planted on the Southern side of the trail to allow for winter sun exposure. To
fulfill buffering requirements, evergreen trees shall be replaced by an equal
mix of canopy trees, understory trees, and shrubs of the size described in
Figure 22-4-12.
      D.   Entrances to trails and intersections between trails shall be
delineated with post and rail fencing or other suitable material.
   5.   Parking Lot Landscaping. All parking lots shall be designed according
to §
22- 431 and landscaped according to the following regulations.
      A.   Parking lots shall be effectively landscaped with trees and shrubs
to reduce the visual impact of glare, headlights and parking lot lights, to
delineate driving lanes, and to define rows of parking. Furthermore, parking
lots should be adequately landscaped to provide shade in order to reduce the
amount of reflected heat and to improve the aesthetics of parking lots.
      B.   All parking lots in the Borough of Telford with 10 or more stalls
shall be landscaped according to the following:
         (1)   One planting island shall be provided for every 10 parking
stalls. There shall be no more than 10 continuous parking stalls in a row
without a planting island.
         (2)   In residential developments, parking lots shall be divided into
smaller parking areas of no more than 40 parking stalls by planting strips.
         (3)   Planting strips shall be a minimum of 8 feet wide and run the
length of the parking row and shall be protected with curbing, wheel stops or
bollards, and planted with one canopy tree every 25 feet plus shrubs and/or
groundcover to cover the entire area at maturity. Species shall be selected
from
Appendix 22-A.
         (4)   Planting islands shall be a minimum of 9 feet by 18 feet in area
and shall be protected with curbing, wheel stops or bollards, and each planting
island shall contain at least one shade tree plus shrubs and/or groundcover to
cover the entire area.
         (5)   Planting strips and planting islands may contain stormwater
management facilities, such bioretention swales and rain gardens.
         (6)   The placement of light standard shall be coordinated with the
landscape design to avoid a conflict with the operation of light fixtures.
         (7)   Additional planting is encouraged and may include a variety of
ornamental trees, shrubs and ground covers, chosen from the list of plant
materials in
Appendix 22-A, provided that:
            (a)   At the ends of planting strips at driveway intersections,
drivers’ visibility shall be maintained by limited plantings within 35 feet of
the intersection.
            (b)   At the ends of planting strips between rows of parking
spaces, visibility shall be maintained by limited plantings within 20 feet of
the intersection.
            (c)   Limited planting shall mean:
               1)   Not more than one shade or canopy tree within the area.
               2)   No shrubs or ground cover plants exceeding 2 feet in
height.
               3)   No evergreen trees.
         (8)   Where perimeter landscaping is required, planting strips shall
be planted with a filtering buffer as per
Figure 22-4-14.
         (9)   Whenever a parking lot abuts a primary arterial street, it shall
be screened by a 4-foot tall fence constructed of wood, vinyl designed to look
like wood, brick, stone, stucco over concrete block (capped with brick, slate
or stone), or ornamental iron (or ornamental aluminum, steel, or vinyl designed
to look like iron) as consistent with local character. This will be in addition
to filtering buffer requirements. The design shall require the approval of the
Borough Council upon recommendation of the Telford Borough Planning Commission.
   6.   Additional Plantings.
      A.   All proposed nonresidential structures shall incorporate the
following minimum plant materials in the landscaping areas adjacent to the
proposed structure:
         (1)   One canopy tree (2-2½ inch minimum caliper) or two understory
trees (8 feet minimum height) shall be planted for every 50 feet of proposed
building facade facing a public street.
         (2)   Five deciduous or evergreen shrubs (18 inch minimum height)
shall be planted for every 20 feet of proposed building facade facing a public
street.
         (3)   Planting areas shall be a minimum 150 square feet with a minimum
10 foot width.
         (4)   A minimum of 25 percent of the area between the building facade
and the property frontage shall consist of pervious planting areas.
      B.   All proposed residential lots shall plant at least one canopy tree
per 10,000 square foot, or a portion thereof, of lot area. Existing trees to
remain may satisfy part or all of this planting requirement.
      C.   All proposed attached residential units shall plant a minimum of one
canopy tree for every two dwelling units.
      D.   At the discretion of the Borough Council, if sufficient planting
space is not available immediately adjacent to the proposed structure, required
building facade plantings may be located on the other areas of the tract.
   7.   Stormwater Basins and Associated Facilities. Landscaping shall be
required in and around all stormwater management basins according to the
following and as generally presented in
Figure 22-4-17.
      A.   All areas of stormwater management basins, including basin floors,
side slopes, berms, impoundment structures or other earth structures, shall be
planted with suitable vegetation such as naturalized meadow plantings
specifically suited for stormwater basins and as recommended in Appendix 22-A.
Landscape designs for the basin should require minimal overall maintenance.
         (1)   Trees and shrubs shall be planted around stormwater basins. A
minimum planting of two trees and 10 shrubs per 100 linear feet of basin
perimeter shall be planted around the basin. No woody vegetation shall be
planted within 30 feet of an outlet/drain structure, emergency spillway or
berm.
Figure 22-4-17 Stormwater Basin Landscaping
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/9565a0d7265d57d6baaa3e133757d0f2857f409f/
IMAGES/0-0-0-47.png]
 
         (2)   Naturalized ground cover plant species, such as native
wildflowers, meadows and nonaggressive grasses specifically designed for the
permanently wet, intermittently wet and usually dry areas of stormwater basins,
shall be seeded in the floors and slopes of the basin and meet the following
requirements:
            (a)   The plantings provide a satisfactory continuous cover that
acts to prevent erosion to all areas of the basin.
            (b)   The plantings do not interfere in the safe and efficient
function of the basin as determined by the Telford Borough Engineer.
         (3)   Mown turf grass is permitted only in the emergency spillway, on
top of berms, on outside face of berms, specified walking paths within the
basin, and access paths to allow maintenance of inflow and outflow structures.
Any other areas proposed for turf grass requiring regular mowing should be
approved by the Telford Borough Engineer.
            (a)   Areas of the naturalized basin containing lawn grass
(including top and outside berm) shall be sodded or hydro-seeded to minimize
erosion during the establishment period, and once established, these areas
shall be maintained at a height of not more than 6 inches.
      B.   Once established, a singular annual mowing of the meadow/naturalized
grass areas should be sufficient to maintain a wet meadow and/or basin floor.
Additional mowing/maintenance may be required to keep broadleaf weeds and woody
species from becoming established. A full description of basin maintenance
responsibilities should be included on the recorded subdivision plan and a
notation outlining the basin maintenance responsibilities of the basin owner
should be placed on the property deed.
      C.   Signage at basins to educate the public and/or designate the limits
of mowing is encouraged.
      D.   Low flow concrete channels are not permitted with stormwater
management facilities.
      E.   Stormwater basins shall be screened from adjacent properties using
the buffer plantings standards for a filtering buffer as described in
Figure 22-4-14.
   8.   Riparian Corridor Planting Requirements.
      A.   Existing trees within the riparian corridor shall be preserved and
retained. Existing tree cover should be surveyed and inventoried to assess the
need for any new plantings.
      B.   Planting Requirements.
         (1)   New trees shall be planted at a minimum rate of 15 feet on
center or one tree per 225 square feet in staggered rows or an equivalent
informal arrangement within the area defined as Zone One by the RCCD.
         (2)   New trees shall be a variety of sizes ranging from a minimum 4
to 5 foot branched whip to an approximate 1½ inch balled and burlapped planting
stock.
         (3)   New tree plantings shall be composed of native riparian tree
species.
         (4)   Tree plantings shall be located along the streambank to provide
shade for the stream, soil erosion control and stormwater benefits, according
to accepted streambank restoration practices.
   9.   Landscape Design Criteria.
      A.   Plantings shall be placed in arrangements and locations to best
mitigate the adverse impacts of proposed site development. The required plant
material shall be distributed over the entire length and width of any required
buffer area.
      B.   Plantings shall be spaced to comply with the visual mitigation
requirements with consideration given to the provision for the future growth
habits and mature sizes of selected plant species.
      C.   Plant species selection shall be based on the following
considerations:
         (1)   Existing site conditions and their suitability for the selected
plants based on the site’s soils, hydrology and microclimate.
         (2)   Specific functional objectives of the plantings which may
include but not be limited to visual screening, noise abatement, energy
conservation, wildlife habitat, erosion control, stormwater management and
aesthetic value.
         (3)   Maintenance and replacement considerations such as hardiness,
resistance to insects and disease, longevity, availability and cost of plant
materials.
         (4)   A minimum variety of tree species is required as follows:
 
Number of Trees Minimum Number of Tree Species Maximum Percent of Any One
                                               Species
0-5             1                              100 percent
6-15            2                              50 percent
16-30           3                              40 percent
31-50           4                              30 percent
51+             6                              20 percent
 
      D.   Existing healthy trees, shrubs or woodlands may be substituted for
part or all of the required plant material at the discretion of the Borough
Council. The minimum quantities and/or visual effect of the existing vegetation
shall be equal to or exceed that of the required buffer. In order for existing
vegetation to qualify for required buffer plantings, proof must be demonstrated
that adequate protection measures, particularly in the plant’s root zone, are
incorporated into the plan.
      E.   Plant materials shall meet the specifications of §
22-435, herein.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 433)
§ 22-435.   Plant Materials Specifications.
   1.   General Requirements.
      A.   The location, dimensions and spacing of required plantings should be
adequate for their proper growth and maintenance taking into account the sizes
of such plantings at maturity and their present and future environmental
requirements and tolerances including wind, moisture and sunlight.
      B.   Plantings should be selected and located where they will not
contribute to conditions hazardous to public safety. Such conditions include,
but are not limited to, public street rights-of-way, underground and above
ground utilities, and sight triangle areas required for unobstructed views at
street intersections.
   2.   Plant Specifications.
      A.   All plants shall meet the minimum standards for health, form and
root condition as outlined in the American Association of Nurserymen AAN
Standards.
      B.   All plant material shall be hardy and within the USDA hardiness Zone

be replaced. Substitutions for certain species of plants may be made with the
approval of Telford Borough.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 434)
§ 22-436.   Water Supply.
   1.   Applicants shall be in compliance with Part 16 of Telford Borough’s
Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27, Part 16] that provides standards and regulations relating to the
Borough’s Wellhead Protection Overlay.
   2.   Applicants shall provide a safe, reliable and adequate water supply
from public water service to support the intended uses approved as part of a
development plan. Applicants shall present evidence to the Borough Council that
the subdivision or land development is to be supplied by Telford Borough
Authority. Applicant needs evidence from Telford Borough Authority that they
are willing to provide said service.
   3.   Fire hydrants shall be located at accessible points throughout the
subdivision and shall be located according to the Telford Borough Engineer. As
a general rule, hydrants should be located at each street intersection and at
intermediate points as recommended by the State Insurance Services Office.
Generally hydrant spacing may range from 350 to 600 feet depending upon the
area being serviced. The type and methods of construction to be employed in the
installation of fire hydrants shall be in accordance with current State and
local regulations.
   4.   Public Water Supply Facilities Design. The design for public water
supply facilities shall be in accordance with PADEP Water Supply Manual. When
connecting to a public water supply system, the new system shall be built to
the same specifications of the existing system.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 435)
§ 22-437.   Waste Water Disposal.
   1.   Waste water from a subdivision or land development must be disposed of
in an environmentally safe manner. All sanitary sewers shall be installed and
connected to the Borough or authority sanitary sewer system following review of
plans and approval by PADEP and the Borough Authority. In areas not presently
served by central sanitary sewers, appropriate sewage disposal must be provided
in accordance with the regulations of PADEP and in addition, the installation
and capping of sanitary sewer mains and house connections may be required if
studies by the Borough Council indicate that extension of sanitary sewers to
serve the property subdivided appears probable or necessary to protect public
health. PADEP and both the Montgomery County and/or Bucks County Departments of
Health as may be appropriate shall approve the waste water disposal systems.
   2.   Wastewater Facilities Design Standards.
      A.   Sewage Facilities. The type of sewage facilities developed for a
particular site shall be based upon the recommendations of the Telford Borough
Sewage Facilities Plan developed in accordance with Act 537.
      B.   Sewage Facilities Design. The design and installation of domestic
sewage facilities shall be done in accordance with the Pennsylvania Domestic
Wastewater Facilities Manual prepared by PADEP and be compatible with Telford
Borough’s existing system.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 436)
§ 22-438.   Solid Waste Storage.
   Central trash storage and recyclable storage areas shall be developed as
follows:
      A.   Design.
         (1)   All trash collection equipment should be placed within
enclosures. Enclosures should be at least large enough to adequately contain
all trash and recyclable material containers. Generally, the sizing and type of
storage containers will depend upon the amount of trash and recyclables
expected to be generated in the buildings they service.
         (2)   Enclosures should be 6 feet high or at least 1 foot higher than
the proposed collection container.
         (3)   Enclosures should be made of durable material including masonry
blocks or steel reinforced wood fencing. In most cases, garden type fencing or
landscaping is not durable enough.
         (4)   The entrance to the enclosure should be at least 10 feet wide to
accommodate front loading trucks. Gates placed on the entrance should be
durable and equipped with piston type bolts to secure gates in both a closed
and open position.
         (5)   The trash storage area should be placed on a concrete pad. The
dimensions of the pad are dependent on the number and size of proposed
containers. Ideally, the pad should extend 6 to 10 feet in front of where the
proposed container is to be placed to support the front wheels of the trash
truck servicing the site. The area above the container should be free of
obstructions. Generally, a 15-foot clearance above the storage area is
sufficient.
      B.   Locations.
         (1)   In locating a trash storage area several objectives should be
balanced including spatial demands, distance from source of trash generation,
set back from adjoining property, and access for disposal trucks. Trash storage
may be placed near building service entrances or loading docks, but may not be
placed in any area used to satisfy parking or loading requirements. In
apartment or condominium complexes with centralized waste storage, containers
are may be located in an area which is convenient to each grouping of 10 to 15
units. Spatial consideration (i.e., loss of parking area or loading space) is
important.
         (2)   During the servicing of these containers (up to 5 minutes) it is
important that internal circulation at the site is not impeded. Trash
containers ideally should be within a building setback in a given zoning
district. At a minimum, they should be set back in accordance with accessory
structures.
      C.   Operations. Trash storage containers should be serviced at least
once a week. Recycling containers can be serviced at a less frequent interval.
If a dumpster contains food it should be serviced every 3 days. A storage
container should have tight fitting lids, secured at all times, and be leak
free. It should also be cleaned out at least two times a year.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 437)
§ 22-439.   Traffic Impact Study.
   1.   Purpose. The traffic impact study will enable the Borough of Telford to
assess the impact of the proposed development on the transportation system,
both highways and public transportation, in the Borough of Telford. Purpose of
the impact study is to insure that proposed developments do not adversely
affect the transportation network and to identify any traffic problems
associated with access between the site and the existing transportation
network. The study’s purpose is also to delineate solutions to potential
problems and to present improvements to be incorporated into the proposed
development. The study shall assist in the protection of air quality,
conservation of energy and encouragement of public transportation use.
   2.   A traffic impact study shall be prepared by a qualified traffic
engineer and/or transportation planner with previous traffic study experience.
Procedures and standards for a traffic impact study are as set forth herein.
Applicant may provide funds to the Borough of Telford to enable the Borough to
hire a traffic engineer of its choice to conduct the study, if this procedure
is deemed appropriate and approved by the Borough of Telford.
   3.   Applicability.
      A.   A traffic impact study shall be submitted as part of all
subdivision, land development and conditional use applications for all
residential subdivisions of 20 lots or more and all commercial, office,
industrial, institutional or other uses requiring land development approval.
      B.   The Borough Council, at its discretion, may require any other
subdivision or land development application to be accompanied by a traffic
impact study; provided, however, that the Borough Council notify the applicant
within 60 days following the Borough Council’s first meeting to consider the
proposal. Such a notification shall specify the reason for the requirement,
citing the proposal’s particular location or existing problems or type of use.
The Borough Council, at its discretion, may waive the requirement for a traffic
impact study. If required by the Borough Council, the developer of a land
development shall provide emergency signal preemption for any traffic signals
located within or immediately adjacent to the development. An application which
requires a traffic impact study shall not be considered complete until the
traffic impact study is submitted to the Borough of Telford in accordance with
the provisions of this Section.
   4.   Definitions.
      A.   Public Transportation. Transportation service for the general public
provided by a common carrier of passengers generally on a regular route basis,
or a private operator offering service to the public.
      B.   Study Area. This area will extend approximately ½ mile along the
adjacent roadways in all directions from all access points or the first major
intersection along these roadways. Where doubt exists, the traffic engineer
shall seek guidance from the Telford Borough Engineer prior to the submission
of the traffic impact study.
      C.   Major Intersection. Any intersection where traffic generated by the
proposal will have significant impact on the operation of the intersection and/
or any other intersection involving an arterial road. Where doubt exists, the
traffic engineer shall seek guidance from the Telford Borough Engineer prior to
the submission of the traffic impact study.
      D.   Volume/Capacity Analysis. This procedure compares the volume of a
roadway or intersection approach to its capacity (maximum number of vehicles
that can pass a given point during a given time period.) The procedures
described in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual or latest, Highway Research Board
Special Report 209, shall be followed.
      E.   Level of Service. Level of service, as described in the 2000 Highway
Capacity Manual, indicates how well traffic moves on a particular highway
facility or through a specific intersection. There are six levels of servicing
ranging from “A” through “F.” Level of Service “A” indicates generally free
movement. Level of Service “F” represents maximum capacity of the facility.
Level “F” indicates congestion. Level of Service “C” is considered the design
level of service, representing a stable traffic flow and a relatively
satisfactory travel speed.
      F.   Trip Generation Rates. The total count of trips to and from a study
site per unit of land use as measured by parameters such as dwelling units,
acres, etc.
      G.   Queue Analysis. This procedure includes the average queue and
maximum queue of vehicles which will be observed in each traffic stream and
intersection approach, measured in both feet and vehicles. Various statistical
and/ or computer models may be applied.
      H.   Warrants for Traffic Signal Installation. This is a series of
warrants which detail the minimum traffic or pedestrian volumes or other
criteria necessary for the installation of a traffic signal. These warrants are
contained in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and
Highways, U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration,
2003, as amended, or the most recent version, whichever is later.
      I.   Engineering and traffic studies shall be prepared in accordance with
67 Pa.Code, Chapter 201, “Engineering and Traffic Studies.”
   5.   General Requirements and Standards. A traffic impact study shall
contain the following information:
      A.   General Site Description. The site description shall include the
size, location, proposed land uses, construction staging and completion date of
the proposed subdivision or land development. If the development is
residential, types of dwelling units shall also be included. A brief
description of other major existing and proposed developments within the study
area shall be provided. The general site description shall also include
probable socioeconomic characteristics of potential site users to the extent
that they may affect the transportation needs of the site (i.e., number of
senior citizens).
      B.   Transportation Facilities Description.
         (1)   The description shall contain a full documentation of the
proposed internal and existing external transportation system. This description
shall include proposed internal vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian circulation,
all proposed ingress and egress locations, all internal roadway widths and
rights- of-way, parking conditions, traffic channelization and any traffic
signals or other intersection control devices at all intersections within the
site.
         (2)   The report shall describe the entire external roadway system
within the study area and include discussion of existing design deficiencies
and potential safety hazards. Major intersections in the study area shall be
identified and sketched. All existing and proposed public transportation
services and facilities within a 1 mile radius of the site shall also be
documented. Report shall include review and discussion of all available
accident reports within the study area during the prior 3 years. All future
highway improvements, including proposed construction and traffic
signalization, shall be noted. The 4-Year Regional Transportation Improvement
Program maintained by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission and the
PennDOT 12-Year Plan shall be used as a source of information when determining
if any future roadway improvements are scheduled for the adjacent road network.
Any proposed roadway improvements due to proposed surrounding developments
shall be recorded.
      C.   Existing Traffic Conditions. Existing traffic conditions shall be
measured and documented for all roadways and intersections in the study area.
Existing traffic volumes for average daily traffic, peak highway hour(s)
traffic, and peak development generated hour(s), and documentation shall be
included in the report. Traffic counts are to be performed from 6 a.m. to 10
a.m. and from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. Traffic count data shall not be more than 1 year
old. Traffic counts shall be taken on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday of a
nonholiday week. Traffic counts shall be taken during the school year. Traffic
counts shall be collected during average volume conditions, during fair
weather, and in consideration of any construction activities or special events
which may be taking place in the area. Additional counts (conducted on a
Saturday for a commercial development or residential development in close
proximity to the commercial district or tourist attractions) may also be
required in some cases. The Telford Borough Engineer shall make such
determinations. Traffic counts shall be submitted in electronic format to the
Borough of Telford. Roadway characteristics shall be described and illustrated.
Features to be addressed shall include lane configurations, geometry, signal
timing, traffic control devices, posted speed limits and sight distance
limitations. Existing levels of service shall be calculated for all
intersections and turning movements within the study area. This analysis will
determine the adequacy of the existing roadway system to adequately serve the
existing traffic demand. Roadways, intersections, or individual movements
experiencing levels of service below C, and/or volume/capacity ratios greater
than or equal to 1.0 shall be noted as deficient. A volume/capacity analysis
based upon existing volumes shall be performed during the peak highway hour(s)
and the peak development generated hour(s) for all roadways and major
intersections in the study area. Levels of service shall be determined for each
location using the current edition of the Highway Capacity Manual methodology.
All analysis must utilize Highway Capacity Software, version 4.1e, or latest.
      D.   Transportation Impact of the Development. Estimation of vehicular
trips to result from the proposal shall be completed for the average daily peak
highway hour(s) and peak development-generated hour(s). Vehicular trip
generation rates to be used for this calculation shall be obtained from the
manual, Trip Generation, Seventh Edition, Institute of Transportation
Engineers, 2003 (as amended). These development-generated traffic volumes shall
be provided for the in-bound and out- bound traffic movements as estimated, and
the reference source(s) methodology followed shall be documented. All turning
movements shall be calculated. These generated volumes shall be distributed to
the study area and assigned to the existing roadways and intersections
throughout the study area. Documentation of all assumptions used in the
distribution and assignment phase shall be provided. Traffic volumes shall be
assigned to individual access points. If school crossings are to be used,
pedestrian volumes shall be assigned to each crossing. Any characteristics of
the site that will cause particular trip generation problems shall be noted.
      E.   Analysis of Transportation Impact. The total future traffic demand
shall be calculated. This demand shall consist of the combination of the
existing traffic expanded to the completion year (using a background growth
rate for the area from PennDOT, Pennsylvania Traffic Data, latest edition), the
development-generated traffic, and the traffic generated by other proposed
developments in the study area. A separate trip distribution figure shall be
provided. A second/volume capacity analysis shall be conducted using the future
conditions volumes without development. This analysis shall be performed during
the peak highway hour(s) and peak generated hour(s) for all roadways and major
intersections in the study area. Level of service calculations shall be
completed for all major intersections. A third/volume capacity analysis shall
be conducted using the total future demand and the future roadway capacity. If
staging of the proposed development is anticipated, calculations for each stage
of completion shall be made. This analysis shall be performed during the peak
highway hour(s) and peak development- generated hour(s) for all roadways and
major intersections in the study area. Level of service calculations shall be
completed for all major intersections. It is usually at these locations that
capacity is most restricted. All access points and pedestrian crossings shall
be examined as to the feasibility of installing traffic signals. This
evaluation shall compare the projected traffic and pedestrian volumes to the
warrants for traffic signal installation.
      F.   Sight Distance Analysis. Sight distance measurements shall be
performed at any proposed driveway and/or existing driveway to determine
sufficient sight distance to the left and right of the driveway. Sight
distances shall be compared to the desirable sight distance standards as
specified in 67 Pa.Code, Chapter 441, “Access to and Occupancy of Highways by
Driveways and Local Roads,” January, 1992. Sight distance shall also be
compared to PennDOT’s safe stopping sight distance (SSSD) requirements as
specified in A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, of the
American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (ASSHTO),
Chapter III, “Elements of Design,” 1994.
      G.   Auxiliary Lane Analysis. An auxiliary lane analysis shall be
completed utilizing Highway Research Record (HRR) 211. HRR 211 provides graphs
based upon the speed of the roadway and the percentage of left turns. Utilizing
the future build with development traffic volumes, points shall be plotted on
the graphs. Based on the plotted points it should determined that the study
area intersections associated with the proposed developments do or do not
satisfy the left turn lane warrant. Right turn lane analysis should be based
upon the “Access Management, Location and Design Participant Notebook,”
Publication Number FHWA-HI-92- 033, US Department of Transportation, Federal
Highway Administration NHI Course Number 15255, October 1991. Deceleration
lanes should be provided for all high volume driveways. For low and medium
volume driveways, the designer should refer to the Colorado and Virginia DOT
deceleration lane warrants.
      H.   Conclusions and Recommended Improvements.
         (1)   Levels of service for all roadways and intersections shall be
listed. All individual turning movement of roadways and/or intersections
showing a level of service below “C” shall be considered deficient, and
specific recommendations for the elimination of these problems shall be listed.
This listing of recommended improvements shall include, but not be limited to
the following elements: internal circulation design, site access location and
design, external roadway and intersection design/safety improvements, traffic
signal installation and operation including signal timing, and transit design
improvements. All physical roadway improvements shall be shown in sketches.
         (2)   Existing and/or future public transportation service shall also
be addressed. A listing of all actions to be undertaken to increase present
public transportation usage and improve service, if applicable shall be
included.
         (3)   The listing of recommended improvements for both roadways and
transit shall include, for each improvement, the party responsible for the
improvement, the cost and funding of the improvement and the completion date
for the improvement.
         (4)   The study shall outline mitigation measures and demonstrate any
changes to the level of service achieved by these measures. Any alternatives or
suggested phasing of improvements shall be described. The mitigation measures
may include recommendations such as roadway widening, turning lanes,
deceleration lanes/tapers, changes to signalization, use of access management
techniques, or a reduction in the proposed intensity of the use. The
responsibility and timing of all recommended roadway improvements shall be
described within the traffic impact study.
   6.   Time of Submission. The traffic impact study shall be submitted to the
Planning Commission with the preliminary plan submission. Revisions to
preliminary plans may constitute the need for re-submission of the traffic
impact study for the revised conditions. Improvement plans shall not be
submitted to PennDOT until after review by the Montgomery County Planning
Commission and/or Bucks County Planning Commission and Borough Council.
   7.   Implementation. The Borough Council shall review the traffic impact
study to analyze its adequacy in solving any traffic problems that will occur
due to the land development or subdivision. The Borough Council may determine
that certain improvements on and/or adjacent to the site and within the study
area are necessary requirements for land development or subdivision plan
approval and may attach these as conditions to the approval. If Borough Council
determines that such additional improvements are necessary, the developer shall
have the opportunity to submit alternative improvement designs to obtain plan
approval.
   8.   Emergency Response Organizations. The Borough of Telford shall submit
all land development plans proposing the construction of nonresidential
buildings or multi-family residential dwellings to the fire department, police
department and any other emergency response organization having jurisdiction
within the area of the proposed development for review and comment.”
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 438)
Part 5
Mobile Home Park Standards
§ 22-501.   Applicability.
   1.   Individual Mobile Homes. Individual mobile homes, as defined in §
22-202, may be erected on any lot where the use is permitted, providing
compliance is made with zoning requirements and all sections of this Chapter
which apply to subdivisions and development of single-family detached
dwellings, and applicable local or Federal building codes.
   2.   Mobile Home Parks. The provisions of this Part shall be followed in the
construction or alteration of all mobile home parks, as defined in §
22-202. These provisions are in addition to other applicable regulations of
this Chapter. Compliance with the Telford Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27] is also required.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, §500)
§ 22-502.   Site Design.
   The following site design standards shall apply to mobile home parks:
      A.   Arrangement of Structures and Facilities. The tract, including
mobile home stands, patios, other dwellings and structures, and all tract
improvements, shall be organized in relation to topography, the shape of the
plot and common facilities. Special attention shall be given to new mobile home
designs and to common appurtenances that are available.
      B.   Adaptation to Tract Assets. Each mobile home unit or other dwelling
or structure shall be fitted to the terrain with a minimum disturbance of the
land and a minimum elevation difference between the floor level of the unit and
the ground elevation under it. Existing trees and shrubs, rock formation,
streams, floodplains, steep slopes and other natural features of the tract
shall be preserved to the maximum extent practical. Favorable views shall be
emphasized by the plan.
      C.   Courts and Spaces. Groups or clusters of units, so placed as to
create interior spaces and courtyards, shall be incorporated whenever feasible.
      D.   Orientation. Mobile homes are encouraged to be arranged in a variety
of orientations, and are strongly encouraged to have many units with their long
sides facing the street rather than their ends, in order to provide variety and
interest.
      E.   Street Layout. Street patterns unrelated to the topography are to be
avoided.
      F.   Roadways.
         (1)   Standards. All Borough standards for the construction of streets
contained in this Chapter shall be adhered to for all public streets in and
abutting a mobile home park. In those parks where streets are to be maintained
as private internal streets maintained by the mobile home park owner or owned
and maintained in common by the residents/owners of the individual lots, the
following standards shall apply:
            (a)   Right-of-Way. There shall be an equivalent right-of-way (as
defined under “street rights-of-way” in §
22-202) reserved along streets which are designed to function as major or minor
collector streets, and which connect exterior roadways, form major internal
loops, traverse the majority of the development, or provide access to adjoining
parcels of land. No equivalent rights-of-way are required on other streets. On
those streets where an equivalent right-of-way is required, parallel parking
may be permitted, but perpendicular or angled parking is not permitted.
            (b)   Pavement. Pavement or cartway width of all residential
streets serving as access to mobile home lots shall be not less than 26 feet.
Pavement may be reduced to no less than 20 feet on a street serving as access
to not greater than 10 mobile home lots where parking is prohibited along the
road and off-street visitor parking is provided in common areas of at least 300
feet of all dwelling units. Overflow parking must be provided in a suitable
area as determined by the Borough Engineer. One off-street parking space shall
be required in the common parking area for every three mobile homes.
            (c)   Grades. Gradients on all residential streets shall not exceed
10 percent.
            (d)   Cul-de-Sac Streets. A paved turnaround area with a minimum
radius of 40 feet shall be provided at the closed end of any cul-de-sac street
serving as a sole access to four or more mobile home lots. No permanently-
closed cul-de-sac street shall exceed 600 feet in length or serve as the only
access to more than 20 mobile home lots.
         (2)   Access Limitations. Mobile home lots may have direct access only
onto streets internal to the development. Direct access from a mobile home lot
shall not be permitted onto the streets surrounding the mobile home park.
         (3)   Conversions. Any road built as a private road, and later
proposed for conversion to a public road, shall be brought up to the applicable
standards for public streets prior to being dedicated as a public way, unless
this requirement is waived by Borough Council subsequent to determining that
compliance with the requirement would have a negative effect on the mobile home
park.
      G.   Pedestrian Circulation.
         (1)   General Requirements. All mobile home parks shall provide safe,
convenient, all-season pedestrian walkways of adequate width for intended use,
durable and convenient to maintain between individual mobile homes, mobile home
development, all community facilities provided for the residents, and offsite
pedestrian traffic generators, such as schools, bus stops, commercial centers,
etc. These pedestrian walkways may parallel vehicular roadways, where they
shall only be required on one side, or they may form a separate but coordinated
system away from streets. Walkways must be provided wherever pedestrian traffic
is concentrated and where school children congregate, but may be waived
elsewhere if the applicant successfully demonstrates a lack of need.
         (2)   Common Walk System. Where a common walk system is provided and
maintained between locations, such common walks shall have a minimum width of 4
feet. Where these walks parallel roadways they shall be separated from the road
pavement by a distance of at least 4 feet.
         (3)   Individual Walks. All dwellings shall be connected to common
walks, or to streets, or to driveways or parking spaces connecting to a paved
street. Such individual walks shall have a minimum width of 2 feet.
      H.   Parking.
         (1)   Spaces Required. Two paved lined off-street parking spaces shall
be provided for each dwelling on the same lot. Parking for any commercial or
other nonresidential use shall follow the requirements otherwise applicable for
such uses.
         (2)   Common Parking Areas. All common parking areas shall conform
with the dimensional requirements in §
22-431. The number and location of the parking spaces shall conform to
paragraph .F(1)(b) of this Section.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 501)
§ 22-503.   Common Open Space.
   In addition to any requirements of the Telford Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27], the following regulations shall also apply:
      A.   Open Space System.
         (1)   Arrangement. The common space shall be designed as a contiguous
area unless the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of Borough Council
that two or more separate areas would be preferable. The open space shall also
have easily identifiable pedestrian and visual accessibility to all residents
of the mobile home park, although all units do not have to abut the common open
space.
         (2)   Recreation. Recreation areas and facilities shall be provided to
meet the anticipated needs of the residents of the mobile home park. Not less
than 25 percent of the required open space area exclusive of lands within the
required buffers, shall be devoted to recreation. Recreation areas should be of
a size, shape, and topography that is conducive to active and passive
recreation, in compliance with applicable zoning requirements.
      B.   Buffers.
         (1)   General Requirements. Along all exterior property boundary lines
a permanent buffer shall be provided.
         (2)   Existing Buffers. In cases where the property line of a mobile

forth in this Part.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 600)
§ 22-602.   Completion or Guarantee of Required Improvements.
   No final plan shall be approved until the applicant has either:
      A.   Completed all of the improvements required by Borough Council for
final plan approval, in compliance with the requirements of this Chapter.
      B.   Provided a proper financial security for those improvements, as
required by this Part, in compliance with the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq., to cover the estimated costs for
completion of those improvements.
         (1)   The work completed or guaranteed shall be in strict accordance
with the approved plans and the requirements of this Chapter.
         (2)   No lot in a subdivision may be sold, and no permit to erect,
alter or repair any building upon land in a subdivision or land development

building constructed in any floodplain area except in compliance with the
floodplain management requirements of this Chapter, the Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27] and the Building Code [
Chapter 5, Part 1].
         (4)   Borough Council may defer or waive at the time of final plan
approval, subject to appropriate conditions, the provision of any or all
required improvements, as in its judgment, are not requisite in the interests
of public health, safety and welfare, or which are inappropriate due to the
inadequacy or nonexistence of connecting facilities. A separate public
improvement agreement may be executed by Borough Council guaranteeing
completion of any deferred improvement.
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 601)
§ 22-603.   Financial Security.
   1.   In lieu of the completion of improvements required for final plan
approval, financial security, in an amount required, shall be guaranteed to the
Borough in compliance with the applicable requirements of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq. Such financial security
shall assure the complete installation of all the required improvements to be
completed on or before the date fixed in the plan approval, subdivision
agreement, and/or development agreement for completion of such improvements.
   2.   The amount of such security to be posted for the completion of required
improvements shall be equal to 110 percent of the cost of completion estimated
as of 90 days following the date scheduled for completion by the developer.
Annually, the Borough may adjust the amount of the required financial security
by comparing the actual cost of improvements which have been completed and the
estimated cost for the completion of the remaining improvements as of the
expiration of the 90th day after the original scheduled date for completion or
a rescheduled completion date.
   3.   In determining the cost of the completion of improvements for setting
the amount of financial security required in §
22-603, such cost shall be based upon an estimate of the cost of completion of
required improvements submitted by the applicant or developer, and prepared by
a professional engineer and certified to be fair and reasonable. The Borough
under recommendation of the Borough Engineer may refuse to accept the estimate
for good reasons provided to the applicant. If the applicant or developer and
the Borough are unable to agree upon an estimate, then the estimate shall be
recalculated and recertified by another professional engineer which is mutually
chosen by the Borough and the applicant. The estimate certified by the third
engineer shall be presumed to be fair and reasonable and shall be the final
estimate.
   4.   When requested by the applicant in order to facilitate financing,
Borough Council shall furnish the applicant with a signed copy of a resolution
indicating approval of the final plan contingent upon the applicant obtaining a
satisfactory financial security. Final plans will not be signed or recorded
until the financial improvements agreement is executed. The resolution of
contingent approval shall expire and be deemed to be revoked if the financial
security agreement is not executed within 90 days, unless a written extension
is granted by Borough Council.
   5.   The Borough at its option, may accept financial security in cash in the
form of an irrevocable letter of credit, escrow account or surety bond with a
bonding company or commonwealth or federal chartered lending institution chosen
by the party posting financial security provided said institution or company is
authorized to conduct such business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

   Borough Council may release all or parts of the posted financial security as
completion of improvements proceeds, in compliance with the applicable
requirements of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10101
et seq.
      A.   Partial Release of Security. As the work of the installation of the
required public improvements proceeds, the party posting the financial security
may request the Borough to release or authorize the release, from time to time,
such portions of the financial security necessary for the payment of the
contractor or contractors performing the work. Any such request shall be done
in writing addressed to Telford Borough. Upon receipt of the request for
release of a portion of the improvement security, Telford Borough shall within
45 days allow the Borough Engineer to certify, in writing, that such portion of
the public improvements has been completed in accordance with the approved plan
at which time the Borough shall authorize the release to the applicant or his
designee by the bond company or lending institution of an amount of funds that
the Borough engineer feels fairly represents the value of the work completed.
If the Borough fails to act upon a request for release of security within 45
days, the Borough shall be deemed to have approved the full release of security
as requested.
      B.   Incomplete Improvements. If the required improvements are not
completely installed within the period fixed or extended by Borough Council,
Borough Council may:
         (1)   Declare the financial security in default and require that all
improvements be installed regardless of the extent of the building development
at the time the agreement is declared in default.

improvements.
         (5)   Exercise any other available rights under the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
      C.   Post-completion Security. The applicant shall be responsible for
maintenance of all improvements for a period of 18 months after final
acceptance and certification of project completion.
      D.   Landscaping Security. The applicant shall be responsible for the
full replacement of all dead or diseased trees or shrubs for 18 months after

Special Studies and Reports
§ 22-701.   Applicability.
   The following special studies and reports to be developed by qualified
professionals may be required to support and justify subdivision and land
development proposals as required by this Chapter and the Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27].
(Ord. 388, 10/3/2011, § 700)
§ 22-702.   Groundwater Study.
   1.   Purpose. Groundwater studies are intended to determine if there is an
adequate supply of water for a proposed use and to estimate the impact of
additional water withdrawals on existing nearby wells, underlying aquifers and
streams.
   2.   Applicability.
      A.   Since Telford Borough is located within the Southeastern
Pennsylvania Groundwater Protection Area of the Delaware River Basin Commission
(DRBC), all projects with wells withdrawing 10,000 gallons per day (gpd) or
greater of groundwater or surface water or a combination of these two sources
are required to obtain a permit from the DRBC. These projects are not required
to submit a groundwater impact study; however, copies of all submissions by the
applicant to DRBC must be sent to Telford Borough additionally, copies of all
submissions to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)
and all correspondence received by the applicant from DEP shall be forwarded to
Telford Borough.
      B.   Groundwater studies are required for projects that do not have to
get a permit or docket approval from DRBC, propose a private water supply and
which fall into one of the following three categories:
         (1)   Subdivisions that contain five or more dwelling units and have
an overall gross density greater than one house per two acres, excluding
residual agricultural lots.
         (2)   All land developments intended for nonresidential use (i.e.,
industrial, commercial and institutional) unless waived by the Borough Council.
         (3)   Subdivisions or land developments taking place in an area with
known groundwater contamination or groundwater supply problems as identified in
the Indian Valley Regional Comprehensive Plan or by the Department of
Environmental Protection or by any other study approved by Borough Council.
   3.   Study. Telford Borough will not approve any subdivision or land
development where the groundwater impact study shows that the proposed water
system:
      A.   Does not provide an adequate supply of water for the proposed use,
considering both quality and quantity.
      B.   Adversely affects nearby wells and streams.
      C.   Does not provide for adequate groundwater recharge, considering
other withdrawals.
      D.   Does not provide safe drinking water, taking into account reasonable
treatment options.
      E.   Is not in compliance with Part 16, “Wellhead Protection Overlay,” of
Telford Borough’s Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27, Part 16].
   4.   General Requirements and Standards for a Groundwater Impact Study. All
groundwater impact studies must meet the following requirements:
      A.   The study shall be prepared by a professional hydrologist, geologist
or engineer qualified to conduct groundwater investigations.
      B.   A Phase I study shall be conducted for all projects required to do a
groundwater study. The Phase I study shall be based upon available literature
and appropriate professional judgment and shall include the following
information:
         (1)   Calculations of the projected water needs using the criteria set
forth in the following references:
            (a)   Public Water Supply Manual, Bureau of Water Quality
Management, PA Department of Environmental Protection, Harrisburg, PA.

boundary.
         (3)   The location of all faults, lineaments, and fracture traces
within a ¼ mile of the site boundary.
         (4)   The locations of all existing and proposed wells within a ¼ mile
of the site boundary, and all large withdrawal wells (10,000+ gpd) within 1
mile of the site.
         (5)   The location of all existing and proposed on-lot septic systems
within a ¼ mile of the site boundary.
         (6)   The location of all streams, perennial, and intermittent, within
a ¼ mile of the site boundary.
         (7)   A discussion of the aquifers underlying the site and their long-
term drought recharge capability based on accepted published data or detailed
site specific investigation for both the pre and post-development condition.
         (8)   Based on the drought recharge capability of the underlying
aquifer and the calculated daily groundwater withdrawals of the project, a
hydrologic budget shall be calculated for the site and for the area within a ¼
mile of the site boundary.
         (9)   Based on the results of the hydrologic budget, a determination
shall be made about adverse affects on the groundwater to be caused by the
project. This determination should include analysis of the total recharge water
volume lost to the site as a result of the creation of new impervious surface
or modified ground cover found on site. Pumping of groundwater and waste water
disposal must also be evaluated within the hydrologic budget.
         (10)   Water quality information for area groundwater based from tests

General Provisions
§ 23-101.   Statement of Findings.
   Council of Telford Borough finds that:
      A.   Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities,
contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of
existing streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public
facilities to convey and manage stormwater, undermines floodplain management
and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities, reduces
groundwater recharge, and threatens public health and safety.
      B.   A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated
erosion, is fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare and the
protection of the people of the Borough and all the people of the Commonwealth,
their resources, and the environment.
      C.   Through project design, impacts from stormwater runoff can be
minimized to maintain the natural hydrologic regime, and sustain high water
quality, stream baseflow and aquatic ecosystems. The most cost effective and
environmentally advantageous way to manage stormwater runoff is through
nonstructural project design, minimizing impervious surfaces and sprawl,
avoiding sensitive areas (i.e., stream buffers, floodplains, steep slopes), and
designing to topography and soils to maintain the natural hydrologic regime.
(Ord. 362, 3/7/2005, § 101)
§ 23-102.   Purpose.
   1.   The purpose of this Chapter is to:
      A.   Promote health, safety and welfare within the Borough.
      B.   Implement the requirements of the East Branch Perkiomen Creek
Stormwater Management Plan.
      C.   Implement the requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System Phase II (NPDES II).
   2.   By minimizing the damages described in §
23-101.A of this Chapter through provisions designed to:
      A.   Manage accelerated runoff, erosion and sedimentation problems at
their source by regulating activities that cause these problems.
      B.   Utilize and preserve the existing natural drainage systems.
      C.   Encourage recharge of groundwater where appropriate and prevent
degradation of groundwater quality.
      D.   Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses in
the Borough and the Commonwealth.
      E.   Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams.
      F.   Provide proper maintenance of all permanent stormwater management
facilities that are constructed in the Borough.
      G.   Provide performance standards and design criteria for watershed-wide
stormwater management and planning.
(Ord. 362, 3/7/2005, § 102)

Creek Watershed Stormwater Management Plan to the municipality for review. This
criterion shall apply to the total proposed development even if development is
to take place in stages. Impervious cover shall include, but not be limited to,
any roof, parking or driveway areas and any new streets and sidewalks. Any
areas designed to initially be gravel or crushed stone shall be assumed to be
impervious for the exemption criteria.
   2.   Stormwater drainage systems shall be provided in order to permit
unimpeded flow along natural watercourses, except as modified by stormwater
management facilities or open channels consistent with this Chapter.
   3.   The Drainage plan must be designed consistent with the sequencing
provisions of §
23-302 to ensure maintenance of the natural hydrologic regime and to protect
groundwater and surface water quality and quantity. The Drainage plan designer
must proceed sequentially in accordance with Part 3 of this Chapter.
   4.   The existing points of concentrated drainage that discharge onto
adjacent property shall not be altered without permission of the affected
property owner(s) and shall be subject to any applicable discharge criteria
specified in this Chapter.
   5.   Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge shall be subject to any
applicable discharge criteria in the general direction of existing discharge,
whether proposed to be concentrated or maintained as diffused drainage areas,
except as otherwise provided by this Chapter. If diffused flow is proposed to
be concentrated and discharged onto adjacent property, the applicant must
document that adequate downstream conveyance facilities exist to safely
transport the concentrated discharge, or otherwise prove that no erosion,
sedimentation, flooding or other harm will result from the concentrated
discharge.
   6.   Whenever a watercourse is located within a development site, it shall
remain open in its natural state and location and should not be piped, impeded
or altered (except for road crossings). It is the responsibility of the
developer to stabilize existing eroded stream/channel banks.
   7.   Where a development site is traversed by watercourses drainage
easements shall be provided conforming to the line of such watercourses. The
terms of the easement shall prohibit excavation, the placing of fill or
structures, and any alterations that may adversely affect the flow of
stormwater within any portion of the easement.
   8.   When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural
drainageways on the site cannot adequately provide for drainage, open channels
may be constructed conforming substantially to the line and grade of such
natural drainageways. Work within natural drainageways shall be subject to
approval by the municipality and the DEP through the joint permit application
process, or, where deemed appropriate by DEP, through the general permit
process.
   9.   Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this Chapter that
would be located in or adjacent to waters of the Commonwealth or wetlands shall
be subject to approval by DEP through the joint permit application process, or,
where deemed appropriate by DEP, the general permit process. When there is a
question whether wetlands may be involved, it is the responsibility of the
applicant or his agent to show that the land in question cannot be classified
as wetlands; otherwise approval to work in the area must be obtained from DEP.
   10.   Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this Chapter that

connected to sanitary or storm sewers. Overland flow and infiltration/
percolation of stormwater shall be promoted where site conditions allow. If a
developer wishes to connect directly to streets or storm sewers, it shall be
permitted on a case-by-case basis only after review and approval by the
Borough.

exceptional value (EV) waters: the temperature and quality of water and streams
that have been declared as exceptional value and high quality are to be
maintained as defined in 25 Pa.Code, Chapter 93, “Water Quality Standards,”
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Rules and Regulations.
Temperature sensitive BMPs and stormwater conveyance systems are to be used and
designed with storage pool areas and supply outflow channels and should be

and the relaxation of restrictions on planting vegetation within the
facilities, provided that capacity for volumes and rate control is maintained.
At a minimum, the southern half on pond shorelines shall be planted with shade
or canopy trees within 10 feet of the pond shoreline. In conjunction with this
requirement, the maximum slope allowed on the berm area to be planted is 10 to

long-term maintenance schedule and management plan for the thermal control BMPs
is to be established and recorded for all development sites.
   14.   All stormwater runoff shall be pretreated for water quality prior to
discharge to surface water as required by §
23-303 of this Chapter.

Commonwealth unless otherwise demonstrated.
   2.   The applicant shall demonstrate that they designed the regulated
activities in the following sequence to minimize the increases in stormwater
runoff and impacts to water quality:
      A.   Prepare an existing resource and site analysis map (ERSAM), showing
environmentally sensitive areas including, but not limited to, steep slopes,
ponds, lakes, streams, wetlands, hydric soils, vernal pools, floodplains,
stream buffer zones, hydrologic soil groups A, B, C and D, any existing

points, recharge areas and hydrologic soil groups A and B.
      D.   Evaluate nonstructural stormwater management alternatives (see

areas and discharge points, to minimize earth disturbance and impervious
surfaces, and to reduce runoff to the maximum extent possible, the use of
surface or point discharges.
      J.   Conduct a proposed conditions runoff analysis based on the final
design and to meet the release rate and in turn the overbank flow and extreme
event requirements (§
23-306).
      K.   Manage any remaining runoff through treatment prior to discharge, as
part of detention, bioretention, direct discharge or other structural control.

         (a)   The following calculation formula is to be used to determine the
water quality storage volume, (WQv), in acre-feet of storage for the East
Branch Perkiomen Creek watershed:

            1)   WQv=Water Quality Volume (acre-feet).
            2)   P=Rainfall Amount equal to 90 percent of events producing this
rainfall (in).
            3)   A=Area of the project contributing to the water quality BMP
(acres).
            4)   Rv=0.05 + 0.009(I) where I is the percent of the area that is
impervious surface (impervious area/A*100).
         (b)   The P value for the five PennDOT rainfall regions is shown in
Figure 23-B-2 in Appendix 23-B of the Model Ordinance within this plan and as
shown in Appendix
Table 23-B-5. Since the Borough is in PennDOT Region 4, the P value to be
utilized to meet this requirement is 1.95 inches.
   B.   (1)   Design of BMPs used for water quality control shall be in
accordance with design specifications outlined in the Maryland Stormwater
Design Manual, Maryland Dept. of the Environment (http://www.mde._state.md.us/
Programs/WaterPrograms/SedimentandStormwater/home/inde_x.asp), latest ed. or
other design manuals approved by the Borough.
      (2)   The following factors SHALL be considered when evaluating the
suitability of BMPs used to control water quality at a given development site:
         (a)   Total contributing drainage area.
         (b)   Permeability and infiltration rate of the site soils.
         (c)   Slope and depth to bedrock.
         (d)   Seasonal high water table.
         (e)   Proximity to building foundations and well heads.
         (f)   Erodibility of soils.
         (g)   Land availability and configuration of the topography.
         (h)   Peak discharge and required volume control.
         (i)   Stream bank erosion.
         (j)   Efficiency of the BMPs to mitigate potential water quality
problems.
         (k)   The volume of runoff that will be effectively treated.
         (l)   The nature of the pollutant being removed.
         (m)   Maintenance requirements.
         (n)   Creation/protection of aquatic and wildlife habitat.
         (o)   Recreational value.
         (p)   Enhancement of aesthetic and property value.
   C.   To accomplish the above, the applicant shall submit original and
innovative designs to the Borough for review and approval. Such designs may
achieve the water quality objectives through a combination of BMPs (best
management practices).
(Ord. 362, 3/7/2005, § 303)
§ 23-304.   Groundwater Recharge (Infiltration).
   Telford Borough has enacted a wellhead protection plan and therefore the
“Wellhead Protection Overlay District” [
Chapter 27, Part 16] shall govern stormwater management designs.
   A.   Infiltration BMPs shall meet the following minimum requirements:
      (1)   Regulated activities will be required to recharge (infiltrate) a
portion of the runoff created by the development as part of an overall
stormwater management plan designed for the site. The volume of runoff to be
recharged shall be determined from paragraphs .A(1)(b)1) or .A(1)(b)2)
depending upon demonstrated site conditions.
         (a)   Infiltration BMPs intended to receive runoff from developed
areas shall be selected based on suitability of soils and site conditions and
shall be constructed on soils that have the following characteristics:
            1)   A minimum depth of 24 inches between the bottom of the BMP and
the limiting zone.
            2)   An infiltration and/or percolation rate sufficient to accept
the additional stormwater load and drain completely as determined by field
tests conducted by the applicant’s design professional.
            3)   The recharge facility shall be capable of completely
infiltrating the recharge volume within 4 days (96 hours).
            4)   Pretreatment shall be provided prior to infiltration.
            5)   The requirements for recharge are applied to all disturbed
areas, even if they are ultimately to be an undeveloped land use such as grass,
since studies have found that compaction of the soils during disturbance
reduces their infiltrative capacity.
         (b)   The recharge volume (Re) shall be computed by first obtaining
the infiltration requirement using methods in either paragraph .A(1)(b)1) or .A
(1)(b)2) then multiplying by the total proposed impervious area. The overall
required recharge volume for a site is computed by multiplying total impervious
area by the infiltration requirement.
            1)   NRCS Curve Number Equation. The following criteria shall
apply.
               a)   The NRCS runoff shall be utilized to calculate infiltration
requirements (P) in inches.
               b)   For zero runoff: P=I (Infiltration)=(200/CN)-2 Equation:
23-304.1 where:
                  i)   P=I=infiltration requirement (inches).
                  ii)   CN=SCS(NRCS) curve number of the existing conditions
contributing to the recharge facility.
               c)   This equation can be displayed graphically in, and the
infiltration requirement can also be determined from
Figure 23-304-1.
               d)   The recharge volume (Rev) required would therefore be
computed as: Rev=I * impervious area (SF)/12=Cubic Feet (CF) Equation:
23-304.2.
            2)   Annual Recharge Water Budget Approach.
               a)   It has been determined that infiltrating 0.6 inches of
runoff from the impervious areas will aid in maintaining the hydrologic regime
of the watershed. If the goals of §
23-304.A(b)1) cannot be achieved, then 0.6 inches of rainfall shall be
infiltrated from all impervious areas, up to an existing site conditions curve
number of 77. Above a curve number of 77, Equation
23-304.1 or the curve in
Figure 23-304-1 should be used to determine the Infiltration requirement.
               b)   Where: I=0.6 inches.
               c)   The recharge volume (Rev) required would therefore be
computed as: Rev=1 * percent impervious area (SF)/12=(CF).
               d)   The recharge values derived from these methods are the
minimum volumes the applicant must control through an infiltration/recharge BMP
facility. However, if a site has areas of soils where additional volume of
infiltration can be achieved, the applicant is encouraged to recharge as much
of the stormwater runoff from the site as possible.

IMAGES/0-0-0-61.png]
 
   B.   The general process for designing the infiltration BMP shall be:
      (1)   A detailed soils evaluation of the project site shall be required
to determine the suitability of recharge facilities. The evaluation shall be
performed by a qualified applicant and, at a minimum, address soil
permeability, depth to bedrock and subgrade stability.
         (a)   Analyze hydrologic soil groups as well as natural and man-made
features within the watershed to determine general areas of suitability for
infiltration practices.
         (b)   Provide field tests, such as double ring infiltration tests at
the level of the proposed infiltration surface to determine the appropriate
hydraulic conductivity rate.
         (c)   Design the infiltration structure for the required storm volume
based on field determined capacity at the level of the proposed infiltration
surface.
         (d)   Where the recharge volume requirement cannot be physically
accomplished due to the results of the field soils testing, supporting
documentation and justification shall be supplied to the municipality with the
drainage plan.
         (e)   If on-lot infiltration structures are proposed by the
applicant’s design professional, it must be demonstrated to the Borough that
the soils are conducive to infiltrate on the lots identified.
   C.   Extreme caution shall be exercised where infiltration is proposed in
geologically susceptible areas such as strip mine or limestone areas. Extreme
caution shall also be exercised where salt or chloride would be a pollutant
since soils do little to filter this pollutant and it may contaminate the
groundwater. Extreme caution shall be exercised where infiltration is proposed
in source water protection areas. The qualified design professional shall
evaluate the possibility of groundwater contamination from the proposed
infiltration/recharge facility and perform a hydrogeologic justification study
if necessary. The infiltration requirement in High Quality/Exceptional Value
waters shall be subject to the 25 Pa.Code, Chapter 93, “Antidegradation
Regulations.” The Borough may require the installation of an impermeable liner
in BMP and/or detention basins where the possibility of groundwater
contamination exists. A detailed hydrogeologic investigation may be required by
the Borough.
   D.   The Borough shall require the applicant to provide safeguards against
groundwater contamination for uses which may cause groundwater contamination,
should there be a mishap or spill.
   E.   Recharge/infiltration facilities shall be used in conjunction with
other innovative or traditional BMPs, stormwater control facilities and
nonstructural stormwater management alternatives.
(Ord. 362, 3/7/2005, § 304)
§ 23-305.   Stream Bank Erosion Requirements.
   1.   In addition to the water quality volume, to minimize the impact of
stormwater runoff on downstream streambank erosion, the requirement is to
design a BMP to detain the proposed conditions 2-year, 24-hour design storm to
the existing conditions 1-year flow using the SCS Type II distribution.
Additionally, provisions shall be made (such as adding a small orifice at the
bottom of the outlet structure) so that the proposed conditions 1-year storm
takes a minimum of 24 hours to drain from the facility from a point where the
maximum volume of water from the 1-year storm is captured. (i.e., the maximum
water surface elevation is achieved in the facility).
   2.   Release of water can begin at the start of the storm (i.e., the invert
of the water quality orifice is at the invert of the facility). The design of
the facility shall consider and minimize the chances of clogging and
sedimentation. Orifices smaller than 3 inches diameter are not recommended.
However, if the design engineer can provide proof that the smaller orifices are
protected from clogging by use of trash racks, etc., smaller orifices may be
permitted. Trash racks are required for any primary orifice.
   3.   In “no detention” areas (District C) only, the objective is not to
attenuate the larger storms. This can be accomplished by configuration of the
outlet structure not to control the larger storms, or by a bypass or channel to
divert only the 2-year flood into the basin or divert flows in excess of the 2-
year storm away from the basin.
(Ord. 362, 3/7/2005, § 305)
§ 23-306.   Stormwater Management Districts.
   1.   The East Branch Perkiomen Creek watershed has been divided into
stormwater management districts as shown on the Watershed Map in
Appendix 23-D.
   2.   In addition to the requirements specified below, the water quality (§
23-303) ground water recharge (§
23-304) and streambank erosion (§
23-305) requirements shall be implemented.
   3.   Standards for managing runoff from each watershed subarea in the
Borough is shown below, Districts A, B, C-1 and C-2 are within the East Branch
Perkiomen Creek watershed. District D is for all other portions of the Borough
outside of the East Branch Perkiomen Creek watershed. Development sites located
in each of the A, B or C Districts must control proposed conditions runoff
rates to existing conditions runoff rates for the design storms as follows:
District Design Storm Proposed conditions Design Storm Existing conditions
District Design Storm Proposed conditions Design Storm Existing conditions
         2-year                           1-year

         25-year                          25-year
*EXPLANATION OF DISTRICT C-2: Development sites which can discharge directly
to the East Branch Perkiomen Creek main channel or major tributaries or
indirectly to the main channel through an existing stormwater drainage system
(i.e., storm sewer or tributary) may do so without control of proposed
conditions peak rate of runoff greater than the 5- year storm. Sites in
District C will still have to comply with the water quality criteria (§
23-303), the groundwater recharge criteria (§
23-304), and streambank erosion criteria (§
23-305). If the proposed conditions runoff is intended to be conveyed by an
existing stormwater drainage system to the main channel, assurance must be
provided that such system has adequate capacity to convey the increased peak
flows or will be provided with improvements to furnish the required capacity.
If storms greater than the 2-year storm cannot be conveyed to the stream or
watercourse is a safe manner, the proposed conditions peak rate of runoff
must be controlled to the existing conditions peak rate as required in
District C-1 provisions (i.e., 25-year proposed conditions flows to 25-year
existing conditions flows) for the specified design storms.
 
(Ord. 362, 3/7/2005, § 306)
§ 23-307.   Stormwater Management District Implementation Provisions
(Performance Standards).
   1.   General. Proposed conditions peak rates of runoff from any regulated
activity shall meet the peak release rates of runoff prior to development for
the design storms specified on the Stormwater Management District Watershed Map
(
Appendix 23-D) and §
23-306, of this Chapter.
   2.   District Boundaries. The boundaries of the stormwater management
districts are shown on an official stormwater district map that is available
for inspections at the Borough office. A copy of the map at a reduced scale is
included in the ordinance
Appendix 23-D. The exact location of the Stormwater Management District
boundaries, as they apply to a given development site, shall be determined by
mapping the boundaries using the 2-foot topographic contours (or most accurate
data required) provided as part of the drainage plan.
   3.   Sites Located in More Than One District. For a proposed development
site located within two or more stormwater management district category
subareas, the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall be the existing
conditions peak discharge for that subarea as indicated in §
23-306. The calculated peak discharges shall apply regardless of whether the
grading plan changes the drainage area by subarea. An exception to the above
may be granted if discharges from multiple subareas recombine in proximity to
the site. In this case, peak discharge in any direction may be a 100 percent
release rate provided that the overall site discharge meets the weighted
average release rate.
   4.   Off-Site Areas. Off-site areas that drain through a proposed
development site are not subject to release rate criteria when determining
allowable peak runoff rates. However, on-site drainage facilities shall be
designed to safely convey off-site flows through the development site.
   5.   Site Areas. Where the area of a site being impacted by a proposed
development activity differs significantly from the total site area, only the
proposed disturbed area utilizing stormwater management measures shall be
subject to the management district criteria. Unimpacted or undisturbed areas
that do flow into or are bypassing the stormwater management facilities would
not be subject to the management district criteria.
   6.   “No Harm” Option. For any proposed development site not located in
District Cl or C2, the applicant has the option of using a less restrictive
runoff control (including no detention) if the applicant can prove that “no
harm” would be caused by discharging at a higher runoff rate than that
specified by the Plan. The “no harm” option is used when an applicant can prove
that the proposed conditions hydrographs can match existing conditions
hydrographs, or if it can be proved that the proposed conditions will not cause
increases in peaks at all points downstream. Proof of “no harm” would have to
be shown based upon the following “downstream impact evaluation” which shall
include a “downstream hydraulic capacity analysis” consistent with paragraph .G
to determine if adequate hydraulic capacity exists. The applicant shall submit
to the Borough this evaluation of the impacts due to increased downstream
stormwater flows in the watershed.
      A.   The “downstream impact evaluation” shall include hydrologic and
hydraulic calculations necessary to determine the impact of hydrograph timing
modifications due to the proposed development upon a dam, highway, structure,
natural point of restricted streamflow or any stream channel section,
established with the concurrence of the Borough.
      B.   The evaluation shall continue downstream until the increase in flow
diminishes due to additional flow from tributaries and/or stream attenuation.
      C.   The peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the design
return period storms (2, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100-year) shall be the values from
the calibrated model for the East Branch Perkiomen Creek watershed. These flow
values can be obtained from the watershed plan.
      D.   Applicant-proposed runoff controls that would generate increased
peak flow rates at storm drainage problem areas would, by definition, be
precluded from successful attempts to prove “no-harm,” except in conjunction
with proposed capacity improvements for the problem areas consistent with
paragraph .G of this subsection.
      E.   Financial considerations shall not constitute grounds for granting a
no- harm exemption.
      F.   Capacity improvements may be provided as necessary to implement the
“no harm” option which proposes specific capacity improvements to provide that
a less stringent discharge control would not create any harm downstream.
      G.   Any “no harm” justifications shall be submitted by the applicant as
part of the drainage plan submission per Part 4.
   7.   “Downstream Hydraulic Capacity Analysis.” Any downstream capacity
hydraulic analysis conducted in accordance with this Chapter shall use the
following criteria for determining adequacy for accepting increased peak flow
rates:
      A.   Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey the
increased runoff associated with a 2-year return period event within their
banks at velocities consistent with protection of the channels from erosion.
Acceptable velocities shall be based upon criteria included in the Department
of Environmental Protection’s Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control Program
Manual.
      B.   Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
increased 25-year return period runoff without creating any hazard to persons
or property.
      C.   Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must
pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in accordance
with 25 Pa.Code, Chapter 105, regulations (if applicable) and, at minimum, pass
the increased 25-year return period runoff.
   8.   Regional Stormwater Management Facilities Alternatives. For certain
areas within the study area, it may be more cost-effective to provide one
control facility for more than one development site than to provide an
individual control facility for each development site. The initiative and
funding for any regional runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of
prospective applicants. The design of any regional control facility must
incorporate reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed. The peak
outflow of a regional control facility would be determined on a case-by-case
basis using the hydrologic model of the watershed consistent with protection of
the downstream watershed areas. “Hydrologic model” refers to the calibrated
model as developed for the stormwater management plan. It is a requirement
that, even if regional facilities are proposed for the water quantity control,
that the water quality, streambank erosion, and recharge criteria be
accomplished on-site, or as close to the source of the runoff as possible.
(Ord. 362, 3/7/2005, § 307)
§ 23-308.   Design Criteria for Stormwater Management Facilities.
   1.   Any stormwater facility located on state highway rights-of-way shall be
subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT).
   2.   Any stormwater management facility (i.e., detention basin BMP) designed
to store runoff and requiring a berm or earthen embankment required or
regulated by this Chapter shall be designed to provide an emergency spillway to
handle flow up to and including the 100-year proposed conditions. The height of
embankment must be set as to provide a minimum 1.0 foot of freeboard above the
maximum pool elevation computed when the facility functions for the 100-year
proposed conditions peak inflow. Should any stormwater management facility
require a dam safety permit under 25 Pa.Code, Chapter 105, “Dam Safety and
Waterway Management,” the facility shall be designed in accordance with Chapter
105 and meet the regulations of Chapter 105 concerning dam safety which may be
required to pass storms larger than 100-year event.
   3.   Any facilities that constitute water obstructions (e.g., culverts,
bridges, outfalls or stream enclosures), and any work involving wetlands as
directed in 25 Pa.Code, Chapter 105, regulations (as amended or replaced from
time to time by DEP), shall be designed in accordance with Chapter 105 and will
require a permit from DEP. Any other drainage conveyance facility that does not
fall under Chapter 105 regulations must be able to convey, without damage to
the drainage structure or roadway, runoff from the 25-year design storm with a
minimum 1.0 foot of freeboard measured below the lowest point along the top of
the roadway. Roadway crossings located within designated floodplain areas must
be able to convey runoff from a 100-year design storm with a minimum 1.0 foot
of freeboard measured below the lowest point along the top of the roadway. Any
facility that constitutes a dam as defined in 25 Pa.Code, Chapter 105,
regulations may require a permit under dam safety regulations. Any facility
located within a PennDOT right-of-way must meet PennDOT minimum design
standards and permit submission requirements.
   4.   Conveyance facilities to or exiting from stormwater management
facilities (i.e., detention basins) shall be designed to convey the design flow
to or from that structure. Roadway crossings located within designated
floodplain areas must be able to convey runoff from a 100-year design storm.
Any facility located within a PennDOT right-of- way must meet PennDOT minimum
design standards and permit submission requirements.
   5.   Storm sewers must be able to convey proposed conditions runoff from a
25-year design storm without surcharging inlets, where appropriate.
   6.   Adequate erosion protection shall be provided along all open channels,
and at all points of discharge.
   7.   The design of all stormwater management facilities shall incorporate
sound engineering principles and practices. The Borough shall reserve the right
to disapprove any design that would result in the creation of, exacerbation or
continuation of an adverse hydrologic or hydraulic condition within the
watershed.
(Ord. 362, 3/7/2005, § 308)
§ 23-309.   Calculation Methodology.
   Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using
either the rational method or a soil cover complex methodology.
   A.   (1)   Any stormwater runoff calculations shall use generally accepted
calculation technique that is based on the NRCS soil cover complex method.
Table 23-309-1 summarizes acceptable computation methods. It is assumed that
all methods will be selected by the applicant based on the individual
limitations and suitability of each method for a particular site.
      (2)   The Borough may allow the use of the rational method to estimate
peak discharges from drainage areas that contain less than 20 acres. The
rational method is recommended for drainage areas under 20 acres.
   B.   All calculations consistent with this Chapter using the soil cover
complex method shall use the appropriate design rainfall depths for the various
return period storms according to the region for which they are located as
presented in
Table 23-B-1 in Appendix 23-B of this Chapter. If a hydrologic computer model
such as HEC-1 or HEC-HMS is used for stormwater runoff calculations, then the
duration of rainfall shall be 24 hours. The SCS “S” curve shown in Figure 23-B-
1,
Appendix 23-B of this Chapter shall be used for the rainfall distribution.
   C.   Runoff Curve Numbers (CN) for both existing and proposed conditions to
be used in the soil cover complex method shall be obtained from
Table 23-B-2 in Appendix 23-B of this Chapter. For the purposes of existing
conditions flow rate determination, undeveloped land shall be considered as
“meadow” in good condition, unless the natural ground cover generates a lower
curve number or Rational ‘C’ value (i.e., forest), as listed in
Table 23-B-2 or
23-B-3 in Appendix 23-B of this Chapter. For areas of prior mining disturbance
(i.e. strip mining, mine spoil areas, etc.), the designer must first locate in
which of mining affect area the site is located, using the Management District
Map in
Appendix 23-D. The appropriate curve number or Rational ‘C’ value from
Table 23-B-2 or
Table 23-B-3 should then be used.
   D.   All calculations using the rational method shall use rainfall
intensities consistent with appropriate times of concentration for overland
flow and return periods from the Design Storm Curves from PA Department of
Transportation Design Rainfall Curves (1986) (Figures
23-B-2 to
23-B-3). Times of concentration for overland flow shall be calculated using the
methodology presented in Chapter 3 of Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
NRCS, TR-55 (as amended or replaced from time to time by NRCS). Times of
concentration for channel and pipe flow shall be computed using Manning’s
equation.
   E.   The designer shall consider that the runoff from proposed sites graded
to the subsoil will not have the same runoff conditions as the site under
existing conditions even if topsoiled and seeded. The designer shall increase
their proposed condition CN or C value to reflect proposed soil conditions by
using CN or C value of one HSG lower than existing site soils.
   F.   Runoff coefficients (c) for both existing and proposed conditions for
use in the Rational method shall be obtained from Table
23-B-3 in Appendix 23-B of this Chapter.
   G.   (1)   Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning equation shall be
used for hydraulic computations, and to determine the capacity of open
channels, pipes and storm sewers. Values for Manning’s roughness coefficient
(n) shall be consistent with
Table 23-B-4 in Appendix 23-B of the ordinance.
      (2)   Outlet structures for stormwater management facilities shall be
designed to meet the performance standards of this Chapter using any generally
accepted hydraulic analysis technique or method.
   H.   The design of any stormwater detention facilities intended to meet the
performance standards of this Chapter shall be verified by routing the design
storm hydrograph through these facilities using the storage-indication method.
For drainage areas greater than 200 acres in size, the design storm hydrograph
shall be computed using a calculation method that produces a full hydrograph.
The municipality may approve the use of any generally accepted full hydrograph
approximation technique that shall use a total runoff volume that is consistent
with the volume from a method that produces a full hydrograph.

(Ord. 362, 3/7/2005, § 309)
§ 23-310.   Need for Basins, Storm Sewers, Culverts, Bridges and Other
Structural Installations.
   Basins, storm sewers, culverts, bridges and other structural installations
shall be provided to safely accommodate stormwater, where natural nonstructural
practices are not feasible and where stormwater flows otherwise would have
adverse impact on the environment and the general welfare of the Borough and
its citizens in order to:
   A.   Maintain natural hydrologic regimes of streams and watercourses. Such
flows may be redirected as required, subject to the approval of PADEP.
   B.   Promote drainage of all low points along the line of streets. Overflow
swales shall be designed to convey the full 100-year storm flows away from all
street low points. These swales shall be located to prevent flooding of the
downslope lots.
   C.   Intercept stormwater runoff along streets at intervals reasonably
related to the extent and grade of the area drained, and to prevent substantial
flow of water across intersections or flooding of intersections during the
design storm stipulated elsewhere in this Section.
   D.   Insure adequate and unimpeded flow of stormwater under driveways in,
near, or across natural watercourses or drainage swales. Suitable pipes or
other waterway openings shall be provided as necessary.
(Ord. 362, 3/7/2005, § 310)
§ 23-311.   Design of Basins (Detention and Retention), Storm Sewers, Culverts,
Bridges and Other Structural Installations.
   1.   Standards for conventional basins shall meet requirements listed in
this Section.
      A.   Basins shall be installed prior to any earthmoving or land
disturbances that they will serve. The phasing of their construction shall be
noted in the erosion and sedimentation control narrative and on the E&S plan.
Permanent vegetation shall be established prior to denuding any other land,
unless the basin functions as an E&S device.
      B.   Energy dissipaters and/or level spreaders shall be installed at
points where pipes or drainage ways discharge from basins. Multiple outlet
structures and multiple outlet piping from the basin may be required by the
Borough to reduce the impact of point discharges.
      C.   The following slope restrictions shall apply to basins:
         (1)   Exterior slopes of compacted soil shall not exceed 1 foot
vertical for 3 feet horizontal, and may be further reduced if the soil has
unstable characteristics.
         (2)   Interior slopes of the basin shall not exceed 1 foot vertical in
3 feet horizontal except with approval of the Borough.
            (a)   Where maximum water depth will not exceed 3 feet.
            (b)   When a 2-inch rainfall in 1 hour will not exceed the capacity
of the basin in 1 hour.
            (c)   Where concrete, stone or brick walls are used with side
slopes proposed to be steeper than 1 foot vertical in 3 feet horizontal, in
which case the basin shall be fenced by a permanent fence 42 inches in height
and a ramp of durable, nonslip materials for maintenance vehicles shall be
provided for access into the basin.
         (3)   The minimum bottom slope shall be 3 percent for grass, and 0.75
percent for concrete paving. One percent may be used for grass if an underdrain
system is provided. A concrete low flow channel may be required for basins
where the distance from the inlet pipe to the outlet structure exceeds 100
feet, depending upon site conditions. The minimum channel width shall be 4
feet, The channel shall be constructed of 4-inch thick concrete (3,300 psi 28-
day strength) over inches of PennDOT No. 2A stone.
      D.   Basins shall also be designed to meet the following requirements:
         (1)   The minimum top of berm width shall be 8 feet.
         (2)   Outlet pipes shall have a minimum diameter of 12 inches. For
pipe lengths exceeding 100 feet, the minimum diameter shall be 15 inches.
         (3)   Properly spaced anti-seep collars shall be installed on all
basin outlet pipes. Design calculations shall be provided.
         (4)   All basins shall be constructed with a compacted relatively
impervious (Unified Soil Classification CL-ML or CL) key trench and core. The
key trench shall extend at least 2 feet into undisturbed subsoil (below topsoil
layer). The minimum bottom width of the trench shall be 6 feet and the minimum
top width of the core shall be 4 feet. The side slopes of the compacted core
and trench shall not exceed 1 horizontal to 1 vertical, and the top elevation
of the core shall be set at or above the 25-year design water elevation. The
Borough may require an impermeable liner to be installed up to the 100-year
design water surface elevation.
      E.   Basin Outlet Structures and Emergency Spillways.
         (1)   Outlet structures within basins which will control peak
discharge flows and distribute the flows by pipes to discharge areas shall be
constructed primarily of concrete or masonry material and shall have child-
proof, nonclogging trash racks over all design openings, except those openings
designed to carry perennial stream flows. Trash rack material should be epoxy
coated galvanized or stainless steel. Other materials are subject to the
approval of the Borough.
         (2)   Six inches of freeboard shall be provided between the crest of
the primary outlet structure and the invert of the emergency spillway.
         (3)   Emergency spillways shall be constructed in undisturbed earth
wherever possible. When constructed in fill, sod, pre-cast concrete paving
blocks, concrete or permanent erosion control matting shall be used. Design
calculations shall be submitted indicating that the specified material can
withstand velocities based on the 100-year design storm event. When using sod,
it shall be applied along the inside slope above the 25-year water surface
elevation, along the face and sides of the spillway and down the outside slope
to existing grade. Emergency spillways shall be designed to safely convey the
100 year basin inflow hydrograph through the basin assuming the principal
outlet is completely blocked and the basin water surface elevation is equal to
the spillway invert elevation.
      F.   Basin inlet and outlet structures should be located at maximum
distances from one another. The Borough may require a rock filter berm or rock-
filled gabions between inlet and outlet areas when the distance is deemed
insufficient for sediment trappings.
      G.   Permanent grasses or stabilization measures shall be established on
the sides of all earthen basins by hydroseeding within 5 days of initial
construction (or conversion from sediment basin or sediment trap). The Borough
may require jute or erosion control matting to be installed inside the basin or
on the basin embankment.
      H.   (1)   Stormwater runoff shall discharge to a suitable natural
drainage course (except where prohibited by riparian buffer area regulations of
this Section) or storm sewer system.
         (2)   Where not possible or not permitted, level spreading devices or
other suitable facilities (i.e., swale) shall be designed with sufficient
capacity to convey the 100-year storm event without creating any safety,
flooding or property hazard. Securing of necessary drainage easements for this
purpose shall be the sole responsibility of the developer.
      I.   The Borough may require soil samples from the site to be analyzed to
determine if these soils are suitable for berm embankment construction. If in
the opinion of the Borough the soils are found to be unsuitable, the developer
shall import suitable soils for constructing the basin.
   2.   Swale Design.
      A.   Grass swales not specifically designed as BMP devices shall have a
minimum bottom slope of 2 percent and their depth shall be deep enough to
convey the 25-year storm event with a minimum of 1.0 foot of freeboard. Swale
linings shall be designed based on the 10-year velocity. Swales shall have
sufficient freeboard to convey the 100-year storm discharge without creating
any safety or property hazard.
      B.   Swales, when located outside of the Borough right-of-way, shall be
located within an easement not less than 20 feet wide, but of sufficient width
to allow access for maintenance and to convey all storms up to and including
the 100-year storm. A note on the plan shall indicate that the easement allows
the Borough the right, though not the responsibility, to perform needed
maintenance and/or repairs and backcharge the maintainer or lien the property
of the maintainer.
   3.   Storm Sewer Design.
      A.   Where storm sewer pipe and inlets are required, they shall be placed
immediately in front of the curb within the right-of-way. Any storm sewer pipe
which outlets on private residential property may only discharge to the rear
yard and must be a minimum of 50 feet beyond habitable structures.
      B.   Storm sewers shall have a minimum diameter of 15 inches and only
reinforced cement concrete pipe shall be used where the Borough will have
ultimate maintenance responsibility. The minimum grade of the pipe shall be ½
percent. For storm sewers not to be maintained by the Borough, smooth bore
corrugated polyethylene pipe up to a maximum diameter of 48 inches may be used
in lieu of concrete. The minimum diameter shall be 15 inches and the minimum
grade shall be ½ percent.
      C.   All storm sewer, sanitary sewers, water pipes and other utilities
beneath a paved surface shall be bedded and backfilled with PennDOT No, 2A
stone. This backfill shall be placed in 6 inch lifts and solidly compacted to
the satisfaction of the Borough.
      D.   In carbonate areas, watertight pipe connections are required and
appropriate specifications shall be specified on the plans.
      E.   Headwalls, endwalls or end sections shall be required on all open
pipes, shall be of concrete construction and shall be set on a minimum of 12
inches of AASHTO No. 57 (PennDOT 2B) coarse aggregate.
      F.   All storm sewers shall be constructed per PennDOT specifications as
outlined in Publication 408, Design Manual, Part 2, Highway Design and
Standards for Roadway Construction, RC-Series unless otherwise dictated by the
Borough Code.
      G.   Any changes in alignment shall be straight sections connected by
inlets or manholes.
      H.   Precast inlet tops and boxes shall meet the requirements of PennDOT
Publication 408. PennDOT type “C” precast concrete Inlet tops are to be
provided with a 5-inch x 24-inch Cast Iron “Dump No Waste-Drains To Waterway”
(with ½ inch raised lettering) plate with trout logo as manufactured by E.
Jordan Iron Works or approved equal. Bottom of covers are to be clearly marked
with Grade of Iron (ASTM A48, Class 35B), product number and date of
manufacture.
      I.   The words “Dump No Waste-Drains To Waterway” in 1¼ inch raised
letters with bass logo shall be cast or stamped into the stormsewer manhole
covers as manufactured by E. Jordan Iron Works or approved equal, Bottom of
covers are to be clearly marked with Grade of Iron (ASTM A48, Class 35B),
product number and date of manufacture.
      J.   When there is a change in pipe size through an inlet, the top inside
elevation of the outlet pipe shall be at or below the top inside elevations of
all incoming pipes.
      K.   Storm sewer sizes shall be determined based upon the following
design storm frequencies:
         (1)   Twenty-five years in all other subdivisions or land
developments, unless otherwise specified by the Borough.
         (2)   The design of storm sewer systems within the drainage area of
detention or retention facilities must be analyzed for adequacy during the 100-
year storm, including the effects of the control facility tailwater. This may
require a hydraulic grade line analysis. When approved by the Borough, overflow
swales may be provided at low points in streets to safely convey the full 100
year peak flow to the control facility, in lieu of providing the full capacity
in the storm sewer.
      L.   Storm sewer design shall be based upon PennDOT design methods. Inlet
efficiency and bypass flow shall be determined for all inlets, and the gutter
flow spread shall not exceed ½ the travel lane width or to a maximum of 8 feet
where parking is permitted. The Borough may require that a hydraulic grade line
analysis be performed on storm sewer systems.
      M.   Culverts shall be evaluated for inlet and outlet control
restrictions.
      N.   Rainfall intensity curves and other hydraulic design data, provided
by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and/or manufacturers of storm
drainage structures shall be used for design purposes.
      O.   Manholes and/or inlets shall not be more than 300 feet apart on pipe
sizes up to 24 inches, and not more than 400 feet apart on larger sizes.
      P.   Inlets, manholes, covers and frames shall conform to Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation specifications. At street intersections, every
attempt should be made to place inlets in the tangent and not in the curved
portion of the curbing.
      Q.   When precast concrete inlets or manholes are used within a street, a
minimum of two courses of brick masonry or grade ring shall be placed to bring
the grate or cover to proper elevation. If brick is used, every third vertical
joint shall be left open; if grade rings are used, the horizontal joints shall
be left open to facilitate drainage of the base course. Geotextile fabric shall
be wrapped around the outside of the brick masonry or grade rings to prevent
the washing of fines into the structure.
   4.   Roof Drains.
      A.   Stormwater roof drains shall not discharge water directly over a
sidewalk or into any sanitary sewer line.
      B.   Except for single-family homes, proposed roof drains and collector
locations shall be shown on the storm drainage plans. Roof drains and
collectors shall meet all appropriate Borough Code.
   5.   Design of Bridges and Culverts.
      A.   Bridges and culverts shall have ample waterway to carry the design
flows, based on a minimum storm frequency of 25 years, unless a larger design
flow is required by PADEP. One hundred year water depths shalt not exceed 6
inches above the roadway centerline elevation. Bridge and/or culvert
construction shall be in accordance with the PennDOT specifications and shall
meet the requirements of the PADEP. The appropriate permits and approvals must
be acquired by the applicant prior to final plan approval.
      B.   Culverts shall be provided with wing walls and constructed for the
full width of the right-of-way. If the Borough determines that the character of
the road is expected to change for future planning, the cartway of the bridge
shall be made to anticipate this condition. On each side of the bridge cartway,
the bridge railing must be set back from the edge of the final cartway and this
area may be used to place sidewalks, bike trails, etc.
(Ord. 362, 3/7/2005, § 311)
§ 23-312.   Various Other Site Development Requirements.
   1.   Procedures for protecting soils or geologic structures with water
supply potential from contamination by surface water or other disruption by
construction activity shall be established in consultation with the Borough and

information submitted by the applicant.
      C.   The amount of the deposit to the fund shall be converted to present
worth of the annual series values. The Borough Engineer shall determine the
present worth equivalents, which shall be subject to the approval of the
Borough Council.
   2.   If a stormwater management facilities and/or best management practices
facility is proposed that also serves as a recreation facility (e.g.,
ballfield, lake), the Borough may reduce or waive the amount of the maintenance
fund deposit based upon the value of the land for public recreation purpose.
   3.   If at some future time a stormwater control or BMP (whether publicly or
privately owned) is eliminated due to the installation of storm sewers or other
storage facility, the unused portion of the maintenance fund deposit will be
applied to the cost of abandoning the facility and connecting to the storm
sewer system or other facility. Any amount of the deposit remaining after the
costs of abandonment are paid will be returned to the depositor.
   4.   If stormwater controls or BMPs are accepted by the municipality for
dedication, the Borough may require persons installing stormwater controls or
BMPs to pay a specified amount to the Borough Stormwater Control and BMP
Operation and Maintenance Fund, to help defray costs of operations and
maintenance activities. The amount may be determined as follows:
      A.   If the stormwater control or BMP is to be owned and maintained by
the Borough, the amount shall cover the estimated costs for operations and
maintenance for 10 years, as determined by the Borough.
      B.   The amount shall then be converted to present worth of the annual
series values.
   5.   If a stormwater control or BMP is proposed that also serves as a
recreation facility (e.g., ball field, lake), the Borough may adjust the amount
due accordingly.
   6.   Long-Term Maintenance. The Borough shall require applicants to pay a
fee to the Borough Stormwater Maintenance Fund to cover long term maintenance
of stormwater control and best management practices.
   7.   Stormwater Related Problems. The Borough may require applicants to pay

§ 24-101.   Definitions.
   Unless otherwise expressly stated, the following words and phrases shall be
construed throughout this Part to have the meaning indicated in this Part. The

is the place in which a man has voluntarily fixed the habitation of himself and
his family, not for a mere special or limited purpose, but with the present

place where its functions are discharged.

disability other than regular wages received during a period of sickness,
disability or retirement or payments arising under workmen’s compensation acts,
occupational disease acts and similar legislation, or payments commonly
recognized as old age benefits, retirement pay or pension paid to persons
retired from service after reaching a specific age or after a stated period of
employment or payments commonly known as public assistance, or unemployment
compensation payments made by any governmental agency or payments to reimburse
expenses or payments made by employers or labor unions for wage and salary
supplemental programs, including, but not limited to, programs covering
hospitalization, sickness, disability or death, supplemental unemployment
benefits, strike benefits, Social Security and retirement.

agency designated by the Council of the Borough to collect and administer the
tax on earned income and net profits.

governmental body or unit or agency, or any other entity employing one or more
persons for a salary, wage, commission or other compensation.
   Net profits–the net income from the operation of a business, profession or
other activity, except corporations, after provision for all costs and expenses
incurred in the conduct thereof, determined either on a cash or accrual basis,
in accordance with the accounting system used in such business, profession, or
other activity, but without deduction of taxes based on income.

§ 24-204.   Imposition of Tax; Interest.
   1.   Every person who makes, executes, delivers, accepts or presents for
recording any document or in whose behalf any document is made, executed,
delivered, accepted or presented for recording, shall be subject to pay for and
in respect to the transaction or any part thereof, a tax at the rate of 1
percent of the value of the real estate represented by such document, which tax
shall be payable at the earlier of the time the document is presented for
recording or within 30 days of acceptance of such document or within 30 days of
becoming an acquired company.
   2.   The payment of the tax imposed herein shall be evidenced by the
affixing of an official stamp or writing by the Recorder of Deeds whereon the
date of the payment of the tax, amount of the tax and the signature of the
collecting agent shall be set forth.
   3.   It is the intent of this Part that the entire burden of the tax imposed
herein on a person or transfer shall not exceed the limitations prescribed in
the Local Tax Enabling Act, Act of December 31, 1965, P.L. 1257, 53 P.S. §
6924.101 et seq., so that if any other political subdivision shall impose or
hereafter shall impose such tax on the same person or transfer then the tax
levied by the Borough of Telford under the authority of that Act shall during
the time such duplication of the tax exists, except as hereinafter otherwise
provided, be one-half of the rate and such one-half shall become effective
without any action on the part of the Borough; provided, however, that the
Borough and any other political subdivision which imposes such tax on the same
person or transfer may agree that, instead of limiting, their respective rates
to one-half of the rate herein provided, they will impose respectively
different rates, the total of which shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted
under the Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. § 6924.101 et seq.
   4.   Any tax imposed by this Part that is not paid by the date the tax is
due shall bear interest as prescribed for interest on delinquent municipal
claims under the Act of May 16, 1923, P.L. 207, No. 153, 53 P.S. §701 et seq.,
as amended, known as the “Municipal Claims and Tax Liens Act.” The interest
rate imposed shall be the lesser of the interest rate imposed upon delinquent
Commonwealth taxes as provided in § 806 of the Act of April 9, 1929, P.S. 343,
No. 176, 72 P.S. § 806, as amended, known as the “Fiscal Code,” or the maximum
interest rate permitted under the Municipal Claims and Tax Liens Act for tax
claims. [Ord. 401]
   5.   The tax imposed under this Part and all applicable interest and
penalties shall be administered, collected and enforced under the Act of
December 31, 1965, P.S. 1257, No. 511, 53 P.S. §6924.101 et seq., known as the
“Local Tax Enabling Act;” provided, that if the correct amount of the tax is
not paid by the last date prescribed for timely payment, the Township, pursuant
to §1102-D of the Tax Reform Code of 1971, 72 P.S. § 8102-D, authorizes and
directs the Department of Revenue of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to
determine, collect and enforce the tax, interest, and penalties. [Ord. 401]

   The United States, the Commonwealth or any of their instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions shall be exempt from payment of the tax

however, relieve any other party to a transaction from liability for the tax.
(Ord. 255, 12/1/1986, § 105)
§ 24-206.   Excluded Transactions.
   1.   The tax imposed by §

or interest therein subject to such transfer was acquired by the husband and
wife or husband or wife prior to the granting of the final decree in divorce,

grantee claims an exemption from taxation under this clause.

person of earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold the local
services tax from the person under clause (3).
         (3)   If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under clause (2),
the employer shall withhold the tax for the remainder of that calendar year.
The employer shall withhold from the person, for the first payroll period after
receipt of the notification under clause (2), a lump sum equal to the amount of
tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption claimed by the
person under this subsection, plus the per payroll amount due for that first
payroll period. The amount of tax withheld per payroll period for the remaining
payroll periods in that calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for
other employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to withholding
of the tax under this clause is subsequently severed in that calendar year, the
person shall be liable for any outstanding balance of tax due, and the
political subdivision may pursue collection under this article.
         (4)   Except as provided in clause (2), it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating exemption
certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or exempting any employee
from the local services tax.
      C.   Refunds. The Borough in consultation with the Collector and DCED,
shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims for any tax paid
by any person who is eligible for exemption, which procedures shall be in
accord with provisions of the general municipal law relating to refunds of
overpayments and interest on overpayments. Refunds made within 75 days of a
refund request or 75 days after the last day the employer is required to remit
the tax for the last quarter of the calendar year, whichever is later, shall
not be subject to interest. No refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a
calendar year that do not exceed one dollar ($1): The Borough or the Collector
shall determine eligibility for exemption and provide refunds to exempt
persons.
(Ord. 402, 11/17/2014, § 1)
§ 24-504.   Duty of employers to collect.
      A.   Each employer within the political subdivision, as well as those
employers situated outside the political subdivision but who engage in business
within the political subdivision, is hereby charged with the duty of collecting
the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or performing for him within
the political subdivision and making a return and payment thereof to the
Collector. Further, each employer is hereby authorized to deduct this tax for
each employee in his or her employ, whether said employee is paid by salary,
wage or commission and whether or not all such services are performed within
the political subdivision.
      B.   A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro
rata share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person for a
payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax levied for
the calendar year by the number of payroll periods established by the employer
for the calendar year. For purposes of determining the pro rata share, an
employer shall round down the amount of the tax collected each payroll period
to the nearest one-hundredth of a dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made
on a payroll period basis for each payroll period in which the person is
engaging in an occupation, except as provided in paragraph D of this section,
For purposes of this paragraph, combined rate shall mean the aggregate annual
rate of the tax levied by the school district and the municipality.
      C.   No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax
by more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
      D.   In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement from a
principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the length of the
payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a statement from the
employee that the pay statement is from the employee's principal employer and
the employee will notify other employers of a change in principal place of
employment within 2 weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be
provided on the form approved by DCED.
      E.   The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The political subdivision shall provide a taxpayer a
receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
      F.   No employer shall he held liable for failure to withhold the tax or
for the payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the
employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the employee's
principal office or where the employee is principally employed. Further, an
employer shall not be liable for payment of the local services tax in an amount
exceeding the amount withheld by the employer if the employer complies with the
provisions of paragraph B of section 24-233 of this article and this section
and remits the amount so withheld in accordance with this article.
      G.   Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30
days after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
(Ord. 402, 11/17/2014, § 1)
§ 24-505.   Returns.
   Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her to
an employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer shall
be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had been
originally levied against the employer.
(Ord. 402, 11/17/2014, § 1)
§ 24-506.   Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
   In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted and paid
over to the Collector on or before the thirtieth day following the end of each
calendar quarter of each such tax year.
(Ord. 402, 11/17/2014, § 1)
§ 24-507.   Self-employed individuals.
   Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind or
engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of employment
within the political subdivision shall be required to comply with this article
and pay the pro rata portion of the tax due to the Collector on or before the
thirtieth day following the end of each quarter.
(Ord. 402, 11/17/2014, § 1)
§ 24-508.   Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or employed in more
than one political subdivision.
      A.   The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first
day the person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is, concurrent
employment, or an occupation which requires the person working in more than one
political subdivision during a payroll period, the priority of claim to collect
the local services tax shall be in the following order:
         (1)   First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his
or her principal office or is principally employed;
         (2)   Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides
and works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
         (3)   Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed
and which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
   In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes prima facie
certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
(Ord. 402, 11/17/2014, § 1)
§ 24-509.   Nonresidents subject to tax.
   All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the political subdivision but who perform services of
any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the political
subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject themselves
to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under this article
with the same force and effect as though they were residents of the political
subdivision. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation within the
political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential employer may, for the
purpose of this article, be considered a self- employed person, and in the
event his or her tax is not paid, the political subdivision shall have the
option of proceeding against either the employer or employee for the collection
of this tax as hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 402, 11/17/2014, § 1)
§ 24-510.   Administration of tax.
      A.   The Collector shall be appointed by resolution of the political
subdivision. It shall be the duty of the Collector to accept and receive
payments of this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount received
by him from each employer or self- employed person, together with the date the
tax was received.
      B.   The Collector is hereby charged with the administration and
enforcement of this article and is hereby charged and empowered, subject to
municipal approval, to proscribe, adopt and promulgate rules and regulations
relating to any matter pertaining to the administration and enforcement of this
article, including provisions for the examination of payroll records of any
employer subject to this article, the examination and correction of any return
made in compliance with this article and any payment alleged or found to be
incorrect or as to which overpayment is claimed or found to have occurred. Any
person aggrieved by any decision of the Collector shall have the right to
appeal consistent with the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights under Act 50 of 1998.
      C.   The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return made by
an employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax due. Each employer
is hereby directed and required to give the Collector the means, facilities and
opportunity for such examination.
(Ord. 402, 11/17/2014, § 1)
§ 24-511.   Suits for collection.
      A.   In the event that any tax under this article remains due or unpaid
30 days after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for the
recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this article, together with
interest and penalty.
      B.   If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate
of 6% on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning with the due date
of the tax and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of such tax for
nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery of this tax or other
appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable therefor shall, in
addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of collection.
(Ord. 402, 11/17/2014, § 1)
§ 24-512.   Violations and penalties.
   Whoever makes any false or untrue statement on any return required by this
article, or whoever refuses inspection of the books, records or accounts in his
or her custody and control setting forth the number of employees subject to
this tax who are in his or her employment, or whoever fails or refuses to file
any return required by this article shall be guilty of a violation and, upon
conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $600 and
costs of prosecution, and, in default of payment of such fine and costs, to
imprisonment for not more than 30 days. The action to enforce the penalty
herein prescribed may be instituted against any person in charge of the
business of any employer who shall have failed or who refuses to file a return
required by this article.
(Ord. 402, 11/17/2014, § 1)
§ 24-513.   Interpretation.
      A.   Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to empower the
political subdivision to levy and collect the tax hereby imposed on any
occupation not within the taxing power of the political subdivision under the
Constitution of the United States and the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania.
      B.   If the tax hereby imposed under the provisions of this article shall
be held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of the
Constitution of the United States or of the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania as to any individual, the decision of the court shall not affect
or impair the right to impose or collect said tax or the validity of the tax so
imposed on other persons or individuals as herein provided.

determines that such a review is necessary. In deciding all applications for
conditional uses Borough Council should be guided by the following standards
and criteria:
      A.   The proposed use should not cause undue noise, glare or pollution of
the surrounding areas, as determined by the Borough Council, upon
recommendation by the Borough Engineer and Borough Planning Commission.
      B.   Anticipated levels of traffic congestion, noise, glare and pollution
created by the proposed use will be similar to the levels created by the uses
permitted in that district.
      C.   Any visual or functional conflicts between the proposed use and
surrounding existing uses shall be kept to a minimum. Increased setbacks,
planted buffers, wooden fences or other measures may be required by the Borough
Council to minimize potential conflicts, or to reduce anticipated levels of
noise. Visual and functional conflicts include, but are not limited to, loading
docks, parking lots, service driveways or large nonresidential buildings
adjacent to residential neighborhoods or open space areas, without adequate
buffering.
(Ord. 379, 7/6/2009, § 403)
§ 27-404.   Prohibited Uses.
   1.   A use not listed as being permitted by right, special exception, or
conditional use in a particular zoning district is not permitted in that zoning
district.
   2.   No building may be erected, altered or used and no lot or premises may
be used for any trade, processing or business which is noxious or offensive by
reason of odor, dust, smoke, gas, vibration, illumination or noise, or which
constitutes a public hazard whether by fire, explosion or otherwise.
(Ord. 379, 7/6/2009, § 404)
§ 27-405.   Uses Subject to Other Regulations.
   1.   Uses permitted by right or as special exceptions or conditional uses

lot size, lot width, building area, easements and provisions for off-street
parking and loading and to such other provisions as are specified in other
Parts hereof.
   2.   No zoning permit shall be issued for a use or structure until a

servicing authority.
(Ord. 379, 7/6/2009, § 405)
§ 27-406.   Travel Trailers, Temporary Trailers and other Portable Storage

   1.   Travel trailers and temporary trailers are prohibited from being placed
on an unpaved area in the front yard of a property. These vehicles or units
kept on-site must be kept in the driveway or paved, off-street surface on the
property at the furthest accessible point from the street. When placed on the
driveway or paved area in the side or rear yard, they shall be located at least
5 feet from any property line. In no case may one of these vehicles or units be
placed in the street, create a sight obstruction for vehicular or pedestrian
traffic, nor block sidewalks.
   2.   Portable storage units (PODS or similar) are permitted when consistent
with the following standards:
      A.   Permit Required. Application; insurance; fee: before placing a
portable storage unit on his or her property, a person must submit an
application and receive a permit from the Borough. An insurance certificate
providing liability insurance in the amount of $500,000 provided by the company
supplying the portable storage unit must accompany the application, with the
Borough of Telford named as an additional insured party. However, this is not
required to be submitted if the Borough already has a certificate from the same
company on file that was submitted within the past calendar year. Fees for a
30-day permit shall be determined by the fee schedule. Applications shall be
obtained from the Code Enforcement office.
      B.   Duration. Permits will be granted for a period of 30 days in any one
12- month period (per dwelling unit).
      C.   Location. Portable storage units are prohibited from being placed on
an unpaved area in the front yard of a property. Portable storage units kept
on-site must be kept in the driveway or paved, off-street surface on the
property at the furthest accessible point from the street. Where possible, the
unit shall be placed on a paved surface to the rear or side of the residential
structure. When placed on the driveway or paved area in the side or rear yard,
portable storage units shall be located at least 5 feet from any property line.
      D.   Number. Only one portable storage unit may be placed at any property
at one time. If multiple units are used sequentially on a property, the permit
shall apply to all cumulatively.
      E.   Advertising. Advertising is prohibited on a portable storage unit,
with the exception of the name and contact information of the unit’s supplier.
      F.   Hazardous Materials. The use of portable storage units for storage
of hazardous materials is prohibited. The Borough Code Enforcement Officer may
inspect the portable storage unit to ensure no such materials are being stored
inside.
      G.   Condition of Portable Storage Unit. A portable storage unit with
holes, breaks, tears or large areas of rust, in the opinion of the Code
Enforcement Officer, may not be placed on or in front of any property.

§ 27-408.   Lots of Record.
   A lot, whether improved or unimproved, which is of public record in single
and separate ownership at the time of enactment of this Chapter may be used for
a permitted use in the district in which it is located.
      A.   Reduction of Lot Area. No lot shall be so reduced that the area of
the lot, or the dimensions of the required open spaces shall be less than
prescribed by this Chapter.
      B.   Modification of Front Yard Requirements. Where an unimproved lot of
record is situated on the same street frontage with two improved lots or one
unimproved and one improved lot, the front yard requirement for that district
may be modified so that the front yard shall be an average of the existing
yard.
      C.   Projection into Required Yards. No building and no part of a
building shall be erected within or shall project into any required yard in any

         (1)   An unenclosed porch under roof, canopy, or trellis, not more
than 14 feet in height, cannot encroach a distance of more than 10 feet into a
required yard, provided that in no case shall this encroachment extend into
such yard more than 40 percent of the required depth of the yard.
         (2)   A terrace, deck, patio or landing place, not covered by a roof,
canopy, or trellis, which does not extend above the level of the first floor of
the building cannot encroach a distance of more than 12 feet into a required
yard, provided that this encroachment is not more than 40 percent of the
required minimum depth or width of the yard.

may project not more than 3 feet into a required yard.
         (6)   An unattached garage which fronts on an alley and which is
accessory to a residential building may be erected within the required rear or
side yards provided that it meets the following requirements:
            (a)   The maximum height of such garage be limited to 15 feet.
            (b)   For those lots 22 feet wide or less, a side yard shall not be
required.
            (c)   Lots greater than 22 feet, but less than 30 feet, one side
yard shall be required of no less than 3 feet.
            (d)   Lots greater than 30 feet, two side yards shall be required
of no less than 3 feet each.
            (e)   In those instances where a side yard setback is not provided,

structure abutting the neighboring property.
            (f)   The distance from the rear lot line shall not be less than 3
feet.
            (g)   The distance from a principal structure shall not be less
than 10 feet.
            (h)   An existing garage, which is nonconforming in respect to
setback requirements and which fronts on an existing alley, may be replaced or
reconstructed provided that the replacement structure is the same size as the
existing structure and shall not exceed the nonconformity anymore than the
structure being replaced and that a 3-foot apron be provided.

§ 27-409.   Obstructions to Vision and Sight Triangles at Intersections
Prohibited.
   On any lot, no wall, fence, sign or other structure shall be erected,
altered or maintained, and no hedge, tree, shrub or other growth shall be
planted or maintained over 3 feet in height, which will interfere with or
obstruct vehicular or pedestrian vision at any intersection of streets or any
street or crosswalk. Likewise, sight triangles extending outward from traffic
intersections shall be in no way obstructed or blocked from view, as outlined
above, so that a clear view is maintained for both vehicle and pedestrian
traffic.

Engineer and Borough Council that satisfactory provisions are made to prevent
traffic congestion and hazards to the surrounding area. Provisions shall be
made for safe and efficient ingress and egress to and from the development.
Borough Council may require a traffic impact study for any use in this district
when they determine, after consulting with the Borough Engineer, that such a
study is necessary to demonstrate the adequacy of the access points and streets
for accommodating the traffic generated by the proposed use. Existing
residential areas shall not be infringed upon by significant volumes of traffic
from the proposed use. Whenever a traffic impact study is required, the
preliminary plan shall be considered incomplete until the submission of the
traffic impact study. The traffic impact study shall be prepared by a

of the proposed use on the surrounding properties and neighborhood shall be
considered. The use shall not adversely affect the general welfare and orderly
development of the general neighborhood in which it is proposed.
         (1)   The scale, form and appearance of structures and open space
shall be compatible with the general character of any adjacent residential
area.
         (2)   The applicant shall submit profile drawings showing the views
into the proposed development from adjacent properties which are either used
for or zoned to permit single-family detached residential uses and which will
have a view of any proposed building greater than two stories in height.
            (a)   The views shall be taken from a point on each adjacent
property at the minimum rear yard setback (depending upon whether a rear or
side lot line abuts the proposed development) where the proposed development
will be most visible. The views shall be taken from a height of 5½ feet above
grade at the designated point. Depending upon specific circumstances of a
proposed development, the Borough reserves the right to request additional
profiles or to request the view be considered from a different point or from a
different height.
            (b)   The views shall be drawn with identical horizontal and
vertical scales. The scale shall be no less than 1 inch equals 20 feet.

            (d)   Wherever the views indicate that a building, or portion
thereof, greater that two stories will be clearly visible, the applicant shall
propose mitigating actions. These may include relocating the building, reducing
the building’s height, adding landscaping and/ or berms or other appropriate
actions to be approved by the Borough.

member as a Hearing Officer. The decision, or, where no decision is called for,
the findings shall be made by the Board; however, the appellant or the

decision of the hearing, waive decision or findings by the Board and accept the
decision or findings of the Hearing Officer as final.
   2.   The parties to the hearing shall be the Borough, any person affected by
the application who has made timely appearance of record before the Board, and

(Ord. 379, 7/6/2009, § 1808)
§ 27-1809.   Decision of the Zoning Hearing Board.
   1.   The Zoning Hearing Board or the Hearing Officer, as the case may be,
shall render a written decision or make written findings on the application
within 45 days of the last hearing before the Board or Hearing Officer. When
the application is contested or denied, each decision shall be accompanied by
findings of fact and conclusions based thereon together with the reasons
therefore. Conclusions based on any provisions of this Chapter or of any law,
ordinance, rule or regulation shall contain a reference to the provision relied
on and the reasons why the conclusion is found appropriate in the light of the
facts found.
   2.   If the hearing is conducted by a Hearing Officer, and there has been no
stipulation that his decision or findings are final, the Board shall make his
report and recommendations available to the parties within 45 days and the
parties shall be entitled to make written representations thereon to the Board
prior to final decision or entry of findings, and the Board’s decision shall be
entered no later than 30 days after the report of the Hearing Officer.
   3.   Where the Board fails to render the decision within the required
period, or fails to hold the required hearing within 60 days of application,
the decision shall be deemed to have been rendered in favor of the applicant
unless the applicant has agreed in writing or on the record to an extension of
time.
   4.   When a decision has been deemed to have been rendered in favor of the
applicant because of the failure of the Board to hold a hearing or render a
decision as provided, the Board shall give public notice of said deemed
decision within 10 days from the last day it could have met to render a
decision. Such notice shall be given in the manner prescribed by §27-1706
herein. If the Board shall fail to provide such notice, the applicant may do
so. Nothing in this subsection shall prejudice the right of any party opposing
the application to appeal the decision to a court of competent jurisdiction.
   5.   A copy of the final decision or findings shall be delivered to the
applicant personally or mailed within 1 week following the final decision. To
all other persons who have filed their name and address with the Board not

other wise, brief notice of the decision or findings and a statement of the
place at which the full decision or findings may be examined.
(Ord. 379, 7/6/2009, § 1809)
§ 27-1810.   Standards for Variances and Special Exceptions.
   1.   Variance. The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is
alleged that the provisions of this Chapter inflict unnecessary hardship upon
the applicant. The Board may require preliminary application to the Zoning
Officer. The Board may grant a variance provided that all of the following
findings are made where relevant in a given case:
      A.   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape, or
exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the property
and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of this Chapter
in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
      B.   That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of this Chapter and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
      C.   That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant.
      D.   That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
      E.   That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulation in issue.
      F.   In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of
this Chapter.
   2.   Special Exception. Where the Borough Council, in this Chapter, has
stated special exceptions to be granted or denied by the Zoning Hearing Board
pursuant to express standards and criteria, the Board shall hear and decide
requests for such special exceptions in accordance with such standards and
criteria. In granting any special exception, the Board may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes of this Chapter.
(Ord. 379, 7/6/2009, § 1810)
§ 27-1811.   Challenges and Appeals.
   Decisions on appeals and applications to the Board, other than variances and
special exceptions, shall be considered in accordance with the following:
      A.   Time Limitations.
         (1)   All appeals from determinations adverse to a landowner shall be
filed by the landowner within 30 days after notice of the determination is
issued.
         (2)   Appeals designed to secure reversal or limit the approval of any
application for development, preliminary or final, shall be filed with the
Board no later than 30 days after the application is approved by an appropriate
Borough officer or agency, unless the person filing proves that he had no
notice, knowledge or reason to believe that such approval had been given. If
such person succeeded to his interest after such approval, he shall be bound by
the knowledge of his predecessor in interest.
      B.   Stay of Proceedings. Upon filing of any proceeding before the Board,
and during its pendency, all land development pursuant to any challenged
ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning Officer or of any agency or body,
and all official action thereunder, shall be stayed unless the Zoning Officer,
agency or body certifies to the Board facts indicating imminent peril to life
or property, in which case the development or official action shall not be
stayed other than by a restraining order granted by the Board or by the court
having jurisdiction of zoning appeals.
(Ord. 379, 7/6/2009, § 1811)
§ 27-1812.   Expiration.
   Unless otherwise specified by the Board, a special exception or variance
shall expire if the applicant fails to obtain any and all permits within 6
months of the date of authorization thereof. The applicant may apply to the
Board for postponement of the expiration, providing in writing an explanation
of the reasons why permits were not obtained and a request for a postponement
to a specific date. All parties who originally received notification of the
Board’s decision in the matter shall be notified of the postponement of
expiration, at the applicant’s expense.
(Ord. 379, 7/6/2009, § 1812)
§ 27-1813.   Appeal to Court.
   Any persons aggrieved by the decision of the Board, or any taxpayer, or any
officer of the Borough, may within 30 days after any decision of the Board,
appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County or Bucks County, as
the case may be, by petition in such form as may be prescribed or authorized by
law.

§ 27-1901.   Violations.
   1.   It shall be the duty of the Zoning Officer to take cognizance of
violations of this Chapter. He shall investigate each violation which comes to
his attention whether by observation or communication. He shall order in
writing the correction of such conditions as are found to be in violation of
this Chapter.
   2.   Failure to secure a zoning permit, occupancy or use permit or Zoning
Hearing Board approval when required, previous to the erection, construction,
extension, or addition to a building shall be a violation of this Chapter.
(Ord. 379, 7/6/2009, § 1901)
§ 27-1902.   Enforcement Notice.
   An enforcement notice shall be sent to the owner of record of the parcel on
which the violation has occurred, to any person who has filed a written request
to receive enforcement notices regarding that parcel, and to any other person
requested in writing by the owner of record. The notice of enforcement shall
include:
      A.   The name of the owner of record and any other persons against whom
the Borough intends to take action.
      B.   The location of the property in violation.
      C.   The specific violation with a description of the requirements which
have not been met, citing in each instance the applicable provisions of this
Chapter.
      D.   The date before which the steps for compliance must be commenced and
the date before which the steps must be completed.
      E.   A statement describing the recipient’s right to appeal to the Zoning
Hearing Board within 10 days of receipt of the notice.
      F.   A statement that failure to comply with the notice within the time
specified, unless extended by appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board, constitutes a
violation, with possible sanctions clearly described.
(Ord. 379, 7/6/2009, § 1902)
§ 27-1903.   Enforcement Proceedings.
   1.   Causes of Action. In case any building, structure, landscaping or land
is, or is proposed to be erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered,
converted, maintained or used in violation of this Chapter, the Borough Council
or, with the approval of the Borough Council, an officer of the Borough, or any
aggrieved owner or tenant of real property who shows that his property or
person will be substantially affected by the alleged violation, in addition to
other remedies, may institute any appropriate action or proceeding to prevent,
restrain, correct or abate such building, structure, landscaping or land, or to
prevent, in or about such premises, any act, conduct, business or use
constituting a violation. When any such action is instituted by a landowner or
tenant, notice of that action shall be served upon the Borough at least 30 days
prior to the time the action is begun by serving a copy of the complaint to
Borough Council. No such action may be maintained until such notice has been
given. If a violation is not corrected within the period specified by the
enforcement notice, it shall be the duty of the Zoning Officer to notify
Borough Council, who shall take necessary action to correct the violation,
which action may include initiation of a civil enforcement proceeding.
   2.   Where, in the opinion of the Zoning Officer, a violation presents peril
to life or property, the Zoning Officer may recommend to Borough Council
immediate initiation of a civil enforcement proceeding.
(Ord. 379, 7/6/2009, § 1903)
§ 27-1904.   Enforcement Remedies.
   Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated or
permitted the violation of the provisions of this Chapter shall, upon being
found liable therefore in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the
Borough, pay a judgment of not more than $500 plus all court costs, including
reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Borough as a result thereof.
      A.   No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or payable until
the date of determination of a violation by the magisterial district judge. If
the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the Borough may
enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure.
      B.   Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate
violation, unless the magisterial district judge determining that there has
been a violation further determines that there was a good faith basis for the
person, partnership or corporation violating this Chapter to have believed that
there was no such violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have been
only one such violation until the 5th day following the date of the
determination of a violation by the magisterial district judge and thereafter
each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation.
      C.   The court of common pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of
stay, upon cause shown, tolling the per diem fine pending a final adjudication
of the violation and judgment.
      D.   All judgments, costs and reasonable attorney fees collected for the
violation of this Chapter shall be paid over to the Borough.

variances, Zoning Hearing Board certificates, and other charges associated with
the Zoning Ordinance shall be fixed in accordance with a fee schedule adopted
by a resolution of the Borough Council upon the enactment of this Chapter and
such schedule may be amended from time to time by resolution of the Borough
Council.
(Ord. 379, 7/6/2009, § 1905)
§ 27-1906.   Conflict.
   It is not intended by this Chapter to repeal, abrogate, annul or interfere
with any existing ordinances or enactment, or with any rule, regulation or
permit adopted or issued there under, except insofar as the same may be
inconsistent or in conflict with any of the provisions of this Chapter provided
that where this Chapter imposes greater restrictions upon the use of buildings
or land, or upon the height and bulk of buildings, or prescribes larger open
spaces than are required by the provisions of such ordinance, enactment, rule,
regulation or permit, then the provisions of this Chapter shall control.
(Ord. 379, 7/6/2009, § 1906)
Part 20
Amendments
§ 27-2001.   Amendment.
   The Borough Council of Telford may, from time to time, amend, supplement,
change, modify or repeal this Chapter, including the

law.
(Ord. 379, 7/6/2009, § 2001)
§ 27-2002.   Enactment of Zoning Ordinance Amendments.
   1.   The Borough Council may from time to time amend, supplement or repeal
any of the regulations and provisions of this Chapter. Pursuant to § 609 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10609 as amended, the
procedure for the preparation of a proposed zoning ordinance as set forth in §
607 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10607, is
hereby declared optional.
   2.   Before voting on the enactment of an amendment, the Borough Council
shall hold a public hearing thereon, pursuant to public notice. In addition, if
the proposed amendment involves a zoning map change, notice of said public
hearing shall be conspicuously posted by the Borough at points deemed
sufficient by the Borough along the perimeter of the tract to notify
potentially interested citizens. The affected tract or area shall be posted at
least 1 week prior to the date of the hearing.
   3.   In the case of an amendment other than that prepared by the Planning
Commission the Borough Council shall submit each amendment to the Planning
Commission at least 30 days prior to the hearing on the proposed amendment to
provide the Planning Commission an opportunity to submit recommendations.
   4.   If, after any public hearing held upon an amendment, the proposed
amendment is changed substantially, or is revised to include land previously
not affected by it, the Borough Council shall hold another public hearing,
pursuant to public notice, before proceeding to vote on the amendment.
   5.   At least 30 days prior to the public hearing on the amendment by the
Borough Council, the Borough shall submit the proposed amendment to the County
planning agency for recommendations.
   6.   Within 30 days after enactment, a copy of the amendment to this Chapter
shall be forwarded to the county planning agency.
(Ord. 379, 7/6/2009, § 2002)
§ 27-2003.   Curative Amendments.

provided at the Borough office, if any, requesting an amendment of this Chapter
or
Zoning Map as they relate to the landowner’s property, and shall pay the fee
fixed by the Borough Council for such a submission.
   2.   Since the amendment of this Chapter or
Zoning Map is a decision which falls within the legislative discretion of the
Borough Council, the Council shall have no obligation or duty to grant a
hearing or take any action on the proposal for amendment of this Chapter or
Zoning Map submitted by a landowner.
   3.   If a Borough landowner submits a proposal for the amendment of this
Chapter or
Zoning Map and the Borough Council determines to take no action on the
proposal, the Borough Zoning Officer or Borough Secretary shall return the
application and fee submitted by the landowner or other person, and the Borough
shall take no further action on the submission.
   4.   If the Borough Council determines to grant a hearing on any proposal to
amend this Chapter or
Zoning Map as submitted by a Borough landowner, the Council shall refer the
proposal to the Montgomery County Planning Commission and the Bucks County
Planning Commission for review and commentary. At its discretion, the Council
may also refer the proposal to the Borough Planning Commission for review and
commentary. The Council shall advertise the proposed amendment as required by
the Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq., and, if the proposal
involves any amendment to the Zoning Map, any affected property shall be
posted. The Borough Council shall hold public hearings as it deems appropriate
on the proposal to amend this Chapter or Zoning Map.
   5.   Subsequent to any public hearing, the Borough Council shall be under no
obligation to take any final action on any proposal to amend this Chapter or
Zoning Map.
(Ord. 379, 7/6/2009, § 2004)
§ 27-2005.   Fees.
   For the purpose of defraying expenses of advertising, etc., applications for
amendments shall be accompanied by a fee, in an amount as established from time
to time by resolution of the Borough Council. Said fee shall be nonrefundable
after advertisement of the notice of the hearing has been made.
