EDITOR'S NOTE
The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is similar to that used
in the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each section
is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For example, 238.02
indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238 (or the 38th
chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02. The code and chapter
numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the first
two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the first two
digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right of the
decimal. As another example, 408.01 indicates that the code number is 4, the
chapter number is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section
number is .01.
With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code. Exceptions are the Traffic and
General Offenses Codes, where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter
in each Code or are included as part of the sections. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 660.061, 660.062 and 660.063
follow 660.06 and precede 660.07 to be placed in their logical position.
Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the
section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

CHARTER
ORIGINAL CHARTER OF THE CITY OF JOHNSTOWN, PENNSYLVANIA
EDITOR'S NOTES: To distinguish this Charter from the Home Rule Charter adopted
by the voters on May 18, 1993, this Charter shall be referred to throughout
these Codified Ordinances as the "Original Charter of the City of Johnstown,
Pennsylvania," or just the "Original Charter," and the other shall be referred
to as the "Home Rule Charter of the City of Johnstown, Pennsylvania" or just
the "Home Rule Charter."
The perimeter description in this Original Charter of the boundaries of the
City of Johnstown includes the territory then forming a part of the Seventh
Ward of the Borough of Johnstown and later designated the Seventeenth Ward by a
decree of Court dated December 1, 1890. The Eighteenth, Nineteenth and
Twentieth Wards were created out of the territory formerly comprising the
Borough of Morrellville, which was annexed to the City by Special Ordinance
391, passed October 19, 1897. The Twenty-First Ward of the City was created out
of the territory formerly comprising the Borough of Coopersdale, which was
annexed to the City by General Ordinance 105, passed March 24, 1898. Reference
should also be made to Table D - Annexation and Detachment of Territory - of
the Tables of Special Ordinances in the Preliminary Unit of these Codified
Ordinances, and to Chapter 206 of the Administration Code, for ordinances
affecting the boundaries of the City.
PENNSYLVANIA, ss.

                                       Sends greeting:
   Whereas, In and by an Act of the General Assembly of this Commonwealth,
entitled "An Act for the incorporation and government of Cities of the third
class," approved the twenty-third day of May, Anno Domini one thousand eight
hundred and eighty-nine, it is among other things provided in the first section
thereof that "Cities of the third class shall be chartered whenever a majority
of the electors of any town or borough, or of any two or more contiguous towns
or boroughs, situate within the limits of the same county, having together a
population of at least ten thousand according to the last preceding United
States census, shall vote at any general election in favor of the same," and in
the second section of said act it is further provided that "If it shall appear
by the said returns that there is a majority in favor of a city charter, the
Governor shall issue Letters Patent, under the Great Seal of the Commonwealth,
reciting the facts, defining the boundaries of the said City, and constituting
the same a body corporate and politic";

boroughs of Johnstown, Grubbtown, Conemaugh, Woodvale, Prospect, Millville and

that there was a majority in each of said boroughs in favor of a City Charter;

Pennsylvania permitting adoption and recording by reference, or in the case of
any ordinance adopting, with or without amendment or modification, any standard
building, plumbing, electrical, housing or other technical code complete in
itself, for the regulation of any trade, occupation or line of activity or
undertaking, but in the latter cases it shall be necessary only to record the
ordinance adopting the same by reference and indicating the Municipal office
where the complete code or ordinance shall be available.
      (3)   Whenever an ordinance shall be specifically amended or repealed,
the City Clerk shall cause a notation to that effect to be made in the

summary offense proceedings, or proceedings for the recovery of penalties,
before magisterial district judges with the same right of appeal from any final
judgment entered.
   (j)   Penalties. A person who willfully violates any ordinance for which no
penalty is otherwise specified commits a summary offense and, upon conviction,
shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000)
plus costs and attorney's fees, where authorized, or to imprisonment of not
more than 90 days, or both, at the discretion of the Court.
   (k)   Continuing Violations. Unless otherwise expressly provided, each day
any violation continues shall constitute a separate offense, and the person or
other entity responsible for such violation shall be punished as provided above
for each separate offense.
   (l)   Abatement of Nuisances. In addition to the penalties and other
remedies herein provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in
violation of any ordinance will be deemed a public nuisance and may be abated
by the City with the costs of such abatement borne by the person or entity
owning the property upon which such condition exists. Such costs will be
collected for the use of the City as debts by law are collected or by a
municipal claim or lien filed as provided by law. Each day that such condition
continues shall be regarded as a separate offense.
   (m)   Actions at Law or in Equity. In addition to the enforcement provisions
herein provided, the City may institute an appropriate action or proceeding at

remedies as are just and reasonable.
   (n)   Cumulative Penalties. Wherever these Codified Ordinances or any
ordinance provides for alternative penalties or remedies, said penalties or
remedies shall be cumulative and the imposition of any one such penalty or
remedy shall not prevent the City from invoking any other penalty or remedy
provided therefor.

or motion may not be brought before Council again for at least six months from

services used by the City.
      (4)   Develop and maintain clear and accurate specifications describing

      (5)   Obtain quotations or bids for items needed.
      (6)   For certain items in recurring use by the City, obtain competitive
quotations to remain firm for a designated period of time up to one year or

services.
      (7)   Award purchase contracts to the vendor offering the lowest overall

competition.
      (2)   Neither the Purchasing Agent nor any other official or employee of
the City shall communicate the particulars of any vendor's quotation, bid, or
proposal directly or indirectly to any other vendor until after the purchase in
question is made or the vendor is chosen. To further the objective of

         A.   By competitive bids pursuant to the contract provisions of the
Pennsylvania Third Class City Code (53 P.S. Sections 36901 et seq.).
         B.   By direct quotations for the item or items in question pursuant
to this section.
            1.   The Purchasing Agent may seek to obtain ad-hoc quotations from
at least three vendors for goods or services needed by the City. Should two or
more vendors decline to quote, the Purchasing Agent shall continue to contact
vendors until the City has either received at least two quotations or the
Purchasing Agent has concluded that further contact of potential vendors will
be useless.
            2.   For direct quotes, the Purchasing Agent shall prepare a clear
and accurate specification for the needed good or service, and shall obtain the
quotations in writing, in a personal meeting, or by telephone, from the
potential vendors. When procuring a quotation by telephone or in a personal
meeting, the Purchasing Agent shall record each vendor's firm name, name of the
person making the quote, a detailed description of the item, the price,
warranty, delivery information, and other matters.
         C.   By intergovernmental cooperation with other local governments, a
council of governments, the State of Pennsylvania, the Federal Government, or
other public body which has utilized lawful procurement practices and is making
the goods or services available to the City at a prorata cost or better.
         D.   By obtaining the item or items through a purchase agreement from
a designated preferred supplier.
            1.   When the City anticipates needing an unpredictable number of
common category items, the precise quantities and descriptions of which cannot
be foretold (e.g. paints, lumber, electrical supplies, plumbing supplies,
etc.), the Purchasing Agent may seek competitive proposals applicable to an
entire inventory category supplied by such a general class of vendors. The said
proposals would be in the form of a discount below the listed prices normally
charged to the typically non-quantity customer for a stated period of time or
for a particular project. In considering this type of proposal, the Purchasing
Agent shall consider:
               a.   The vendor's catalogs or pricing sheets which list prices
normally charged in the category of goods;
               b.   The quoted percentage of discount from the catalog or
pricing sheets to be allowed to the City by the vendor for the period in
question;
               c.   The general availability of the materials either in the
vendor's immediate inventory or through other means of timely acquisition and
distribution.
            2.   The Purchasing Agent shall not commit the City to a preferred
purchase arrangement if the anticipated total costs applicable to that category
of purchases is expected to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or more
during a forthcoming twelve month period.
            3.   The Purchasing Agent may choose a preferred vendor for a
defined period of time up to one year and award all of the City's business
pertaining to that category to the preferred vendor. The preferred vendor shall
furnish all of the items in the category to the City unless:
               a.   The preferred vendor does not have a needed item or set of
items in stock or cannot make a timely delivery to the City;
               b.   The vendor's place of business is closed and the item is
needed immediately;
               c.   There is a genuine emergency, and an item is needed
immediately, and it is infeasible to acquire the item from the preferred
vendor.
         G.   By designating a vendor to supply a manufacturer's line of goods
or equivalent.
            1.   The Purchasing Agent may designate certain categories of goods
used repeatedly by the City which are to be purchased from a successful vendor
who has offered price quotations to remain in effect for stated periods of time
or until market conditions change. Examples shall be such things as oil
filters, fan belts, spark plugs, tires, bolts or other fasteners, stationery,
and janitorial supplies.
            2.   The Purchasing Agent may designate several representative
sizes or types of such goods by a leading manufacturer's part or catalog
number, but any quotations sought shall also seek other manufacturers'
equivalents. "Equivalent" shall mean an item supplied by one manufacturer,
which item is equal in size, function, warranty and quality, to that supplied
by another. Approximate quantities of need will also be indicated.
            3.   The Purchasing Agent may seek quotations for entire lines of
items or the equivalent, meaning all the catalog listings in the line, with the
prices and a percentage of discount off of the stated prices, during the period
the quote, is to be in effect. When this method of purchasing is used, the
Purchasing Agent shall acquire all of the category of goods from the vendor
whose standing quotation, including the discount, affords the least overall
cost to the City.
         F.   By unsolicited proposal.
            1.   To encourage vendors of goods and services to promote
innovative improvements in the way the City operates, A vendor, or potential
vendor, may submit an unsolicited proposal for an item, process, or technique
which has never been used by the City.
            2.   After carefully reviewing an unsolicited proposal, the City
may summarily accept it provided the acceptance does not violate any other City
ordinance or State or Federal law or regulation. Such a proposal must:
               a.   Be completely unsolicited by any officials or employee of
the City;
               b.   Provide for an innovation in City operations which is
reasonably anticipated to lower costs, improve City services, or both.
            3.   Acceptance of any unsolicited proposal shall be reported
immediately to the City Council in writing.
         G.   By noncompetitive negotiation.
            1.   "Noncompetitive negotiation" is procurement through
solicitation of a proposal from only one source, or after solicitation has been
attempted from a number of sources, competition is determined to be non-
existent. Noncompetitive negotiation may be used when the award of a contract
is infeasible under any other procurement method authorized under this section
and would not violate 53 P.S. Sections 36901 et seq. or other applicable State
or Federal law or regulation.
            2.   Circumstances under which a contract may be awarded by
noncompetitive negotiation are limited to any of the following:
               a.   The item is available only from a single source;
               b.   There is a public emergency, and urgency for the item or
service will not permit a delay incident to any other more competitive
purchasing procedure;
               c.   The Federal or State grantor agency authorizes
noncompetitive negotiation in connection with a program administered by the
City, which is funded by the Federal or State agency;
               d.   After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is
determined to be non-existent or inadequate.
(Ord. 4587. Passed 8-14-91.)
      (2)   A detailed master plan (or plans) has been developed for a set or
sets of technological or equipment types and related software to be used by the
City. Such plan or plans shall foster ease of maintenance, servicing,
operation, training, the facilitation of spare parts and related supplies, and
other factors to such a degree that it is in the City's interest to standardize
the equipment makes and types. The plan and its preparation shall be open to
public scrutinies and shall not be prepared by a vendor or agent for a vendor
dealing in the equipment called for in the plan.
      A separate plan may be applicable to the City's motorized fleet and
equipment or sections thereof, computer and other automated data processing
equipment, office equipment, radio transmitting and receiving equipment, and
similar types of technology and equipment.
      After being adopted by the City Manager, each such plan shall be
submitted to the City Council.
      Once a plan has been approved by the City Manager and has not been
rejected by resolution of the City Council to be acted upon prior to or during
the first regularly scheduled City Council meeting to occur after one month of
its transmittal by the City Manager, the plan shall be presumed to be adopted
and shall remain in effect until revised in the same manner as its original
adoption.

greater than the total estimated income.
      (2)   Adoption. The Council shall adopt the forthcoming budget, capital
program, tax levies and other revenue measures no later than December 31 of the
fiscal year currently ending. If it fails to adopt the budget, the amount
appropriated for the current fiscal year shall be deemed adopted for the
ensuing fiscal year on a month-to-month basis, with all items in it prorated
accordingly, until such time as the Council adopts a budget. Adoption of the
budget shall constitute appropriations of the amounts specified therein as
expenditures from the funds indicated.
   (i)   Amendments After Adoption.
      (1)   Supplemental appropriations. If during the fiscal year the City
Manager certifies that there are available for appropriation revenues in excess

obligation incurred against any allotment of appropriation except in accordance
with appropriations duly made and unless the City Manager or his or her
designee first certifies that there is a sufficient unencumbered balance in
such allotment or appropriation, and that sufficient funds are or will be
available to cover the claim or to meet the obligation when it becomes due and
payable.
      (3)   Reduction of appropriations. If at any time during the fiscal year
it appears probable that the revenues to be available will be insufficient to
meet the amount appropriated, the City Manager shall report to the Council
without delay, indicating the estimated amount of the deficit, any remedial
action taken, and his or her recommendation as to any other steps to be taken.
The Council shall then take such further action as it deems necessary to
prevent or to minimize any deficit, and may, by ordinance, reduce one or more
appropriations.
      (4)   Transfer of appropriations. At any time during the fiscal year the
City Manager may transfer part or all of any unencumbered appropriation balance
among programs within a department, office or agency and, upon written request

the unencumbered appropriation balance from one department, office or agency to
another. Any transfer made by the City Manager shall be reported to the City
Council at the next Council meeting.
      (5)   Limitations; effective date. No appropriation for debt service may
be reduced or transferred, and no appropriation may be reduced below any amount
required by law to be appropriated or by more than the amount of the
unencumbered balance thereof. The supplemental and emergency appropriations and
reduction or transfer of appropriations authorized by this section may be made
effective immediately upon adoption.
   (l)   Payment of Funds. No payment of any funds of the City shall be made
unless provided for in the budget, provided, however, that payroll and utility
expenditures may be made at the direction of the City Manager where the same
are based upon a prior ordinance or contract. All checks or drafts of the City
shall be signed by the City Manager and shall be countersigned by the Finance
Director of the City.

estate. Authorization for contracts for the construction of capital
improvements shall be by resolution.

products, goods and services, the making of contracts and the sale or lease of
personal or real property of the City. Such procedures shall provide for

this section.

who is authorized to carry out all responsibilities and duties of the City, as
provided herein.
   (b)   For purposes of this section, "fire loss" or "claim for fire damage"

a claim of a named insured for fire damage to a structure located within the

unless there is compliance with Sections 508(c) and (d) of said Act and the

of the Act, the insurer shall pay the claim of the named insured, provided,
however, that if the loss agreed upon by the named insured and the insurer
equals or exceeds sixty percent of the aggregate limits of liability on all
fire policies covering the building structure, the following procedures shall
be followed:
      (1)   The insurer shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the
Municipal Officer the aggregate of two thousand dollars ($2,000) for each
fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) of a claim and for each fraction of that
amount of a claim, provided that this section is to be applied such that if the
claim is fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) or less, the amount transferred to
the City shall be two thousand dollars ($2,000), and provided, further, that
if, at the time of a loss report, the named insured has submitted a
contractor's signed estimate of the cost of removing, repairing or securing the
building or other structure in an amount less than the amount calculated under
the foregoing transfer formula, the insurer shall transfer to the City from the
insurance proceeds the amount based upon the estimate.
      (2)   The transfer of proceeds shall be on pro rata basis by all
companies, associations or exchanges insuring the building or other structure.
Policy proceeds remaining after the transfer to the City shall be disbursed in
accordance with the policy terms.
   (e)   After the transfer provided in subsection (d) hereof, the named
insured may submit a contractor's signed estimate of the costs of removing,
repairing or securing the building or other structure, and the designated
officer shall return the amount of the funds transferred to the City in excess
of the estimate to the named insured if the City has not commenced to remove,
repair or secure the building or other structure.
   (f)   Upon receipt of proceeds under this section, the City shall do all of
the following:
      (1)   The Municipal Officer shall place the proceeds in a separate fund
to be used solely as security against the total costs of removing, repairing or
securing the building or structure which are incurred by the City. Such costs
shall include, without limitation, any engineering, legal or administrative
costs incurred by the City in connection with such removal, repair or securing
of the building or any proceedings relating thereto.
      (2)   It shall be the obligation of the insurer, when transferring the
proceeds, to provide the City with the name and address of the named insured.
Upon receipt of the transferred funds and the name and address of the named
insured, the Municipal Officer shall contact the named insured, certify that
the proceeds have been received by the City and notify the named insured that
the procedures under this subsection shall be followed.
      (3)   When the repair, removal or securing of the building or other
structure has been completed in accordance with all applicable regulations and
orders of the City and the required proof of such completion received by the
Municipal Officer, and if the City has not incurred any costs for such repair,
removal or securing, the fund shall be returned to the named insured. If the
City has incurred costs for the repair, removal or securing of the building or
other structure, the costs shall be paid from the fund and, if excess funds
remain, the City shall transfer the remaining funds to the named insured.
      (4)   To the extent that interest is earned on proceeds held by the City
pursuant to this section, and retained by it, such interest shall belong to the
City. To the extent that proceeds are returned to the named insured, interest
earned on such proceeds shall be distributed to the named insured at the time
that the proceeds are returned.
   (g)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ability of the
City to recover any deficiency. Furthermore, nothing in this section shall be
construed to prohibit the City and the named insured from entering into an
agreement that permits the transfer of funds to the named insured if some other
reasonable disposition of the damaged property has been negotiated.
   (h)   The City may, by resolution, adopt procedures and regulations to
implement Section 508 and this section and may, by resolution, fix reasonable
fees to be charged for City activities or services provided pursuant to Section
508 and this section, including, but not limited to, the issuance of

for any costs and/or expenses incurred by the Department, which may be
attainable, by the Department by submitting claims only to the individual
property owners’ insurance carrier.
   (b)   It is the finding of the City that individual property owners may
maintain insurance coverage within their own casualty insurance policies,
homeowners’ policies and/or other applicable policies that would provide
reimbursement to the Fire Department for fire suppression and other services
rendered to the property owners’ properties in response to emergency service
requests.
   (c)   The City Manager is hereby authorized and directed, by and through the
Office of the Fire Chief, to ascertain what insurance coverages may be
applicable and available under each circumstance, and to take the necessary and
affirmative actions to apply for and receive reimbursement from any insurance
carriers where a property owner is or may be insured to reimburse the
Department for any cost and/or expense incurred for services, supplies and/or
equipment used for or provided to the property owner by their Department. A fee
shall be established by ordinance of City Council and amended from time to time
listing each assessed fee per item of equipment, vehicle, and personnel used by
the Fire Department.
   (d)   Under no circumstances shall the property owner receive a bill from
the City for fire suppression or other services provided by the Department,
with the exception in cases of intentional false alarms and fires intentionally
set by the property owner.
   (e)   This section shall be liberally construed to accomplish its purpose to
compensate and/or reimburse the City from insurance proceeds only the costs
and/or expenses incurred while providing services to their duties for the Fire
Department.

   Every officer and employee presently or hereafter employed or elected by the

she has become entitled to any compensation, the total amount of the
contributions paid into the Fund by him or her shall be refunded, in full,
without interest. However, if the amount contributed has been returned to any

(Ord. 3888. Passed 1-12-71.)
286.07 APPLICATION TO PER DIEM EMPLOYEES.
   No person holding a position in the City as a laborer, at a per diem wage,

Retirement Fund herein provided for, but he or she shall have the option of so
doing and shall only become entitled to the compensation provided for by this
chapter if he or she elects to contribute to the Fund. However, he or she shall
be required to contribute 3.5% of his or her wages and the same percentage of
any amount of compensation he or she receives after his or her retirement.
(Ord. 3888. Passed 1-12-71.)
286.08 PAYMENT OF BENEFITS; VESTING SCHEDULE.
   (a)   The benefits conferred by this chapter shall apply to all persons
employed in any capacity by or holding positions in the City in accordance with
its provisions, except as hereinafter provided. Benefits conferred by this
chapter shall be payable on a monthly basis, as follows:
      (1)   Fifty percent of the final monthly earnings during any of the five
highest years of service to the City, or, if greater, the amount determined by
the rate of average monthly earnings during the last two years; and
      (2)   Forty percent of the primary Social Security benefits to which the
member is entitled because of age.
   Benefits at normal retirement date will equal (1) minus (2).
   (b)   (1)   The following vesting schedule shall apply for all terminations
of employment:
Years of Service at Termination Percent Vested
Years of Service at Termination Percent Vested
Less than 12                    0
12 but less than 13             60
13 but less than 14             65
14 but less than 15             70
15 but less than 16             75
16 but less than 17             80
17 but less than 18             85
18 but less than 19             90
19 but less than 20             95
20 or more                      100
 
      (2)   If a member who has completed at least ten years of credited
service with the employer incurs a disability prior to attaining normal
retirement age, such member shall be entitled to receive a monthly benefit
equal to 50% of the member's average compensation, with no reduction or offset
due to payment of social security benefits.
      (3)   The payment of a disability retirement benefit shall be made
monthly commencing on the member's disability retirement date and ending on the
earlier of the date of death of the member or the date that the member's total
and permanent disability shall cease. If the member's total and permanent
disability shall cease prior to the attainment of the member's normal
retirement age, the member shall be deemed to have terminated employment as of
the disability retirement date for purposes of this plan, unless the member
shall resume active employment within three months following the date on which
such total and permanent disability ceased. A member who fails to resume active
employment after total and permanent disability ceases shall not be entitled to
a distribution of accumulated contributions pursuant to the extent that the
total amount of disability retirement benefits paid exceeds the value of the
member's accumulated contributions as of the disability retirement date, and
shall not be entitled to any other benefits under the plan as a result of the
accumulation of any years of credited service as of the disability retirement
date.
      (4)   If the Plan Administrator shall determine that a member who is
totally and permanently disabled has recovered sufficiently to resume active
employment, or if a member refuses to undergo a medical examination as directed
by the Plan Administrator (such a medical examination may not be required more
frequently than once in any given 12-month period), the payment of disability
retirement benefits shall cease.
      (5)   If a member is receiving payment of disability retirement benefits
under this plan, the member must notify the Plan Administrator of any change in
condition which may cause the member's entitlement to receipt of such benefits
to cease. If a member fails to provide immediate notice to the Plan
Administrator of any change in status and thereby continues to receive payment
of benefits hereunder to which the member is not entitled, the Plan
Administrator may take whatever action is necessary and permitted under
applicable law to recover any amount of improper payments, including offsetting
such amounts against any future payment of retirement or other benefits under
the plan, or legal action. The Plan Administrator may also recover the costs of
any such action.
   (c)   Effective with retirements as of January 1, 1997, City employees with
20 years of service and who are at least 55 years of age may retire.
   (d)   Effective with retirements as of January 1, 1997, there shall be an
additional benefit to employees age 55 years or older consisting of a 1%
increment for each year beyond 20 years of service. For example, for an
employee 55 years of age or older with 20 years of service, the rate shall be
100% of 50%; for an employee 55 years of age or older with 21 years of service,
the rate shall be 100% of 51%; and so forth, to a maximum not to exceed 40
years of service, which, at 1% each additional year, would be 100% of 70%.
(Ord. 3992. Passed 4-10-74; Ord. 4763. Passed 1-22-97; Ord. 4884. Passed 4-24-
02.)
286.09 COMPUTATION OF SERVICE TIME.
   The time of service herein specified shall be computed from the time of the
first or original service to the City and need not be continuous. However, the
service of those officers or employees who terminated or who were terminated
prior to January 1, 1971, and who subsequently became re-employed, re-elected
or re-appointed after that date, shall be computed from the date of re-
employment, re-election or re-appointment. Further, any officer or employee who
was employed on January 1, 1971, and who terminated or who was terminated prior
to May 1, 1974, and was re-employed, re-appointed or re-elected, shall receive
credit for his or her actual service from January 1, 1971, provided that he or
she repays any member contribution which he or she may have withdrawn.
(Ord. 4206. Passed 11-26-80.)
286.10 PAYMENT OF COMPENSATION; ATTACHMENT, ASSIGNMENT AND TRANSFER.
   The compensation provided for in this chapter shall not be subject to
attachment or execution, shall be payable only to the beneficiary designated by
this section and shall not be subject to assignment or transfer.

287.02 ADMINISTRATION.
   The Pension Fund shall be aggregated with other pension funds maintained by
the employer to create a single pension trust fund, which shall thereafter
serve as the funding mechanism for all pension plans connected with the
aggregation. Each pension plan subject to the aggregation shall have an
undivided participation in the assets of the combined pension trust fund. For

calculated annually, in accordance with Section 607 of the Act.
   The aggregate pension trust fund shall be managed by a Board of Trustees,
which shall include at least one representative of the active membership of
each plan included in the fund. All members of such Board shall be appointed by
the Council, by majority vote.
   The employer may direct the Board of Trustees to pay expenses from the
Pension Fund which are attributable to the preparation of any actuarial
valuation report or experience investigation required by the Act, or any other
expense which is permissible under the Act and which is directly associated
with administering the Plan. Such permissible expenses shall include, but are
not limited to, investment costs associated with obtaining authorized
investments and investment management fees, accounting expenses, premiums for
insurance coverage on Fund assets, reasonable and customary counsel fees
incurred for advice or to defend the Pension Fund, and legitimate travel and
education expenses incurred by Plan officials, which are necessary and
reasonable and which benefit the Pension Fund.
   It shall be the duty of the Board of Trustees to receive, retain and
distribute Pension Fund contributions and pension payments to members who are
entitled to receive such contributions and payments. No contributions or
pension payments to a member shall be made from any other fund maintained or
controlled by the City, except the pension trust fund.
   The Board of Trustees may take, by gift, grant, devise or bequest, any money
or property, real, personal or mixed, in trust for the benefit of such Pension
Fund. Legal title to assets in the aggregated pension trust fund shall be in
the Municipality as trustee, or its nominees as trustees, for any person having
a beneficial interest in a particular pension plan that is associated with the
pension trust fund.
(Ord. 4440. Passed 10-28-87; Ord. 4654. Passed 10-27-93.)
287.03 ELIGIBILITY.
   Any person who becomes an employee of the employer on or after January 1,
1988, shall be eligible to become a member of the Plan and to participate
hereunder on the first day of the month following his or her date of hire. If
an employee elects not to become a member of the Plan as of the first date when
he or she is eligible, then he or shall be eligible for membership hereunder at
any later date.
(Ord. 4440. Passed 10-28-87.)
287.04 CONTRIBUTIONS.
   Each member shall make regular monthly contributions to the Plan at a rate
of 5% of the member's monthly compensation.
(Ord. 4440. Passed 10-28-87; Ord. 5355. Passed 6-14-23.)
287.05 PENSION BENEFITS.
   (a)   Each member hired before January 1, 2017 shall be entitled to receive
a pension benefit, provided the member has completed at least 20 years of
credited service with the employer and has attained 55 years of age. A member
hired on or after January 1, 2017 shall be required to have completed at least
15 years of credited service with the employer and to have attained 60 years of
age.
   (b)   A member entitled to a pension benefit shall receive monthly income
payments during the member's lifetime. For members hired before January 1,
2017, the total amount payable per month shall be equal to one-half of the
member's final monthly average salary reduced by 50% of the member's monthly
social security benefit. For members hired on or after January 1, 2017, the
monthly benefit shall be calculated at 1.5% of final monthly average salary for
each year of service completed with no social security offset.
   (c)   The normal form of payment of benefits shall be as a series of monthly
payments continuing throughout the life of the member. In lieu of the normal
form, a member may elect to receive a reduced benefit during the member's life,
so that benefit payments will be continued to a contingent annuitant following
the member's death. The amount of benefit payable to the contingent annuitant
shall be elected by the member and shall be equal to 50%, 66.67% or 100% of the
amount of the member's benefit. The value of the contingent annuitant option
shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of payment. If a member
makes an election of this optional form of payment within the six-month period
before the member's retirement date, he or she shall supply satisfactory
evidence of good health to the employer in order to be eligible to receive such
optional form of payment.
   If a member elects to receive the member's benefit in the optional form and
the member's designated contingent annuitant dies after the member's payments
have commenced, the member may not change the member's election and the
member's payments shall continue in the same reduced monthly amount, with no
benefit payable to any other person upon the member's death. A member may
change or rescind the member's election, without the consent of any designated
beneficiary chosen earlier by such member.
   (d)   Each member hired before January 1, 2017 who retires after age 55 who
becomes entitled to a pension benefit shall also become entitled to payment of
a service increment benefit equal to the number of whole years of service
completed in excess of 20 multiplied by 1% of final monthly average salary, to
a maximum of 20% of final monthly average salary. Members hired on or after
January 1, 2017 shall not be eligible for this benefit.
(Ord. 4440. Passed 10-28-87; Ord. 5355. Passed 6-14-23.)
287.06 DISABILITY BENEFITS.
   (a)   If a member who has completed at least ten years of credited service
with the employer incurs a disability prior to attaining normal retirement age,
such member shall be entitled to receive a monthly benefit equal to 50% of the
member's average compensation, with no reduction or offset due to payment of
social security benefits.
   (b)   The payment of a disability retirement benefit shall be made monthly,
commencing on the member's disability retirement date and ending on the earlier
of the date of death of the member or the date that the member's total and
permanent disability shall cease. If the member's total and permanent
disability shall cease prior to the attainment of the member's normal
retirement age, the member shall be deemed to have terminated employment as of
the disability retirement date for purposes of this plan, unless the member
shall resume active employment within three months following the date on which
such total and permanent disability ceased. A member who fails to resume active
employment after total and permanent disability ceases shall not be entitled to
a distribution of accumulated contributions pursuant to the extent that the
total amount of disability retirement benefits paid exceeds the value of the
member's accumulated contributions as of the disability retirement date, and
shall not be entitled to any other benefits under the plan as a result of the
accumulation of any years of credited service as of the disability retirement
date.
   (c)   If the Plan Administrator shall determine that a member who is totally
and permanently disabled has recovered sufficiently to resume active
employment, or if a member refuses to undergo a medical examination as directed
by the Plan Administrator (such a medical examination may not be required more
frequently than once in any given 12-month period), the payment of disability
retirement benefits shall cease.
   (d)   If a member who is receiving payment of disability retirement benefits
under this plan, the member must notify the Plan Administrator of any change in
condition, which may cause the member's entitlement to receipt of such benefits
to cease. If a member fails to provide immediate notice to the Plan
Administrator of any change in status and thereby continues to receive payment
of benefits hereunder to which the member is not entitled, the Plan
Administrator may take whatever action is necessary and permitted under
applicable law to recover any amount of improper payments, including offsetting
such amounts against any future payment of retirement or other benefits under
the plan, or legal action. The Plan Administrator may also recover the costs of
any such action.
(Ord. 4440. Passed 10-28-87; Ord. 4885. Passed 4-24-02.)
287.07 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND REFUND OF CONTRIBUTIONS.
   (a)   If a member terminates his or her employment with the employer before
he or she becomes vested or entitled to receive a pension benefit hereunder,
the total amount of his or her contributions paid to the Pension Fund shall be
refunded, without interest.
   (b)   If a member terminates his or her employment and is later re-employed
by the employer as a member of the employer, he or she shall repay any
contributions previously refunded in full in order to receive credit for his or
her years of service earned prior to his or her date of termination; otherwise,
he or she will be considered a new employee. Full payment must be received
within two years from the employee's date of re-employment in order for prior
credited service to be reinstated.
   (c)   If a member dies prior to becoming eligible to receive a benefit
hereunder, his or her contributions, without interest, shall be paid to his or
her beneficiary or estate.
   (d)   If a member begins receiving a benefit hereunder, but dies at a time
when total benefit payments received are less than the amount of his or her
contributions to the Plan, the balance representing such difference shall be
paid to his or her beneficiary or estate.
   (e)   Notwithstanding the preceding, if a member has completed at least 12
years of credited service with the employer as of his or her termination date,
but is not otherwise entitled to receive a pension benefit hereunder, such
member shall be entitled to receive a deferred vested benefit, which shall
commence upon his or her attainment of age 60, equal to the benefit provided
under Section
287.05, based upon the participant's final monthly average salary as of his or
her date of termination and the social security offset applicable thereto. A
member shall become vested in his or her accrued benefit according to the
following schedule:
Completed Years of Service Percentage of Accrued Benefit
Completed Years of Service Percentage of Accrued Benefit
Less than 12               0

287.08 VALUATION REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   An actuary shall perform an actuarial valuation at least biennially,
unless the employer is applying or has applied for Supplemental State
Assistance, pursuant to Section 603 of the Act, whereupon actuarial valuation
reports shall be made annually.
   (b)   Such actuarial reports shall be prepared and filed under the
supervision of the Chief Administrative Officer.
   (c)   The Chief Administrative Officer of the Pension Plan shall determine
the financial requirements of the Plan on the basis of the most recent
actuarial report and shall determine the minimum obligation of the employer
with respect to funding the Plan for any given plan year. The Chief
Administrative Officer shall submit the financial requirements of the Plan and
the minimum obligation of the employer to Council annually and shall certify
the accuracy of such calculations and their conformity with the Act.
   (d)   The employer shall contribute to the Pension Fund such amounts as are

(Ord. 3785. Passed 6-4-68.)
288.07 CALCULATION OF PENSIONS.
   Pensions which shall be paid to all pensioned or retired police officers or
other officers referred to in this chapter shall be one-half of the monthly
salary that the officer or employee received from the City at the time he or
she was placed on the pension list. The basic salary shall be based on the
increment provided and mandated by Act 373 (P.L. 1006), as amended, as directed
and ordered by the Decree of the Court of Common Pleas on July 8, 1968, by
Judge H. Clifton McWilliams. Payments for allowances shall not be a charge on
any fund in the Treasury of the City or under its control, save the Police
Pension Fund herein provided for. The basis of the apportionment of the
pension, except as to service increments provided for in this chapter, shall
not, in any case, exceed, in any year, one-half of the annual salary of such
member computed at such monthly rate. However, if a police officer or other
officer referred to in this chapter has retired before the effective date of
this section (Ordinance 4462, passed June 8, 1988) and receives a pension of
less than four hundred dollars ($400.00) per month, then such retired police
officer or other officer shall receive a pension of four hundred dollars
($400.00) per month. The pension payable to widows or dependent children as set
forth in Section
288.05 shall be calculated at the rate of 100 percent of the pension the police
officer was receiving or would have been receiving had he or she been retired
at the time of his or her death.
(Ord. 4462. Passed 6-8-88.)
288.08 ELIGIBILITY FOR PENSION; INVOLUNTARY AND MANDATORY RETIREMENT.
   Every police officer or other employee in the Department of Police hired
prior to January 1, 1988 and not, therefore, subject to the terms and
conditions of the City of Johnstown New Police Pension Plan, Ordinance 4442 of
1988 as amended,
Chapter 289 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Johnstown, Pennsylvania,
1986 who has served continuously for twenty years shall be entitled to be
retired on his or her own request on a pension. However, a police officer or
other employee in the Department who was employed as of June 4, 1968, shall be
entitled to be retired on his or her own request on a pension after he or she
has served continuously for twenty years, without regard to his or her age. The
pension shall date from the time the police officer or employee filed his or
her application with Council. However, Council may retire any police officer or
member of the Department who has served fifteen years or more, or who has
completed at least ten years of continuous service for a disability incurred
while in the line of duty, if, in its opinion, the officer or employee is
physically or mentally incapacitated from performing his or her duty in the
Department. Further, the age of sixty-five years is hereby established as the
age at which retirement from duty is mandatory for all members of the
Department.
(Ord. 3943. Passed 4-18-72; Ord. 5355. Passed 6-14-23.)
288.09 RULES AND REGULATIONS; PAYMENT AND USE OF CONTRIBUTIONS.
   The Police Pension Fund Association shall make rules, bylaws and
regulations. It shall prescribe the conditions and the sum to be paid by
Department of Police personnel to entitle them to membership. All sums of money
paid by persons to become members of the Association shall be paid to the
Treasurer of the Association and shall be used for the payment of pensions to
the officers or their widows or widowers and dependent children entitled
thereto under this chapter.
(Ord. 3785. Passed 6-4-68.)
288.10 SERVICE INCREMENTS.
   In addition to the retirement allowance which is authorized to be paid from
the Police Pension Fund by this chapter, and notwithstanding the limitations
herein placed upon such retirement allowances and all contributions, each
contributor who becomes entitled to a retirement allowance shall also be
entitled to the payment of a service increment in accordance with and subject
to the conditions hereinafter set forth:
   (a)   The service increment shall be the sum obtained by computing the
number of whole years, after having served the minimum required by this
chapter, during which a contributor has been employed by the City and has been
paid out of the City Treasury, and multiplying the number of years so computed
by an amount equal to one-fortieth of the retirement allowance which has become
payable to such contributor in accordance with this chapter. In computing the
service increment, no employment after the contributor has reached the age of
sixty-five years shall be included and no service increment shall be paid in
excess of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per month.
   (b)   Each contributor shall pay into the Police Pension Fund a monthly sum
in addition to his or her retirement contribution, which monthly sum shall be
equal to one-half of one percent of his or her salary, provided that such
payments shall not exceed the payment of five dollars ($5.00) per month, and
provided, further, that such service increment contribution shall not be paid
after a contributor has reached the age of sixty-five years.
   (c)   Persons who are contributors and who have already reached the age of
sixty-five years shall have their service increments computed on the years of
employment prior to the date of reaching their sixty-fifth birthday.
   (d)   Service increment contributions shall be paid at the same time and in
the same manner as retirement contributions and may be withdrawn in full,
without interest, by persons who leave the employment of the City or by persons
who retire before becoming entitled to any service increment.
   (e)   All members of the Department of Police who are now contributors to
the Fund, and all those employed by the City hereafter, if required to become
contributors to the Fund, shall be subject to this chapter.
(Ord. 3785. Passed 6-4-68; Ord. 4927. Passed 2-11-04.)
288.11 PARTIAL VESTED RIGHTS.
   If a police officer has served for twelve years or more, but less than
twenty years, and has not attained the age of fifty years, and his or her
tenure of office or employment is terminated, with or without his or her
voluntary action, then he or she shall, during the remainder of his or her
life, after attaining the age of fifty years, be entitled to receive such
portion of full pension benefits as the period of his or her service, up to the
date of his or her termination, bears to the full twenty-year period of
service.

(Ord. 4460. Passed 4-13-88; Ord. 5355. Passed 6-14-23.)
289.05 BENEFITS.
   (a)   Each member shall be entitled to receive a pension benefit as follows:
      (1)   For police officers hired on or after January 1, 1988 but before
January 1, 1989, upon accruing twenty years of service with the Department of
Police without regard to age.
      (2)   For police officers hired after January 1, 1989 but before March
11, 2010, upon having attained the age of fifty and the completion of twenty
years plus one day of service with the Department of Police.
      (3)   For police officers hired after March 10, 2010, upon having
attained the age of fifty and the completion of twenty-five years of service
with the Department of Police.
      Payment of pension benefits upon retirement shall be conditioned upon a
member being subject to service, from time to time, as a police reserve, until
unfitted for such service, at which time such member shall be finally
discharged by reason of age or disability. In no case, however, shall a
member's retirement date be later than the date when the member attains sixty-
five years of age.
   (b)   A member entitled to a pension benefit shall receive, during the
member's lifetime, a monthly retirement income equal to one-half of the
member's final monthly average salary.
   (c)   Each member who becomes entitled to a pension benefit shall also
become entitled to payment of a service increment benefit equal to the number
of whole years in excess of twenty of continuous service, or twenty-five years
for members hired on or after January 1, 2018, (including any credit for
military service as provided in Section

entitled to receive. No service increment benefit which is in excess of five
hundred dollars per month, or one hundred dollars per month in the case of a
member hired on or after January 1, 2018, shall be paid to a member, nor shall
such increment reflect any employment after the member has reached sixty-five
years of age.
   (d)   The pension payments herein provided for shall not be subject to
attachment, execution, levy, garnishment or other legal process, and shall be
payable only to the member or the member's survivors, nor shall they be subject
to assignment or transfer.
   (e)   If any member, whether active or retired, dies, the member's spouse,
or if no spouse survives or if a spouse survives and subsequently dies or
remarries, a member's child or children under eighteen years of age, shall
receive a monthly income equal to fifty percent of the pension benefit the
member was receiving under the Plan, or would have received if the member's
pension had been in pay status at the time of the member's death. For members
with a hire date prior to January 1, 2018, this survivor's benefit shall be one
hundred percent.
   (f)   If a member of the employer who has completed at least fifteen years
of continuous service with the employer incurs a disability, or if a member who
has completed at least ten years of continuous service with the employer incurs
a disability while in the line of duty, and the member is unable to perform the
duties of a member, the member shall be entitled to receive a disability
pension benefit which shall be equal to the member's pension benefit calculated
as of the member's date of disability.
   (g)   Each member who becomes entitled to receive a disability pension
benefit from the Pension Fund shall be required to submit to medical
examinations by three physicians designated by the employer. Thereafter, the
employer may annually require the member to have a medical examination to
certify such member's continued disability and, if the member refuses to comply
with such requirement, payment of the member's disability pension benefit shall
cease.
   If a member dies while receiving a disability pension benefit from the
Pension Fund, such benefit payments, in an amount equal to fifty percent of the
disability pension benefit, may be continued to the member's surviving spouse,
or if no spouse survives or if the spouse survives and subsequently dies or
remarries, then to the child or children under eighteen years of age of the
deceased member.

23.)
289.06 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND REFUND OF CONTRIBUTIONS.
   If a member who makes contributions to the Pension Fund ceases to be a
member of the Department of Police before he or she becomes entitled to receive
a pension benefit, the total amount of his or her contributions paid to the
Pension Fund shall be refunded in full, without interest.
   If a member terminates his or her employment and is later re-employed by the
employer as a member of the Department, he or she shall receive credit for the
years of continuous service earned prior to his or her date of termination only
if he or she repays the amount he or she received at the time he or she
terminated employment with the employer.
   If a member dies prior to his or her eligibility to receive a pension
benefit from the Pension Fund, the member's surviving spouse or family shall
receive any death benefits payable to survivors as provided in Section
289.05. If such member is not survived by a spouse or family, however, then the
total contribution paid into the Pension Fund by the member shall be paid to
his or her estate.
(Ord. 4442. Passed 10-28-87.)
289.07 VALUATION REQUIREMENTS.

of the employer to Council annually and shall certify the accuracy of such
calculations and their conformity with the Act.
   The employer shall contribute annually to the Pension Fund such amounts as

standards of the Act and to provide for the benefits under the Plan.

290.01 ESTABLISHMENT.
   There is hereby established in and for the City, under the provisions of Act
440 of June 28, 1947, a Firemen's Pension Fund for the retirement and
pensioning of members of the Department of Fire.
(Ord. 2752. Passed 6-17-48.)
290.02 BOARD OF MANAGERS; BENEFITS.
   There is hereby established a Board of Managers which shall consist of the
City Manager, the Director of Finance, the City Clerk, the Director/Chief of
Fire and two members of the Fire Department to be chosen by the members of the
Fire Department. The two members chosen by the Department shall serve for four-
year terms, one to be chosen every two years. In the case of a vacancy among
the members of the Board chosen by the Department, a successor shall be chosen
for the unexpired term. The Firemen's Pension Fund shall be applied, under such
regulations as the Board prescribes, for the benefit of those members of the
Department who receive an honorable discharge therefrom by reason of service
and age or disability and for the benefit of the families of members who are
killed in service. All pensions that are allowed to those who are retired by
reason of disability or service and age shall be in conformity with a uniform
scale. Benefits allowed from such Fund to families of members who are killed in
service shall take into consideration the member's widow or widower and his or
her children under eighteen years of age, if any survive.
290.03 CONDITIONS FOR RETIREMENT.
   The regulations of the Board of Managers shall prescribe a minimum period of
continuous service of twenty-five years and a minimum age of fifty-five years
after which members of the Department of Fire may be retired from active duty.
Such members as are retired shall be subject to service, from time to time, as
a firemen's reserve until unfit for such service, when they may be finally
discharged by reason of age or disability. The age of sixty-five years is
hereby established as the age at which retirement from duty is mandatory for
all members of the Department.
(Ord. 3396. Passed 2-18-60.)
290.04 DETERMINATION OF PAYMENTS.
   Payments of pensions shall not be a charge on any fund in the Treasury of
the City or under its control, save the Firemen's Pension Fund herein provided
for. The basis of the pension of a member shall be determined by the monthly
pay of the member at the date of retirement, whether for disability or by
reason of age and service, and shall be one-half the annual pay of such member
at the time of retirement computed at such monthly rate. In the case of the
payment of pensions to members for permanent injury incurred in service, and to
families of members killed in service, the amount and commencement of the
payment of pensions shall be fixed by regulations of the Board of Managers,
which shall take into consideration the amount and duration of worker's
compensation allowed by law.
(Ord. 2752. Passed 6-17-48.)
290.05 TERMINATION OF PENSIONS.
   Whenever any person becomes entitled to receive a pension from the Firemen's
Pension Fund and has been admitted to participate therein, he or she shall not
thereafter be deprived of his or her right to participate therein upon the
basis upon which he or she first became entitled thereto, except for one or
more of the following causes: Conviction of a felony or misdemeanor; becoming
an habitual drunkard; becoming a nonresident of the State; or failing to comply
with some general regulation relating to the management of the Fund which may
be made by the Board of Managers and which may provide that a failure to comply
therewith shall terminate the right to participate in the Fund. A pension shall
be terminated only after such due notice and hearing as are prescribed by
regulation of the Board. If any retired member of the Department of Fire, after
retirement, engages in employment for compensation, his or her pension from the
Fund shall be reduced to such an amount that when added to the compensation he
or she receives for employment, it shall equal the compensation he or she was
receiving as a member of the Department at the time of his or her retirement.
At any time when such other employment for compensation ceases, his or her
pension shall be fully restored.
(Ord. 2752. Passed 6-17-48.)
290.06 CONTRIBUTIONS BY MEMBERS.
   (a)   Beginning on the effective date of this chapter (Ordinance 2752,
passed June 17, 1948), all members of the Department of Fire shall pay into the
Firemen's Pension Fund, monthly, an amount equal to three percent of their
monthly wages or salaries.
   (b)   If any pension is granted to a person who has not been a contributor
to the Firemen's Pension Fund hereby established, or to a prior firemen's
pension fund, for an aggregate period of twenty-five years, such person shall
be required to pay to the Board of Managers for the benefit of the Fund,
monthly, an amount equal to three percent of his or her pension until such time
as his or her contribution has been extended to a period of twenty-five years.
(Ord. 2752. Passed 6-17-48.)
290.07 CONTRIBUTIONS BY CITY.
   The City shall pay into the Firemen's Pension Fund, annually, such a sum of
money as Council may, at its discretion, deem sufficient. However, such sum
shall not exceed in any one year an amount in excess of one percent of all City
taxes collected by the City, other than taxes levied to pay interest on or
extinguish the debt of the City or a part thereof.
(Ord. 2752. Passed 6-17-48.)
290.08 PAYMENT OF PENSIONS; ATTACHMENT, ASSIGNMENT AND TRANSFER.
   The pension provided for in this chapter shall not be subject to attachment
or execution, shall be payable only to the beneficiary designated by this
chapter and shall not be subject to assignment or transfer.
(Ord. 2752. Passed 6-17-48.)
290.09 APPLICATION OF CHAPTER.
   The benefits provided for in this chapter shall accrue only to those members
of the Department of Fire who are actually employed by the City and are active
members of the Department on the effective date of this chapter (Ordinance
2752, passed June 17, 1948), or who thereafter become members of the
Department.
(Ord. 2752. Passed 6-17-48.)

291.02 ADMINISTRATION.
   The Pension Fund shall be aggregated with other pension funds maintained by
the employer to create a single pension trust fund, which shall thereafter
serve as the funding mechanism for all pension plans connected with the
aggregation. Each pension plan subject to the aggregation shall have an
undivided participation in the assets of the combined pension trust fund. For

calculated annually, in accordance with Section 607 of the Act.
   The aggregate pension trust fund shall be managed by a Board of Trustees,
which shall include at least one representative of the active membership of
each plan included in the fund. All members of such Board shall be elected by
the active membership of such plan.
   The employer may direct the Board of Trustees to pay expenses from the
Pension Fund which are attributable to the preparation of any actuarial
valuation report or experience investigation required by the Act, or any other
expense which is permissible under the Act and which is directly associated
with administering the Plan. Such permissible expenses shall include, but are
not limited to, investment costs associated with obtaining authorized
investments and investment management fees, accounting expenses, premiums for
insurance coverage on Fund assets, reasonable and customary counsel fees
incurred for advice or to defend the Pension Fund, and legitimate travel and
education expenses incurred by Plan officials, which expenses are necessary and
reasonable and benefit the Pension Fund.
   It shall be the duty of the Board of Trustees to receive, retain and
distribute Pension Fund contributions and pension payments to members who are
entitled to receive such contributions and payments. No contributions or
pension payments to a member shall be made from any other fund maintained or
controlled by the City, except the pension trust fund.
   The employer may take, by gift, grant, devise or bequest, any money or
property, real, personal or mixed, in trust for the benefit of the Pension
Fund. The care, management, investment and disposal of such funds or property
shall be vested in the Board of Trustees, and such care, management and
disposal shall likewise be directed by ordinance, and such Pension Fund shall
be governed thereby, subject to such directions, not inconsistent therewith, as
the donors of such funds and property may prescribe.
   Legal title to assets in the aggregated pension trust fund shall be in the
Municipality as trustee, or its nominees as trustees, for any person having a
beneficial interest in a particular pension plan that is associated with the
pension trust fund.
291.03 ELIGIBILITY.
   Any person who becomes an employee of the employer on or after January 1,
1988, shall be eligible to become a member of the Plan and to participate
hereunder.
(Ord. 4441. Passed 10-28-87.)

service, shall be entitled to have full credit for each year or fraction
thereof, not to exceed five years of continuous service, upon the member's
payment to the Pension Fund of an amount equal to that which the member would
have paid had the member been a member during the period for which the member
desires credit, and upon the member's payment to the Pension Fund of an
additional amount as the equivalent of the contribution of the employer, plus
any interest the employer would have been required to pay on the contributions,
on account of such military service.
(Ord. 4441. Passed 10-28-87; Ord. 5355. Passed 6-14-23.)
291.05 BENEFITS.
   (a)   Members hired before January 1, 2018 shall be entitled to receive a
normal retirement benefit, provided the member has completed at least twenty
years of continuous service with the employer. Members hired on or after
January 1, 2018 shall be entitled to a normal retirement benefit upon
attainment of the age of fifty-five and the completion of twenty-five years of
continuous service. Payment of pension benefits upon retirement shall be
conditioned upon a member being subject to service, from time to time, as a
firemen's reserve, until unfitted for service, at which time such member shall
be finally discharged by reason of age or disability. In no case, however,
shall a member's retirement be later than the date when he or she attains age
sixty-five.
   (b)   A member entitled to a pension benefit shall receive, during his or
her lifetime, a monthly retirement income which is equal to one-half of his or
her final monthly average salary.
   (c)   Each member who becomes entitled to a pension benefit shall also
become entitled to payment of a service increment benefit equal to the number
of whole years in excess of twenty of continuous service, or twenty-five years
for members hired on or after January 1, 2018, (including any credit for
military service as provided in Section
291.04) multiplied by one-fortieth of the pension benefit which the member is
entitled to receive. No service increment which is in excess of five hundred
dollars per month, or one hundred dollars per month in the case of a member
hired on or after January 1, 2018, shall be paid to a member, nor shall such
increment reflect any employment after the member has reached sixty-five years
of age.
   (d)   The pension payments herein provided for shall be payable only to the
member and his or her survivors and shall not be subject to attachment,
execution, levy, garnishment or other legal process, nor shall they be subject
to assignment or transfer.
   (e)   If a member who is active or who is eligible to receive or is
receiving pension benefits dies, the spouse of the deceased member shall,
during the spouse's lifetime, receive a monthly pension which shall be equal to
fifty percent of the amount which the mem her was receiving or would have
received prior to the member's date of death. For members with a hire date
prior to January 1, 2018, the survivor's benefit shall be one hundred percent.
   (f)   If a member who has completed at least fifteen years of continuous
service with the employer incurs a disability, or if a member who has completed
less than fifteen years of continuous service with the employer incurs a
disability while in the line of duty, and the member is unable to perform the
duties of a member, the member shall be entitled to receive a disability
pension benefit equal to the member's pension benefit calculated as of the
member's date of disability.
   (g)   Whenever a member becomes entitled to receive a pension benefit from
the Pension Fund, he or she shall not be deprived of his or her benefit, except
for one or more of the following causes: conviction of a felony or misdemeanor;
becoming a habitual drunkard; or failing to comply with some general regulation
relating to the management of the Pension Fund, if such regulation provides
that failure to comply shall terminate the right to participate in the Pension
Fund. Any termination of a pension benefit shall be only after such due notice
and hearing as shall be prescribed by regulations of Council.
(Ord. 4441. Passed 10-28-87; Ord. 4928. Passed 2-11-04; Ord. 5355. Passed 6-14-
23.)
291.06 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND REFUND OF CONTRIBUTIONS.
   (a)   Except as otherwise set forth in Section
291.06(b), if a member who makes contributions to the Pension Fund ceases
employment before the member becomes entitled to receive a pension benefit, the
total amount of the member's contributions paid to the Pension Fund shall be
refunded, in full, without interest.
   If a member terminates his or her employment and is later re-employed by the
employer as a member of its Department of Fire, the member shall receive credit
for the years of continuous service earned prior to the member's date of
termination only if the member repays the amount the member received at the
time the member terminated employment with the employer.
   If a member dies at a time prior to the member's eligibility to receive a
pension benefit from the Pension Fund, the member's surviving spouse shall
receive any death benefits payable to survivors as provided in Section
291.05. If such member is not survived by a spouse, however, then the total
contribution paid into the Pension Fund by the member shall be paid to the
member's estate.
   (b)   In lieu of a return of member contributions, a member who ceases
employment for any reason other than death or total and permanent disability
prior to meeting the age and years of service requirements applicable to the
member to be eligible for immediate receipt of a full, unreduced normal
retirement benefit, but after completing at least twelve years of continuous
service, shall be entitled to vest the member's retirement benefits subject to
the following conditions:
      (1)   The member must file with the Board of Trustees a written Notice of
the Member's intention to vest.
      (2)   The member must include in the Notice the date the member intends
to terminate the member's employment, and must include an irrevocable letter of
resignation effective on the selected termination date.
      (3)   The termination date shall be at least thirty days, but no later
than sixty days, following the date of the Notice to vest.
      (4)   The member must be in good standing with the Department of Fire on
the date of the Notice to vest.
      (5)   The Board of Trustees shall indicate on the Notice to vest the
final monthly average salary of the member as of the date of the notice to
vest.
   (c)   For members electing a deferred vested benefit in accordance with
Section
291.06(b), upon reaching the date that would have been the date that the member
became eligible for an immediate receipt of a full, unreduced normal retirement
benefit if the member had continued in the full-time employment of the City,
the member shall notify the Board of Trustees, in writing, that the member
desires to collect the member's pension. The amount of retirement benefits the
member is entitled to receive under this Section shall be computed as follows:
      (1)   The initial determination of the member's base retirement benefits
shall be computed on the salary indicated on the Notice to vest pursuant to
Section
291.06(b)(5) above.
      (2)   For members hired on or after January 24, 2001, the portion of the
base retirement benefits due to the member shall be determined by applying to
the base amount the percentage that the members years of service actually
rendered bears to the years of service which would have been rendered had the
member continued to be employed by the Department of Fire until reaching the
date that the member would have been eligible for immediate receipt of a full,
unreduced normal retirement benefit.
(Ord. 4441. Passed 10-28-87; Ord. 5355. Passed 6-14-23.)
291.07 VALUATION REQUIREMENTS.
   An actuary shall perform an actuarial valuation at least biennially, unless
the employer is applying or has applied for Supplemental State Assistance
pursuant to Section 603 of the Act, whereupon actuarial valuation reports shall
be made annually. Such actuarial valuation shall be prepared and certified by
an approved actuary, as such term is defined in the Act.
   The employer shall contribute annually to the Pension Fund such amounts as
are recommended by the Plan's actuary as being required to meet the funding
standards of the Act and to provide for the benefits under the Plan.
   Such actuarial reports shall be prepared and filed under the supervision of
the Chief Administrative Officer.
   The Chief Administrative Officer of the Pension Plan shall determine the
financial requirements of the Plan on the basis of the most recent actuarial
report and shall determine the minimum obligation of the employer with respect
to funding the Plan for any given Plan year. The Chief Administrative Officer
shall submit the financial requirements of the Plan and the minimum obligation
of the employer to Council annually and shall certify the accuracy of such
calculations and their conformity with the Act.
(Ord. 4441. Passed 10-28-87.)
291.08 MODIFICATIONS.
   Prior to the adoption of any benefit plan modification by the employer, the
Chief Administrative Officer of the Plan shall provide to Council a cost
estimate of the proposed benefit plan modification. Such estimate shall
disclose to Council the impact of the proposed benefit plan modification on
future financial requirements of the Plan and the future minimum obligation of
the employer with respect to the Plan.
(Ord. 4441. Passed 10-28-87.)
291.09 AUTHORITY; INTENT.
   This chapter is hereby established under the provisions of the Act governing
severely distressed municipalities and is intended to comply with the
requirements therein governing recovery programs of such municipalities.
(Ord. 4441. Passed 10-28-87.)

(Ord. 4443. Passed 10-28-87.)
293.03 ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   The Pension Fund shall be aggregated with other pension funds
maintained by the employer to create a single pension trust fund, which shall
thereafter serve as the funding mechanism for all pension plans connected with
the aggregation. Each pension plan subject to the aggregation shall have an
undivided participation in the assets of the combined pension trust fund. For
accounting purposes, the value of the participation by each plan shall be
calculated annually, in accordance with Section 607 of the Act.
   The aggregate pension trust fund shall be managed by a Board of Trustees,
which shall include at least one representative of the active membership of
each plan included in the fund. All members of such Board shall be elected by
the active membership of such plan.
   The employer may direct the Board of Trustees to pay expenses from the
Pension Fund which are attributable to the preparation of any actuarial
valuation report or experience investigation required by the Act, or any other
expense which is permissible under the terms of the Act and which is directly
associated with administering the plan. Such permissible expenses shall
include, but are not limited to, investment costs associated with obtaining
authorized investments and investment management fees, accounting expenses,
premiums for insurance coverage on Fund assets, reasonable and customary
counsel fees incurred for advice or to defend the Pension Fund, and legitimate
travel and education expenses incurred by Plan officials, which expenses are
necessary and reasonable and benefit the Pension Fund.
   It shall be the duty of the Board of Trustees to receive, retain and
distribute Pension Fund contributions and pension payments to members who are
entitled to receive such contributions and payments. Any contributions or
pension payments to a member shall not be made from any other fund maintained
or controlled by the City, except the pension trust fund.
   The Board of Trustees may take, by gift, grant, devise or bequest, and money
or property, real, personal or mixed, in trust for the benefit of such Pension
Fund.
   Legal title to assets in the aggregated pension trust fund shall be in the
Municipality as trustee, or its nominees as trustees, for any person having a
beneficial interest in a particular pension plan that is associated with the
pension trust fund.
   (b)    Board of Managers. There is hereby established a Board of Managers,
which shall consist of the City Manager, the Director of Finance, the Assistant
City Manager and two representatives selected by the plan participants. The two
representatives shall be elected for four-year terms.
(Ord. 4935. Passed 4-28-04.)
293.04 ELIGIBILITY.
   Any person who becomes an employee of the employer on or after January 1,
1988, shall be eligible to become a member of the Plan and to participate
hereunder as of the January 1 that coincides with or immediately follows such
employee's completion of one year of service with the employer and his or her
attainment of age twenty-five, whichever occurs later. However, in no case
shall an employee become a participant hereunder after his or her attainment of
fifty-six years of age.
(Ord. 4443. Passed 10-28-87.)
293.05 CONTRIBUTIONS.
   Each member shall contribute 2.25 percent of his or her total Form W-
2 compensation each month to the Pension Fund as a condition of his or her
participation hereunder.
(Ord. 4443. Passed 10-28-87.)
293.06 BENEFITS.
   Each member shall be entitled to receive a monthly pension benefit
commencing at his or her normal retirement date and payable during his or her
lifetime, which shall be equal to one percent of his or her final monthly
average salary, multiplied by his or her years of continuous service with the
employer. In no case, however, shall credit be given for years of continuous
service exceeding forty.
   A member may continue to work beyond his or her normal retirement date, in
which case he or she shall be credited with additional years of continuous
service, but in no case shall continuous service in excess of forty years be
credited. If a member's employment continues beyond normal retirement date,
there shall be no retirement benefits paid until employment ceases and
retirement begins.
   The normal form of payment of benefits shall be a single life annuity. If a
member files a written election, on forms approved by the employer, he or she
may receive his or her benefit in one of the following optional forms:
   (a)   Period Certain Option. A reduced pension is payable to the member and,
if the member dies before receiving either sixty, 120 or 180 monthly payments
(depending upon the period certain elected), payments shall be continued to the
member's beneficiary until the completion of such guaranteed period.
   (b)   Joint and Survivor Annuity. A reduced pension is payable to the
member, so that pension payments can be continued to the member's spouse,
following the participant's death, in an amount equal to fifty percent, sixty-
six and two-thirds percent, seventy-five percent or 100 percent of the amount
payable to the member during the member's lifetime.
   Any optional form shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of
payment. A member's election of an optional form of payment shall be
irrevocable as of the date that a member's benefits commence. If a member's
spouse (under Option (b)) or a member's beneficiary (under Option (a)) dies
before the member, but after payments have commenced, the member shall continue
to receive the same reduced monthly payments, but no benefits shall be payable
to any other person upon the member's death.
   Any member who has completed at least fifteen years of continuous service
with the employer and has attained sixty years of age, shall be entitled to
retire and to commence receiving an early retirement benefit from the Pension
Fund. Such member's pension benefit shall be reduced to its actuarial
equivalent if the member receives his or her pension benefit prior to his or
her attainment of age sixty-five. Payments shall start, at the election of the
member, as of the first day of the month that coincides with or immediately
follows the member's early retirement, or on the first day of any intervening
month between the participant's early retirement date and his or her normal
retirement date.
   The pension payments herein provided for shall not be subject to attachment,
execution, levy, garnishment or other legal process, and shall be payable only
to a member or his or her survivors, nor shall they be subject to assignment or
transfer.
(Ord. 4443. Passed 10-28-87.)
293.07 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND REFUND OF CONTRIBUTIONS.
   Other provisions of this chapter notwithstanding, if a member completes at
least fifteen years of service with the employer and has attained age fifty,
but has not attained age sixty as of his or her termination date, such member
shall be entitled to receive a deferred vested benefit payable at his or her
normal retirement date. The amount of such deferred vested benefit shall be
equal to the benefit determined under Section
293.05, but shall be determined as of the date of the member's termination of
employment on the basis of his or her final monthly average salary and
continuous service as of such date. A member may elect to commence receipt of
his or her deferred vested benefit immediately, as of the first day of the
month coincident with or immediately following his or her date of termination,
or on any date intervening between that date and his or her normal retirement
date, but such benefit shall be actuarially reduced to reflect payment
commencing before normal retirement date.
   If a member who makes contributions to the Pension Fund ceases to be a
member of the employer before he or she becomes entitled to receive a pension
benefit, or a deferred vested benefit, the total amount of his or her
contributions paid to the Pension Fund shall be refunded in full, without
interest.
   If a member terminates his or her employment and is later re-employed by the
employer as a member of the employer, he or she shall be required to repay his
or her contributions in full to receive credit for the years of continuous
service earned prior to his or her date of termination.
   If a member dies prior to his or her receiving a pension or deferred vested
benefit from the Pension Fund, then the total contribution paid into the
Pension Fund by the member shall be paid to his or her beneficiary or estate.
(Ord. 4443. Passed 10-28-87.)
293.08 VALUATION REQUIREMENTS.
   An actuary shall perform an actuarial valuation at least biennially, unless
the employer is applying or has applied for Supplemental State Assistance
pursuant to Section 603 of the Act, whereupon actuarial valuation reports shall
be made annually.
   Such actuarial reports shall be prepared and filed under the supervision of
the Chief Administrative Officer.
   The Chief Administrative Officer of the Pension Plan shall determine the
financial requirements of the Plan on the basis of the most recent actuarial
report and shall determine the minimum obligation of the employer with respect
to funding the Plan for any given Plan year. The Chief Administrative Officer
shall submit the financial requirements of the Plan and the minimum obligation
of the employer to Council annually and shall certify the accuracy of such
calculations and their conformity with the Act.
   The employer shall annually contribute to the Pension Fund such amounts as
are recommended by the Plan's actuary as being required to meet the funding
standards of the Act and to provide for the benefits under the Plan.
(Ord. 4443. Passed 10-28-87.)
293.09 MODIFICATIONS.
   Prior to the adoption of any benefit plan modification by the employer, the
Chief Administrative Officer of the Plan shall provide to Council a cost
estimate of the proposed benefit plan modification. Such estimate shall
disclose to Council the impact of the proposed benefit plan modification on
future financial requirements of the Plan and the future minimum obligation of
the employer with respect to the Plan.

   (a)   Definitions. As used in this section:
      (1)   "Improperly parked" means parked overtime at a meter, parked in a
restricted parking location or improperly stopped or parked on a public street,
road, alley or parking garage.
      (2)   "Boot", "booting" or "booted" means the act of immobilizing a motor
vehicle, in such a manner as to prevent its operation, with a device or by
means which will cause no damage to such vehicle unless such vehicle is moved
while such device is in place or such means are employed.
(Ord. 4713. Passed 2-22-95.)
   (b)   Boot Installation. A motor vehicle found parked within the City upon
any public ground or in any public parking facility at any time may be booted
by the Police Department or an employee of the Bureau of Parking if there are
three or more unsettled parking violations pending against the owner of such
motor vehicle or if the owner of the vehicle is more than three months in
arrears in monthly parking fees. Such booting shall serve to prevent the
removal of the vehicle by any person, except an authorized tower, until all
fines, fees, penalties and costs are paid in full.
(Ord. 4753. Passed 9-11-96.)
   (c)   Notice of Booting. Upon the booting of a motor vehicle, the officer or
employee shall cause to be placed on the vehicle, in a conspicuous manner,
notice sufficient to warn any individual that the vehicle has been immobilized
and that any attempt to move the vehicle might result in damage to the vehicle.
The notice shall also outline the procedure for obtaining removal of the boot.
As soon as practicable, the officer or employee shall provide the owner of the
booted vehicle, at his or her request, with notice of the specific parking
violations for which, or on account of which, such vehicle was booted.
   (d)   Boot Removal; Post-Immobilization Hearing.
      (1)   The owner of a booted vehicle, or other authorized person, shall be
permitted to secure the release of the vehicle upon:
         A.   Paying the amount of the fines and penalties for the violations
for which the boot was attached;
         B.   Paying the amount of the fines, penalties and court costs, if
any, for any other unsettled parking violations involving the owner of the
booted vehicle; and
         C.   Paying the fees required under subsection (f) hereof.
      (2)   The owner of a booted vehicle, or other authorized person, shall
have the right to a post-immobilization hearing limited to the determination of
the validity of the booting. Such hearing must be requested within fifteen days
after the vehicle is booted and shall be conducted by the designated District
Magistrate. The hearing shall be held during normal business hours within ten
business days of the demand therefor or as soon as practical. The post-
immobilization hearing will not be determinative of or adjudicate the merits of
any citation issued relative to any immobilized vehicle, but will be limited
solely to determining whether the vehicle was properly subject to booting under
the provisions of this section.
   (e)   Towing and Storage of Vehicles. The boot shall remain in place for
forty- eight hours, unless the owner has complied with subsection (d) hereof.
If such compliance has not occurred within forty-eight hours, the vehicle shall
be towed or impounded. If the booting occurs when a vehicle is parked in any
zone regulated by towing provisions, then such vehicle is subject to immediate
towing and impounding. Towing and storage fees, as specified in Section
422.02, shall be paid, along with the fees specified in subsection (d) hereof,
before the owner of such vehicle, or other authorized person, shall be
permitted to repossess or secure the release of the vehicle. Vehicles unclaimed
within sixty days of towing and storage shall be deemed abandoned and subject
to disposal as such in the manner authorized by law.
   (f)   Booting Fee. The owner of a booted vehicle shall be subject to a fee
established by resolution of City Council and amended from time to time for
such immobilization, in addition to the fines and costs for the parking
violations for which the vehicle was originally booted. All unpaid fees
remaining unpaid after the twenty- first calendar day are subject to the
booting provisions contained in this chapter with all fees and charges to be
paid in full prior to removal of booting apparatus.
      (1)   Fees collected in excess of one hundred dollars ($100.00) shall be
dedicated for bond and other debt service of the Parking Fund operations and no
other purposes.
   (g)   Enforcement; Implementation. This section shall be enforced by the
Bureau of Parking or the Department of Police. The Director of the Bureau of
Parking, or a successor position thereto, and the Chief of Police, or the City
Manager, shall have the authority to implement the parking enforcement
provisions set forth in this section, including waiver and/or settlement of
disputed violations, and to promulgate such rules and regulations as are
necessary therefor, which regulations shall become effective upon approval by
Council.
   (h)   Right to Hearing Not Waived. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to deprive any person of the Constitutional right to a hearing or
trial as to the violations for which citations have been issued.
   (i)   Tampering With Boot; Unauthorized Movement of Vehicle. No person shall
tamper with, remove or attempt to remove any device used to immobilize a motor
vehicle that has been booted pursuant to this section, or move or attempt to
move the booted vehicle before release of the vehicle has been officially
secured.

unassigned space, shall have his or her motor vehicle tagged by the Department
of Police or an employee of the Bureau of Parking and shall remit with the tag
a fine of twenty dollars ($20.00) for such violation. Upon default of payment
of such fine within fifteen days, the tag shall be turned over to the District
Magistrate for further action or the motor vehicle may be booted as per Section
482.195 . Monthly parkers who continue to park without properly showing their
monthly parking permit shall have their parking privileges revoked.

events. If a person using event parking does not remove his or her vehicle
after said event, he or she shall be subject to a fine of twenty dollars
($20.00). Upon default of payment of such fine within fifteen days, the tag
shall be turned over to the District Magistrate for further action or the motor
vehicle may be booted as per Section
482.195.

   (a)   Parking meter zones are hereby established within the districts or
upon those streets or parts of streets described in existing ordinances of the
City, which are hereby made a part of this chapter by reference, in which zones
the parking of vehicles upon streets shall be regulated by parking meters,
which meters shall be in operation to measure the parking time of parked
vehicles between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. every day, except Saturdays, Sundays,
holidays and snow emergency days. For purposes of this chapter, "holidays"
means any national or State proclaimed holiday when the offices at City Hall
are closed in recognition thereof, and "snow emergency days" means any day
proclaimed by the City Manager or by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a show
emergency day which requires the closing of the offices at City Hall and which
shall remain in effect until officially lifted, and any other days that City
Hall is closed.
(Ord. 4746. Passed 4-10-96.)
   (b)   The Manager of the Bureau of Parking is hereby authorized, subject to
the removal by Council by amendment of such ordinances and regulations, to
establish parking meter zones at other locations upon those streets or parts of
streets where it is determined, upon the basis of an engineering and traffic
investigation, that the installation of parking meters is necessary to aid in
the regulation, control and inspection of parking vehicles.
(Ord. 4320. Passed 11-22-83.)
484.02 INSTALLATION AND DESIGN OF METERS.
   (a)   The Bureau of Parking shall direct the installation of parking meters
in the zones established as provided in this chapter upon the curb immediately
adjacent to each designated parking space. Such meters shall be capable of
being operated either automatically or mechanically upon the deposit therein of
the required coin of United States currency for the full period of time for
which parking is lawfully permitted. As new parking technology is made
available to the Bureau of Parking, additional payment options may be allowed
at the discretion of the City Manager and/or his or her designee.
   (b)   Each parking meter shall be so designed, constructed, installed and
set that it will indicate, by an appropriate signal, how much of the lawful
parking period remains after the deposit of the coin or coins required, and
also indicate, by an appropriate signal, upon the expiration of the time period
registered by deposit of one or more coins, as provided herein, that the lawful
parking meter period has expired. Rates for said meters will be established by
resolution of City Council and amended from time to time.
   (c)   Each parking meter shall bear thereon a legend indicating the days and
hours when the requirement to deposit coins therein shall apply, the value of
the coins to be deposited and the limited period of time for which parking is
lawfully permitted in the parking meter zone in which such meter is located.
(Ord. 4320. Passed 11-22-83; Ord. 5323. Passed 12-8-21.)

meter spaces so designated shall be of appropriate length and width so as to be
accessible from the traffic lanes of such street.
   (b)   No person shall park a vehicle in any such designated parking meter
space during the restricted or regulated time applicable to the parking meter
zone in which such meter is located so that any part of such vehicle occupies
more than one such space or protrudes beyond the markings designating such
space, except that a vehicle which is of too large a size to be parked within a
single designated parking meter zone shall be permitted to occupy two adjoining
parking meter spaces when coins have been deposited in the parking meter for
each space so occupied as is required in this chapter for the parking of other
vehicles in such space.
(Ord. 4320. Passed 11-22-83.)
484.04 DEPOSIT OF COINS AND TIME LIMITS.
   (a)   No person shall park a vehicle in any parking space upon a street
alongside of and next to which a parking meter has been installed during the
restricted and regulated time applicable to the parking meter zone in which
such meter is located, unless a coin or coins of United States currency of the
appropriate denominations, as provided in this chapter, have been deposited
therein, or have been previously deposited therein for an unexpired interval of
time, and such meter has been placed in operation.
   (b)   No person shall permit a vehicle within his or her control to be
parked in any such parking meter space during the restricted and regulated time
applicable to the parking meter zone in which such meter is located while the
parking meter for such space indicates by signal that the lawful parking time
in such space has expired. This provision shall not apply to the act of parking
or the necessary time which is required to deposit immediately thereafter a
coin or coins in such manner.
(Ord. 4320. Passed 11-22-83.)
   (c)   No person shall park a vehicle in any such parking meter space for a
consecutive period of time longer than that limited period of time for which
parking is lawfully permitted in the parking meter zone in which the meter is
located, irrespective of the number or amount of coins deposited in such meter.
   Any vehicle caused to be moved or reparked within the same unit block shall
be deemed not to have been removed and shall thereby be subject to penalty. A
vehicle shall be deemed to have been removed from a unit block if it has been
continuously absent from said unit block for a period in excess of the time
allowed in a parking meter zone.
(Ord. 4844. Passed 12-22-99.)
   (d)   This section shall not relieve any person from the duty to observe
other and more restrictive provisions of this Traffic Code and the Vehicle Code
prohibiting or limiting the stopping, standing or parking of vehicles in
specified places or at specified times.
(Ord. 4320. Passed 11-22-83.)

484.07 INCORPORATION OF EXISTING PARKING METER ZONE ORDINANCES.
   Existing parking meter zone ordinances are hereby incorporated in this
chapter by reference and readopted by Council, to apply within the district or
upon those streets or parts of streets described in existing ordinances of the
City in which the parking of vehicles is regulated by parking meters between
the hours specified on such meters.
(Ord. 4320. Passed 11-22-83.)
484.08 OVERTIME PARKING; WAIVER FINE; SUCCESSIVE VIOLATIONS.
   Any person parking overtime in any metered zone shall be given a tag by the

($20.00). If the violator fails to pay the fine after thirty calendar days, he
or she shall be subject to the procedure and penalty provided elsewhere in this
chapter for violations of this chapter. Each successive violation in excess of

(Ord. 4696. Passed 12-21-94.)
486.02 DEFINITIONS.
   The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation and enforcement
of this chapter:
   (a)   "Declaration of snow emergency" means a declaration of a snow
emergency event by the EOC in time for public announcement not later than 6:00
p.m. the day of, or, in the case of a probable overnight or early morning
start, the day preceding, the event.
   (b)   "Emergency Operations Coordinator (EOC)" means the City Manager or
another City employee so designated by the City Manager, i.e. the Emergency
Management Director or a designated department head.
   (c)   "Primary routes" means designated major arterials and main

principal, emergency, commercial, school or bus access. "Primary routes" also
includes major, high-volume residential streets. (See the list of designated
primary snow emergency routes set forth in Section
486.09.)
   (d)   "Snow emergency event" means a snow event where accumulation of snow
is expected to exceed six inches or where the effects of other types of winter
weather create an emergency situation.
   (e)   "Snow tires" means any tires mounted on drive wheels of vehicles,
which tires are designed to give effective traction on snow, mud or ice covered
streets by means of extra heavy duty treads with special high-traction
patterns, except that no tire so defined shall be construed to be a snow tire
if it is damaged or worn to the extent that its performance would be
substantially impaired. The performance of a snow tire shall be considered
substantially impaired if, when measured in tread groove at two points of the
circumference where the tread is thinnest, but not closer than fifteen inches,
the tread design depth of such tire measures not less than one-fourth of an
inch at both locations.
(Ord. 4696. Passed 12-21-94.)
486.03 DECLARATION OF SNOW EMERGENCY EVENT BY EMERGENCY OPERATIONS COORDINATOR.
   The Emergency Operations Coordinator (EOC) will declare a snow emergency in
time for public announcement not later than 6:00 p.m. the day of, or, in the
case of a probable overnight or early morning start, the day preceding, the
event. The EOC shall cause each declaration made pursuant to this chapter to be
publicly announced by means of broadcast from a radio station, television
station or public access channel with a normal operating range covering the
City and may cause such declaration to be further announced in newspapers of
general circulation when feasible. Each announcement shall describe the action
taken by the EOC, including the time such action became or will become
effective.
   The EOC shall make, or cause to be made, a record of each time and date when
any declaration is announced to the public in accordance with this section.
   Whenever the EOC shall find that some or all of the conditions which give
rise to a parking prohibition in effect pursuant to this chapter no longer
exist, he or she may declare the parking prohibition terminated, in whole or in
part.
(Ord. 4696. Passed 12-21-94.)
486.04 EFFECTIVE PERIOD OF PARKING RESTRICTIONS; OPERATION ON SNOW EMERGENCY

   The additional parking restrictions along designated primary routes shall
become enforceable one hour after the snow emergency is declared by the
Emergency Operations Coordinator (EOC) or when designated by the EOC, but not
less than one hour. The additional parking restrictions shall remain in effect
until they are terminated by announcement of the EOC in accordance with this
chapter.
   No person shall operate any vehicle on a snow removal street or snow
emergency route in such manner or in such condition as to allow or permit such
vehicle to become stalled or incapable of moving under its own power, because
the driving wheels of such vehicle are not equipped with chains, snow tires or
all-weather radial tires, or because the motor fuel supply of such vehicle has

(Ord. 4696. Passed 12-21-94.)
486.07 ILLEGAL REMOVAL OF SNOW BY PERSONS; DEPOSIT OF SNOW, ICE OR SLEET ON
PUBLIC ROADWAY.
   No person shall remove any snow from any portion of a street and pile the

(Ord. 4696. Passed 12-21-94.)
486.08 WINTER WEATHER EMERGENCY PLAN.
   The City Manager is hereby authorized and directed to prepare a Winter
Weather Emergency Plan to define the actions to be taken in the event of
adverse winter weather conditions in order to mitigate the effects of such
severe winter weather on transportation, commerce and general community welfare
and safety. Such Plan shall include, but not be limited to, defining roles and
responsibilities of City departments, identifying street designations and
operational parameters, identifying equipment and personnel available and snow
emergency event activation.
(Ord. 4696. Passed 12-21-94.)
486.09 DESIGNATION OF PRIMARY ROUTES AND ADDITIONAL PARKING RESTRICTIONS DURING
DECLARED SNOW EMERGENCIES.
   The following streets are hereby designated "primary routes" under the
"Winter Weather Emergency Plan." During a declared snow emergency, the
following additional parking restrictions shall apply:
   Additional parking restrictions on the designated primary routes, with the
exception of the Central Business District, are based on an odd/even method
where parking is restricted to that side of the street address numbering (odd/
even) that correlates with the day the snow emergency is declared by the
Emergency Operations Coordinator (EOC). For example, if, on December 28, the
EOC announces a snow emergency starting at some time that evening or early the
next morning, then along primary routes where parking is ordinarily allowed on
the even side of streets, vehicle owners must move their vehicles off that side
of the street to legal parking elsewhere. At 6:00 p.m. the next evening
(December 29), if the emergency is still in effect, vehicle owners may park
back on the even side, but must be off any odd side, legal, primary route
parking areas. This will allow plowing crews to clear the full street width
within a two-day period for better traffic flow and overall parking
availability.
   Areas that are normally restricted will also remain restricted during snow
emergencies. This parking pattern for designated primary routes will continue
until the emergency is declared over.
   All legal street parking along primary routes designated in the Central
Business District will be prohibited during snow emergencies between the hours
of 12:00 midnight and 6:00 a.m. Garage and off-street parking is available
during these hours so that snow removal crews can clear as much of the high
traffic areas as possible.

have committed the unlawful practice, the particulars thereof and such other

her attorney an opportunity to appear before the Commission or a member thereof
appointed by the majority of the members of the Commission.

committed.

practice, the Commission shall state its findings of fact and shall issue and
cause to be served on such respondent an order requiring such respondent to
cease and desist from such unlawful discriminatory practice and to take
affirmative action, including, but not limited to, hiring, reinstatement or
upgrading of employees, with or without back pay; admission or restoration to

commercial housing, upon such equal terms and conditions to any person
discriminated against or all persons as, in the judgment of the Commission,
will effectuate the purposes of this chapter, including a requirement for a
report of the manner of compliance.

not engaged in an unlawful practice, the Commission shall state its findings of
fact and shall issue and cause to be served upon the complainant an order

act of the minor, and shall direct the parent, guardian or other adult person

the court, the amount may be recovered in an action of assumpsit against such
parent, guardian or other adult person.
      (2)   If a judgment has been rendered against a minor for injury to a

(Ord. 4394. Passed 9-10-86.)
654.04 RETAIL THEFT.
   (a)   Offense Defined.
      (1)   No person shall:
         A.   Take possession of, carry away or transfer, or cause to be
carried away or transferred, any merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered
for sale by any store or other retail mercantile establishment with the
intention of depriving the merchant of the possession, use or benefit of such
merchandise without paying the full retail value thereof;
         B.   Alter, transfer or remove any label, price tag marking, indicia
of value or any other marking which aids in determining the value affixed to
any merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered for sale in a store or other
retail mercantile establishment and attempt to purchase such merchandise
personally or in consort with another at less than the full retail value with
the intention of depriving the merchant of the full retail value of such
merchandise;
         C.   Transfer any merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered for
sale by any store or other retail mercantile establishment from the container
in or on which the same is displayed to any other container with the intent to
deprive the merchant of all or some part of the full retail value thereof; or
         D.   Under-ring with the intention of depriving the merchant of the
full retail value of the merchandise.
      (2)   Retail theft is a summary offense, and therefore a violation of
this section, only if the offense is a first offense and the value of the
merchandise is less than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Otherwise, the
actor shall be prosecuted under State law.
   (b)   Presumptions. Any person intentionally concealing unpurchased property
of any store or other mercantile establishment, either on the premises or
outside the premises of such store, shall be prima-facie presumed to have so
concealed such property with the intention of depriving the merchant of the
possession, use or benefit of such merchandise without paying the full retail
value thereof within the meaning of subsection (a) hereof. The finding of such
unpurchased property concealed, upon the person or among the belongings of such
person, shall be prima-facie evidence of intentional concealment, and, if such
person conceals or causes to be concealed such unpurchased property, upon the
person or among the belongings of another, such fact shall also be prima-facie
evidence of intentional concealment on the part of the person so concealing
such property.
   (c)   Evidence. To the extent that there is other competent evidence to
substantiate the offense, the conviction shall not be avoided because the
prosecution cannot produce the stolen merchandise.
   (d)   Detention. A peace officer, a merchant or merchant's employee or an
agent under contract with a merchant, who has probable cause to believe that
retail theft has occurred or is occurring on or about a store or other retail
mercantile establishment, and who has probable cause to believe that a specific
person has committed or is committing the retail theft, may detain the suspect
in a reasonable manner for a reasonable time on or off the premises for all or
any of the following purposes:
      (1)   To require the suspect to identify himself or herself;
      (2)   To verify such identification; or
      (3)   To determine whether or not such suspect has in his or her
possession unpurchased merchandise taken from the mercantile establishment and,
if so, to recover such merchandise, to inform a peace officer or to institute
criminal proceedings against the suspect.
   Such detention shall not impose a civil or criminal liability upon the peace
officer, merchant, employee or agent so detaining.
   (e)   Reduction Prohibited. No justice of the peace or other magistrate
shall have the power to reduce any other charge of theft to a charge of retail
theft as defined in this section.
   (f)   Definitions. As used in this section:
      (1)   "Conceal" means to conceal merchandise so that, although there may
be some notice of its presence, it is not visible through ordinary observation.
      (2)   "Full retail value" means the merchant's stated or advertised price
of the merchandise.
      (3)   "Merchandise" means any goods, chattels, foodstuffs or wares of any
type and description, regardless of the value thereof.
      (4)   "Merchant" means an owner or operator of any retail mercantile
establishment or any agent, employee, lessee, consignee, officer, director,
franchisee or independent contractor of such owner or operator.
      (5)   "Premises of a retail mercantile establishment" includes, but is
not limited to, the retail mercantile establishment, any common use areas in
shopping centers and all parking areas set aside by a merchant or on behalf of
a merchant for the parking of vehicles for the convenience of the patrons of
such retail mercantile establishment.
      (6)   "Store or other retail mercantile establishment" means a place
where merchandise is displayed, held, stored or sold or offered to the public
for sale.
      (7)   "Under-ring" means to cause the cash register or other sales
recording device to reflect less than the full retail value of the merchandise.
   (g)   Fingerprinting. Prior to the commencement of a trial or the entry of
plea of a defendant sixteen years of age or older accused of a violation of
this section, the issuing authority shall order the defendant to submit, within
five days of such order, for fingerprinting by the Department of Police or the
State Police. Fingerprints so obtained shall be forwarded immediately to the
State Police for determination as to whether or not the defendant previously
has been convicted of the offense of retail theft. The results of such
determination shall be forwarded to the Department of Police if such Department
is the prosecutor, or to the issuing authority if the prosecutor is other than
a police officer. The issuing authority shall not proceed with the trial or
plea until in receipt of the determination made by the State Police. The
District Justice shall use the information obtained solely for the purpose of
grading the offense pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) hereof.
(Ord. 4394. Passed 9-10-86.)
654.05 THEFT OF SERVICES.
   (a)   Acquisition of Services.
      (1)   No person shall intentionally obtain services for himself or
herself or for another, which he or she knows are available only for
compensation, by deception or threat, by altering or tampering with the public
utility meter or measuring device by which such services are delivered or by
causing or permitting such altering or tampering, by making or maintaining any
unauthorized connection, whether physically, electrically or inductively, to a
distribution or transmission line, by attaching or maintaining the attachment
of any unauthorized device to any cable, wire or other component of an
electric, telephone or cable television system or to a television receiving set
connected to a cable television system, by making or maintaining any
unauthorized modification or alteration to any device installed by a cable
television system, or by false token or other trick or artifice to avoid
payment for the service.
      (2)   As used in this section, the word "service" includes, but is not
limited to, labor, professional service, transportation service, the supplying
of hotel accommodations, restaurant services, entertainment, cable television
service, the supplying of equipment for use, and the supplying of commodities
of a public utility nature such as gas, electricity, steam, water and telephone
service. The term "unauthorized" means that payment of full compensation for
service has been avoided, or has been sought to be avoided, without the consent
of the supplier of the service.
      (3)   A person is not guilty of theft of cable television service under
this section if such person subscribes to and receives service through an
authorized connection of a television receiving set at his or her dwelling and,
within his or her dwelling, makes an unauthorized connection of an additional
television receiving set or sets or audio system which receives only basic
cable television service obtained through such authorized connection.
      (4)   Where compensation for service is ordinarily paid immediately upon
the rendering of such service, as in the case of hotels and restaurants,
refusal to pay or absconding without payment or offer to pay gives rise to a
presumption that the service was obtained by deception as to intention to pay.
   (b)   Diversion of Services. No person, having control over the disposition
of services of others to which he or she is not entitled, shall knowingly
divert such services to his or her own benefit or to the benefit of another not
entitled thereto.
   (c)   Grading. Theft of services is a summary offense, and therefore a
violation of this section, only if the value of the services obtained or
diverted is less than fifty dollars ($50.00). Otherwise, the actor shall be
prosecuted under State law.
   Amounts involved in theft of services committed pursuant to one scheme or
course of conduct, whether from the same person or several persons, may be
aggregated in determining the grade of the offense.
   (d)   Inferences.
      (1)   Any person having possession of or access to the location of a
public utility meter or service measuring device which has been avoided or
tampered with so as to inhibit or prevent the accurate measurement of utility
service, and who enjoys the use of or receives the benefit from the public
utility service intended to be metered or measured by the public utility meter
or measuring device so avoided or tampered with, may be reasonably inferred to
have acted to avoid or tamper with the public utility meter or measuring device
with the intent to obtain the public utility service without making full
compensation therefor.
      (2)   Any person having possession of or access to the location of the
distribution or transmission lines or other facilities of a cable television
system which have been tapped, altered or tampered with or to which any
unauthorized connection has been made or to which any unauthorized device has
been attached, or any person having possession of or access to any device
installed by a cable television system to which an unauthorized modification or
alteration has been made, the result of which tapping, altering, tampering,
connection, attachment or modification is to avoid payment for all or any part
of the cable television service for which payment is normally required, and who
enjoys the use of or receives the benefit from the cable television service,
may be reasonably inferred to have acted to have tapped, altered, tampered
with, connected or attached to or modified cable television facilities with the
intent to obtain cable television service without making full compensation
therefor. This inference shall not apply to the act of a subscriber to cable
television service, who receives service through an authorized connection of a
television receiving set at his or her dwelling, in making, within his or her
dwelling, an unauthorized connection of an additional television receiving set
or sets or audio system which receives only basic cable television service
obtained through such authorized connection.

a library or willfully and without authority remove any library or museum

or her own use.
      (2)   Library theft is a summary offense, and therefore a violation of
this section, only if the offense is a first offense and the value of the
material is less than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Otherwise, the actor
shall be prosecuted under State law.
      (3)   Amounts involved in library thefts committed pursuant to one scheme
or course of conduct, whether from the same library or several libraries, may

   (b)   Presumption. A person who willfully conceals any library or museum
material on his or her person or among his or her belongings while still on the

facie presumed to have concealed the library or museum material with the
intention of converting such material to his or her own use.

probable cause to believe that a person has committed library theft may detain
such person on the premises of the library or in the immediate vicinity thereof

reasonable length of time to determine whether such person has unlawfully
concealed or removed any library or museum material.

surrender that person to the custody of a peace officer.
   (d)   Exemption From Liability. A peace officer, employee or agent of a
library who detains or causes the arrest of any person pursuant to this section
shall not be held civilly or criminally liable for false arrest, false
imprisonment, unlawful detention, assault, battery, slander, libel or malicious
prosecution of the person detained or arrested if the peace officer, employee
or agent of the library had at the time of the detention or arrest probable
cause to believe that the person committed library theft.
   (e)   Public Display of Law. A copy of this section shall be publicly
displayed in the reading rooms and other public rooms of all libraries in such
number and manner as will bring this section to the attention of patrons.
   (f)   Prior Offenses. Prior to the commencement of trial or entry of plea of
a defendant sixteen years of age or older accused of the summary offense of
library theft, the issuing authority shall notify the Pennsylvania State Police
for determination as to whether or not the defendant previously has been
convicted of the offense of library theft. The results of such determination
shall be forwarded to the Police Department if the Department is the
prosecutor, or to the issuing authority if the prosecutor is other than the
Department. The issuing authority shall not proceed with the trial or plea in
summary cases until in receipt of the determination made by the State Police.
The District Magistrate shall use the information obtained solely for the
purpose of grading the offense pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) hereof.
   (g)   Fingerprinting. Upon conviction the issuing authority shall order the
defendant to submit within five days of such order for fingerprinting by the
Department of Police.

   (a)   Prohibition. No person shall retain any book, pamphlet, magazine,
newspaper, manuscript, map or other property belonging in, or to, or on deposit
with, any library open to the public or any part thereof, for a period
exceeding thirty days after such library has given written notice to return the
same.
   (b)   Disposition of Fine. Any fine imposed under this section shall be paid
over by the magistrate imposing such fine to the library instituting the
prosecution, and costs of prosecution.
   (c)   Form of Notice. Such notice may be given by personal service upon the

      (2)   No person shall, knowing that it will not be honored by the drawee,

without regard to whether the location of the issuance or passing of the check
or similar sight order is within or outside of the City. It shall be no defense
to a violation of this section that some or all of the acts constituting the
offense occurred outside of the City.
      (3)   Issuing or passing a check or similar sight order for the payment
of money, knowing that it will not be honored by the drawee, is a summary
offense, and therefore a violation of this section, only if the amount of the
check or order is five hundred dollars ($500.00) or less and if the offense is
not a third or subsequent offense within a five-year period. Otherwise, the
actor shall be prosecuted under State law.

      (1)   The issuer had no account with the drawee at the time the check or
order was issued.

presentation within thirty days after issue, and the issuer failed to make good
within ten days after receiving notice of that refusal.

conduct through the public exhibition of lewd films, through the display and/or

840.01 FINDINGS.
   The following are the findings of the Council of the City of Johnstown:
   (a)   Sexually oriented businesses are frequently used for unlawful sexual
activities, including prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature.
   (b)   The concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health
concern of the City which demands reasonable regulation of sexually oriented
businesses in order to protect the health and well-being of the citizens.
   (c)   Permitting and/or licensing is a legitimate and reasonable means of
accountability to ensure that operators of sexually oriented businesses comply
with reasonable regulations and to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow
their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or
solicitation.
   (d)   There is convincing documented evidence that sexually oriented
businesses, because of their very nature, have a deleterious effect on both the
existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent
to them, causing increased crime and the downgrading of property values.
   (e)   It is recognized that sexually oriented businesses, due to their
nature, have serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly
when they are located in close proximity to each other, thereby contributing to
neighborhood blight and downgrading the quality of life in the adjacent area.
   (f)   The City desires to minimize and control these adverse effects and
thereby protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizenry; protect the
citizens from increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the
property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods; and deter the
spread of neighborhood blight.
   (g)   It is not the intent of this chapter to suppress any speech activities
protected by the First Amendment but to enact a content-neutral ordinance which
addresses the secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses.
   (h)   It is not the intent of the Council to condone or legitimize the
distribution of obscene material.
(Ord. 4818. Passed 1-27-99.)
840.02 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented businesses
to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the City
and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious
location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the City. The
provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a
limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials,
including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor

simply state that the figures used in making such declaration are the figures
used in making the declaration of the estimate for the Federal income tax,
provided that it is understood that such figures may be modified according to
this chapter so that the declaration required by this section shall set forth
only such income as is taxable under this chapter.
   Such declaration of estimated tax to be paid to the City shall be
accompanied by a payment of at least one-fourth of the estimated tax and at
least a similar amount for such year shall be paid on or before June 15,
September 15 and December 15 of each year. However, such estimate may be
amended at the time of the making of any quarterly payment. Further, on or
before March 15 of the year following that for which such declaration was

City shall be paid therewith. If it then appears that such taxpayer has paid
more than the amount of tax to which the City would be entitled under this
chapter, a refund of the amount so overpaid shall be made.

(Ord. 5008. Passed 12-12-07; Ord. 5187. Passed 11-12-15; Ord. 5350. Passed 4-
12-23.)
882.03 EXEMPTION AND REFUNDS.
   (a)   Exemptions. The following persons are exempt fro payment of the tax
specified in Section
882.02 :
      (1)   Any person whose total earned income and net profits from all
sources within the City is less than twelve thousand dollars ($12,000) for any
calendar year in which the tax is levied is exempt for that calendar year. In
addition, the following persons are exempt from payment of the tax:
      (2)   Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which the
United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or released under
honorable circumstances from active service if, as a result of military
service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double or quadruple amputee or

States Marine Corps Reserve, United States Coast Guard Reserve, United States
Air Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the Pennsylvania Air

   (b)   Procedure to Claim Exemption.
      (1)   A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the City and with the person's
employer affirming that the person reasonably expects to receive earned income
and net profits from all sources within the City of less than twelve thousand
($12,000) in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is filed. In
the event the City utilizes a tax collection officer, it shall provide a copy
of the exemption certificate to that officer. The exemption certificate shall
have attached to it a copy of all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms
from employment within the City for the year prior to the fiscal year for which
the employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax. Upon receipt of the
exemption certificate and until otherwise instructed by the City or except as
required by subsection (2) below, the employer shall not withhold the tax from
the person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar year for
which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall ensure that the
exemption certificate forms are readily available to employees at all times and
shall furnish each new employee with a form at the time of hiring. The
exemption certificate form shall be the uniform form provided by the City.
      (2)   With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the person or
by the City that the person has received earned income and net profits from all
sources within the City equal to or in excess of twelve thousand ($12,000) in
that calendar year or that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax
exemption for that calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person
of earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in excess of
twelve thousand ($12,000) in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold the
local services tax from the person under subsection (3) below.
      (3)   If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year from
the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under subsection (2),
the employer shall withhold the tax for the remainder of that calendar year.
The employer shall withhold from the person, for the first payroll period after
receipt of the notification under subsection (2), a lump sum equal to the
amount of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per payroll amount due
for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld per payroll period
for the remaining payroll periods in that calendar year shall be the same
amount withheld for other employees. In the event the employment of a person
subject to withholding of the tax under this subsection is subsequently severed
in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any outstanding balance
of tax due, and the City may pursue collection under this chapter.
      (4)   Except as provided in subsection (2), it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating exemption
certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or exempting any employee
from the local services tax.
   (c)   Refunds. The City, in consultation with the Collector and DCED, shall
establish procedures for the processing of refund claims for any tax paid by
any person who is eligible for exemption, which procedures shall be in accord
with provisions of the general municipal law relating to refunds of
overpayments and interest on overpayments. Refunds made within 75 days of a
refund request or 75 days after the last day the employer is required to remit
the tax for the last quarter of the calendar year, whichever is later, shall
not be subject to interest. No refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a
calendar year that do not exceed $1. The City or the Collector shall determine
eligibility for exemption and provide refunds to exempt persons.

882.04 DUTY OF EMPLOYERS TO COLLECT.
   (a)   Each employer within the City, as well as those employers situated
outside the City but who engage in business within the City, is hereby charged
with the duty of collecting the tax from each of its employees engaged by it or
performing for it within the City and making a return and payment thereof to
the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby authorized to deduct this tax
for each employee it employs, whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or
commission and whether or not all such services are performed within the City.
   (b)   A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro
rata share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person for a
payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax levied for
the calendar year by the number of payroll periods established by the employer
for the calendar year. For purposes of determining the pro rata share, an
employer shall round down the amount of the tax collected each payroll period
to the nearest 1/100 of a dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a
payroll period basis for each payroll period in which the person is engaging in
an occupation, except as provided in subsection (d) of this section.
   (c)   No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one City during each payroll period.
   (d)   In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement from a
principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the length of the
payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a statement from the
employee that the pay statement is from the employee's principal employer and
the employee will notify other employers of a change in principal place of
employment within two weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall
be provided on the form approved by DCED.
   (e)   The tax shall be no more than forty-seven dollars ($47.00), on each
person for each calendar year, irrespective of the number of political
subdivisions within which a person may be employed. The City shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
   (f)   No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or
for the payment of the withheld tax money to the City if the failure to
withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the employee as
to the employee's place or places of employment, the employee's principal
office or where the employee is principally employed. Further, an employer
shall not be liable for payment of the local services tax in an amount
exceeding the amount withheld by the employer if the employer complies with the
provisions of subsection (b) hereof and remits the amount so withheld in
accordance with this chapter.
   (g)   Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.

12-23.)
882.05 RETURNS.
   Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid to an employee,
except as provided hereafter in this chapter, the employer shall be responsible
for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had been originally levied
against the employer.
(Ord. 5008. Passed 12-12-07; Ord. 5187. Passed 11-12-15.)
882.06 DATES FOR DETERMINING TAX LIABILITY AND PAYMENT.
   In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted and paid
over to the Collector on or before the thirtieth day following the end of each
calendar quarter of each such tax year.
(Ord. 5008. Passed 12-12-07.)
882.07 SELF-EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS.
   Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind or
engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of employment
within the political subdivision shall be required to comply with this chapter
and pay the pro rata portion of the tax due to the Collector on or before the
thirtieth day following the end of each quarter.
(Ord. 5008. Passed 12-12-07.)
882.08 INDIVIDUALS ENGAGED IN MORE THAN ONE OCCUPATION OR EMPLOYED IN MORE THAN
ONE POLITICAL SUBDIVISION.
   (a)   The sites of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day
the person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the event
a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is, concurrent
employment, or an occupation which requires the person working in more than one
political subdivision during a payroll period, the priority of claims to
collect the local services tax shall be in the following order:
      (1)   First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
      (2)   Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
      (3)   Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
   (b)   In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that
calendar year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
(Ord. 5008. Passed 12-12-07.)
882.09 NONRESIDENTS SUBJECT TO TAX.
   All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the political subdivision but who perform services of
any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the political
subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject themselves
to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under this chapter
with the same force and effect as though they were residents of the political
subdivision. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation within the
political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential employer may, for the
purpose of this chapter, be considered a self-employed person, and in the event
his or her tax is not paid, the political subdivision shall have the option of
proceeding against either the employer or employee for the collection of this
tax as hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 5008. Passed 12-12-07.)
882.10 ADMINISTRATION OF TAX.
   (a)   The Collector shall be appointed by resolution of the political
subdivision. It shall be the duty of the Collector to accept and receive
payments of this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount received
by him or her from each employer or self-employed person, together with the
date the tax was received.
   (b)   The Collector is hereby charged with the administration and
enforcement of this chapter and is hereby charged and empowered, subject to
municipal approval, to proscribe, adopt and promulgate rules and regulations
relating to any matter pertaining to the administration and enforcement of this
chapter, including provisions for the examination of payroll records of any
employer subject to this chapter, the examination and correction of any return
made in compliance with this chapter and any payment alleged or found to be
incorrect or as to which overpayment is claimed or found to have occurred. Any
person aggrieved by any decision of the Collector shall have the right to
appeal consistent with the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights under Act 50 of 1998.
The procedures for filing any appeals relating to the imposed tax can be found
in the Finance Office.
   (c)   The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return made by
an employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax due. Each employer
is hereby directed and required to give the Collector the means, facilities and
opportunity for such examination.
(Ord. 5008. Passed 12-12-07.)
882.11 SUITS FOR COLLECTIONS.
   (a)   In the event that any tax under this chapter remains due or unpaid 30
days after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for the
recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this chapter, together with
interest and penalty.
   (b)   If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate
of 6% on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning with the due date
of the tax and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of such tax for
nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery or this tax or other
appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable therefor shall, in
addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of collection.
(Ord. 5008. Passed 12-12-07.)
882.12 VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
   Whoever makes any false or untrue statement on any return required by this
chapter, or whoever refuses inspection of the books, records or accounts in his
or her custody and control setting forth the number of employees subject to
this tax who are in his or her employment, or whoever fails or refuses to file
any return required by this chapter shall be guilty of a violation and, upon
conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $600 and
costs of prosecution, and, in default of payment of such fine and costs, to
imprisonment for not more than 30 days. The action to enforce the penalty
herein prescribed may be instituted against any person in charge of the
business of any employer who shall have failed or who refuses to file a return
required by this chapter.
(Ord. 5008. Passed 12-12-07.)
882.13 INTERPRETATION.
   (a)   Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to empower the
City to levy and collect the tax hereby imposed on any occupation not within
the taxing power of the City under the Constitution of the United States and
the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
   (b)   If the tax hereby imposed under the provisions of this chapter shall
be held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of the

or impair the right to impose or collect said tax or the validity of the tax so
imposed on other persons or individuals as herein provided.

has imposed or hereafter imposes such tax on the same person or transfer, then
the tax levied by the City under the authority of such Act shall, during the
time such duplication of the tax exists, except as hereinafter otherwise
provided, be one-half of the rate, and such one-half rate shall become
effective without any action on the part of the City. However, the City and any
other political subdivision which imposes such tax on the same person or
transfer may agree that, instead of limiting their respective rates to one-half
of the rate herein provided, they will impose, respectively, different rates,
the total of which rates shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted under the
Local Tax Enabling Act.
   (d)   If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate
in effect at the time the tax is due shall be added and collected.

   The United States, the Commonwealth and all of their instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions shall be exempt from payment of the tax
imposed by this chapter. However, the exemption of such governmental bodies
shall not relieve any other party to a transaction from liability for the tax.
(Ord. 4438. Passed 9-23-87.)
888.06 EXCLUDED TRANSACTIONS.
   The tax imposed in Section
888.04 shall not be imposed upon:
   (a)   A transfer to the Commonwealth, or to any of its instrumentalities,

condemnation or by deed of confirmation in connection with condemnation

nominal actual consideration, of property passed by testate or intestate
succession and held by cotenants, provided, however, that if any party takes

excess;

making such transfer;

consideration, of property passing by testate or intestate succession from a
personal representative of a decedent to the decedent's devisee or heir;
   (h)   A transfer, for no actual consideration or for nominal actual
consideration, to a trustee of an ordinary trust, where the transfer of the
same property would be exempt if the transfer were made directly from the
grantor to all of the possible beneficiaries, whether or not such beneficiaries
are contingent or specifically named, except that no such exemption shall be
granted unless the Recorder of Deeds is presented with a copy of the trust
instrument that clearly identifies the grantor and all possible beneficiaries;
   (i)   A transfer, for no actual consideration or for nominal actual

document by which title is acquired by a grantee or statement of value fails to
set forth that the property was acquired by the grantee from, or for the
benefit of, his or her principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the
property is the property of the grantee in his or her individual capacity if
the grantee claims an exemption from taxation under this subsection;

the City and the laws of the Commonwealth related thereto and that the
applicant shall well and truly save, defend and keep harmless the City from and

roadway is improved or paved, and/or a maximum yardage of five cubic yards of
excavation where the sidewalk or roadway is not improved or paved, which are

highway shall be issued under the provisions of division (d)(2) and (d)(3) of
this section.
      (5)   For the removal of a pole, tree or stump, including the removal of
the paving, if any, where an immediate replacement of a pole or tree is not
anticipated, a fee shall be established by ordinance of City Council and
amended from time to time.
      (6)   For each separate excavation for the setting of a pole or the
planting of a tree, a fee shall be established by ordinance of City Council and
amended from time to time.
      (7)   For the excavation by tunneling under an improved street or highway
or sidewalk, the provisions of divisions (d)(1) through (d)(3) hereof shall
prevail, the same as if the highway were excavated by open cut methods.
      (8)   For any excavation for the installation or relocation of
substructures or their appurtenances made necessary by public improvements,
carried out and/or contracted out by the City and/or carried out or contracted
out by a municipal authority or public utility in coordination with a City
project, involving excavation and/or an excavation project authorized by the

requirements of Section
1024.01 and the backfilling and repaving requirements of Section
1024.09 shall apply.
      (9)   Where, by necessity, the excavation granted under any permit
extends under the tracks of a street railway company or any railroad located on
a public highway, all of the provisions of this chapter shall prevail the same
as if the tracks did not exist.
      (10)   In cases where the permit applicant coordinates excavation,
tunneling under or other activities that would otherwise disturb the street,
highway or sidewalk with a public improvements project carried out and/or
contracted out by the City, the City may waive permit fees for those activities
carried out concurrent with the aforementioned public improvements project but
still require permit applicant to complete the application and meet all

1024.04 PAYMENT OF FEES.
   An applicant for a permit shall pay to the City the additional fee or charge
and the surcharge specified in Section
1024.03 (d) and Section
1024.05 , respectively, immediately upon completion of the work for which the
permit was granted, irrespective of whether or not such work was actually
performed by the applicant, or whether or not such work was sublet to a third
party independent contractor. In no case shall the person granted a permit
delay payment to the City by passing on permit fees or charges to a
subcontractor actually performing the work.
(Ord. 5288. Passed 6-10-20.)
1024.05 SURCHARGE FOR OPENINGS IN NEW STREETS.
   (a)   No permit required by Section
1024.01  shall be issued which would allow an excavation or opening in any
paved or improved street or alley or sidewalk, the surface of which has been
improved within a five year period preceding the date of permit issuance,
unless there has first been paid to the City a surcharge which shall be in
addition to the usual permit fee. The surcharge shall be equal to 50 percent of
the usual permit fee for an opening if the street or alley or sidewalk has been
improved within the preceding five years and 75 percent if the improvement was
made within the preceding two years, except that for any excavation or opening
in excess of 50 feet in length in a paved street which has been surfaced within
the preceding five years, the surcharge shall be an amount sufficient to
resurface the street full width for the entire length of the opening.
   (b)   The resurfacing shall be of a type determined by the Director of
Public Works or his or her designee, but in no case shall the basis for the
additional surcharge exceed the cost of resurfacing to a thickness of one inch.
The additional surcharge shall be reduced by 20 percent for each year since the
street has last been surfaced. Utility companies shall also pay the above
surcharges based on City restoration costs.
   (c)   The permit applicant may request waiver of the additional fee but not
the minimum/base fees outlined in the rate schedule, if he or she can prove
that the work requiring excavating, cutting, tunneling under or other
activities that would otherwise disturb the street, highway or sidewalk are (1)
of an emergency nature, or (2) permit applicant could not have been aware of
the subsurface conditions that triggered the need to carry out excavation,
cutting, tunneling under or other activities that otherwise triggered the need
to carry out excavation, cutting, tunneling under or other activities that
would otherwise disturb the street, highway or sidewalk when notified by the
City prior to being notified by the City or the owner of the sanitary sewer
collection system. All quantities of paving surface shall be determined by
measurements made by the inspector or other employee assigned to do such work
by the Director of Public Works or his or her designee.
(Ord. 5288. Passed 6-10-20.)
1024.06 WITHHOLDING OF PERMIT ISSUANCE.
   The Director of Public Works or his or her designee may, at his or her
discretion, withhold the issuance of any permit, except in cases of immediate
necessary emergency repairs, where on account of weather conditions, the
proximity of other excavations or for any other cause, the proposed excavation
would create a condition prejudicial to the public safety.
(Ord. 5288. Passed 6-10-20.)
1024.07 PERMITS NOT TRANSFERABLE; WORK TO BE PERFORMED AT LOCATION DESIGNATED
IN PERMIT.
   Permits provided for in Section
1024.01  shall not be transferable from one person to another, and the work
shall not be made in any place other than the location specifically designated
in the permit.
(Ord. 5288. Passed 6-10-20.)
1024.08   EXPIRATION; EXTENSION OF TIME LIMIT; PERFORMANCE OF WORK UNDER
EXPIRED PERMIT.
   Every permit required by Section
1024.01  shall expire at the end of the period of time which shall be set out
in the permit. If the permittee shall be unable to complete the work within the
specified time, provided the work was commenced prior to the expiration of
time, he shall, prior to expiration of the permit, present in writing to the
Director of Public Works or his or her designee a request for an extension of
time, setting forth therein the reasons for the requested extension. The
Director of Public Works or his or her designee may for good cause shown grant
an extension of time in writing. If the permit expires before the actual work
commences, it shall be necessary to make application for and be issued a new
permit. It shall be unlawful for any person to excavate, cut, or tunnel under
any street when a permit has expired.
(Ord. 5288. Passed 6-10-20.)
1024.09   BACKFILLING, RESTORATION, RESURFACING AND REPAVING.
   (a)   The backfilling, restoration, resurfacing and repaving of openings,
cuts, excavations and tunnelings shall be, both in workmanship and material, in
conformity with the current standard specifications of the City, and such work
shall at all times, be subject to the inspection and approval of the Director
of Public Works or his or her designee. Such restoration shall restore the
surface and adjacent area to the same or better condition as existed prior to
the opening, cut, excavation or tunneling.
   (b)   Notice of time of commencement. The Director of Public Works or his or
her designee must be notified by the permittee prior to the beginning of
backfilling of the date and approximate time at which backfilling will begin.
   (c)   Excavations shall be restored and resurfaced with comparable design
and materials as existed prior to the excavation and shall be backfilled as
follows: Sand or fine material shall be mechanically tamped in six-inch layers
upon each side and over the top of a substructure to a height of 12 inches. The
remainder of the backfill shall be deposited in approximately nine-inch layers
and thoroughly compacted by mechanically tamping. In no case shall the number
of persons shoveling exceed the number of persons tamping while tamping is in
progress. Material for backfilling shall be free from muck, rubbish or other
unsuitable material. Material excavated which is not suitable for backfilling
shall be removed and suitable material must be provided. Stones exceeding one
cubic foot in volume shall not be used in the backfill and individual stones
shall be separated from each other by fine material, thus ensuring complete
filling of voids. In tunnels, the entire backfill shall be deposited and
mechanically tamped in six-inch layers. The removal of sheathing and shoring
shall be executed in such a manner as to prevent the sides of the trench from
falling in and all voids caused by the removal of timber shall be filled with
fine material which shall be thoroughly compacted. Backfill shall be thoroughly
flushed with water if ordered by the City Engineer and the use of ten gallons
of water per cubic yard of backfill may be required. If the street or highway
is unpaved, the backfilling shall not exceed four inches in elevation above the
undisturbed grounds at the sides bordering the excavation, and the surface of
the street or highway over the excavation shall be maintained by the use of
cinder or other approved material whenever settlement takes place.
   (d)   Excavations shall be repaved as follows: Where excavations are made
where sidewalks or roadways are paved, the backfilling shall be completed up to
the elevation of the original subgrade under such paving, then the paving shall
be removed, down to the subgrade for a distance of one foot beyond the outer
limits of the excavation in the roadway and six inches beyond the outer limits
of the excavation in the sidewalk, and the pavement shall then be reconstructed
in accordance with the correct standard specifications for the construction of
new pavements of the type removed. However, where the original pavement of the
roadway consists of brick, cobble or stone-block laid without a concrete base,
the repaving shall be constructed with (1) a concrete base, six inches thick,
composed of one part Portland cement, two parts approved fine aggregate and
four parts approved coarse aggregate, each measured separately and accurately
by volume and mixed in accordance with the specifications of the City, or (2)
Superpave 25.0 mm HMA Base Course at a depth of six inches. Where the width of
the excavation exceeds 12 inches, then the concrete base or concrete pavement
shall be reinforced with approved steel wire-mesh weighing not less than 65
pounds per 100 square feet and the reinforcing shall extend to within three
inches of all edges of the base or pavement and shall be placed two inches
below and parallel with the top of the concrete. Where the width of the
excavation exceeds 24 inches, the concrete base or concrete pavement shall be
reinforced with three-fourths inch reinforcing bars placed six inches center to
center with a two-inch clear on each end and a three-inch clear on the bottom.
   (e)   All repaving of streets and highways shall be extended to the midpoint
of the paved cartway ("Curb-to-Midpoint Repaving"") for the length of an
excavation on any excavation with a work disturbance area exceeding 50 feet in
length. The Director of Public Works reserves the right to waive this
requirement for public improvements carried out and/or contracted out by the
City and/or carried out or contracted out by a municipal authority or public
utility in coordination with a City project involving excavation and/or an
excavation project authorized by the City.
   (f)   Repaving/resurfacing of sidewalks for excavations other than for the
inspection, installation, removal, repair or replacement of a curb box only
shall require the replacement of the entire length and width of the sidewalk
slabs/sections affected. The Director of Public Works reserves the right to
waive this requirement for public improvements carried out and/or contracted
out by the City and/or carried out or contracted out by a municipal authority
or public utility in coordination with a City project involving excavation and/
or an excavation project authorized by the City.
   (g)   The person which received the permit shall be responsible for any
failure of replaced pavement surface during a period of three years following
completion of permanent restoration work. Any expense incurred by the City in
correcting the settlement of the restoration materials or roadway shall be paid
by the permittee unless the permittee submits proof satisfactory to the
Director of Public Works or his or her designee that the settlement was not due
to defective backfilling or other causes controllable by the permittee.
   All repaving work shall be done in a skillful and workmanlike manner, under
the supervision of a competent superintendent or foreman, experienced in the
particular type of construction involved, who shall receive and comply with all
orders of the Director of Public Works or his or her designees.
   However, upon the request of the person granted the permit, for permission
to change the type of repaving surface from that of the original surface, the
Director of Public Works or his or her designee may grant such permission if,
in his or her opinion, the request is in the best interests of the City. If the
Director of Public Works or his or her designee deems it advisable, economical
and in the best interests of the City, he or she may, at his or her discretion,
order, in writing, the replacement of the original paving surface with a type
of paving surface that is more desirable and suitable for the highway.
   (h)   The person granted the permit shall be responsible for restoration or
replacement of property damage occurring on adjacent property as a result of or
related to the repaving or restoration. The financial security issued in
accordance with Section
1024.01  shall be written to cover damage to adjacent property.
(Ord. 5288. Passed 6-10-20.)
1024.10   INTERRUPTION OF COMMERCE; AROUND-THE-CLOCK OPERATIONS.

1024.01  shall be performed between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.,
Monday through Friday except in an emergency or when otherwise noted on the
permit.
   (b)   At the discretion of the Director of Public Works or his or her
designee, when it is deemed that an excavation of the nature set forth in this
chapter will interrupt, for an unreasonable period of time, the natural flow of
commerce in the area where the excavation is being conducted, the City shall
(1) require the permittee or its contractor to work around the clock to
complete the work and to accommodate other businesses in that locale; and (2)
require the permitee or contractor to install at the work site at least two
weeks in advance of the beginning of construction a digital sign notifying the
traveling public of the location of the streets on which traffic flow will be
disrupted by the construction and the estimated start and end dates of
construction.
   (c)   Access to private driveways shall be provided by the permittee or
contractor at all times except during working hours when construction
operations prohibit provision of access. Before any private driveway shall be
closed, the users of the access shall be notified and given sufficient time for
removal of equipment or automobiles, if desired. Emergency access to fire
hydrants must be provided at all times.
(Ord. 5288. Passed 6-10-20.)
1024.11   BARRIERS, WARNING LIGHTS, ETC., TO BE PROVIDED; INSTALLATION BY CITY
ON FAILURE OF PERMITTEE; REMOVAL, ETC., PROHIBITED.
   (a)   Every permittee shall place around the project as many barriers,
barricades, lights, warning flags and signs as shall be determined by the
Director of Public Works or his or her designee to be necessary for the
protection of the public. Additional safety requirements may be prescribed by
the Director of Public Works or his or her designee.
   (b)   Whenever any person fails to provide or maintain the safety devices
required by the Director of Public Works, or his or her designee, such devices
shall be installed and maintained by the City. The amount of the cost incurred
shall be paid by the permittee.
   (c)   No person shall willfully move, remove, injure, destroy or extinguish
any barrier, warning light, sign or notice erected, placed or posted in
accordance with this section.
(Ord. 5288. Passed 6-10-20.)
1024.12   COORDINATION OF CITY PAVING AND INFRASTRUCTURE REPAIR AND
REPLACEMENT.
   When the City plans to improve or pave any street, the Director of Public
Works or his or her designee shall first give notice to all persons owning
property abutting on the street about to be paved or improved and to all public
utilities and municipal authorities operating in the City. All persons, public
utilities and municipal authorities shall make all connections as well as any
repairs thereto which would necessitate excavation of the street within six
months from the giving of notice if they wish to avoid the surcharges imposed
by Section 1024.05. The time may be extended if permission is requested in
writing and approved by the Director of Public Works.
(Ord. 5288. Passed 6-10-20.)
1024.13   EXCAVATIONS IN THE CITY OF JOHNSTOWN CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT.
   (a)   Because the City desires to minimize Central Business District (CBD)
disruption related to excavations, cuts or tunneling, additional requirements
are applicable to excavations, cuts and tunneling in its Central Business
District.
   (b)   The City of Johnstown Central Business District is defined in this
section as Wards 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the City.

other provisions of this chapter, the more stringent requirement shall apply.
   (d)   All excavations in the CBD shall occur between the hours of 7:00 a.m.
and 5:00 p.m., unless the Director of Public Works or his or her designee
determines otherwise.
   (e)   Prior to any opening, cutting, excavating or tunneling or activity
related thereto which causes impact to a sidewalk in the CBD, the permit holder
shall design and construct alternative walkways for pedestrian ingress to and
egress from buildings in the CBD.
   (f)   Prior to any opening, cutting, excavating or tunneling or activity
related thereto which causes impact to a highway or roadway in the CBD, the

the building owners two weeks in advance of the disruption to the roadway. The
public shall also be notified of the upcoming impediment to the roadway or
highway not less than two weeks in advance of the disruption using a digital
sign located in the area that will be disrupted.
   (g)   All repaving of streets and highways in the CBD shall be curb-to-
midpoint for the length of an excavation, unless funding requirements dictate
differing repaving requirements, in which case funding requirement repaving
shall supercede, curb-to-midpoint repaving.

   (b)   Authority of the Shade Tree Commission. The Shade Tree Commission
shall have the authority and jurisdiction of regulating the planting,
maintenance and removal of trees on streets and other publicly owned property
to ensure safety or preserve the aesthetics of such public sites. All actions
to plant new trees, prune (canopy and root) and/or remove existing trees shall
be taken following a public meeting. Advertisements for such meetings shall be
in accordance with the Sunshine Act of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The
by-laws of the Shade Tree Commission shall determine the frequency of said
meetings and the agenda for each.
      (1)   Condition of permit. The Shade Tree Commission shall have the
authority to affix reasonable conditions to the granting of a shade tree work
permit. Permits must be submitted to the Commission for the planting, pruning
(canopy and root), removal of trees, as well as laying down barriers or storage
underneath a tree, which may damage the trees' general health.
      (2)   Master shade tree plan. The Shade Tree Commission shall have the
authority to formulate a master shade tree plan. Public hearings will be held
as necessary. The master street tree plan shall specify the species of trees to
be planted on streets or other public sites of the Municipality, a citywide
tree planting strategy, and a correct standard for tree trimming and
maintenance. The Commission, in making its decisions, shall use the master
shade tree plan. From and after the effective date of the master shade tree

(Ord. 4820. Passed 2-28-01.)
1026.02 PERMIT REQUIRED; TIME LIMITS FOR COMPLETION.
   (a)   Permits Required.
      (1)   Planting, maintenance or removal. No person, firm or utility shall
plant, prune (canopy and root), remove, cut or otherwise disturb any tree on
any street or municipal-owned property without first filing an application with
the Public Works Department and procuring a permit from the Shade Tree
Commission.
         A.   A permit must be obtained and be on file in the Office of the
Public Works indicating approval of and permission by the Shade Tree
Commission, in writing, for the action to be taken. If a contractor is to do
the work sought, the contractor must be authorized by permit. The name, address
and telephone number of the contractor must be identified on the permit.
         B.   Applications for permits must be made at the Office of the Public
Works. The cost of the permit shall be established by ordinance of City Council
and amended from time to time.
         C.   The application for the permit requires the location; the number
of trees to be removed and/or replaced; species/variety of each tree; the name
of the individual or contractor removing, trimming or planting said tree(s);
the presence of electric, water, and sewer lines; distance from intersections;
proximity to neighboring trees; and other information the Shade Tree Commission
deems necessary to determine whether a permit should be issued. The Shade Tree
Commission shall issue the permit provided for herein, when, in their judgment,
the proposed work is desirable and the proposed method and workmanship thereof
are of a satisfactory nature.
         D.   Any permit granted shall contain a definite date of expiration
and the work shall be completed in the time allowed on the permit and in the
manner as therein described. Any permit shall be void if its terms are
violated.
      (2)   Removal, damage, replanting and replacement. No person or property
owner shall remove or damage a tree from public property for the purpose of
construction, or for any other reason, without first filing an application and
procuring a permit from the Shade Tree Commission. The person or property owner
shall bear the cost of removal and replacement of all trees. Stumps shall be
removed below ground level so that the top of the stump shall not project above
the surface of the ground.
      (3)   Emergency removal. When an emergency condition or situation exists
such as trees severely damaged by acts of nature (e.g., lightning, storm,
automobile accident) or similar situations, and when it has been determined
that the tree(s) poses an immediate and specific threat to public safety,
pedestrian or vehicular traffic or property, the Commission or City Manager may
authorize immediate removal of the tree without Commission review or permit.
      (4)   Severe site constraints. In cases where there exists a severe site
constraint so that compliance with this chapter would directly result in a
danger to the public health, welfare and/or safety, the Shade Tree Commission
may waive any or all necessary requirements. For purposes of this section,
“site constraint” is defined to mean the location, use, and/or existing
physical condition or features of the site, where compliance will interfere
with the following:
         A.   Overhead or underground utilities;
         B.   Utility poles, signs, fire hydrants, or parking meter standards;
         C.   Reduce visibility necessary for public safety; and/or
         D.   Crowd or confine tree growth.
   (b)   Violation and Penalty. The City Manager, or his designee, is
authorized to enforce this chapter and issue violation notices. Any person,
business or entity who shall violate any of the provisions of this chapter, or
who shall fail to comply with any of the requirements thereof, shall, upon
conviction thereof, be fined no less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) and no
more than three hundred dollars ($300.00). Said fine may include a separate
restitution in an amount equal to the replacement value of the tree or value of
damage committed. Each day on which a violation occurs or continues shall be
deemed a separate offense. The imposition of any fine for any violation of this
chapter shall not excuse such violations or permit the same to continue.
   (c)   Appeal Process. An applicant aggrieved by the Shade Tree Commission's
denial of their application to remove or trim a tree, may appeal to the City
Council.
      (1)   Written notice. Applicant must file written notice of such an
appeal with the City Manager within ten days of receiving notice of denial from
the Shade Tree Commission.
      (2)   Action by City Council. The City Council shall act on the appeal
within thirty days of the date of appeal to review and either affirm or reverse
the denial. In considering the case, the City Council shall include in its
review a “finding of fact” prepared by the Shade Tree Commission. Failure of
the Council to act within the thirty day period shall result in automatic
granting of the approval per the original application.
      (3)   Council findings. The City Council may affirm or reverse the
determination of the Shade Tree Commission and shall either adopt or modify the
findings of fact by the Shade Tree Commission, of which, may be reduced to
writing or may be entered into the minutes.

1026.03 PERMIT APPLICATIONS; REVOCATION; CONDITIONS FOR ISSUANCE; BOND.
   (a)   An application for any permit required under this chapter shall be
made in writing to the Bureau of Parks, Department of Public Works. Such permit
shall describe the work to be done, specify species or variety, size, nursery
grade and location, and briefly specify the method of planting, method of
support and trimming of all trees or shrubs concerned and contain a definite
expiration date. The Bureau shall have the authority to designate a suitable
type of tree and may refuse a permit to plant any type of tree which, in its
opinion, is not suitable to the location. The permit may be revoked at any time
upon proof, satisfactory to the Bureau, that any of the terms or conditions
upon which such permit was issued has been violated.
   (b)   The Bureau, at its discretion, may, as a condition precedent to the
issuance of a permit, require a contractor, authorized by the homeowner to
plant a tree, to guarantee such tree for one year against defects in materials
or workmanship. If death of the tree results within this time period for either
of such reasons, the contractor will incur the cost of removal, the cost for a
new tree and the cost of replanting for each tree planted. All trees shall be
removed so that the stump is not more than three inches higher than the ground.
   A contractor hired to trim or remove a tree must file a bond with the
Bureau, sufficient to cover injury to any person or property damage.

the results of the test.
   (h)   Issuance of Certificate of Compliance.
      (1)   If the application for certificate of compliance, properly
completed and filed with the Ordinance Compliance Officer with the designated
filing fee, indicates that there are no connections of surface storm water to
the sanitary sewer system, then the Ordinance Compliance Officer shall issue
the certificate of compliance within ten days of application therefore.
      (2)   If the lateral test reveals the existence of one or more surface
storm water connections to the sanitary sewer system, the Ordinance Compliance
Officer shall not issue the certificate of compliance until the connections
have been removed and a qualified contractor has certified that there is no
connection of surface storm water to the sanitary sewer system from the
property to be sold or transferred.
   (i)   Temporary Certificate of Compliance.

property to conduct the lateral testing should the applicant fail to do so.
         C.   The filing fee established by the governing body from time to
time by resolution.
      (3)   The Ordinance Compliance Officer may reject the application for
temporary certificate of compliance whenever, in his or her sole judgment, the

five dollars ($25.00) per request. Otherwise, the cash security shall be
forfeited.

However, only one leak adjustment will be granted per person per metered
account. Requests for leak adjustments should be submitted on the appropriate
form available in the City Manager's Office.
      (2)   No bill will be adjusted unless the cause of the leak has been
determined, repaired and consumption has returned to normal. The City Manager
or her designee will be responsible for administering all requests for water
leak adjustments. If an adjustment is granted, billing shall be revised as set
forth below.
         A.   Leak adjustments ("at single-family residential accounts") shall
be adjusted to forty-five dollars ($45.00) plus average bill calculated using
the past eight quarters, if available, or latest account history.
         B.   Leak adjustments ("at commercial, industrial, institutional or
multi family accounts") shall be adjusted to forty-five dollars ($45.00) plus
an amount equal to one-half of the amount due under the current rate schedule
for all water passing through the meter or delivered to the property.

City, to supply to it, on or before the fifteenth day of the month following
the month during which water bills are issued, a list of all water meter
readings and flat-rate water bills issued during the preceding calendar month
and the basis of such flat-rate customers' water charges so that such data may
be used by the City in calculating and computing its rentals, rates or charges
for furnishing sewerage and sewage treatment service to such water customers.
(Ord. 4170. Passed 1-9-80.)
1048.05 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR SERVICES.
   Sewage collection services shall be rendered upon the following terms and
conditions:
   (a)   Free Service Prohibited. There shall be no free service rendered by
the City's sewage collection system to firms or individuals, and all public
corporations, charitable or nonprofit institutions, school districts and other
political subdivisions shall pay for the use of the services and facilities
thereof in accordance with the established schedule of rates set forth in this
chapter.
   (b)   Care and Treatment of Industrial Waste. If the character of sewage or
industrial waste from a nonfamily unit is such that it imposes a burden upon
the City sewage collection system, in excess of the burden imposed by average
sewage, such additional charge shall be made therefor as the City deems to be
fair and equitable to meet the additional costs of collecting, analyzing,
sampling, transporting, treating and disposing of such sewage and waste. The
City may, if it deems it advisable, require the owner, tenant or occupant of
such commercial building or manufacturing or industrial plant, building or
premises to pretreat and/or equalize the flow of such sewage or waste in such a
manner as shall be specified by the City before discharging such sewage or
waste into the City sewage collection system.
   (c)   Excessive Infiltration Prohibited. The City may prohibit excessive
infiltration of surface ground waters into the City sewage collection system.
From time to time, the City may inspect the sewers of any user to ascertain the
extent of such infiltration. Where such infiltration is found, the City may
cause the user and/or owner to correct or repair the defects found therein. If
the user and/or owner fails or refuses to correct the defects causing excessive
infiltration, the City may correct the same and charge the user and/or owner
the costs for such corrections, which costs, if not paid, shall be a lien
against the user and/or owner as herein set forth. However, the City shall give
the user and/or owner a written notice of its intention to correct the
defective condition at least thirty days before the City incurs costs for the
correction of such defective condition.
   (d)   Storm, Roof, Surface or Water Discharges. The sanitary sewer discharge
from the sanitary sewerage system of the user and/or owner into the City sewage
collection system shall not contain stream, storm, roof, surface or other
water, the discharge from tile drains or any industrial waste chemicals or
other matter in violation of this chapter, unless otherwise permitted,
authorized or approved by the City and the Commonwealth or any duly constituted
board, commission or department thereof.
   (e)   Costs for Pretreatment of Sewage. If any sewage is discharged into the
City sewage collection system, from the sewage system of a user, the user shall
provide pretreatment prior to discharge into the City sewage collection system
or shall pay to the City the actual cost of any special treatment at the City's
sewage treatment plant as may be agreed upon by the user and the City. The user
shall pay the cost of any damage to the City sewage collection system resulting
from the discharge of such sewage which requires special treatment. Whether or
not sewage is improper and in need of special treatment, and whether or not
such discharge resulted in damage to the City sewage collection system, shall
be determined by a competent professional engineer acceptable to the City.
   (f)   Nonliability of City. The City shall not be liable for any damage or
expense occurring to or within any premises resulting from leaks or stoppage in
the City sewage collection system or from any other cause, unless the damages
resulting from leaks or stoppage are caused by the action of the City or its
negligence and/ or the negligence of its servants, workers and employees.
   (g)   Connection to City Sewage Collection System of a System of Sewers. Any
person who contemplates land development projects within the City and, by
reason thereof, contemplates any extension of the existing system of sewers
which are intended to connect with the City sewage collection system, either
directly or indirectly, shall do sin in accordance with this chapter and the
applicable laws of the Commonwealth. Before any such contemplated connection or
addition is made, two copies of the maps or drawings of such system or addition
to the system must be furnished to and approved by the City Plumbing Inspector.
All properties served by such a system connected with the City sewage
collection system shall become subject to this chapter, and the furnishing of
sewage service to such properties shall be at the rates and charges provided in
tariffs of the City.
   (h)   Special Devices and Treatment.
      (1)   Traps and separators. All persons discharging sanitary sewage
containing grease, oil or fats into the City sewage collection system shall
provide adequate grease and sand traps or oil separators which shall
effectively keep the grease content of sewage leaving the premises to less than
100 parts per million by weight.
      (2)   Prohibited wastes; special treatment. Sanitary sewage, discharged
into the City sewage collection system, shall not contain any industrial waste,

unusual attention or expense is required to handle such materials at the sewage
treatment plant; or
         I.   Containing an unusual, noxious or malodorous gas or substance
capable of creating an unnecessary public nuisance.
            Where wastes are of such character as to violate any of the
preceding regulations, the wastes must be pretreated to such a degree that they
will comply with the preceding provisions prior to discharge into the City
sewage collection system.
            The City shall have the right to direct any customer to cease and
prevent the discharge into the City sewage collection system of any wastes not
complying with these regulations.
   (i)   Approval of Pretreatment Devices. All grease traps, sand traps or

furnished by a water utility, or of such other meters as may be installed
pursuant to any provision of this chapter.
(Ord. 4567. Passed 2-27-91.)
   (b)   In the event any customer, discharging sewage or other liquids into
the City sewer system, either directly or indirectly obtains part or all of the
water used by him or her from sources other than a water utility, such user of
other waters shall, at its own expense, install and maintain water meters
satisfactory to the City for measuring all water usage other than that obtained
from the public water system, and the quantity of water used to determine the
volumetric usage charge under this chapter shall be the sum of the quantity
measured by all such meters plus the quantity of water obtained from the public
water systems. City personnel shall at all reasonable times have the authority
to enter the customer's premises to gain access to meters owned by the customer
for the purpose of reading the meters. Each meter, whenever installed by the
customer, shall have been tested for accuracy at the customer's expense, and
thereafter will be tested periodically, also at the customer's expense.
   (c)   Customers requesting consideration for a reduction in the sewage
volumetric charges because of water not entering the City sewer system shall
make written application to the City for such consideration, giving the name of
the person, the person's address and account number and supporting data fully

sewer layout, existing meters and proposed meters to determine the quantity of
flow entering or not entering the City sewer system. The cost of furnishing,
installing and maintaining any meters other than those utilized shall be borne
by the customer. The type, size, location, arrangement and maintenance of such
meters shall be subject to the approval of the City.
   (d)   In the event that it is established to the satisfaction of the City
that a portion of the water measured by the water meters servicing the
customer's property does not and cannot enter the City sewer system, then the
City may determine, in such manner and by such method as it may deem practical,
the portion of the metered water actually entering the City sewer system, or
the City may require or permit the installation of additional meters by the
customer in such a manner as to determine the quantity of sewage actually
entering the City sewer system. The sewage volumetric charges shall be based
upon the quantity of sewage estimated, measured or computed by the City to be
actually entering the City sewer system.
(Ord. 4543. Passed 9-26-90.)
1050.05 RATES; PAYMENTS; DELINQUENCY; CHANGES.
   (a)   There is hereby imposed upon each property served by the City sewer

hereinafter provided, for the use, whether direct or indirect, of the City
sewer system, based on the rates hereinafter set forth. All owners connected to
the City sewer system shall be billed according to the following schedule of
sewer rates and the billing practice of the City, by determining the total
number of billing units for which such owners are responsible, and the
following charges shall be imposed for each such billing unit:
 
Sewage Volume             Quarterly Rates
0 - 6,000 gallons         $21.74 minimum
6,001 - 40,000 gallons    3.62 per 1,000 gallons
40,001 - 100,000 gallons  2.04 per 1,000 gallons
100,001 - 200,000 gallons 1.23 per 1,000 gallons
200,001 - 300,000 gallons 0.87 per 1,000 gallons

(Ord. 4735. Passed 12-13-95; Ord. 4881. Passed 9-25-02.)
   (b)   There shall be imposed the foregoing minimum rentals and charges on
each billing unit, the same as if each billing unit were separate and apart
from the others. Sewage collection charges in excess of the minimum charge on
each such billing unit shall be determined by dividing the total water consumed
by the number of billing units involved and applying the above rate schedule to
the quantity so determined.
   (c)   Any municipality, if it wishes, may guarantee the payment of rates by
customers living within its municipal boundaries or pay the rates otherwise
owed to the City by such customers, but the ultimate responsibility for the
payment of such rates shall remain with the customers until the amounts are so
paid by the municipality.
   (d)   Any customer connected to a sewage collection system owned by a
municipality which is not served by the Johnstown Water Authority or other
water utility shall place a flow meter at the tap-in point to the sewer line
before making a tap-in. As a condition for tapping into the City sewer system,
the municipality shall advise the City of the existence of any such customers.
Such customers shall pay the same quarterly sewer rates as set forth in
division (a) of this section, the same as other customers.
   (e)   All customers or persons owning property connected directly or
indirectly to the City sewer system shall give the City their correct address.
Failure to receive bills shall not be considered an excuse for nonpayment, nor
shall it permit an extension of the period during which bills are payable at
face.
   (f)   All rentals for services under this chapter, together with all
penalties thereon, not paid on or before the end of 30 days from the date of
each bill, shall be deemed to be delinquent. To the extent permitted by law,
all delinquent rentals and all penalties thereon shall be a lien on the
property served and may be entered as a lien against such property in the
office of the Prothonotary of Cambria County, and shall be collected in the
manner provided by law for the filing and collection of such liens.
   (g)   Monthly bills for services under this chapter shall be subject to a 5%
per month penalty for commercial and industrial customers and a 1.5% per month
penalty for residential customers if not paid within 30 days after the date of
the bill. In the event of an unpaid account, after the tenth of the month
following the original billing due date, the water service shall be shut off.
Service for water or sewage will not be restored until all delinquent bills
against the same, and the costs of shutting off and restoring service have been
paid.
   (h)   The City shall estimate each customer's sewer usage, and upon the
basis thereof the customer shall be billed one-third of the customer's
estimated quarterly sewer bill for each of the first two months of each
quarter, and the bill for the third month of the quarter shall be such an
amount as is necessary to reflect the customer's actual usage for the quarter.
   (i)   The City of Johnstown shall file, with the Pennsylvania Public Utility
Commission, the regulations required by the Public Utility Commission Order of
June 14, 1989, at Docket No. I-880083, upon approval thereof by a professional
engineer for the system.
   (j)   The rates provided in division (a) of this section are designed to
allow the City to operate the City sewer system on a self-sustaining basis,
without the use of City tax revenues, with the revenues derived from the users
being utilized solely for the complete operation of the City sewer system. In
furtherance thereof, recognizing that any rate increase lawfully imposed on
non-City residents shall be simultaneously imposed on all City residents who
are users of the City sewer system:
      (1)   The Bureau of Sewage is hereby empowered to petition the
Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, from time to time, for such rate
increases in the future as may be needed to assure that all of the following
are timely paid by the users:
         A.   All annual operating expenses of the City sewer system, as
reflected in the annual budget adopted by the City;
         B.   All costs for debt service on large scale improvements or
renovations of the City sewer system incurred and mandated by State or Federal
laws or regulations and/or approved by City Council;
         C.   All costs of small scale (less than one million dollars
($1,000,000) annually) improvements or renovations of the City sewer system
incurred and mandated by State or Federal laws or regulations;
         D.   All incurred costs of small scale (less than one million dollars
($1,000,000) annually) improvements or renovations of the City sewer system as
needed and evidenced by certification from the professional engineer for the
system and approved by the Bureau of Sewage;
         E.   All costs for debt service on large scale improvements or
renovations of the City sewer system as needed and evidenced by certification
from the professional engineer for the system and as authorized by the
administration and by resolution of Council; and
         F.   Such funds as are necessary to create and maintain an Annual
Reserve Fund(s) for future expansion or improvements to the sewer system to the
extent permitted by statutes or rules or regulations of the Pennsylvania Public
Utility Commission.
            However, no rate increase shall be collected from residents of the
City of Johnstown prior to the time that the same rate increase is also
collected from residents of outlying municipalities upon approval of the rates,
tariffs, rules or regulations by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission.
      (2)   The Bureau of Sewage of the City of Johnstown may adopt such rules
and regulations as are necessary and reasonable for the proper and efficient
operation of the City sewer system as recommended or approved by the
professional engineer for the system, which rules and regulations are not
inconsistent with this chapter and which rules and regulations:
         A.   Are necessary to maintain compliance with any NPDES discharge
permit;
         B.   Are necessary to maintain the physical integrity or the designed
operational characteristics of the City sewer system; or
         C.   Are necessary for the health or safety of the users or for the
employees or agents of the Bureau of Sewage.
         However, no petition for a rate increase, nor any rule or regulation
under this subsection, shall become effective without thirty days prior notice
to Council of the City of Johnstown and the legislative body of any affected
municipality, and upon approval of the rate, tariff, rule or regulation by the
Public Utility Commission. Council for the City of Johnstown shall have the
right to deny the City the right to file any petitions for a rate increase or
the right to issue such rule or regulation within thirty days of receipt of
such prior notice.
(Ord. 4543. Passed 9-26-90; Ord. 4567. Passed 2-27-91.)
1050.06 FILING OF LIENS ON DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS.
   The rates properly charged under this chapter shall be a lien on the
properties served when properly filed in the office of the Prothonotary and may
be collected in the manner and to the extent provided by law for the filing and
collection of municipal claims, or by a civil action in assumpsit, at the
option of the City.
(Ord. 4543. Passed 9-26-90.)
1050.07 INFORMATION FROM WATER UTILITY.
   Every water utility is hereby authorized and required, at the request of the
City, to supply to it, on or before the fifteenth day of the month following
the month during which water bills are issued, a list of all water meter
readings and flat-rate water bills issued during the preceding calendar month
and the basis of such flat-rate customers' water charges so that such data may
be used by the City in calculating and computing its rentals, rates or charges
for furnishing sewerage and sewage treatment service to such water customers.
(Ord. 4543. Passed 9-26-90.)
1050.08 WATER SHUT-OFF.
   In the event of a delinquency as set forth in Section
1050.05, the Director of Public Works and every water utility are hereby
authorized to take such action authorized by the Act of April 14, 1949 (P.L.
482), as amended (53 P.S. Secs. 2261 et seq.).
(Ord. 4543. Passed 9-26-90.)
1050.09 EXCESSIVE INFILTRATION AND STORM SEWER CONNECTIONS PROHIBITED.
   (a)   Excessive Infiltration Prohibited. The City shall have the right to
prohibit, and does hereby prohibit, excessive infiltration into the City sewer
system of surface and ground waters. From time to time, the City may inspect
the sewers of any owner or municipality to ascertain the extent of such
infiltration. Where such infiltration is found, the City has the right to cause
the owner and/or municipality to correct or repair the defects found therein.
If the owner and/or municipality fails or refuses to correct the defects
causing excessive infiltration, the City, in addition to the other rights it
has at law, reserves the right to correct the defects and charge the owner and/
or municipality the costs and expenses for such corrections, which charges, if
not paid, shall be liened against the owner and/or municipality as herein set
forth. However, the City is required to give the owner and/or Municipality a
written notice of its intention to correct the defective condition at least
thirty days before the City incurs expenses and costs for the correction of
such defective condition.
   (b)   Storm, Roof, Surface or Water Discharges. The sanitary sewer discharge
from the sanitary sewer system of the user and/or owner and/or municipality
into the City sewer system shall not contain stream, storm, roof, surface or
other water, the discharge from tile drains, or any industrial waste chemicals
or other matter in violation of these provisions, unless otherwise permitted,
authorized or approved by the City and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or any
duly constituted board, commission or department thereof.
   (c)   Municipalities to Prevent Infiltration. If the sewer system of any
municipality transports sewage or water for both storm and sanitary purposes,
the municipality, as a condition for having its system connected or continued
to be connected to the City sewer system, shall undertake changes and
improvements to the municipality's sewer system in such manner as shall be
approved by the City's consulting engineer so as to divert, for purposes of
elimination, the storm and/or surface water and thus prevent such water from
entering the City sewer system. For the purpose of this subsection, the
municipality agrees to permit the City's consulting engineer and the City's
inspector to inspect the sewer system of the municipality at all reasonable
times to determine the amount of sanitary sewage discharging into the City
sewer system from the sanitary sewer system operated by the municipality.
   (d)   Metering of and Charges for Excessive Infiltration. To determine if
there is excessive infiltration or storm sewer discharge flowing into the City
sewer system, the City may install flow meters at the connection points where
any municipality's sewer system is connected to the City sewer system. From the
reading of the flow meters shall be deducted a volume of sewage equivalent to
the volume of sewage contributed by each customer located along the
municipality's sewer system so connected to the City sewer system. The
difference shall be deemed equivalent to the infiltration and/or storm sewer
flow from the municipality. If the municipality refuses or fails to repair or
correct the defects causing such excessive flow into the City sewer system, the
City may charge the municipality itself for the collection, transportation and
treatment of such excessive flow, as though the municipality itself were a
"customer" or "user" of the City sewer system, under the rates then in effect.
   (e)   Responsibility for Damages Caused by Infiltration. Any user or
municipality which willfully permits or causes the excessive infiltration of
surface waters and/or storm sewer flow into any sewer system, which directly or
indirectly flows into the City sewer system, shall be responsible for the
damages to the City sewer system resulting therefrom, and, in addition, shall
be responsible for any penalties that the City is required to pay for violating
environmental control laws, where such excessive infiltration or storm sewer
flow is the cause of the violation giving rise to the penalties imposed upon
the City.
(Ord. 4543. Passed 9-26-90.)
1050.10 COLLECTION SERVICE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
   Sewage collection service shall be rendered upon the following terms and
conditions:
   (a)   Free Service Prohibited. There shall be no free service rendered by
the City's sewer system to firms or individuals. All public corporations,
charitable or nonprofit institutions, school districts and other political
subdivisions shall pay for the use of the service and facilities of the City
sewer system in accordance with the established schedule of rates as
hereinafter set forth or hereafter enacted.
   (b)   Care and Treatment of Industrial Waste. In a case where the character
of sewage or industrial waste from non-family units is such that it imposes a
burden upon the City sewer system in excess of the burden imposed by the
average sewage, such additional charges shall be made therefor as the City
shall deem to be fair and equitable to meet the additional costs of collecting,
analyzing, sampling, transporting, treating and disposing of such sewage and
waste. In addition, the City may, if it deems it advisable, require the owner,
tenant or occupant of such commercial building, manufacturing or industrial
plant, building or premises to pretreat and/or equalize the flow of such sewage
or waste in such manner as shall be specified by the City before discharging
such sewage or waste into the City sewer system.
   (c)   Costs for Pretreatment of Sewage. If any sewage is discharged into the
City sewer system from the sewer system of a user, which sewage requires a
pretreatment under the terms and conditions of the rules and regulations of the
Environmental Protection Agency (40 C.F.R. 401.10, et seq.) and/or the City's
wastewater contribution permits, the user shall provide pretreatment prior to
discharge into the City sewer system or shall pay to the City the actual cost
of any special treatment at the City's sewage treatment plant as may be agreed
upon by the City. If the user discharges effluent which contains BOD in excess
of the rate of normal domestic sanitary sewage (300 mg/l), or total suspended
solids concentration in excess of 350 mg/l, the user/customer shall pay a
surcharge in addition to the charge for regular sewage service. The surcharge
shall be computed by using the following formula: Surcharge Factor % = [70+15
(BOD/300) + 15(TSS/350)]-100, where BOD=average BOD of the user's wastewater
for the period of computation (mg/l) and TSS = average total suspended solids
of the user's wastewater for the period of computation. The amount of the BOD
and TSS surcharge shall be computed by multiplying the charge for regular
service by the surcharge factor. The user/customer shall pay the costs of any
damage to the City's sewer system resulting from the discharge of such sewage
which requires special treatment. Whether or not sewage is improper and in need
of special treatment, and whether or not such discharge resulted in damage to
the City sewer system, shall be determined by a competent professional engineer
acceptable to the City.
   (d)   Liability of City. The City shall not be liable for any damage or
expense occurring to or within any premises and resulting from leaks or
stoppage in the City sewer system or from any other cause, unless the damages
resulting from leaks or stoppage are recoverable under the Political
Subdivision Tort Claims Act (Act of 1980, October 5, P.L. 693, #142, Section
221(1)).
   (e)   Special Devices and Treatment.
      (1)   Requirement of special devices. All persons discharging sanitary
sewage containing grease, oil or fats into the City sewer system shall provide
adequate grease and sand traps or oil separators which shall effectively keep
the grease content of sewage leaving the premises to less than 100 parts per
million by weight.
      (2)   Prohibited wastes; special treatment. Sewage discharged into the
City sewer system shall not contain any industrial waste, chemicals or other
matter:
         A.   Which violates the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also
known as the Clean Water Act, as amended, 33 U.S.C. Section 125, et seq., or
which in any way violates the City's pretreatment program adopted pursuant to
the regulations of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, 40
C.F.R., Part 403, or which otherwise violates
Chapter 1042 of these Codified Ordinances;
         B.   Which cannot be discharged without pretreatment pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency (40 C.F.R. 401.10,
et seq.);
         C.   Which has a temperature higher than 150 degrees Fahrenheit;
         D.   Which contains more than 100 parts per million by weight of fat,
oil or grease;
         E.   Which contains any gasoline, benzine, naphtha, fuel oil or other
inflammable or explosive liquids, solids or gases;
         F.   Which contains any inadequately ground garbage;
         G.   Which contains any ashes, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings,
metal, glass, rags, feathers, tar, plastics, wood, paunch manure or any solid
or viscous substance capable of causing obstruction or other interference with
the City sewer system or the sewage treatment plant into which the sewage is
discharged;
         H.   Which has a pH, as determined by the City Engineer, lower than
6.0 or higher than 9.0, or which has any other corrosive property capable of
causing damage or hazard to structures or equipment in the City sewer system or
structures, equipment, bacterial action or personnel of the sewage treatment
plant into which the sewage is discharged;
         I.   Which contains a toxic or poisonous substance in sufficient
quantity to injure or interfere with any sewage treatment process, to
constitute a hazard to humans or animals or to create any hazard in the
receiving water of the sewage treatment plant into which the sewage is
discharged. Toxic wastes shall include wastes containing cyanide or copper,
chromium, nickel, zinc or other metallic ions;
         J.   Which contains total solids of such character and quantity that
unusual attention to expenses is required to handle such materials at the
sewage treatment plant; or
         K.   Which contains unusual, noxious or malodorous gases or substances
capable of creating an unnecessary public nuisance.
            Where wastes are of such character as to violate any of the
preceding regulations, the wastes must be pretreated to such a degree that they
will comply with the preceding provisions prior to discharge into the City
sewer system.
            The City shall have the right to direct any customer to cease and
prevent the discharge into the City sewer system of any wastes not complying
with these regulations.
   (f)   Approval of Pretreatment Devices. All grease traps, sand traps or
other devices for pretreatment of sanitary sewage or industrial wastes shall be
subject to the approval of the City Engineer prior to installation.

1052.01 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   Approved. "Approved" means accepted as meeting an applicable
specification stated or cited in this chapter or as suitable for the proposed
use.
   (b)   Auxiliary Water Supply. "Auxiliary Water Supply" means any water
supply, on or available to a premises, other than the generally recognized
public potable water supply. These auxiliary waters may include water from
another purveyor's public potable water supply or any natural source such as a
well, spring, river, stream, harbor, etc., or "used waters" or "industrial
fluids." They may be polluted or contaminated or they may be objectionable and
constitute an unacceptable water source over which the Water Purveyor does not
have sanitary control.
   (c)   Backflow. "Backflow" means the flow of water or other liquids,
mixtures or substances into the distribution pipes of a potable water supply
from any source or sources other than its intended source. Back-siphonage is
one type of backflow.
   (d)   Backflow Preventer. "Backflow preventer" means a device or means to
prevent backflow.
      (1)   Air-gap primary prevention. "Air-gap primary prevention" means the
unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere from the lowest
opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water to a tank, plumbing fixture or
other device to the flood level rim of the receptacle. An approved air-gap
shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe, measured vertically
above the top rim of the vessel, and in no case less than one inch. When an
air-gap is used to prevent contamination of the public potable water system, an
approved reduced pressure device shall be installed in the bypass.
      (2)   Reduced pressure principal primary prevention. The term "approved
reduced pressure principal backflow prevention device" means a device approved
by a recognized and Authority-approved testing agency for backflow prevention
devices. It shall incorporate two or more check valves, an automatically
operating differential relief valve located between the two checks, and two
tightly closing shut-off valves, and shall be equipped with the necessary
appurtenances for testing. The device shall operate to maintain a condition in
which the pressure in the zone between the two check valves is less than the
pressure on the public water supply side of the device. At cessation of normal
flow, the pressure between check valves shall be less than the supply pressure.
In case of the leakage of either check valve, the differential relief valve
shall operate to maintain this reduced pressure by discharging to the
atmosphere. When the inlet pressure is two pounds per square inch or less, the
relief valve shall open to the atmosphere, thereby providing an air-gap in the
device. To be approved, these devices must be readily accessible for
maintenance and testing and installed in a location where no part of the valve
will be submerged.
      (3)   Double check valve assembly secondary prevention. "Double check
valve assembly secondary prevention" means an assembly of at least two
independently acting approved check valves, including tightly closing shut-off
valves on each side of the check valve assembly and suitable leak detector
drains plus connections available for testing the water tightness of each
valve. The entire assembly shall meet the specifications and approval of a
recognized and Authority-approved testing agency for backflow prevention
devices. To be approved, these devices must be readily accessible for
maintenance and testing.
   (e)   Contamination. "Contamination" means an impairment of the quality of
water by sewage or industrial fluids, waste or any other substance, to a degree
which creates an actual hazard to the public health, such as, but not limited
to, poisoning or the spread of disease. See also "Pollution."
   (f)   Cross Connection. "Cross Connection" means any physical connection or
arrangement of piping or fixtures between two otherwise separate piping
systems, one of which contains potable water and the other nonpotable water or
industrial fluids of questionable safety, through which, or because of which,
backflow may occur. A water service connection between a public potable water
distribution system and a customer's water distribution system, which
connection is cross-connected to a contaminated fixture, industrial fluid
system or with a potentially contaminated supply or auxiliary water system,
constitutes one type of cross connection. Other types of cross connections
include connectors such as swing connections, removable sections, four-way plug
valves, spools, dummy sections of pipe, swivel or changeover devices, sliding
multiport tube, etc.
   (g)   Cross Connection Control by Containment. "Cross connection control by
containment" means the installation of an approved backflow device immediately
after the meter on any customer's premises where an actual or potential cross
connection exists on a customer's water system.
   (h)   Cross Connection, Controlled. "Controlled cross connection" means a
connection between a potable water system and a nonpotable water system with an
approved built-in backflow preventer that will continuously afford protection
commensurate with the degree of hazard.
   (i)   Greater Johnstown Water Authority. "Greater Johnstown Water Authority"
means the utility in charge of supplying potable water to consumers within the
City, which utility is invested with the authority and responsibility for the
implementation of an effective cross connection control program and for the
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.
   (j)   Hazard, Degree of. "Degree of hazard" is the term derived from an
evaluation of the potential risk to public health and the adverse effect upon
the potable water system.
      (1)   Hazard, Health. "Health hazard" means any condition, device or
practice in the water supply system and its operation which could create, or in
the judgment of the Water Purveyor may create, a danger to the health and well-
being of the water consumer. An example of a health hazard is a structural
defect, including cross connections, in a water supply system.
      (2)   Hazard, Plumbing. "Plumbing hazard" means a plumbing-type cross
connection in a consumer's potable water system that has not been properly
protected by a vacuum breaker, air-gap separation or other device. Unprotected
plumbing-type cross connections are considered to be a health hazard.
      (3)   Hazard, Pollutional. "Pollutional hazard" means an actual or
potential threat to the physical properties of the water system or the
potability of the public or the consumer's potable water system, which threat
would constitute a nuisance or be aesthetically objectionable or which could
cause damage to the system or its appurtenances, but would not be dangerous to
health.
      (4)   Hazard, System. "System hazard" means an actual or potential threat
of severe damage to the physical properties of the public potable water system
or the consumer's potable water system, or of a pollution or contamination
which would have a protracted effect on the quality of the potable water in the
system.
   (k)   Industrial Fluids System. "Industrial fluids system" means any system
containing a fluid or solution which may be chemically, biologically or
otherwise contaminated or polluted in a form or concentration such as would
constitute a health, system, pollutional or plumbing hazard if introduced into
a public potable water supply. This may include, but not be limited to:
polluted or contaminated water; all types of process waters and "used water"
originating from the public potable water system which may have deteriorated in
sanitary quality; chemicals in fluid form; plating acids and alkalies;
circulated cooling waters that are connected to an open cooling tower and/or
cooling waters that are chemically or biologically treated or stabilized with
toxic substances; contaminated natural waters such as may come from wells,
springs, streams, rivers, bays, harbors, seas, irrigation canals, or systems,
etc.; oils, gases, glycerine, paraffines, caustic and acid solutions and other
liquid and gaseous fluids used in industrial or other processes or for fire-
fighting purposes.
   (l)   Pollution. "Pollution" means the presence of any foreign substance
(organic, inorganic, radiological or biological) in water which tends to
degrade the quality of the water so as to constitute a hazard or impair the
usefulness or quality of the water to a degree which does not create an actual
hazard to the public health, but does adversely and unreasonably affect such
waters for domestic use. See also "Contamination."
   (m)   Public Water System. "Public water system" means a system for the
provision to the public of piped water for human consumption, if such system
has at least fifteen service connections or regularly services at least twenty-
five individuals.
   (n)   Water, potable. "Potable water" means any water which, according to
recognized standards, is safe for human consumption.
   (o)   Water, nonpotable. "Nonpotable water" means water which is not safe
for human consumption or which is of questionable potability.
   (p)   Water Service Connection. "Water service connection" means the
terminal end of a service connection from the potable water system, i.e. where
the Water Purveyor loses jurisdiction and sanitary control over the water at
its point of delivery to the consumer's water system. There should be no
unprotected takeoffs from the service line ahead of any meter or backflow
prevention device located at the point of delivery to the consumer's water
system. "Service connection" shall also include a water service connection from
a fire hydrant and all other temporary or emergency water service connections
from the public potable water system.
   (q)   Water System.
      (1)   The "water system" shall be considered a made up of two parts: the
utility system and the customer system.
      (2)   The "utility system" shall consist of the source facilities and the
distribution system and shall include all those facilities of the water system
under the complete control of the utility up to the point where the customer's
system begins.
      (3)   The "source" shall include all components of the facilities
utilized in the production, treatment, storage and delivery of water to the
distribution system.
      (4)   The "distribution system" shall include the network of conduits
used for the delivery of water from the source to the customer's system.
      (5)   The "customer's system" shall include those parts of the
facilities, beyond the termination of the utility distribution system, which
are utilized in conveying utility-delivered domestic water to points of use.
   (r)   Water, Used. "Used water" means any water supplied by a Water Purveyor
from a public potable water system to a consumer's water system after it has
passed through the point of delivery and is no longer under the sanitary
control of the Water Purveyor.
(Ord. 4533. Passed 6-13-90.)
1052.02 BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICE REGULATIONS.
   (a)   No water service connection to any premises shall be approved by the
Water Purveyor unless the water supply is protected as required by State law
and regulations and by this chapter. Service of water to any premises shall be
discontinued by the Water Purveyor if a backflow prevention device required by
this chapter is not installed, tested and maintained, or if it is found that a
backflow prevention device has been removed or bypassed, or if an unprotected
cross connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until
such conditions or defects are corrected.
   (b)   The customer's system should be open for inspection at all reasonable
times to authorized representatives of the Water Purveyor to determine whether
these regulations, exist. The municipality shall be notified prior to any such
inspections and as soon as any problems occur. When such a condition of hazard
becomes known, the Water Purveyor shall deny or immediately discontinue service
to the premises by providing for a physical break in the service line until the
customer has corrected the condition in conformance with State, County and City
law relating to plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted
pursuant thereto.
   (c)   An approved backflow prevention device shall be installed on each
service line to a customer's water system, at or near the property line or
immediately after the meter inside the building being served, but in all cases
before the first branch line leading off the service line, wherever the
following conditions exist:
      (1)   In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply which is
not or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and which is not
acceptable as an additional source by the Water Purveyor, the public water
system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing a
backflow prevention device in the service line.
      (2)   In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other
objectionable substances are handled in such a fashion as to create an actual
or potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall be
protected against backflow from the premises by the installation of a backflow
prevention device in the service line. This shall include the handling of
process waters and waters originating from the utility system which have been
subject to deterioration in quality.
      (3)   In the case of premises having internal cross connections that
cannot be permanently corrected and controlled, or intricate plumbing and
piping arrangements, or where entry to all portions of the premises is not
readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or
impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross connections exist, the
public water system shall have primary maximum protection against backflow from
the premises by the installation of a backflow prevention device in the service
line.
   (d)   The type of protection device required under subsection (c) hereof
shall depend on the degree of hazard which exists, as follows:
      (1)   In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water
supply as stated in paragraph (c)(1) hereof, and where such auxiliary water
supply is not subject to any of the following rules, the public water system
shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced
pressure principle backflow prevention device.
      (2)   In the case of any premises where there is water or substance that
would be objectionable, but not hazardous to health, if introduced into the
public water system, the public system shall be protected by an approved double
check valve assembly.
      (3)   In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous
to health which is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or
potential hazard to the public water system, this system shall be protected by
an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle
backflow prevention device. Examples of premises where these conditions will
exist include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical
manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries and plating works.
      (4)   In the case of any premises where there are "uncontrolled" cross
connections, either actual or potential, the public water system must be
protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure
principle backflow prevention device at the service connection.
      (5)   In the case of any premises where, because of security requirements
or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make
a complete in-plant cross connection survey, the public water system shall be
protected against backflow from the premises by the installation of a backflow
prevention device in the service line. In this case, maximum protection will be
required; that is, an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced
pressure principle backflow prevention device shall be installed in each
service to the premises.
   (e)   Any backflow prevention required herein shall be of a model approved
by the Water Purveyor. The term "approved backflow preventer" shall mean a
device that has been manufactured in full conformance with standards
established by the American Water Works Association, entitled: AWWA C506-69
Standards for Reduced Pressure Principle and Double Check Valve Backflow
Prevention Devices.
   Said AWWA standards have been adopted by the Official Authority Head. Final
approval, however, of the "Reduced Pressure Principle Backflow Preventer" and
the "Double Check Valve Assembly" issued by an approved testing laboratory
certifying full compliance with the said AWWA standards prior to final
approval.
   (f)   It shall be the duty of the customer-user, at any premises, where
backflow prevention devices are installed, to have thorough inspections and
operational tests made at least once a year, or more often in those instances
where inspections indicate a need. These inspections and tests shall be at the
expense of the water user and shall be performed by a licensed plumber
specifically trained, to the satisfaction of the Water Purveyor, in the
inspection and repair of backflow prevention devices. The customer-user shall
notify the Water Purveyor in advance when the test is to be undertaken so that
he or she or his or her representative may witness the test if it is so
desired. These devices shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced at the expense
of the customer-user whenever they are found to be defective. Records of such
tests, repairs and overhauls shall be kept and made available to the Water
Purveyor and the municipality. Copies of all test results shall be submitted to
the Water Purveyor and the municipality.
   (g)   All presently installed backflow prevention devices which do not meet
the requirements of this section, but were approved devices for the purposes
described herein at the time of installation and which have been properly
maintained, shall, except for the inspection and maintenance requirements under
subsection (f) hereof, be excluded from the requirements of these rules so long
as the Water Purveyor is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the
utility system. Whenever the existing device is moved from its present location
or requires more than minimum maintenance, or when the Water Purveyor finds
that the maintenance of the device constitutes a hazard to health, the unit
shall be replaced by a backflow prevention device meeting the requirements of
this section.
   (h)   No consumer shall alter, bypass or render inoperative any backflow
device approved and installed under these regulations.
(Ord. 4533. Passed 6-13-90.)
1052.03 FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR IMPROVEMENTS.
   It shall be the responsibility of the consumer to install and maintain
devices mandated pursuant to Section
1052.02 at his or her own cost and expense.
(Ord. 4533. Passed 6-13-90.)
1052.04 NOTICE OF VIOLATION; DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE.
   The Water Purveyor shall notify, in writing, the owner, or authorized agent
of the owner, of the premises in which there is found to be a violation of the
provisions of this chapter. Failure of the owner to remove or correct the
violation within the time provided will constitute cause for the Water Purveyor
to discontinue water service to said premises.
(Ord. 4533. Passed 6-13-90.)
1052.99 PENALTY.
   Any person, firm, association or corporation who or which violates any
provision of this chapter shall, upon the judgment of any Justice of the Peace
determining such violation, be subject to a fine not exceeding three hundred
dollars ($300.00) and costs for each offense, plus any additional expenses
encountered by the Water Purveyor to restore the water quality in such a way
that it is safe for human consumption. In default of payment of the fine and
costs, etc., the violator shall be subject to imprisonment for a period not
exceeding thirty days. A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each
calendar day during or on which a violation occurs or continues.

street, watercourse or public ground contained in the Official Map or part
thereof.
(Ord. 3914. Passed 11-30-71.)
1226.02 RECOMMENDATIONS OF PLANNING COMMISSION AND PUBLIC HEARING PRIOR TO
ADOPTION.
   Prior to the adoption of any survey of existing or proposed public streets,
watercourses and public grounds as the Official Map or part thereof, or any
amendment to the Official Map, Council shall refer such survey and amendment to
the Planning Commission for review. The Commission shall report its
recommendations on such proposed Official Map, part thereof or amendment
thereto within forty days, unless an extension of time is agreed to by Council.
Before voting on the enactment of the proposed Official Map, part thereof or
amendment thereto, Council shall hold a public hearing thereon after giving
public notice of such hearing.
(Ord. 4398. Passed 9-10-86.)
1226.03 EFFECT OF APPROVED PLATS ON OFFICIAL MAP.
   After the adoption of the Official Map or part thereof, all streets,
watercourses and public grounds on final, recorded plats which have been
approved as provided by this Planning Code shall be deemed amendments to the
Official Map. Notwithstanding any of the other terms of this Planning Code, no
public hearing need be held or notice given if the amendment to the Official
Map is the result of the addition of a plat which has been approved as provided
by this Planning Code.
(Ord. 3914. Passed 11-30-71.)
1226.04 EFFECT OF ADOPTION OF MAPPED STREETS, WATERCOURSES AND PUBLIC GROUNDS
ON OFFICIAL MAP.
   The adoption of any street or street line as part of the Official Map shall
not, in and of itself, constitute or be deemed to constitute the opening or
establishment of any street, nor the taking or acceptance of any land for
street purposes, nor shall it obligate the City to improve or maintain any such
street. The adoption of proposed watercourses or public grounds as part of the
Official Map shall not, in and of itself, constitute or be deemed to constitute
a taking or acceptance of any land by the City.
(Ord. 3914. Passed 11-30-71.)
1226.05 BUILDINGS IN MAPPED STREETS, WATERCOURSES AND PUBLIC GROUNDS.
   For the purpose of preserving the integrity of the Official Map of the City,
no permit shall be issued for any building within the lines of any street,
watercourse or public ground shown or laid out on the Official Map. No person
shall recover any damages for the taking for public use of any building or
improvement constructed within the lines of any street, watercourse or public
ground after the same has been included in the Official Map, and any such
building or improvement shall be removed at the expense of the owner. However,
when the property of which the reserved location forms a part cannot yield a
reasonable return to the owner unless a permit is granted, the owner may apply
to Council for a permit to so build. Before granting any permit authorized in
this section, Council shall give public notice and hold a public hearing at
which all parties in interest shall have an opportunity to be heard. A refusal
by Council to grant the permit applied for may be appealed by the applicant to
a court in the same manner and within the same time limitation as are provided
for zoning appeals in the Zoning Code.
(Ord. 3914. Passed 11-30-71.)
1226.06 TIME LIMITATIONS ON RESERVATIONS FOR FUTURE TAKING OR ACQUISITION.
   Council may fix the time for which streets, watercourses and public grounds
on the Official Map shall be deemed reserved for future taking or acquisition
for public use. However, the reservation for public grounds shall lapse and
become void one year after an owner of such property has submitted a written
notice to Council announcing his or her intention to build, subdivide or
otherwise develop the land covered by the reservation, or has made a formal
application for an official permit to build a structure for private use, unless
Council has acquired the property or begun condemnation proceedings to acquire
such property before the end of the year.
(Ord. 3914. Passed 11-30-71.)
1226.07 RELEASE OF DAMAGE CLAIMS OR COMPENSATION.
   Council may designate any of its agencies to negotiate with the owner of
land whereon reservations are made for the release of claims for damages or
compensation for such reservations or agreements, indemnifying Council from
such claims by others, which release or agreement, when properly executed by
Council and the owner and recorded, shall be binding upon the successor in
title.
(Ord. 3914. Passed 11-30-71.)

(Ord. 3703. Passed 10-27-66.)
1240.03 SEPARABILITY.
   If a court declares any portion of these Subdivision Regulations to be

(Ord. 3703. Passed 10-27-66.)
1240.04 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, as used in these Subdivision
Regulations:
   (a)   Block. "Block" means an area of property, usually containing lots, and
bounded on at least three sides (or the equivalent) by one or more streets or
other definite barriers.
   (b)   Building Line. "Building line" means the line across a lot
establishing the minimum open space to be provided between the street right-of-
way line and the foremost line of a building or structure.
   (c)   Commission, Planning. "Planning Commission" means the Planning
Commission of the City.
   (d)   Comprehensive Plan. "Comprehensive Plan" means the complete plan, or
any of its parts, prepared by the Planning Commission to guide the physical
development and redevelopment of the community, as evidenced by the minutes,
actions, resolutions, maps, plans, reports and other official acts and
documents of the Commission.
   (e)   Developer. "Developer" means a person, corporation, partnership,
association or other entity or any responsible person therein or agent therefor
who or which undertakes the activities covered by these Subdivision
Regulations. "Developer" is intended to include, but not necessarily be limited
to, the terms "subdivider," "owner" and "builder," even though the individuals
involved in successive stages of the project may vary.
   (f)   Easement. "Easement" means a grant of the right to use a portion of a
parcel of land (usually a strip) for specified purposes, to the public, a
corporation, a utility or a person.
   (g)   Lot. "Lot" means a portion of a subdivision or other parcel of land
intended as a unit for the purpose of conveyance, transfer, improvement,
development or sale. Specifically:
      (1)   "Double frontage lot" means a lot having frontage on two
nonintersecting streets.
      (2)   "Reverse frontage lot" means a double frontage lot having a
structure facing the opposite street from the majority of structures in the
block.
   (h)   Plan of Lots, Final. "Final plan of lots" means a complete and exact
subdivision plan prepared as required by these Subdivision Regulations and
other applicable statutes.
   (i)   Plan of Lots, Preliminary. "Preliminary plan of lots" means a
tentative subdivision plan prepared as required by these Subdivision
Regulations by a person qualified by training and experience as a land planner.
   (j)   Planning District. "Planning District" means a compact area of the
community, undivided by main highways or other major physical barriers, and
designated in the Comprehensive Plan for a specific use, such as a residential
neighborhood, commercial district or industrial district.
   (k)   Street. "Street" means a right of way intended primarily for vehicular
traffic which may or may not have a paved cartway, sidewalks, utilities and
other improvements. A street may be designated by other appropriate names, such
as highway, thoroughfare, boulevard, parkway, road, avenue, drive, lane or
place. The following functional classifications are herein used:
      (1)   Loop, radial, cross-connector and cross-connector link streets are
major streets for circulation outside of residential neighborhoods and other
planning districts.
      (2)   Local major streets are streets for major circulation within but
not through residential neighborhoods and other planning districts, and
providing access to cross-connector link streets.
         Within this classification there are two types: Class A designed for
circulation through residential neighborhoods or planning districts and for
carrying the heavier traffic volumes; and Class B designed to serve as
"bleeder" streets to relieve the volumes developed on the Class A streets and
to distribute the traffic to other classifications of streets.
      (3)   Minor streets are those streets which are used primarily for access
to the abutting properties and which serve to distribute traffic to local major
streets.
      (4)   Marginal access streets are streets located adjacent and parallel
to a controlled access highway for the purpose of providing access to the
properties between interchange points on the highway.
   (l)   Subdivision. "Subdivision" means the division or redivision of a lot,
tract or parcel of land by any means into two or more lots, tracts, parcels or
other divisions of land, including changes in existing lot lines, for the
purpose, whether immediate or future, of lease, transfer of ownership or
building or lot development, provided, however, that the division of land for
agricultural purposes into parcels of more than ten acres, not involving any
new street or easement of access, shall be exempted.
   (m)   Subdivision Regulations. "Subdivision Regulations" means Ordinance
3703, passed October 27, 1966, as amended, codified herein as Title Four of
Part Twelve - the Planning and Zoning Code.

1242.01 CONSIDERATION BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   It is the intention of these Subdivision Regulations that all matters herein
which require action or decision by Council shall first be referred to the
Planning Commission for its detailed recommendations as to the course to be
followed and furtherance of the community interest and the Comprehensive Plan.
(Ord. 3703. Passed 10-27-66.)
1242.02 APPLICATION AND INTERPRETATION; COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   (a)   These Subdivision Regulations shall apply only to the subdivision of
tracts or parcels of land for the purpose of building or housing development,
and also to minor subdivisions as hereinafter defined. These Subdivision
Regulations are not intended to have, nor shall they have, any application to
casual sales or gifts of real estate.
   (b)   No person shall sell, agree to sell, transfer or otherwise convey by
deed, agreement, lease or other instrument any lot or parcel of ground situated
within the City limits, or for a distance of three miles outside thereof, which
lot or parcel is part of a tract being subdivided, nor shall a lot or parcel of
ground be subdivided in any other form or be excavated or have structures
erected thereon pursuant to a subdivision plan, nor shall any permit to erect,
alter or repair any building be issued, unless and until that subdivision has
been approved by the Planning Commission in accordance with the requirements of
these Subdivision Regulations.
(Ord. 3703. Passed 10-27-66; Ord. 5052. Passed 12-30-09.)
1242.03 VARIANCES.
   No variance from or exception to these Subdivision Regulations shall be
granted in whole or in part, except in the following instances:
   (a)   Hardship. Upon application and allegations in writing that
extraordinary hardship may result from strict compliance with these Subdivision
Regulations, a case may be referred to the Planning Commission for the purpose
of hearing the cause and determining substitute regulations to accommodate the
specific hardship. If, by adopting the substitute regulations, substantial
justice may be done and the public interest may be served, the Planning
Commission may adopt the substitute regulations in lieu of the regulations
causing hardship, provided that such variation will not have the effect of
nullifying the intent and purpose of the Comprehensive Plan or the spirit of
these Subdivision Regulations.
   (b)   Large Scale Development. The standards and requirements of these
Subdivision Regulations may be modified in the case of a plan and program for a
new town, a complete community or a neighborhood unit, which, in the judgment
of the Planning Commission and Council, provides adequate public spaces and
improvements for the circulation, recreation, light, air and service needs of
the tract when fully developed and populated, and which also provides the
covenants or other legal provisions as will ensure conformity to and
achievement of the Comprehensive Plan.
   (c)   Minor Subdivision. Upon application to the Planning Commission and
submission of a professionally prepared drawing, the standards and requirements
of these Subdivision Regulations shall not apply to the division of a lot
containing one or more permanent structures into one or more separate lots.
(Ord. 3703. Passed 10-27-66; Ord. 5052. Passed 12-30-09.)
1242.04 FILING FEES.
   A filing fee shall accompany the filing of the preliminary plan of lots. No
subdivision, variance, or conditional use application shall be accepted or
acted upon unless the fee is paid. The fee shall be established by ordinance of
City Council and amended from time to time.
   If, after application, the number of lots is changed, appropriate additional
fees or refunds shall be made.
(Ord. 3703. Passed 10-27-66; Ord. 5068. Passed 5-26-10; Ord. 5146. Passed 4-24-
14; Ord. 5353. Passed 5-31-23.)
1242.99 PENALTY.
   Any person, partnership or corporation who or which, being the owner or
agent of any lot, tract or parcel of land, lays out, constructs, opens or
dedicates any street, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, water main or other
improvement for public use, travel or other purposes or for the common use of
occupants of buildings abutting thereon, or who or which sells, transfers or
agrees or enters into an agreement to sell any land in a subdivision or land
development, whether by reference to or by other use of a plat of such
subdivision or land development, or who or which erects any building thereon,
without a final plat having been prepared in full compliance with the
provisions of these Subdivision Regulations and the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code (Act 247 of 1968, as amended) and without such final plat having
been recorded as provided therein, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon
conviction thereof, such person, or the members of such partnership, or the
officers of such corporation, or the agent of any of them, responsible for such
violation, shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) per lot
or parcel or per dwelling within each lot or parcel. All fines collected for
such violations shall be paid over to the City. The description by metes and
bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document used in the process of
selling or transferring shall not exempt the seller or transferor from such
penalties or from the remedies herein provided.

1244.01 PLAN APPROVAL GENERALLY.
   Except as otherwise provided in these Subdivision Regulations, no plan of
any subdivision shall be approved by the Planning Commission or Council, except
in accordance with the procedure designated in this chapter and other parts of
these Subdivision Regulations. Any approval of any subdivision plan not
processed as hereinafter provided shall be null and void, unless such approval
was made previous to the adoption of these Subdivision Regulations.
(Ord. 3703. Passed 10-27-66.)
1244.02 PRE-APPLICATION PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Prior to filing an application for conditional approval of the
preliminary plan of lots, the developer shall submit to the Planning Commission
plans and data as specified in Section
1244.05(a). This step does not require formal application, payment of fees or
filing of a preliminary plan of lots with the Commission. In the case of small
land subdivisions, the Commission may waive the pre-application procedure.
   (b)   Within thirty days, the Commission shall inform the developer that
plans and data as submitted or as modified do or do not meet the objectives of
these Subdivision Regulations. When the Commission finds that the plans and
data do not meet such objectives, it shall express its reason therefor.
(Ord. 3703. Passed 10-27-66.)
1244.03 PROCEDURE FOR CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF PRELIMINARY PLAN OF LOTS.
   (a)   On reaching conclusions informally as recommended in Section
1244.02, regarding his or her general program and objectives, the developer
shall cause to be prepared a preliminary plan of lots, together with
improvement plans and other supplementary material as specified herein.
   (b)   Three copies of the preliminary plan of lots and supplementary
material specified shall be submitted to the Planning Commission with a written
application for conditional approval at least fifteen days prior to the
respective meeting at which it is to be considered.
   (c)   Following a review of the preliminary plan of lots and other materials
submitted for conformity to these Subdivision Regulations, and negotiations
with the developer on changes deemed advisable in the kind and extent of
improvements to be made by him or her, the Planning Commission shall, within
thirty days, act thereon as submitted or modified, and, if approved, the
Commission shall express its approval as a conditional approval and shall state
the conditions of such approval, if any, or if disapproved, shall express its
disapproval and its reasons therefor.
   (d)   The action of the Commission shall be noted on three copies of the
preliminary plan of lots, referenced and attached to any conditions determined.
One copy shall be returned to the developer, either personally or by mailing
the same to him or her, at his or her last known address, not later than
fifteen days following the decision. One copy shall be transmitted to Council,
and the third copy shall be retained by the Commission. Under no circumstances
shall the developer start work of any nature other than surveying and staking
prior to receiving the conditional approval of the Commission upon the
preliminary plan of lots.
   When the application is not approved in terms as filed, the decision shall
specify the defects found in the application and describe the requirements
which have not been met and shall, in each case, cite the provisions of the
statute or ordinance relied upon.
   Failure of the Planning Commission to render a decision and communicate it
to the applicant within the time and in the manner required herein shall be
deemed an approval of the application in terms as presented unless the
applicant has agreed in writing to an extension of time or change in the
prescribed manner of presentation of communication of the decision, in which
case failure to meet the extended time or change in manner of presentation of
communication shall have a like effect.
   (e)   Conditional approval of a preliminary plan of lots shall not
constitute approval of the final plan of lots. Rather, it shall be deemed an
expression of approval of the layout submitted on the preliminary plan of lots
as a guide to the preparation of the final plan of lots which will be submitted
for approval of the Commission and Council and for recording upon fulfillment
of the requirements of these Subdivision Regulations and the conditions of the
conditional approval, if any.
(Ord. 4398. Passed 9-10-86.)
1244.04 PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF FINAL PLAN OF LOTS.
   (a)   The final plan of lots shall conform substantially to the preliminary
plan of lots as approved, and, if desired by the developer, it may constitute
only that portion of the approved preliminary plan of lots which he or she
proposes to record and develop at the time, provided that such portion conforms
to all the requirements of these Subdivision Regulations.
   (b)   When an application for approval of the final plan of lots is received
by the Planning Commission and such plan conforms to all the requirements of
these Subdivision Regulations, the date of receipt shall be stamped or written
thereon. The Commission shall take action on such application within thirty
days after the date of receipt.
   (c)   Three copies of the final plan of lots and other exhibits required for
approval shall be prepared as specified herein and shall be submitted to the
Commission with written application for approval within six months after
approval of the preliminary plan of lots, at least fifteen days prior to the
meeting at which it is to be considered.
   (d)   The date of approval of the final plan of lots by the Commission shall
be recorded thereon. Approval shall be void unless such plan is recorded in the
office of the County Recorder of Deeds within ninety days after the date of
approval.
(Ord. 3703. Passed 10-27-66.)
1244.05 CONTENTS OF PLANS.
   All plans presented to the Planning Commission and Council shall be
accompanied by or include the following data:
   (a)   Pre-Application Plans and Data.

1246.01 CONFORMITY REQUIRED.
   Herein set forth are the design standards to which plans of lots must
conform in order to be approved by the Planning Commission and Council.
(Ord. 3703. Passed 10-27-66.)
1246.02 STREETS.
   (a)   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all
streets shall conform to the Comprehensive Plan and shall be considered in
their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions and
to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the
proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets.
   (b)   Where such is not shown in the Comprehensive Plan, the arrangement of
streets in a subdivision shall either:
      (1)   Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing
streets and surrounding areas;
      (2)   Conform to a plan for the neighborhood or planning district
prepared by the Planning Commission, where topographical or other conditions
exist that make continuance of or conformance to existing streets impractical;
or
      (3)   Conform (in the case of multifamily housing projects, industrial
developments, commercial districts, unit group projects, etc.) to a plan
approved by the Commission.
   (c)   No local major street or minor street shall be laid out in such a way
as to permit or encourage its use by through traffic.
   (d)   Where a subdivision abuts or contains loop, radial, cross-connector or
cross-connector link streets, as shown on the Comprehensive Plan, the
Commission may require a non-access reservation or "buffer strip" containing
screen planting along the rear property line and along deep lots with rear
service ways, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate
protection of residential properties and will afford separation of through and
local traffic.
   (e)   Where a subdivision borders along or contains a controlled access
highway right of way as shown on the Comprehensive Plan, the Commission may
require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right of
way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land.
Portions of such width shall be greater where approach grades and future grade
separations require additional width.
   (f)   Reserve strips controlling the access to streets shall be prohibited
except where their control is definitely placed under the jurisdiction of the
municipality in which they are located, with conditions approved by the
Commission.
   (g)   Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be
avoided.
   (h)   A tangent at least fifty feet long shall be introduced between reverse
curves on local major streets and minor streets.
   (i)   When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point,
they shall be connected by radial curves adequate to ensure a sight distance of
not less than 100 feet for local major streets and minor streets and of such
greater radii as the Commission shall determine for special cases or as shown
on the Comprehensive Plan.
   (j)   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at less than sixty
degrees.
   (k)   Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with radii of
twenty feet for minor streets and forty feet for intersections of local major
streets or a minor street and a local major street, or of a greater radius as
may be deemed necessary.
   (l)   Street right-of-way widths shall be as shown in the Comprehensive Plan
and as specified below:
 
Street Type          Pavement Width (ft.) Right-of-Way Width (ft.) Sidewalk
Loop, radial, cross-
connector and cross- 24                   80                       No
connector link
Local major                                                       
   Class A        36                   60                       Yes
   Class B        20                   60                       No

Marginal access      20 or 22             40                       Yes
   (m)   Half streets shall be prohibited, except where essential to the
reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other
requirements of these Subdivision Regulations and where the Commission finds it
will be practical to require the dedication of the other half when the
adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever a half street is adjacent to a tract
to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such
tract. Where the subdivision abuts on an existing City street or Township or
State road, developers shall allow a right of way from the center of such road,
equal to one-half that required by the classification into which such road
falls, as outlined herein.
   (n)   Dead-end or cul-de-sac streets shall not normally be longer than 500
feet. All cul-de-sacs shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround
having an outside roadway diameter of at least eighty feet and a street
property line diameter of at least 100 feet. Where cul-de-sac streets exceed
500 feet, larger turnarounds and additional turnarounds may be required.
   (o)   No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with
names of existing streets. Street names shall be subject to approval by the
Commission. All street names shall be made available to the Local Postmaster
for his or her approval.
   (p)   Street grades shall not exceed the following, with due allowance for
vertical curves. (Note: The Commission, at its own discretion, may permit short
segments of streets to exceed the maximum gradients where necessary for proper
land utilization, but under no circumstances will grades in excess of fifteen
percent be permitted.)
 
Street Type           Percent Grade
Marginal access       12
Minor                 12
Local major - Class A 10
Local major - Class B 12
Other street types    As required by State or local officials
   (q)   No street grade shall be less than one percent.
(Ord. 3703. Passed 10-27-66.)
1246.03 EASEMENTS.
   (a)   Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lines shall be
provided where necessary as determined by the Planning Commission and shall be
at least fifteen feet wide.
   (b)   Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way,
channel or stream, there shall be provided a storm water easement for drainage
with a right of way conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse,
and such further width for construction as will be adequate for the purpose.
Parallel streets may be required in connection therewith.
   (c)   All easements shall be clearly identified as to purpose.
(Ord. 3703. Passed 10-27-66.)
1246.04 BLOCKS.
   (a)   The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due
regard to:
      (1)   Provision of adequate building sites, suitable to the special needs
of the type of use contemplated;
      (2)   Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions;
      (3)   Needs for convenient access, circulation control and safety of
street traffic; and
      (4)   Limitations and opportunities of topography.
   (b)   Block lengths shall not normally exceed 1,800 feet or be less than 400
feet.
   (c)   Pedestrian crosswalks not less than ten feet wide shall be required
where deemed essential to provide circulation or access to schools,
playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation and other community facilities.
(Ord. 3703. Passed 10-27-66.)
1246.05 LOTS.
   (a)   The lot size, width, depth, shape and orientation and the minimum
building set-back lines shall be appropriate for the location of the
subdivision and for the type of development and use contemplated, and shall be
in accordance with the Zoning Code.
   (b)   Lot dimensions shall conform to the requirements of the Zoning Code,
or if minimum lot sizes are not so required, the following requirements shall
apply:
      (1)   Residential lots where either or both water supply and sanitary
sewage disposal are provided by individual on-lot facilities shall conform to
the Minimum Requirements for Individual Water Supply and Sewage Disposal
Systems, a part of the F.H.A.'s Minimum Property Requirements for the State of
Pennsylvania.
      (2)   The depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for
commercial or industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-
street parking facilities and service areas required by the type of development
contemplated and as outlined in the Zoning Code and Comprehensive Plan.
   (c)   Corner lots for residential uses shall have extra width to permit
appropriate building setback from and orientation to both streets. Such
additional width shall be not less than fifteen feet or as required by the
Zoning Code.
   (d)   The subdividing of the land shall be such as to provide, by means of a
public street, each lot with satisfactory frontage and access to a public
street. On cul-de-sac and curved streets each lot shall have at least thirty
feet of frontage at the property right-of-way line.
   (e)   Double frontage and reverse frontage lots should be avoided, except
where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic
arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. A
planting screen easement of at least ten feet and across which there shall be
no right of access shall be provided along the line of a lot abutting such a
traffic artery or other use.
   (f)   Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to
street right-of-way lines.
(Ord. 3703. Passed 10-27-66.)
1246.06 COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS OR GUARANTEE THEREOF PREREQUISITE TO FINAL
PLAN APPROVAL.
   No plan shall be finally approved unless the streets shown on such plan have
been improved to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable condition, or
improved as may be otherwise required by these Subdivision Regulations, and
until any walkways, curbs, gutters, street lights, fire hydrants, shade trees,
water mains, sanitary sewers, storm drains and other improvements as may be
required by these Subdivision Regulations have been installed in accordance
with these Subdivision Regulations. In lieu of the completion of any
improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a plan, the
developer may deposit with the Municipality financial security in an amount
sufficient to cover the costs of any improvements or common amenities,
including, but not limited to, roads, storm water detention and/or retention
basins and other related drainage facilities, recreational facilities, open
space improvements or buffer or screen plantings which may be required. Without
limitation as to other types of financial security which the Municipality may
approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, Federal or
Commonwealth chartered lending institution irrevocable letters of credit and
restrictive or escrow accounts in such lending institutions shall be deemed
acceptable financial security for the purposes of this section. Such financial
security shall be posted with a bonding company or Federal or Commonwealth
chartered lending institution chosen by the party posting the financial
security, provided that such bonding company or lending institution is
authorized to conduct such business within the Commonwealth. Such bond or other
security shall provide for, and secure to the public, the completion of any
improvements which may be required within one year of the date fixed in the
subdivision plan for completion of such improvements. The amount of financial
security shall be equal to 110 percent of the cost of the required improvements
for which financial security is to be posted. The cost of the improvements
shall be established by submission to Council or the Planning Commission of a
bona fide bid or bids from the contractor or contractors chosen by the party
posting the financial security to complete the improvements or, in the absence
of such bona fide bids, the costs shall be established by an estimate prepared
by the City Engineer. If the party posting the financial security requires more
than one year from the date of posting of the financial security to complete
the required improvements, the amount of financial security may be increased by
an additional ten percent for each one-year period beyond the first anniversary
date from posting of financial security or to an amount not exceeding 110
percent of the cost of completing the required improvements as re-established
on or about the expiration of the preceding one-year period by using the above
bidding procedure. Where development is projected over a period of years,
Council or the Planning Commission may authorize submission of final plans by
section or stages of development subject to such requirements or guarantees as
to improvements in future sections or stages of development as it finds
essential for the protection of any finally approved section of the
development. As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request Council to release or
authorize the release, from time to time, of such portions of the financial
security necessary for payment to the contractor or contractors performing the
work. Any such requests shall be in writing addressed to Council, and Council
shall have forty-five days from receipt of such request within which to allow
the City Engineer to certify, in writing, to Council that such portion of the
work upon the improvements has been completed in accordance with the approved
plan. Upon such certification, Council shall authorize release by the bonding
company or lending institution of an amount as estimated by the City Engineer
fairly representing the value of the improvements completed or, if Council
fails to act within such forty-five day period, Council shall be deemed to have
approved the release of funds as requested. Council may, prior to final release
at the time of completion and certification by the City Engineer, require
retention of ten percent of the estimated cost of the aforesaid improvements.
Where Council accepts dedication of all or some of the required improvements
following completion, Council may require the posting of financial security to
secure structural integrity of such improvements as well as the functioning of
such improvements, in accordance with the design and specifications depicted on
the final plan, for a term not to exceed eighteen months from the date of
acceptance of dedication. Such financial security shall be of the same type as
otherwise required in this section with regard to installation of such
improvements, and the amount of the financial security shall not exceed fifteen
percent of the actual cost of installation of such improvements. If water mains
or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with apparatus or facilities related
thereto, are to be installed under the jurisdiction and pursuant to the rules
and regulations of a public utility or Municipal authority separate and
distinct from the Municipality, financial security to assure proper completion
and maintenance thereof shall be posted in accordance with the regulations of
the controlling public utility or Municipal authority and shall not be included
within the financial security as otherwise required by this section. If
financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion of improvements
required as a condition for the final approval of a plan as set forth in this
section, the Municipality shall not condition the issuance of building, grading
or other permits relating to the erection or placement of improvements,
including buildings, upon the lots or land as depicted upon the final plan upon
actual completion of the improvements depicted upon the approved final plan.
Moreover, if such financial security has been provided, occupancy permits for
any building or buildings to be erected shall not be withheld following the
improvement of the streets providing access to and from existing public roads
to such building or buildings to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable
condition, as well as the completion of all other improvements as depicted upon
the approved plan, either upon the lot or lots or beyond the lot or lots in
question if such improvements are necessary for the reasonable use of or
occupancy of the building or buildings.
(Ord. 4398. Passed 9-10-86.)
1246.07 RELEASE FROM IMPROVEMENT BOND.
   (a)   When the developer has completed all of the necessary and appropriate
improvements, the developer shall notify Council, in writing, by certified or
registered mail, of the completion of the aforesaid improvements and shall send
a copy thereof to the City Engineer. Council shall, within ten days after
receipt of such notice, direct and authorize the City Engineer to inspect all
of the aforesaid improvements. The City Engineer shall, thereupon, file a
report, in writing, with Council, and shall promptly mail a copy of the same to
the developer by certified or registered mail. The report shall be made and
mailed within thirty days after receipt by the City Engineer of the aforesaid
authorization from Council, and such report shall be detailed and shall
indicate approval or rejection of such improvements, either in whole or in
part, and if such improvements, or any portion thereof, are not approved or are
rejected by the City Engineer, such report shall contain a statement of reasons
for such nonapproval or rejection.
   (b)   Council shall notify the developer, in writing, by certified or
registered mail, of the action of Council with relation thereto.
   (c)   If Council or the City Engineer fails to comply with the time
limitation provisions contained herein, all improvements will be deemed to have
been approved and the developer shall be released from all liability, pursuant
to its performance guaranty bond or other security agreement.
   (d)   If any portion of the improvements is not approved or is rejected by
Council, the developer shall proceed to complete the same and, upon completion,
the same procedure of notification, as outlined herein, shall be followed.
   (e)   Nothing herein, however, shall be construed in limitation of the
developer's right to contest or question, by legal proceedings or otherwise,
any determination of Council or the City Engineer.
   (f)   Where reference is made herein to the City Engineer, he or she shall
be a duly registered professional engineer employed by the Municipality or
engaged as a consultant thereto.
(Ord. 4398. Passed 9-10-86.)
1246.08 REMEDIES TO EFFECT COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   If any improvements which may be required have not been installed as
provided in these Subdivision Regulations, or in accordance with the approved
final plan, Council may enforce any corporate bond or other security by
appropriate legal and equitable remedies. If proceeds of such bond or other
security are insufficient to pay the cost of installing or making repairs or
corrections to all the improvements covered by such security, Council may, at
its option, install part of such improvements in all or part of the subdivision
or land development and may institute appropriate legal or equitable action to
recover the moneys necessary to complete the remainder of the improvements. All
of the proceeds, whether resulting from the security or from any legal or
equitable action brought against the developer, or both, shall be used solely
for the installation of the improvements covered by such security and not for
any other Municipal purpose.

PROVISIONS GOVERNING ZONING DISTRICTS
1260.060   S CONSERVANCY DISTRICT.
   The S Conservancy District is intended to encourage the conservation of
steep hillside land within the City, where the economics of building and
supplying public services and facilities argue against the more usual type of
building development, and where only huge expenditures for grading the land
will permit a change of zone and make building development feasible; to
prohibit commercial, industrial, and residential uses of land, except under
special conditions relating to public service, to provide for public
recreational facilities; and to discourage any use when its character or
location within the District would create requirements and costs for public
service, such as police and fire protection, water supply and sewerage,
substantially in excess of such requirements and costs in areas of less steep
topography.
   (a)   Permitted Uses. In an S Conservancy District, land and structures may
be used, and structures may be erected, altered, enlarged and maintained, for
the following uses only:
      (1)   General gardening and growing of trees and nursery stock, not
including roadside displays or commercial signs;
      (2)   One-family dwellings, when located on a street improved to City
standards, provided that connection with a public sewer is feasible and the

conformity with the requirements of the local public health authorities are
installed;
      (3)   Recreation areas, when operated by a non-profit organization;
      (4)   Reforestation and public reservation, not involving sales or
advertising on the premises;
      (5)   The following conditional uses. It is not the intention that the S
District is contemplated for the following uses, but with a realization that
certain parts of such District may be developed to meet health and safety
requirements without interfering with other features of zoning the following
conditional uses, as prescribed in Sections
1260.160 through
1260.175, may be accepted under circumstances prescribed thereunder:
         A.   Cemeteries, including crematoriums;

yard opens into the alley or street, the alley or street may be considered as a
portion of the yard.

rear yard may be waived, provided that there is furnished an equivalent open
space in lieu thereof.
      (6)   An open porch may be erected in a front yard, provided that it is
not closer to an adjoining property line than the required width of the side
yard. A side yard abutting a street need not be more, but shall not be less, in

1260.072   FP FLOOD PLAIN DISTRICT.
   The Flood Plain District is designed as a sub-zone, or overlay zone, within
any given zoning district. The recognition of a Flood Plain District on the
Zoning Map serves to minimize loss of life and health and damage to public and
private property due to recurring or severe flooding. The Flood Plain District
also provides notices to prospective developers that flooding may be expected
in the area.
   The identified Flood Plain District shall be any area within the City,
subject to the 100- year flood, which is identified as Zone A (Area of Special
Flood Hazard) on the most recent Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) as issued by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), or on the most recent Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) issued by FEMA, if such a map has been prepared for
the City of Johnstown.
   (a)   Flood Elevation Determination. 
      (1)   For the purposes of this chapter, the 100-year flood elevation
shall be used as the basis for regulation. To determine the 100-year flood
elevation, the elevation at a given point on the boundary of the identified
flood plain area which is nearest the construction site in question will be
used. In helping to make this necessary elevation determination, other sources
of data, where available, shall be used such as:
         A.   Corps of Engineers-Flood Plain Information Reports;
         B.   U.S. Geological Survey-Flood Prone Quadrangles;
         C.   U.S.D.A., Soil Conservation Service - County Soil Surveys
(Alluvial Soils) or P.L. 566 Flood Information;
         D.   Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection-Flood Control
Investigations;
         E.   Known high-water marks from past floods;
         F.   Other sources.
      (2)   In lieu of the above, the City may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional
engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the
technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the City.
   (b)   Changes in Identification of Area. The identified flood plain area may
be revised or modified by the City where studies or information provided by a
qualified agency or person documents the need for such revision. However, prior
to any such change, approval must be obtained from the Federal Insurance
Administration (FIA).

PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT PROVISIONS
1260.080   PURPOSE.
   Planned residential development is a technique wherein residential
structures (semi- detached, detached, and multi-story) are arranged in closely
related groups. It may also include land uses of a cultural, recreational, and
commercial character to the extent that they are designed to serve the
residents. Instead of spreading houses uniformly over an entire tract, cluster
development occurs, creating higher densities in certain areas and preserving
natural features in others. Under such planning, lot size is reduced and the
land thus saved is used for common greens or open space.
(Ord. 5139. Passed 11-27-13.)
1260.081   GRANT OF POWER.
   (a)   The City shall administer planned residential development provisions

consistent with the provisions contained in Article VII, PA Municipalities
Planning Code, Act 247 as amended.
(Ord. 5139. Passed 11-27-13.)
1260.082   APPLICABILITY OF COMPREHENSIVE PLAN.
   Every application for approval of a planned residential development shall be
based on, and interpreted in relation to, the City’s Comprehensive Plan.
(Ord. 5139. Passed 11-27-13.)
1260.083   JURISDICTION OF COUNTY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   When the County has adopted a planned residential development ordinance in
accordance with the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, a certified copy
of the ordinance shall be sent to the City. All amendments thereof shall also
be sent to the City. The County shall not supersede any planned residential
development, zoning, or subdivision and land development ordinance which has

tentative approval as submitted, or which has been given tentative approval
with conditions which have been accepted by the landowner (and provided that
the landowner has not defaulted or violated any of the conditions of the
tentative approval), shall not be modified, revoked or otherwise impaired by
action of the Municipality pending an application for final approval without
the consent of the landowner, provided that an application for final approval
is filed or, in the case of development over a period of years, provided that

section thereof. Said application shall be made to the official of the
Municipality designated by this chapter and within the time or times specified
by the official written communication granting tentative approval. The
application shall include any drawings, specifications, covenants, easements,
performance bond, and such other requirements as may be specified by ordinance,
as well as any conditions set forth in the official written communication at
the time of tentative approval. A public hearing on an application for final
approval of the development plan, or part thereof, shall not be required
provided the development plan, or the part thereof, submitted for final
approval, is in compliance with the development plan theretofore given
tentative approval and with any specified conditions attached thereto.
   (b)   In the event the application for final approval has been filed,
together with all drawings, specifications, and other documents in support
thereof, and as required by this chapter and the official written communication
of tentative approval, the Municipality shall, within 45 days of such filing,
grant such development plan final approval.
   (c)   (1)   In the event the development plan as submitted contains
variations from the development plan given tentative approval, the approving
body may refuse to grant final approval and shall, within 45 days from the
filing of the application for final approval, so advise the landowner in
writing of said refusal, setting forth in said notice the reasons why one or
more of said variations are not in the public interest. In the event of such
refusal, the landowner may either:
         A.   Re-file his or her application for final approval without the
variations objected; or
         B.   File a written request with the approving body that it hold a
public hearing on his application for final approval.
      (2)   If the landowner wishes to take either such alternative action he
may do so at any time within which he shall be entitled to apply for final
approval, or within 30 additional days if the time for applying for final
approval shall have already passed at the time when the landowner was advised
that the development plan was not in substantial compliance. In the event the
landowner shall fail to take either of these alternate actions within said
time, he shall be deemed to have abandoned the development plan. Any such
public hearing shall be held pursuant to public notice within 30 days after
request for the hearing is made by the landowner, and the hearing shall be
conducted in the manner prescribed in this subchapter for public hearings on
applications for tentative approval. Within 30 days after the conclusion of the
hearing, Council shall by official written communication either grant final
approval to the development plan or deny final approval. The grant or denial of
final approval of the development plan shall, in cases arising under this
section, be in the form and contain the findings required for an application
for tentative approval set forth in this subchapter.
   (d)   A development plan, or any part thereof, which has been given final
approval shall be so certified without delay by Council and shall be filed of
record forthwith in the office of the Recorder of Deeds before any development
shall take place in accordance therewith. Upon the filing of record of the
development plan, the zoning and subdivision regulations otherwise applicable
to the land included in such plan shall cease to apply thereto. Pending
completion, in accordance with the time provision stated in Section 508 of the
PA Municipalities Planning Code, of said planned residential development or of
that part thereof, as the case may be, that has been finally approved, no
modification of the provisions of said development plan, or part thereof, as
finally approved, shall be made except with the consent of the landowner. Upon
approval of a final plat, the developer shall record the plat in accordance
with the provisions of Section 513(a) of the PA Municipalities Planning Code
and post financial security in accordance with Section 509 of the PA
Municipalities Planning Code.
   (e)   In the event that a development plan, or a section thereof, is given
final approval and thereafter the landowner shall abandon such plan or the
section thereof that has been finally approved, and shall so notify the
approving body in writing; or, in the event the landowner shall fail to
commence and carry out the planned residential development in accordance with
the tine provisions stated in Section 508 of the PA Municipalities Planning
Code after final approval has been granted, no development or further
development shall take place on the property included in the development plan
until after the said property is reclassified by enactment of an amendment to
this chapter in the manner prescribed for such amendments in Article VI of the
Municipality Planning Code, Act 247, as amended.

1260.117   STORMWATER MANAGEMENT.
   (a)   General Provisions.
      (1)   Short Title. This section shall be known and may be cited as the
“City of Johnstown Stormwater Management Ordinance,” as a means of further
implementing the Stonycreek Watershed Plan and Little Conemaugh Watershed Plan
as well as the Stormwater Discharges from Small Municipal Separate Storm Sewer
Systems (MS4s).
      (2)   Statement of Findings. The governing body of the Municipality finds
that:
         A.   Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater
resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying
capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public
facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines flood plain management
and flood control efforts in downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, threatens public health and safety, and increases non-point source
pollution of water resources.
         B.   A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff,
is fundamental to the public health, safety and welfare and the protection of
people of the Commonwealth, their resources and the environment.
         C.   Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams, which also
protects and maintains surface water quality.
         D.   Federal and State regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are required
to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer
systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).
      (3)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to promote health, safety,
and welfare within the Municipality and its watershed by minimizing the harms
and maximizing the benefits described in subsection (a)(2) above through
provisions designed to:
         A.   Meet legal water quality requirements under State law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim and restore
the existing and designated uses of the waters of this Commonwealth.
         B.   Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.
         C.   Manage stormwater runoff close to the source.
         D.   Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
         E.   Maintain groundwater recharge, to prevent degredation of surface
and groundwater and to otherwise protect water resources.
         F.   Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
         G.   Provide proper operation and maintenance of all permanent
Stormwater Management (SWM) Best Management Practices (BMPs) that are
implemented within the Municipality.
         H.   Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.
      (4)   Statutory Authority.
         A.   Primary Authority. The Municipality is empowered to regulate
these activities by the authority of the Act of October 4, 1978, PL. 864 (Act
167), 32 P.S. Section 680.1, et seq., as amended, the “Storm Water Management
Act” and the (appropriate municipal code).
         B.   Secondary Authority. The Municipality also is empowered to
regulate land use activities that affect runoff by the authority of the Act of
July 31, 1968, PL. 805, No. 247, The Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,
as amended.
      (5)   Applicability. All regulated activities and all activities that may
affect stormwater runoff, including land development and earth disturbance
activity, are subject to regulation by this section.
      (6)   Repealer. Any other ordinance provision(s) or regulation of the
Municipality inconsistent with any of the provisions of this section is hereby
repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
      (7)   Severability. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction
declares any section or provision of this section invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of any of the remaining provisions of this section.
      (8)   Compatibility with Other Requirements. Approvals issued and actions
taken under this section do not relieve the applicant of the responsibility to
secure required permits or approvals for activities regulated by any other
code, law, regulation or ordinance.
      (9)   Erroneous Permit. Any permit or authorization issued or approved
based on false, misleading or erroneous information provided by an applicant is
void without the necessity of any proceedings for revocation. Any work
undertaken or use established pursuant to such permit or other authorization is
unlawful. No action may be taken by a board, agency or employee of the
Municipality purporting to validate such a violation.
   (b)   Definitions.
      (1)   For the purposes of this section, certain terms and words used
herein shall be interpreted as follows:
         A.   Words used in the present tense include the future tense; the
singular number includes the plural, and the plural number includes the
singular; words of masculine gender include feminine gender; and words of

the specific example but is intended to extend its meaning to all other
instances of like kind and character.
         C.   The words “shall” and “must” are mandatory; the words “may” and
“should” are permissive.
      (2)   “Agricultural activity.” Activities associated with agriculture
such as agricultural cultivation, agricultural operation, and animal heavy use

activities that meet the exemption criteria found in subsection (c)(2)A. of
this section.
         F.   Impervious Areas:
            1.   The measurement of impervious areas shall include all of the
impervious areas in the total proposed development even if development is to
take place in stages.
            2.   For development taking place in stages, the entire development

submit and erosion and sedimentation control plan to the Conservation District.
         O.   Regulated activities that create earth disturbance activities
that affect over one acre must also submit an application for an NPDES permit
to the Conservation District.
      (2)   Exemptions.
         A.   Regulated activities that result in cumulative earth disturbances
less than 1,250 square feet maximum are exempt from the requirements in
subsections (c)(3) and (4) and (d) of this section.

pose a threat to public health and safety or the environment.
         F.   Exemption responsibilities. An exemption shall not relieve the
applicant from implementing such measures as are necessary to protect public
health, safety, and property.
         G.   Drainage problems. If a drainage problem is documented or known
to exist downstream of or is expected from the proposed activity, then the
Municipality may require the applicant to comply with this section even if the
proposed activity may be otherwise exempt.
         H.   Even though the proposed activity may be exempt from these
regulations the applicant is not relieved from complying with other applicable
regulations enacted and enforced by the Municipality.
      (3)   Volume Controls. The low impact development practices provided in
the SWM Manual1 shall be utilized for all regulated activities to the maximum
extent practicable. Water volume controls shall be implemented using the design
storm method in subsection (c)(3)A. or the simplified method in subsection (c)
(3)B. below. For regulated activities that create 10,000 square feet or less of
impervious cover that do not require hydrologic routing to design the
stormwater facilities, this chapter establishes no preference for either
methodology; therefore, the applicant may select either methodology on the
basis of economic considerations, the intrinsic limitations on applicability of
the analytical procedures associated with each methodology, and other factors.
         A.   The design storm method (CG-1 in the SWM Manual1) is applicable
to any size of regulated activity. This method requires detailed modeling based
on site conditions.
            1.   Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for
all storms equal or less than the two-year, 24-hour duration precipitation.
            2.   For modeling purposes:
               a.   Existing (pre-development) non-forested pervious areas must
be considered meadow in good condition.
               b.   Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present,
shall be considered meadow in good condition in the model for existing
conditions.
         B.   The simplified method (CG-2 in the SWM Manual1) provided below is
independent of site conditions and should be used if the design storm method is
not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated activities greater
than 10,000 square feet or for projects that require design of stormwater
storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
            1.   Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two
inches of runoff from al new impervious surfaces.
            2.   At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious
surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow (i.e., it shall not
be released into the surface waters of this Commonwealth). Removal options
include reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration.
            3.   Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed
to accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed runoff; however,
in all cases at least the first one-half inch of the permanently removed runoff
should be infiltrated.

as the case may be, provided that the cubic content existing when it became
nonconforming shall not be increased.
   (b)   If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs
and maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized official to be unsafe
or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be
restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the
district in which it is located.

   The Zoning Hearing Board shall function in strict accordance with and
pursuant to the Municipalities Planning Code Act 247 of 1968 as re-enacted and
amended; and shall have all powers set forth therein, including but not limited
to the following:
   (a)   Variances.
      (1)   The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged
that the provisions of this chapter inflict unnecessary hardship upon the
applicant. The Board may by rule prescribe the form of application and may
require preliminary application to the Building Code Official. The Board may
grant a variance, provided that all of the following findings are made where
relevant in a given case:
         A.   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or
exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions
and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of
this chapter in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
         B.   That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there
is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with
the provisions of this chapter and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
         C.   That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
         D.   That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, not
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
         E.   That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulation in issue.
      (2)   In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of
this chapter.
   (b)   Special Exceptions. Where the City Council has stated special
exceptions to be granted or denied by the Board pursuant to express standards
and criteria, the Board shall hear and decide requests for such special
exceptions in accordance with such standards and criteria. In granting a
special exception, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and
safeguards, in addition to those expressed in this chapter, as it may deem
necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter.

and cross-examine adverse witnesses on all relevant issues.
   (h)   Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but irrelevant, immaterial,
or unduly repetitious evidence may be excluded.
   (i)   The Board or the Hearing Officer, as the case may be, shall keep a
stenographic record of the proceedings. The appearance fee for a stenographer
shall be shared equally by the applicant and the Board. The cost of the
original transcript shall be paid by the Board if the transcript is ordered by
the Board or Hearing Officer or shall be paid by the person appealing from the
decision of the Board if such appeal is made, and in either event the cost of
additional copies shall be paid by the person requesting such copy or copies.
In other cases the party requesting the original transcript shall bear the cost
thereof.
   (j)   The Board or the Hearing Officer shall not communicate, directly or
indirectly, with any party or his or her representatives in connection with any
issue involved except upon notice and opportunity for all parties to
participate, shall not take notice of any communication, reports, staff
memoranda, or other materials, except advice from their solicitor, unless the
parties are afforded an opportunity to contest the material so noticed and
shall not inspect the site or its surroundings after the commencement of
hearings with any party or his or her representative unless all parties are
given an opportunity to be present.
   (k)   The Board or the Hearing Officer, as the case may be, shall render a
written decision or, when no decision is called for, make written findings on
the application within 45 days after the last hearing before the Board or
Hearing Officer. Where the application is contested or denied, each decision
shall be accompanied by findings of fact and conclusions based thereon together
with the reasons therefore. Conclusions based on any provisions of this
chapter, rule or regulation shall contain a reference to the provision relied
on and the reasons why the conclusion is deemed appropriate in the light of the
facts found. If the hearing is conducted by a Hearing Officer, and there has
been no stipulation that his or her decision or findings are final, the Board
shall make its report and recommendations available to the parties within 45
days and the parties shall be entitled to make written representations thereon
to the Board prior to final decision or entry of findings, and the Board’s
decision shall be entered no later than 30 days after the report of the hearing
officer. Where the Board fails to render the decision within the period
required by this subsection, or fails to hold the required hearing within 60
days from the date of the applicant’s request for a hearing, the decision shall
be deemed to have been rendered in favor of the applicant unless the applicant
has agreed in writing or on the record to an extension of time. When a decision
has been rendered in favor of the applicant because of failure of the Board to
meet or render a decision as hereinabove provided, the Board shall give public
notice of said decision within ten days from the last day it could have met to
render a decision in the same manner as provided in subsection (a) of this
section. If the Board shall fail to provide such notice, the applicant may do
so. Nothing in this subsection shall prejudice the right of any party opposing
the application to appeal the decision to a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (l)   A copy of the final decision or, where no decision is called for, of
the findings shall be delivered to the applicant personally or mailed to him
not later than the day following its date. To all other persons who have filed
their name and address with the Board not later than the last day of the
hearing, the Board shall provide by mail or otherwise, brief notice of the
decision or findings and a statement of the place at which the full decision or
findings may be examined.

promote the convenience and welfare of the public; conform with good zoning
practice and the intent and purpose of this chapter; and adhere to the guiding
principles of the Comprehensive Plan, the City may amend, supplement, or change
the regulations, district boundaries, or classification of property, now or
hereafter established by this chapter, subject to the procedure provided in
this section.

review. All information shall then be submitted to the Planning Commission for
their review and recommendations.
               b.   Preliminary Review by Planning Commission. After the facts
are presented and the data and information from the petition are reviewed and
studied by the Planning Commission, the Commission shall, within 15 days after
regularly scheduled meeting, submit the petition with its preliminary
recommendations to the City. The preliminary report by the Planning Commission
is not intended to establish final approval by the Commission but rather to

inspection, and briefly describe the change proposed.
      (3)   In addition, if the proposed amendment involves a Zoning Map
change, notice of said public hearing shall be conspicuously posted by the City
at points deemed sufficient by the City along the tract to notify potentially
interested citizens. The affected tract or area shall be posted at least one
week prior to the date of the hearing.

      (3)   Notice of the amendment must be published at least ten days prior
to enactment.
      (4)   Following the final public hearing, Council may vote to adopt the

substantial changes are made to the amendment after this publication, the City,
at least ten days prior to enactment, shall re-advertise a brief summary
setting forth all provisions and changes, according to the aforementioned
notice requirements in a newspaper of general circulation in the City.
   (g)   Final Action by the City.

the regulations, district boundaries, or classification of property, now or
hereafter established by this ordinance, shall require the affirmative vote of
a majority of the members of City Council.
      (2)   Any ordinance amending, supplementing or changing the regulations,
district boundaries or classification of property hereinafter established by
this ordinance, if not acted upon by the City within 90 days after the required
public hearing, shall require a new public hearing as prescribed in this
section.

(Ord. 5139. Passed 11-27-13.)
1260.231   LANDOWNER CURATIVE AMENDMENT.
   A landowner who desires to challenge the validity of this chapter, Zoning
Map, or any provision thereof, on substantial grounds, which prohibits or
restricts the use or development of land in which he or she has an interest,
may submit a curative amendment to the City with a written request that his or
her challenge and proposed amendment be heard and decided. The City shall
commence a public hearing within 60 days of receipt of the written request.
   (a)   Notification. The City Planning Commission and the Cambria County
Planning Commission shall be notified of the proposed amendment at least 30

Section
1260.222 , and all references therein to the Zoning Hearing Board shall, for
the purposes of this section, refer to City Council.
   (d)   Invalidation Limitation. If the City does not accept the landowner’s
curative amendment and a court subsequently rules that the challenge has merit,
the court’s decision shall not result in a declaration of invalidity for this
entire chapter or Zoning Map, but only for those provisions, which specifically
relate to the landowners curative amendment and challenge.
   (e)   Enactment Considerations. If it is determined that the challenge has
merit, City Council may accept the landowner’s curative amendment, with or
without revision, or may adopt an alternative amendment which cures the
challenged defects. In addition to the curative amendments, plans, and
information submitted by the landowner, City Council shall also consider the
following:
      (1)   The impact of the proposal on roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, and other public facilities;
      (2)   The impact of residential proposals on regional housing needs and
their effectiveness in providing housing units of the type available to and
affordable by classes of persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by the
challenged provisions of this chapter or Zoning Map;
      (3)   Site suitability in relation to physiographic features;
      (4)   The impact of the proposed use on physiographic and environmental
considerations; and
      (5)   The impact of the proposed use on agricultural preservation, public
health, and public welfare considerations.
(Ord. 5139. Passed 11-27-13.)
1260.232   MUNICIPAL CURATIVE AMENDMENTS.
   The City may determine that this chapter or sections thereof are
substantially invalid. This determination shall declare by formal action the
sections substantially invalid and propose a curative amendment to overcome
this invalidity.
   (a)   Within 30 days of this declaration and proposal the City shall:
      (1)   By resolution make specific findings setting forth the declared
invalidity which may include references to specific uses which are either not
permitted or not permitted in sufficient quantity; class of uses which require
revision; or references to this entire chapter; and
      (2)   Begin to prepare and consider a curative amendment to correct the
declared invalidity.
   (b)   Within 180 days of the declaration and proposal, the City shall enact
a curative amendment or validate, or reaffirm the validity of, this chapter
pursuant to the procedures outlined in Section
1260.230.
   (c)   After using this procedure, the City may not again utilize this method
for a 36-month period following the date of a curative amendment, or
reaffirmation of this chapter, unless a new duty or obligation is imposed on
the City by a change in statute or Pennsylvania Appellate Court decision after
the date of declaration and proposal. In this case, the City may use the
provision of this section to fulfill said duty or obligation.
   (d)   Any other procedures or provisions as required by the PA
Municipalities Planning Code, Act 247 as re-enacted and amended.
(Ord. 5139. Passed 11-27-13.)
1260.233   FEES.
   Any person other than City Council or the City Planning Commission

REPEALING CLAUSE
1260.240   REPEALING CLAUSE.

to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such unconstitutionality,
illegality or invalidity shall not affect or impair any of the remaining
provisions, sentences, clauses or sections of this chapter. It is hereby
declared as the intent of the Johnstown City Council that this chapter would
have been adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentences,
clauses, or sections thereof not have been included herein.

1448.01 LICENSE AND CERTIFICATE REQUIRED.
   No person, other than a registered master plumber, shall carry on or engage
in the business of plumbing or house drainage in the City, and no person shall
expose a sign of plumbing or house drainage, or any advertisement pertaining
thereto, unless he or she has first obtained a license and certificate of
competency therefor and has been registered by the Department of Community and
Economic Development. For all registered plumbers who are doing work within the
City only for house drainage within the City, such individuals may perform
house drainage work within the City without being a master plumber: however,
said individual is required to be registered with the Department of Community
and Economic Development.
(Ord. 4397. Passed 9-10-86; Ord. 5290. Passed 6-10-20.)
1448.02 REGISTRATION OF PERSONS HOLDING LICENSES OR CERTIFICATES FROM OTHER
JURISDICTIONS.
   Any person holding a valid and current license or certificate of competency
granted by any first, second or third class city of the Commonwealth, to engage
in or work at the business of plumbing and drainage work, who desires to do
plumbing or drainage work in the City, may be issued a license or certificate
from the City and before entering upon such work, upon the payment of a fee as
set forth by City Council, which fee shall be paid into the City Treasury. The
registration shall consist of recording such person's name and address only.
However, such registration shall be restricted and limited to such plumbing and
drainage work as such person shall have contracted for at the time of registry.
On the completion of such contract, the registration of such person shall be
null and void and no further permit shall be issued until he or she has first
registered his or her name and address, as provide above in this section.
(Ord. 4397. Passed 9-10-86; Ord. 5290. Passed 6-10-20.)
1448.03 LICENSE AND CERTIFICATE APPLICATIONS; EXAMINATIONS; FEES.
   Every person with three years or more of practical experience who is engaged
in the business or work of plumbing or house and building drainage in the City
shall apply, in writing, to the Bureau of Health for a license and certificate
of competency to do so. If, after proper examination made by the Board of
Plumbing Examiners, such person is found to be competent, that fact shall be
certified to the Codes Administrator who shall thereupon issue a license and
certificate to such person. Such license and certificate shall be valid for one
calendar year or the fractional part thereof next following the date of such
examination and shall entitle such person to engage in or work at the business
of plumbing or house and building drainage. Only one member of a firm or
corporation must hold a master plumbers license. Individuals who do not pass
the examination are thus not qualified to do plumbing work nor drainage work
within the City will be in violation of this chapter.
   The dates for examinations for plumbers licenses shall be fixed and
published by the Board of Plumbing Examiners. The fees for such examinations
shall be as set forth by City Council.
(Ord. 4397. Passed 9-10-86; Ord. 5290. Passed 6-10-20.)
1448.04 RE-REGISTRATION; FEES.
   A re-examination will not be necessary for re-registration, unless the
licensed master or journeyman plumber has failed to make an application for re-
registration at the specified time. The fees for re-registration shall be as
set forth by City Council. The licensed master or journeyman plumber may re-
register by paying the registration fee by March 31 of the current year, and
back the prior two years if outstanding registration fees are owed. All three
years need to be paid in full to place the licensed master or journeyman
plumber in good standing with the City. (Example: By March 31, 2020, the
plumber could pay for year 2020, 2019 & 2018, and will not have to re-test.
However, after that date has passed, the plumber would have to retest for the
plumbing license.)
(Ord. 3795. Passed 12-10-68; Ord. 5290. Passed 6-10-20.)
1448.05 REGISTRY.
   A registration of all master plumbers, journeymen plumbers and apprentices
shall be kept in the Department of Community and Economic Development and shall
be open to the inspection of all persons interested therein.
(Ord. 4397. Passed 9-10-86.)
1448.06 CHANGE OF ADDRESS; RETIREMENT.
   Every registered master plumber shall give immediate notice of any change in
his or her place of business, and upon his or her retirement from business, he
or she shall surrender his or her license and certificate to the Bureau of
Health.
(Ord. 3309. Passed 8-19-58.)
1448.07 PLANS; FEES.
   Any person duly registered as a master plumber who desires to file plans
with the Plumbing Inspector for the installation of plumbing or house drainage
shall, before such plans are approved and a permit is issued, pay to the
Director of Finance fees as set forth by City Council for each plan. However,
where two or more buildings are being built by one owner at the same time on
the same street and between two intersecting streets, a single plan shall be
sufficient, with a fee for each separate unit. Payment of the fee shall be
noted upon the plan.
(Ord. 4673. Passed 7-13-94.)
1448.08 PERFORMANCE OF WORK BY REGISTERED PLUMBERS REQUIRED.
   No person, other than a registered master plumber or a registered journeyman
plumber in his or her employ (registered apprentices excepted), shall install,
alter, repair or make any connection with any drainage pipe, storm pipe
connected to a storm sewer system, medical or industrial gas pipe, soil pipe,
waste pipe, vent pipe or water pipe. For all registered plumbers who are doing
work within the City only for house drainage within the City, such individuals
may perform house drainage work within the City without being a master plumber;
however, said individual must be registered with the Department of Community
and Economic Development.

(Ord. 5104. Passed 6-13-12.)
1464.02   INTENT.
   The intent of this chapter is to:
   (a)   Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
   (b)   Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in
order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
   (c)   Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.
   (d)   Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units, and its residents, by preventing excessive development in areas subject
to flooding.
   (e)   Comply with Federal and State floodplain management requirements.
(Ord. 5104. Passed 6-13-12.)
1464.03   APPLICABILITY.
   (a)   It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or
corporation to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or
development anywhere within any identified flood-prone area in the City of
Johnstown unless a permit has been obtained from the Floodplain Administrator.
   (b)   A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing buildings
or structures.
(Ord. 5104. Passed 6-13-12.)
1464.04   ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in
effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance provisions
shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those provisions are
more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of
this chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
(Ord. 5104. Passed 6-13-12.)
1464.05   WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this chapter is
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on accepted
engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be
increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings
restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that areas outside any
identified floodplain areas, or that land uses permitted within such areas will
be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability
on the part of the City of Johnstown or any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.

of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial
damage” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
         B.   Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that
would constitute a substantial improvement as defined in this chapter, must
comply with all ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure’s
continued designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific
ordinance requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National
Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places must be
obtained from the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation
Officer. Any exemption from ordinance requirements will be the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

   (a)   The identified floodplain area shall be:
      (1)   Any areas of City of Johnstown, classified as special flood hazard
areas (SFHAs) in the flood insurance study (FIS) and the accompanying flood
insurance rate maps (FIRMs) dated June 19, 2012 and issued by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof,
including all digital data developed as part of the flood insurance study and,
      (2)   Any community identified flood hazard areas.
   (b)   The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and
amendments are hereby adopted by the City of Johnstown and declared to be a
part of this chapter.
(Ord. 5104. Passed 6-13-12.)
1464.31   DESCRIPTION AND SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF IDENTIFIED FLOODPLAIN AREAS.
   The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific
areas:
   (a)   The Floodway Area/District shall be those areas identified as floodway
on the FIRM as well as those floodway areas which have been identified in other
available studies or sources of information for those special floodplain areas
where no floodway has been identified in the FIS. The floodway represents the
channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in
order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water
surface elevation by more than one foot at any point.
      (1)   Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted
unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed
encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      (2)   No new construction or development shall be allowed, unless a
permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection Regional
Office.
   (b)   The AE Area/District without floodway shall be those areas identified
as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which
base flood elevations have been provided in the FIS but no floodway has been
delineated.
      (1)   In AE Area/District without floodway, no new development shall be
permitted unless it can be demonstrated that the cumulative effect of all past
and projected development will not increase the BFE by more than one foot.
      (2)   No new construction or development shall be located within the area
measured fifty feet landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse, unless a
permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection Regional
Office.
   (c)   (1)   The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone
on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no one-percent
annual chance flood elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation
and floodway information from other Federal, State, or other acceptable source
shall be used when available. Where other acceptable information is not
available, the elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point
on the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site.
      (2)   In lieu of the above, the Municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional
engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the
technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the Municipality.
   (d)   The Shallow Flooding Area/District shall be those areas identified as
the AO Zone on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject to inundation
by one-percent-annual-chance shallow flooding where average depths are between
one and three feet. In the AO Zone, drainage paths shall be established to
guide floodwaters around and away from structures on slopes.
(Ord. 5104. Passed 6-13-12.)
1464.32   CHANGES IN IDENTIFICATION OF AREA.
   The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by City Council
where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person documents
the need for such revision. However, prior to any such change, approval must be
obtained from the FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later
than six months after the date such information becomes available, a community
shall notify the FEMA of the changes by submitting technical or scientific
data.
(Ord. 5104. Passed 6-13-12.)
1464.33   BOUNDARY DISPUTES.
   Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise from
the determination of the City’s authority having jurisdiction, an appeal shall
be made to the Johnstown Zoning Hearing Board. The burden of proof shall be on
the appellant.
(Ord. 5104. Passed 6-13-12; Ord. 5113. Passed 11-28-12.)
1464.34   JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARY CHANGES.
   Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other corporate
boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community shall review
flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary changes. The
community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in areas subject to
annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or exceed those in CFR 44
60.3.
