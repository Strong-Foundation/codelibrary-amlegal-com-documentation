(Ord. 69, 11/6/2003, § 1)
§ 212. PURPOSE.
The seven municipalities of the Penns Valley Area have come to recognize that
the issues associated with growth and development, such as, but not limited to,
traffic congestion, air and water pollution, and loss of open space, are too
large for any one municipality to deal with. They further recognize that
current growth, and anticipated growth, if not properly managed will lead to
the diminution of the region's quality of life. They are concerned that current
zoning requirements which call for each and every municipality to provide for a
full range of uses, regardless of historic development patterns, is inefficient
and potentially destructive to the region's economic and social structure. To
this end, the seven municipalities of the Penns Valley Area hereby embark on a
course of action to implement multi-municipal planning. The Township of Penn
empowers the Penns Valley Regional Planning Commission to undertake the
development of a Multi-Municipal Comprehensive Plan that shall encompass the
seven municipalities of the Penns Valley Area.
(Ord. 69, 11/6/2003, § 2)
§ 213. POWERS AND DUTIES.
The Penns Valley Regional Planning Commission shall have the responsibility to
prepare a Multi-Municipal Comprehensive Plan for the seven participating
municipalities of the Penns Valley Area. To this end, the powers and duties of
the Commission are as follows:
      A.   To prepare a Multi-Municipal Comprehensive Plan pursuant to Article
XI of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 11001 et seq.
      B.   That in the preparation of the Multi-Municipal Comprehensive Plan,
the members of the Commission shall represent the interest of their respective
municipalities, and may cast one vote per municipality on all matters that
require action.
      C.   The recommendation of the Commission shall be advisory only.
      D.   The municipalities may extend the power and duties of the Regional
Planning Commission by resolution of all participating municipalities.
      E.   The Commission shall be guided by the By-Laws of the Penns Valley
Regional Planning Commission, “Attachment #1.” 1
(Ord. 69, 11/6/2003, § 3)
1 Editor’s Note: The By-Laws of the Penns Valley Regional Planning Commission,
“Attachment #1,” is on file and available for inspection in the Township
office.
§ 214. WITHDRAWAL.
Any participating municipality may withdraw from the Penns Valley Regional
Planning Commission after 6 months formal notice. Formal notice must be
submitted in writing with the consent of the respective governing body
authorizing withdrawal from the Regional Planning Commission. Upon receiving
notice that a municipality wishes to withdraw from the Regional Planning
Commission, the governing bodies of the remaining municipalities shall promptly
schedule a meeting to consider whether the remaining municipalities wish to
continue with the Regional Planning Commission. Municipalities who choose to
withdraw shall still be responsible for their share of costs for the 6-month
formal notice period.
(Ord. 69, 11/6/2003, § 4)
§ 215. DISPUTE RESOLUTION.

the contents of the multi-municipal comprehensive plan or the interpretation of
this Part, the Regional Planning Commission may retain the services of the
Centre County Planning Office or any other organization that specializes in
mediation. The parties involved in the dispute shall be responsible for any

(Ord. 65, 5/2/2002, § 4)
§ 505. PAYMENT OF CLAIM.
   1.   Upon the receipt of a certificate pursuant to § 504(A), the insurer

      B.   If at the time of a loss report the named insured has submitted a
contractor's signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing
the building or other structure in an amount less than the amount calculated
under the foregoing transfer formula, the insurer shall transfer from the
insurance proceeds the amount specified in the estimate and the insurer shall
provide the Township with the name and address of the named insured(s).
      C.   The transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all
insurers insuring the building or other structure.

incurred by the Township. Such cost shall include, but is not limited to, any
material, labor, engineering, legal or administrative costs incurred by the
Township in connection with such removal, repair or securing of the building
and any proceeding related thereto.
      B.   When transferring the funds as required in § 506 hereof, an insurer
shall provide the Township with the name and address of the named insured,
whereupon the Township shall contact the named insured, certify that the
proceeds have been received by the Township and notify the named insured that
the procedures under this Section shall be followed.
      C.   The fund shall be returned to the named insured when repairs,
removal or securing of the building or other structure have been completed and
the required proof received by the designated officer if the Township has not
incurred any costs for repairs, removal or securing. If the Township has
incurred costs for repairs, removal or securing of the building or other
structure, the costs shall be paid from the fund, and, if excess funds remain,
the Township shall transfer the remaining funds to the named insured. Nothing
in this Section shall be construed to limit the ability of the Township to
recover any deficiency. Further, nothing in this Section shall be construed to
prohibit the Township and the named insured from entering into an agreement
that permits the transfer of funds to the named insured if some other
reasonable disposition of the damaged property has been negotiated.
(Ord. 65, 5/2/2002, § 7)
§ 508. FEE AND FURTHER PROCEDURES BY RESOLUTION.

PART 6 RIGHT-TO-KNOW POLICY FOR PUBLIC RECORDS
§ 601. INTRODUCTION.
   1.   Penn Township (“Township”) is a second class township, duly organized
and being the governing body in Penn Township, Centre County, Pennsylvania,
under the Second Class Township Code, 53 P.S. 65101 et seq. As such, the
Township is a local agency for purposes of the new Right-to-Know Law.
   2.   All local agencies shall provide public records in accordance with the
Right-to-Know Law, 53 P.S. § 1381 et seq. Therefore, any record in the
possession of the Township shall be presumed to be a public record, except in
the following circumstances:
      A.   The record is exempt under the Right-to-Know Law.
      B.   The record is protected by the attorney-work product doctrine, the
attorney-client privilege, or other privilege recognized by a court
interpreting the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
      C.   The record is exempt from disclosure under any other Federal or
State law or regulation, or judicial order or decree.
   3.   Records are broadly defined under the Right-to-Know Law. The term
includes a document, paper, letter, map, book, tape, photograph, film or sound
recording, information stored or maintained electronically, and a data-
processed or image-processed document.
   4.   Requests for public records can be made by any person who is a legal
resident of the United States, including resident aliens. Requests to the
Township can also be made by other local agencies, Commonwealth agencies (e.g.,
the Department of the Auditor General or the Treasury Department), judicial
agencies (i.e., the courts), or legislative agencies (e.g., the Senate and
House of Representatives).
(Res. 2008-04, 12/4/2008, § 1)
§ 602. ACCESS AND PROCEDURE.
   1.   Requesters may make oral requests for access to records. However, if
the requester wishes to pursue the relief and remedies provided for in the
Right-to-Know Law, the request for access to records must be a written request.
A written request for access to records may be submitted in person, by mail, by
e-mail, or by facsimile.
   2.   The Township has designated Barbara Shaffer, to act as the Open-Records
Officer (“Officer”). The Officer's contact information is set forth below:
         Barbara Shaffer
         P.O. Box 125
         118 Tea Hollow Lane
         Coburn, PA 16832
         Phone: (814) 349-8886
         Fax: (814) 349-5525
         e-mail: penntownshipcentre@verizon.net
   3.   Questions regarding this policy may be directed to the Officer at the
telephone, fax number or e-mail address listed above.
   4.   All written requests must be addressed to the Officer. In the event a
written request for records is addressed to a Township employee other than the
Officer, the Township employee is hereby directed to promptly forward such
requests to the Officer.
   5.   Written requests should identify or describe the record sought with
sufficient specificity to enable the Township to ascertain which records are
being requested. Unless otherwise required by law, a written request need not
include any explanation of the requester's reason for requesting the records or
the intended use of such records. The Township shall assign a tracking number
to each filed form so as to track the Township's progress in responding to
requests under the new Right-to-Know Law.
   6.   Prior to granting a request for access in accordance with the Right-to-
Know Law, the Township may require a requester to prepay an estimate of the
fees authorized by law if the fees required to fulfill the request are expected
to exceed $100. The fees must be reasonable and based on prevailing fees for
comparable duplication services provided by local business entities. Except as
otherwise provided by statute, no other fees may be imposed unless the agency
necessarily incurs costs for complying with the request, and such fees must be
reasonable.
   7.   In all circumstances, the requester must agree to pay applicable fees
authorized by the new Right-to-Know Law, such as, but not limited to, postage
(not to exceed actual cost of mailing) duplication and certification. All
applicable fees shall be paid before a requester receives access to the record
(s) requested.
   8.   A record being provided to a requester shall be provided in the medium
requested if it exists in that medium; otherwise, it shall be provided in the
medium in which it exists. In other words, the Township shall not be required
to create a record which does not currently exist or to otherwise compile,
maintain, format or organize a record in a manner in which it does not
currently compile, maintain, format or organize such record. The Township may
impose reasonable fees for official certification of copies if the
certification is at the behest of the requester and for the purpose of legally
verifying the public record.
   9.   Upon receipt of a written request for a public record, the Officer
shall do the following:
      A.   Note the date of the receipt on the written request.
      B.   Compute the day on which the 5-day period (see discussion of
response, below) will expire, and make a notation of that date on the written
request
      C.   Create a file for the retention of the original request, a copy of
the response, a record of written communications with the requester, and a copy
of other communications.
(Res. 2008-04, 12/4/2008, § 1)
§ 603. TOWNSHIP'S RESPONSE.
   1.   Upon receipt of a written request for access to a record, the Township
shall make a good faith effort to determine if the record requested is a public
record and whether the Township has possession, custody or control of the
identified record. When doing so, the Township will respond as promptly as
possible under the circumstances existing at the time of the request. Under the
Right-to-Know Law, the Township must send a response within 5 business days of
receipt of the written request for access, or else the written request shall be
deemed denied. For the purposes of this policy, a business day is any Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday, except those days when the Township's
office is closed for all or part of a day due to a holiday.
   2.   Upon receipt of a written request for access, the Officer shall
determine if one of the following applies:
      A.   The request for access requires redaction of a record in accordance
with the Right-to-Know Law.
      B.   The request for access requires the retrieval of a record stored in
a remote location.
      C.   A timely response to the request for access can not be accomplished
due to bona fide and specified staffing limitations.
      D.   A legal review is necessary to determine whether the record is a
record subject to access under the Right-to-Know Law.
      E.   The requester has not complied with the Township's policies
regarding access to records.
      F.   The requester refuses to pay applicable fees authorized by the
Right-to-Know Law.
      G.   The extent or nature of the request precludes a response within the
required time period of 5 business days.
   3.   Upon a determination that one of the factors listed above applies, the
Officer shall send written notice to the requester within 5 business days of
receipt of the request for access. The notice shall include a statement
notifying the requester that the request for access is being reviewed, the
reason for the review, a reasonable date that a response is expected to be
provided, and an estimate of applicable fees owed when the record becomes
available. Information which the Township redacts in accordance with the Right-
to-Know Law shall be deemed a denial.
   4.   If the date that a response is expected to be provided is in excess of
30 calendar days, following the 5 business days allowed for above, the request
for access shall be deemed denied unless the requester has agreed in writing to
an extension to the date specified in the notice. If the requester agrees to
the extension, the request shall be deemed denied on the day following the date
specified in the notice if the Township has not provided a response by that
date.
   5.   For purposes of this policy, the “mailing date” shall be the date
affixed to a: (A) response from the Officer to a request, which is to be the
date the response is deposited in the U.S. mail; (B) final determination from
the Officer, which is to be the date the final determination is deposited in
the U.S. mail.
(Res. 2008-04, 12/4/2008, § 1)
§ 604. APPEAL OF TOWNSHIP'S DETERMINATION.
   1.   If a written request for access to a record is denied or deemed denied,
the requester may file an appeal with the Office of Open Records within 15
business days of the mailing date of the Township's response or within 15
business days of a deemed denial. The appeal shall state the grounds upon which
the requester asserts that the record is a public record, and shall address any
grounds stated by the Township for delaying or denying the request.
   2.   The Office of Open Records has established an internet website with
information relating to the Right-to-Know Law, including information on fees,
advisory opinions and decisions, plus the name and address of all Open-Records
Officers in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. For information on the Office of
Open Records, please go to openrecords.state.pa.us. (Please note: among other
matters, the Office of Open Records shall establish fees for duplication by
photocopying, printing from electronic media or microfilm, copying onto
electronic media, and other means of duplication.)
(Res. 2008-04, 12/4/2008, § 1)
§ 605. RETENTION OF RECORDS.
By adoption of this Part, the Township publicly declared its intention to
follow the Municipal Records Act, 53 Pa. C.S.A. § 1381 et seq., with respect to
the retention and disposition of public records. Nothing in the Right-to-Know
Law shall be construed to modify, rescind or supercede the Township's lawfully
adopted record retention and disposition policy. Moreover, nothing in the
Right-to-Know Law shall be construed to require access to any computer of the
Township, or that of an individual or employee of the Township.

§ 312. TAPPING FEES.
   1.   No person shall connect any improved property with any part of the
sewer system without first making application for and securing a connection
permit, in writing, from the Township, as provided for in the Connection
Ordinance [Part 3A]. Such application shall be made on a form to be provided by
the Township.
   2.   A tapping fee is hereby imposed against the owner of any improved
property to be served by the sewer system which actually connects or is
required to be connected pursuant to the Connection Ordinance [Part 3A] then in
effect requiring such connection.
   3.   The tapping fee payable by the owner of an improved property shall be
the product of the number of equivalent dwelling units constituting such
improved property times $500. In the event an improved property, or use thereof
(including number of occupants), changes in a manner that causes the number of
EDUs applicable to such improved property calculated hereunder to increase, an
additional tapping fee based on such additional EDUs shall be immediately due
and payable.
   4.   The tapping fee shall be due and payable the earlier of: (A) the time
application is made to the Township to make connection to the sewer system, as
provided in subsection (1)   hereof, or, if applicable, the date when the
Township shall connect any such improved property to the sewer system, at the
costs and expense of the owner, when such owner shall have failed to make such
connection as required by the Connection Ordinance [Part 3A] in effect
requiring such connection, or (B) in the case of improved properties required
to be connected following initial construction of the sewer system, the date
which is 60 days after the date of issuance by the Township of a written notice
to connect, owners of an improved property which is attributed an additional
number of equivalent dwelling units as defined by the Township rate structure
herein shall pay a corresponding additional tapping fee at the time of being
attributed with the new EDU computation.
   5.   Calculation and itemization of the maximum lawful tapping fee is
attached hereto as Exhibit “A” and made a part hereof.
   6.   All tapping fees shall be payable to the Treasurer of the Township or
to such other officer or representative of the Township as shall be authorized,
from time to time, by the Township, to accept payment thereof.
   7.   Payment of tapping fees imposed by the Township pursuant to this Part
3B shall be enforced by the Township in any manner appropriate under laws at
the time in effect.
(Res. 2005-05, 5/5/2005, Art. II)
§ 313. USER CHARGES.
   1.   A user charge is hereby imposed upon the owner of each improved
property which is or shall be connected to the sewer system, for use of the
sewer system, whether such use is direct or indirect, and for services rendered
by the Township in connection therewith, and shall be payable as provided
herein. At the discretion of the Township, such user charge may be imposed upon
the owner of an improved property who fails or refuses improperly to connect
such, improved property to the sewer system, as compensation for the
availability of service by the Township in connection with the sewer system.
   2.   The user charge shall be payable by the owner of each improved property
commencing the earlier of: (A) the date of actual, physical connection of an
improved property to the sewer system, or (B) 60 days from the date of issuance
of the notice to connect described in the Connection Ordinance [Part 3A]; or
such other date established by the Township for commencement of the payment of
the user charge.
3.   The user charge applicable to any improved property constituting a
dwelling unit or large consumer shall be calculated, imposed and collected on
the basis of the method provided in this subsection.
Each improved property shall be charged a user charge as a specific amount per
equivalent dwelling unit applicable to such improved property, as determined by
the Township, from time to time. The number of equivalent dwelling units
applicable to each improved property shall be determined as follows:
Description of Improved Property   Unit of Measurement   Number of EDUs per
Unit of Measurement 
Residential dwelling unit (year­round or seasonal)   Each single family
dwelling unit (including apartments)   1 
Mobile (manufactured) home park   Per pad (whether or not occupied)   1

      Each additional 10 employees or fraction thereof   1
The number of equivalent dwelling units applicable to commercial establishments
and industrial establishments shall be computed on the basis of the average
daily number of full and part-time employees (including the owner(s) or
employer(s)) for the calendar month following the date of the monthly billing.
The owners of such facilities shall be responsible for advising the Township in
writing of the number of employees upon connection to the sewer system and upon
request of the Township. The number of equivalent dwelling units applicable to
educational and institutional establishments shall be computed on the highest
monthly average daily attendance of occupants, pupils, faculty, administrators
and staff for the 12 months preceding the date of the monthly billing. The
owners of such facilities shall be responsible for advising the Township in
writing of the number of pupils, faculty, administrators and staff in
attendance as an average daily figure upon request of the Township. No tapping
fees shall be reimbursed by the Township for subsequent reductions in the
number of EDUs constituting a particular improved property.
If the use or classification of any improved property changes within a billing
period, the user charge for such billing period may be prorated by the
Township. The owner of the improved property shall be responsible for advising
the Township in writing of any such change affecting the user charge payable
hereunder. The appropriate credit or additional charge shall appear on the
statement for the next succeeding billing period.
The monthly flat rate user charge payable per equivalent dwelling unit shall be
$63.00 [Res. 2014-07].
User charges for any nonresidential improved property, in the sole discretion
of the Township, may be determined on a metered rate basis calculated according
to:
      A.   Metered volume of potable water usage by the nonresidential improved
property, adjusted, if appropriate, by the Township.
      B.   Actual metered volume of wastewater discharged by the nonresidential
improved property into the sewer system.
In either of the foregoing cases, such user charges on a metered rate basis
shall be computed on the basis of one EDU per each 60,000 gallons or portion
thereof of water consumed or sewage discharged annually.
   4.   In the case of a multiple use improved property sharing a common
connection to the sewer system or a common structure, each such classification
of improved property shall pay a separate user charge, as though it was housed
in a separate structure and had a direct and separate connection to the sewer
system, computed in accordance with subsection (3) of this Section.
   5.   The owner of any improved property which shall discharge domestic
sanitary sewage and/or industrial wastes into the sewer system in excess of a
total flow of 250 gallons per day per equivalent dwelling unit with a peak flow
rate in excess of 375 gallons per day for any 10-minute period, per equivalent
dwelling unit calculated under subsection (3), as determined or reasonably
estimated by the Township, shall pay a volume surcharge. The owner of any
improved property which shall discharge domestic sanitary sewage and/or
industrial wastes to the sewer system having a B.O.D. greater than 300 ppm, or
a suspended solids content greater than 300 ppm, or a dissolved solids content
greater than 500 ppm, or a total solids content greater than 800 ppm, or a
total phosphorus as P content greater than 10 ppm or an ammonia nitrogen as N
content greater than 30 ppm, shall, in the discretion of the Township, pay a
strength of waste surcharge, in addition to applicable user charges.
Surcharges shall be paid in addition to all user charges computed in accordance
with provisions of this Section and shall be computed on such basis, and
payable at such times, as this Township may from time to time adopt, including
provisions of any agreements to which this Township is a party governing the
treatment of domestic sanitary sewage or industrial wastes. The strength of
domestic sanitary sewage and/or industrial wastes to be used for establishing
the amount of surcharge shall be determined periodically at the discretion of
the Township either: (A) by suitable sampling and analysis of such wastes for a
consecutive 3-day period during a time of normal plant operation; or (B) from
estimates made by the Township; or (C) from known relationships of products
produced to strengths of such wastes for those industries where such factors
have been established. In establishing such waste strengths for surcharge
purposes by analysis, analyses shall be made in accordance with procedures
outlined in the latest edition of “Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater” published by the American Public Health Association, Inc.
   6.   The owner of any improved property discharging domestic sanitary sewage
and/or industrial wastes into the sewer system shall furnish to the Township,
including by way of the application for permit described in the Connection
Ordinance [Part 3A], all information deemed essential or appropriate by the
Township for the determination of all applicable user charges and surcharges.
The costs of obtaining such information shall be borne by such owner of the
improved property.
In the event of the failure of the owner to provide adequate information, the
Township shall estimate the applicable user charge and surcharges based upon
available information, until such time as adequate information is received.
There shall be no rebate of past payments if the owner’s refusal to provide
such information results in overpay­ment.
   7.   Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to prohibit this Township from
entering into separate or special agreements with owners of improved property
or other persons with respect to the user charge or surcharge to be imposed in
those cases where, due to special or unusual circumstances, the user charge set
forth herein shall be deemed by this Township, in its sole discretion, to be
inequitable, or where it is in the best interests of this Township to do so.
   8.   User charges shall be payable on a monthly basis, on the first day of
each month, and shall cover a billing period consisting of the immediately
preceding month. Owners of improved property that shall be first connected to
the sewer system during any monthly period shall pay a pro-rata user charge for
service for the balance of the monthly period.
   9.   Payments of user charges and any applicable surcharges shall be due and
payable upon the applicable billing date, at the office of the Township, in the
appropriate amount, computed in accordance with this Part 3B, which shall
constitute the net bill. If any user charge or any applicable surcharge is not
paid within 30 calendar days after the applicable billing date, an additional
sum of 10 percent shall be added to such net bill, which net bill, plus such
additional sum, shall constitute the gross bill. Payment made or mailed and
postmarked on or before the last day of such 30-calendar day period shall
constitute payment within such period. If the end of such 30-calendar day
period shall fall on a legal holiday or on a Sunday, then payment made on or
mailed and postmarked on the next succeeding business day which is not a legal
holiday shall constitute payment within such period. Any and all payments
received on account of delinquent accounts shall be applied first to the oldest
outstanding gross bill, including any accumulated late fee.
   10.   It shall be the responsibility of each owner of an improved property
to provide the Township with, and thereafter keep the Township continuously
advised of, the correct mailing address of such owner. Failure of any owner to
receive a bill for charges due and payable shall not be considered an excuse
for nonpayment, nor shall such failure result in an extension of the period of
time during which the net bill shall be payable.
   11.   No officer or employee of the Township is authorized to reduce, vary
or exempt charges imposed herein or other provisions of this Part 3B without
official action by the Board of Supervisors of this Township.
Every owner of improved property shall remain liable for the payment of user
charges and surcharges until the later of: (A) the receipt by the Township of
written notice by such owner that the property has been sold, containing the
correct name and mailing address of the new owner, or (B) the date on which
title to the improved property is transferred to a new owner. Failure to
provide notice renders an owner continuously liable for any charges that may
accrue until such time as the Township has been properly notified of any change
in ownership as described above.

   NONRESIDENT - a person or business domiciled outside the political
subdivision levying the tax.

of the Local Tax Enabling Act, and all provisions thereof that relate to a tax
on earned income or net profits are incorporated into this Enactment. Any
future amendments to the Local Tax Enabling Act that are required to be applied
to a tax on earned income or net profits will automatically become part of this
Enactment upon the effective date of such amendment, without the need for
formal amendment of this Enactment, to the maximum extent allowed by 1
Pa.C.S.A. § 1937.

(Ord. 84, 11/22/2011, § 7)
§ 208. PURPOSE/AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT/REPEAL.

profits tax currently imposed to the Local Tax Enabling Act, as amended and

Enactment. Any other prior enactment or part of any prior enactment conflicting
with the provisions of this Enactment is rescinded insofar as the conflict
exists. To the extent the same as any enactment in force immediately prior to
adoption of this Enactment, the provisions of this Enactment are intended as a
continuation of such prior enactment and not as a new enactment. If this
Enactment is declared invalid, any prior enactment levying a similar tax shall
remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by adoption of this
Enactment. If any part of this Enactment is declared invalid, the similar part
of any prior enactment levying a similar tax shall remain in effect and shall

   2.   Procedure to claim exemption.
      A.   A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the political subdivision and
with the person's employer affirming that the person reasonably expects to
receive earned income and net profits from all sources within the political
subdivision of less than $12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption
certificate is filed. In the event the political subdivision utilizes a tax
collection officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to
that officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of all
the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment within the political
subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year for which the employee is
requesting to be exempted from the tax. Upon receipt of the exemption
certificate and until otherwise instructed by the political subdivision or
except as required by Subsection B(2), the employer shall not withhold the tax
from the person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar year
for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall ensure that the
exemption certificate forms are readily available to employees at all times and
shall furnish each new employee with a form at the time of hiring. The
exemption certificate form shall be the uniform form provided by the political
subdivision.
      B.   With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the person or
by the political subdivision that the person has received earned income and net
profits from all sources within the political subdivision equal to or in excess
of $12,000 in that calendar year or that the person is otherwise ineligible for
the tax exemption for that calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the
person of earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold the local
services tax from that person under Subsection B(3).
      C.   If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year from
the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under Subsection 2.B.
above, the employer shall withhold the tax for the remainder of that calendar
year. The employer shall withhold from the person, for the first payroll period
after receipt of the notification under Subsection 2.B., a lump sum equal to
the amount of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per-payroll amount due
for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld per payroll period
for the remaining payroll periods in that calendar year shall be the same
amount withheld for other employees. In the event the employment of a person
subject to withholding of the tax under this subsection is subsequently severed
in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any outstanding balance
of tax due, and the political subdivision may pursue collection under this
ordinance.
      D.   Except as provided in Subsection 2.B. above, it is the intent of
this subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating
exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or exempting any
employee from the local services tax.

tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which procedures shall be

calendar year that do not exceed $1. The Township of Penn or the Collector
shall determine eligibility for exemption and provide refunds to exempt
persons.

Collector. Further, each employer is hereby authorized to deduct this tax for
each employee in his or her employ, whether said employee is paid by salary,
wage or commission and whether or not all such services are performed within
the political subdivision.
   2.   A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro
rata share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person for a
payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax levied for
the calendar year by the number of payroll periods established by the employer
for the calendar year. For purposes of determining the pro rata share, an
employer shall round down the amount of tax collected each payroll period to
the nearest 0.01 of a dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll-

occupation,  except as  provided in Subsection 4. of this section; for purposes
of this subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate annual rate of the
tax levied by the school district and the municipality.

withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement from a
principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the length of the
payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a statement from the
employee that the pay statement is from the employee's principal employer and
the employee will notify other employers of a change in principal place of
employment within two weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall
be provided on the form approved by DCED.
   5.   The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The political subdivision shall provide a taxpayer a
receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
   6.   No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for
the payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the
employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the employee's
principal office or where the employee is principally employed. Further, an
employer shall not be liable for payment of the local services tax in an amount
exceeding the amount withheld by the employer if the employer complies with the
provisions of §
504 2. of this Part and this section and remits the amount so withheld in
accordance with this Part.
   7.   Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
(Ord. 88, 9/6/2018, §5)
§ 506.  RETURNS.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the tax
on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer fails
to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her to
an employee, except as provided hereafter in this Part, the employer shall be
responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had been
originally levied against the employer.
(Ord. 88, 9/6/2018, §6)
§ 507.  DATES FOR DETERMINING TAX LIABILITY AND PAYMENT.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted and paid
over to the Collector on or before the 30th day following the end of each
calendar quarter of each such tax year.
(Ord. 88, 9/6/2018, §7)
§ 508.  SELF-EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind or
engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of employment
within the political subdivision shall be required to comply with this Part and
pay the pro rata portion of the tax due to the Collector on or before the 30th
day following the end of each quarter.
(Ord. 88, 9/6/2018, §8)
§ 509.  INDIVIDUALS ENGAGED IN MORE THAN ONE OCCUPATION OR EMPLOYED IN MORE
THAN ONE POLITICAL SUBDIVISION.
   1.   The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day
the person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the event
a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is, concurrent
employment, or an occupation which requires the person working in more than one
political subdivision during a payroll period, the priority of claim to collect
the local services tax shall be in the following order:
      A.   First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office is or is principally employed;
      B.   Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
      C.   Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
   2.   In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that
calendar year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
(Ord. 88, 9/6/2018, §9)
§ 510.  NONRESIDENTS SUBJECT TO TAX.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places of
business outside of the political subdivision but who perform services of any
type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the political
subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject themselves
to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under this Part with
the same force and effect as though they were residents of the political
subdivision. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation within the
political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential employer may, for the
purpose of this Part, be considered a self-employed person, and in the event
his or her tax is not paid, the political subdivision shall have the option of
proceeding against either the employer or employee for the collection of this
tax as hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 88, 9/6/2018, §10)
§ 511.  ADMINISTRATION OF TAX.
   1.   The Collector shall be appointed by resolution of the political
subdivision. It shall be the duty of the Collector to accept and receive
payments of this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount received
by him from each employer or self-employed person, together with the date the
tax was received.
   2.   The Collector is hereby charged with the administration and enforcement
of this Part and is hereby charged and empowered, subject to municipal
approval, to prescribe, adopt and promulgate rules and regulations relating to
any matter pertaining to the administration and enforcement of this Part,
including provisions for the examination of payroll records of any employer
subject to this Part, the examination and correction of any return made in
compliance with this Part and any payment alleged or found to be incorrect or
as to which overpayment is claimed or found to have occurred. Any person
aggrieved by any decision of the Collector shall have the right to appeal
consistent with the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights under Act 50 of 1998, 53
PaCSA. § 8421 et seq.
   3.   The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return made by
an employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax due. Each employer
is hereby directed and required to give the Collector the means, facilities and
opportunity for such examination.
(Ord. 88, 9/6/2018, §11)
§ 512.  SUITS FOR COLLECTION.
   1.   In the event that any tax under this Part remains due or unpaid 30 days
after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for the recovery of
any such tax due or unpaid under this ordinance, together with interest and
penalty.
   2.   If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of
6% on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning with the due date of
the tax and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of such tax for
nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery of this tax or other
appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable therefor shall in
addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of collection.
(Ord. 88, 9/6/2018, §12)
§ 513.  VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
Whoever makes any false or untrue statement on any return required by this
Part, or whoever refuses inspection of the books, records or accounts in his or
her custody and control setting forth the number of employees subject to this
tax who are in his or her employment, or whoever fails or refuses to file any
return required by this Part shall be guilty of a violation and, upon
conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $600 and
costs of prosecution, and, in default of payment of such fine and costs, to
imprisonment for not more than 30 days. The action to enforce the penalty
herein prescribed may be instituted against any person in charge of the
business of any employer who shall have failed or who refuses to file a return
required by this Part.
(Ord. 88, 9/6/2018, §13)
§ 514.  INTERPRETATION.
   1.   Nothing contained in this Part shall be construed to empower the
political subdivision to levy and collect the tax hereby imposed on any
occupation not within the taxing power of the political subdivision under the
Constitution of the United States or of the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania.
   2.   If the tax hereby imposed under the provisions of this Part shall be
held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of the
Constitution of the United States or of the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania as to any individual, the decision of the court shall not affect
or impair the right to impose or collect said tax or the validity of the tax so
imposed on other persons or individuals as herein provided.
(Ord. 88, 9/6/2018, §14)
§ 515.  SEVERABILITY.
The provisions of this Part are severable and in the event that any provision
is held invalid, void, illegal, or unconstitutional by any court, it is the
intent of the Penn Township Supervisors that such determination by the court
shall not affect or render void the remaining provisions of this Part. It is
the declared intent of the Penn Township Supervisors that this Part would have
been enacted if any provision subsequently declared to be void, invalid,
illegal or unconstitutional had not been included at the time of enactment.
(Ord. 88, 9/6/2018, §15)
§ 516.  EFFECTIVE DATE OF TAX.
The tax imposed by this Part shall be effective on January 1, 2019, and all
calendar years thereafter unless repealed or modified by ordinance of the
Township.

PART 1
RULES AND REGULATIONS OF PENN TOWNSHIP WATER DISTRICT 1
1 Editor's Note: The Board of Supervisors created and authorized the Penn
Township Water District for the conduct, operation and maintenance of a public
water supply system to supply water to certain residents of the Township.
§ 101. CONDITIONS OF SERVICE.
These rules and regulation are a part of the contract with every person who
takes water and every such person, by taking the water, agrees to be bound
thereby.
(Ord. 1, 12/26/1952)
§ 102. SERVICE LINE INSTALLATION.
   1.   Water service connect-ion will be made to improved property only, or to
property in process of improvement, upon written request for service connection
with signature of property owner or his duly authorized agent. A new
application must be made upon any change in ownership of the property

each customer; provided, however, that on occasion shall the Water District
install and maintain service lines for more than 50 feet from the main line to
the present water district.
   3.   The owner shall, at his own expense, dig and fill trenches and furnish
pipe for his service line from the curb cock and box to his own property and to
maintain the same, and in all respects be responsible for any and all injury
and damage in consequence thereof or resulting therefrom.
   4.   All service lines shall have a covering of not less than 3 feet and it
is forbidden to lay any service pipe in the same trench with a sewer pipe. The
Water District reserves the right to inspect, before covering, that portion of
the line installed by the owner.
   5.   The stop cock or any water line supplying water to any premises,
whether through an old or new installation, shall be under the exclusive
control of the Water District and no person shall open or close the same, or
lend a key for so doing, without the consent of the Water District, except in
case of breaks or accident.
   6.   Service lines upon the premises supplied must be maintained by the
customer and all leaks must be promptly repaired by the owner, and upon failure
to make such repairs with reasonable dispatch, the service may be discontinued
after due notice and will not be resumed until necessary repairs are made. In
such case, a charge in an amount as established from time to time by resolution
of the Board of Supervisors will be made to cover the cost of turning the water
off and on. [Ord. 66]
(Ord. 1, 12/26/1952; as amended by Ord. 66, 9/5/2002, § 1)
§ 103. APPLICATION FOR WATER SERVICE.
Any property owner desiring a supply of water must make a written application,
on the form furnished by the Water District, at least one day before service is
required. Where premises have already been supplied with approved water service
facilities, and a customer desires water turned on into the premises, the
customer will be required to sign an application for water service in order to
authorize the Water District to turn on the water into the premises.
(Ord. 1, 12/26/1952)
§ 104. BILLING.
   1.   All bills for water service will be rendered semiannually for services
during the previous six months. All bills are due and payable as rendered and
if not paid within 60 days of the due date, a penalty of 10% will be added;
provided, if said bills remain unpaid for a period of 30 days, service will be
discontinued after ten days notice of delinquency. [Ord. 66]
   2.   Any service discontinued on account of nonpayment of water rent will
not be turned on until all arrearages and the fee established to cover the
costs of turning off and on is paid. [Ord. 66]
   3.   Turning on of water into any premises for any purpose by anyone except
a representative of the Water District is prohibited.
   4.   A customer will not be permitted to supply water to any premises other
than that mentioned in the application, agreement or contract without
permission from the Water District.
   5.   No branch shall be allowed to be inserted in any service line without
special permission from the Water District.
   6.   The Water District reserves the right to shut off the water in the
mains at any time for the purpose of making repairs or extension or for other
necessary purposes and will give due notice except in case of breaks and
emergencies. In such case, the Water District shall not be liable for any
damage or inconvenience suffered by the consumer nor in any case for any claim
against it at any time for interruption of service, lessening of supply,
inadequate pressure, poor quality of water or any cause beyond its control. The
Water District reserves the right to reserve the supply of water in case of
scarcity or emergency or whenever the public welfare may require it.
   7.   Consumers desiring to discontinue service shall report the same in
person or in writing to the agent of the Water District. All vacancies shall
date from the date same are reported. Rebate will be granted only where
property has not been occupied for more than three months during the previous
six month period and then only after the owner of the property has notified the
Water District in writing within ten days after property is not occupied that
he desires to claim the rebate.
   8.   Penn Township Water District shall, from time to time, establish rates
and fees for water service by resolution approved by the Penn Township Board of
Supervisors. [Ord. 66]
(Ord. 1, 12/26/1952; as amended by Ord. 66, 9/5/2002, § 1)
§ 105. WATER LINE EXTENSIONS.
   1.   Upon request for service by one or more applicants, the territory will
be surveyed and an estimate prepared on the construction cost of the necessary
extension. This estimate will be used to determine the total minimum revenue to
be guaranteed. On this basis, the estimated amount for each applicant will be
written into his application which, when signed by him and accepted by the Penn
Township Water District, will constitute a contract for the taking of service
under this extension rule. Upon the completion of the extension, estimated
figures shall be revised to agree with the actual cost of construction. The
Penn Township Water District shall not be required to start construction on any
extension until applications have been signed and accepted covering the entire
amount of the guaranteed revenue which shall be payable from the date service
is first furnished or offered to consumers.
   2.   The Penn Township Water District, in order to safeguard its
investments, may require any applicant consumer to establish a satisfactory
credit standing as a guarantee of the payment of his bills during the term of
the contract, or in lieu thereof, making a cash deposit or give other form of
acceptable guarantee.
   3.   All extensions where the Water District's estimated cost of
construction, based on four inch cast iron pipe, does not exceed $100 per
consumer or where the applicants supply sufficient money, material and labor to
reduce the cost of construction per consumer to $100, the Water District will
construct such extension without requiring a guaranteed minimum revenue other
than the minimum charge prescribed in the applicable rate schedule.
   4.   Where the actual cost of construction after applying credits exceed
$100 per customer, the total minimum revenue to be guaranteed from each
extension shall be an amount equal to 12% of the total cost of construction.
This total guaranteed amount will be divided equally among all customers
applying for service on such extension and the amount thus obtained where
thereupon will become the minimum annual charge for each consumer payable
semiannually. The minimum guaranteed revenue of any consumer shall no be less
than the minimum charge as determined by the rate schedule.
   5.   Any additions to extension constructed under the provisions of
subsection (4) above, for the purpose of serving additional consumers, shall be
added to the original cost of construction and reapportioned among the several
consumers; provided, that the inclusion of such additional costs and consumers
will not increase the average minimum of existing consumers; otherwise any
extensions constructed to serve such additional consumers shall be treated as a
new and separate extension requiring a guaranteed minimum as provided in the
preceding subsection.
   6.   Extensions of the distribution system shall be carried in the direction
of the extension at least to the centerline of the lot being served except that
in the case of street corner lots, the extension shall be continued to the
center of the intersecting street.
   7.   In computing charges for the extension of water mains in a direction
transverse to existing mains, an extension of 50 feet made be made at
intersections.
