prescribed in the Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. §§ 6924.101 et seq., so that

tax on the same person or transfer then the tax levied by the Borough Council
under the authority of that Act shall during the time such duplication of the
tax exists, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, be one-half of the rate
and such one-half shall become effective without any action on the part of the
Borough Council provided, however, that the borough and any other political
subdivision which impose such tax on the same person or transfer may agree
that, instead of limiting their respective rates to one-half of the rate herein
provided, they will impose respectively different rates, the total of which
shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted under the Local Tax Enabling Act.

in effect at the time the tax is due, shall be added and collected.
§ 36.029  EXEMPT PARTIES.

presented with a copy of the trust instrument that clearly identifies the
grantor and all possible beneficiaries;

year. Each natural person who exercises such privilege for any length of time

political subdivisions within which a person may be employed.
(Ord. 1056, passed 12-18-2007)
§ 36.127  EXEMPTIONS AND REFUNDS.

all sources within the borough is less than $12,000 for any calendar year in
which the tax is levied is exempt from the payment of the tax for that calendar
year. In addition, the following persons are exempt from payment of the tax:
      (1)   Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which the
United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or released under
honorable circumstances from active service if, as a result of military
service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double or quadruple amputee or
has a service-connected disability declared by the United States Veterans’
Administration or its successor to be a total 100% disability; or
      (2)   Any person who serves as a member of a reserve component of the

shall mean the United States Army Reserve, United States Navy Reserve, United
States Marine Corps Reserve, United States Coast Guard Reserve, United States
Air Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the Pennsylvania Air
National Guard.
   (B)   Procedure to claim exemption.
      (1)   A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the borough and with the
person’s employer affirming that the person reasonably expects to receive
earned income and net profits from all sources within the borough of less than
$12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is filed. In
the event the borough utilizes a Tax Collection Officer, it shall provide a
copy of the exemption certificate to that officer. The exemption certificate
shall have attached to it a copy of all the employee’s last pay stubs or W-
2 forms from employment within the borough for the year prior to the fiscal
year for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax. Upon
receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise instructed by the
borough, or except as required by division (B)(2) below, the employer shall not
withhold the tax from the person during the calendar year or the remainder of
the calendar year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall
ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to employees
at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a form at the time of
hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be the uniform form provided by
the borough.
      (2)   With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the person or
by the borough that the person has received earned income and net profits from
all sources within the borough equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that
calendar year or that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption
for that calendar year, or upon an employer’s payment to the person of earned
income within the borough in an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that
calendar year, an employer shall withhold the local services tax from the
person under division (B)(3) below.
      (3)   If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year from
the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under division (B)(2)
above, the employer shall withhold the tax for the remainder of that calendar
year. The employer shall withhold from the person, for the first payroll period
after receipt of the notification under division (B)(2) above, a lump sum equal
to the amount of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this division (B), plus the per payroll amount due
for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld per payroll period
for the remaining payroll periods in that calendar year shall be the same
amount withheld for other employees. In the event the employment of a person
subject to withholding of the tax under this division (B)(3) is subsequently
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any outstanding
balance of tax due, and the borough may pursue collection under this
subchapter.
      (4)   Except as provided in division (B)(2) above, it is the intent of
this division (B) that employers shall not be responsible for investigating
exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or exempting any
employee from the local services tax.
   (C)   Refunds. The Borough Manager, in consultation with the Collector and
DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims for any
tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which procedures shall be
in accord with provisions of the general municipal law relating to refunds of
overpayments and interest on overpayments. Refunds made within 75 days of a
refund request or 75 days after the last day the employer is required to remit
the tax for the last quarter of the calendar year, whichever is later, shall
not be subject to interest. No refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a
calendar year that do not exceed $1. The Borough Manager or the Collector shall
determine eligibility for exemption and provide refunds to exempt persons.
(Ord. 1056, passed 12-18-2007)
§ 36.128  DUTY OF EMPLOYERS TO COLLECT.
   (A)   Each employer within the borough, as well as those employers situated
outside the borough, but who engage in business within the borough, is hereby
charged with the duty of collecting the tax from each of his or her employees
engaged by him or her or performing for him or her within the borough and
making a return and payment thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is
hereby authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in his or her employ,
whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and whether or not
all such services are performed within the borough.
   (B)   A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro
rata share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person for a
payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax levied for
the calendar year by the number of payroll periods established by the employer
for the calendar year. For purposes of determining the pro rata share, an
employer shall round down the amount of the tax collected each payroll period
to the nearest one-hundredth of a dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made
on a payroll period basis for each payroll period in which the person is
engaging in an occupation, except as provided in division (D) below. For
purposes of this division (B), COMBINED RATE shall mean the aggregate annual
rate of the tax levied by the school district and the borough.
   (C)   No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
   (D)   In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement from a
principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the length of the
payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a statement from the
employee that the pay statement is from the employee’s principal employer and
the employee will notify other employers of a change in principal place of
employment within two weeks of its occurrence. The employee’s statement shall
be provided on the form approved by DCED.
   (E)   The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The political subdivision shall provide a taxpayer a
receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
   (F)   No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or
for the payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the
employee as to the employee’s place or places of employment, the employee’s
principal office or where the employee is principally employed. Further, an
employer shall not be liable for payment of the local services tax in an amount
exceeding the amount withheld by the employer if the employer complies with the
provisions of §
36.127(B), and this section, and remits the amount so withheld in accordance
with this subchapter.
   (G)   Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
(Ord. 1056, passed 12-18-2007)
§ 36.129  RETURNS.
   Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her to
an employee, except as provided hereafter in this subchapter, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.
(Ord. 1056, passed 12-18-2007)
§ 36.130  DATES FOR DETERMINING TAX LIABILITY AND PAYMENT.
   In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted and paid
over to the Collector on or before the thirtieth day following the end of each
calendar quarter of each such tax year.
(Ord. 1056, passed 12-18-2007)
§ 36.131  SELF-EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS.
   Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind or
engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of employment
within the borough shall be required to comply with this subchapter and pay the
pro rata portion of the tax due to the Collector on or before the thirtieth day
following the end of each quarter.
(Ord. 1056, passed 12-18-2007)
§ 36.132  INDIVIDUALS ENGAGED IN MORE THAN ONE OR EMPLOYED IN MORE THAN ONE
POLITICAL SUBDIVISION.
   (A)   The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day
the person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll periods. In the event
a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is, concurrent
employment, or an occupation which requires the person working in more than one
political subdivision during a payroll period, the priority of claim to collect
the local services tax shall be in the following order:
      (1)   First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
      (2)   Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision; and
      (3)   Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person’s home.
   (B)   In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that
calendar year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
(Ord. 1056, passed 12-18-2007)
§ 36.133  NONRESIDENTS SUBJECT TO TAX.
   All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the political subdivision but who perform services of
any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the borough
do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject themselves to the
provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under this subchapter with
the same force and effect as though they were residents of the borough.
Further, any individual engaged in an occupation within the borough and an
employee of a nonresidential employer may, for the purpose of this subchapter,
be considered a self-employed person, and in the event his or her tax is not
paid, the borough shall have the option of proceeding against either the
employer or employee for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 1056, passed 12-18-2007)
§ 36.134  ADMINISTRATION OF TAX.
   (A)   The Collector shall be appointed by resolution of the Borough Council.

tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount received by him or her from
each employer of self-employed person, together with the date the tax was
received.
   (B)   The Collector is hereby charged with the administration and
enforcement of this subchapter and is hereby charged and empowered, subject to

occurred. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Collector shall have the
right to appeal consistent with the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights under Act 50
of 1998.
   (C)   The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return made by
an employer, or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax due. Each employer
is hereby directed and required to give the Collector the means, facilities and
opportunity for such examination.
(Ord. 1056, passed 12-18-2007)

recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this subchapter, together with
interest and penalty.

of 6% on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning with the due date
of the tax and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of such tax for
nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery of this tax or other
appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable therefor shall, in
addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of collection.
(Ord. 1056, passed 12-18-2007)

      (2)   Discharges wastewater which substantially differs in nature or
constituents from the user’s average discharge; and
      (3)   Knows or has reason to know that its discharge, alone or in
conjunction with discharges from other sources, would result in violation of

by permit or by contract with ALCOSAN or by federal, commonwealth, county,
ALCOSAN or the borough laws, ordinances, rules or regulations;
         (b)   Discharges wastewater which substantially differs in nature or
constituents from the user’s average discharge;
         (c)   Knows or has reason to know that its discharge, alone or in
conjunction with discharges from other sources, would result in a permit
violation; and
         (d)   Knows or has reason to know that ALCOSAN is, for any reason,
violating its final effluent limitations in its permit and that such user’s
discharge either alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources,
increases the magnitude or duration of ALCOSAN’s violations.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 72.001  VEHICLES TO BE PARKED WITHIN MARKED SPACES.
   Wherever a space is marked off on any street for the parking of an
individual vehicle, every vehicle parked there shall be parked wholly within
the lines bounding that space, and it shall be a violation of this subchapter
for any person to park a vehicle or allow it to remain parked otherwise.
Penalty, see §
72.999
§ 72.002  RESIDENTIAL PERMIT PARKING.
   (A)   Findings and purpose.
      (1)   The borough finds that:
         (a)   Certain residential areas in the borough are subjected to
commuter vehicle parking, therefore depriving the residents of those areas of
spaces in which to park their own vehicles;
         (b)   Those residential streets are also subjected to a high degree of
commuter traffic which substantially reduces the quality of the ambient air
level;
         (c)   The establishment of a parking permit program for certain
affected areas should facilitate efficient movement of traffic by providing for
parking preference during certain hours of the day and days of the week.
      (2)   Therefore, the borough considers it to be in the interest of the
people of the borough to provide for the establishment of a residential permit
parking program to ensure primary access to available parking spaces by
neighborhood residents and also to provide a cleaner ambient air level.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      COMMUTER VEHICLE. A motor vehicle parked in a residential area by a
person not a resident of that residential area.
      PROPRIETOR. A person who owns or leases real estate within a residential
area of which he or she is not a resident, but who owns or manages a business
enterprise or professional office maintained at that address. For the purpose
of this section, a PROPRIETOR shall be entitled to one parking permit for that
business or professional office address.
      RESIDENT. A person who owns or leases real property within a residential
area and who maintains either a voting residence or bona fide occupancy, or
both, at that address.
      RESIDENTIAL AREA. A contiguous area containing public highways or parts
of public highways primarily abutted by residential property or residential and
nonbusiness property (such as schools, parks, places of worship, hospitals and
nursing homes).
   (C)   Criteria.
      (1)   The residential areas designated in division (D) below are those
deemed impacted and hence eligible for residential parking on the basis of the
following criteria:
         (a)   During any period between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m.,
Monday through Saturday, except legal holidays, the number of vehicles parked
(or standing), legally or illegally, on the streets in the area is equal to 70%
or more of the legal, on-street parking capacity of the area. For the purpose
of this criterion, a legal parking space shall be 20 linear feet; and
         (b)   During the same period as specified in division (C)(1)(a) above,
10% or more of the vehicles parked (or standing) on the streets in the area are
not registered in the name of a person residing in the area. For the purpose of
this criterion, the latest available information from the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation regarding registration of motor vehicles shall be
used.
      (2)   Provided, in determining that a specific area identified as
impacted and eligible for residential permit parking is designated as a
residential permit parking area, the following factors are taken into
consideration:
         (a)   The local and metropolitan needs with respect to clean air and
environment;
         (b)   The possibility of a reduction in total vehicle miles driven in
the borough;
         (c)   The likelihood of alleviating traffic congestion, illegal
parking and related health and safety hazards;
         (d)   The proximity of public transportation to the residential area;
         (e)   The desire and need of the residents for residential permit
parking and their willingness to bear the administrative costs in connection
with it; and
         (f)   The need for parking in excess of the residential permit parking
program in proximity to establishments located in the residential permit
parking area and used by the general public for religious, health or
educational purposes.
   (D)   Designation of residential permit parking areas. Signs shall be
erected along the streets in each residential permit parking area, indicating
the days, hours, locations and conditions under which parking shall be by
permit only.
   (E)   Application for permit. Application for a residential parking permit
shall be made to the Chief of Police by the person desiring the permit, who
shall be only the owner or the driver of a motor vehicle who resides on or is a
proprietor of property immediately adjacent to a street or other location
within a residential parking permit area. A separate application shall be
required for each motor vehicle, and each application shall be accompanied by a
permit fee, in an amount as established by resolution of the borough, which
shall be for the use of the borough, to be applied to the cost of administering
the residential permit parking program. Each application shall contain the
following information: the name of the owner or the driver, as the case may be,
of the motor vehicle; the address of the resident or the proprietor, as the
case may be; the make, model and registration number of the motor vehicle; and
the driver number as taken from the applicant’s current driver’s license. At
the discretion of the Chief of Police, the applicant shall be required, at the
time of making application, to present his or her driver’s license and the
vehicle registration card.
   (F)   Issuance of permit. Upon receipt of the application and the permit
fee, and determination by him or her that the information upon the application
shows that the applicant is entitled to a residential parking permit, the Chief
of Police shall issue to the applicant a residential parking permit, which
shall be valid for the remainder of the calendar year. The permit shall display
the serial and registration numbers of the motor vehicles, the residential
parking area number and the expiration date. The permit shall be renewable
annually before the expiration date, upon making application for renewal and
payment of the permit fee. It shall be unlawful and a violation of this section
for any person to display other than the current and valid permit while
standing or parking in a residential permit parking area at any time when those
permits are to be displayed.
   (G)   Temporary and exemption parking permits. Temporary parking permits may
be issued by the Chief of Police, upon payment of a fee in an amount as
established by resolution of the Borough Council, to bona fide visitors of
residents of a designated residential permit parking area, and exemption
parking permits may be issued, without payment of a fee, to handicapped
persons.
   (H)   Responsibility of permit holder.
      (1)   Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the
holder of a residential parking permit shall be permitted to stand or park a
motor vehicle operated by him or her in any designated residential parking area
during those times when parking of motor vehicles is permitted in that area.
While a vehicle for which a residential parking permit has been issued is so
parked, that permit shall be displayed so as to be clearly visible through the
windshield of the vehicle. A residential parking permit shall not guarantee or
reserve to the holder a parking space within a designated residential permit
parking area.
      (2)   A residential parking permit shall not authorize its holder to
stand or park a motor vehicle in any place where or at any time when stopping,
standing or parking of motor vehicles is prohibited or set aside for other
specified types of vehicles, nor shall the permit exempt its holder from the
observance of any traffic or parking regulation other than residential permit
parking regulation or restriction.
      (3)   No person other than the permit holder whose name appears on the
permit shall use a residential parking permit or display it on a vehicle
operated; any such use or display by a person other than the permit holder
shall constitute a violation of this section by the permit holder and by the
person who so used or displayed the parking permit.
      (4)   It shall constitute a violation of this section for any person
falsely to represent himself or herself as eligible for a residential parking
permit or to furnish false information in an application to the Chief of Police
in order to obtain a residential parking permit.
   (I)   Revocation of permits. The Chief of Police shall have authority to
revoke the residential parking permit of any permit holder found to be in
violation of any provision of this section. Upon written notification to the
present holder of the revocation, the permit holder shall surrender the permit
to the Chief of Police. Failure to do so, when so requested, shall constitute a
violation of this section; provided, any person receiving such a notice may,
within ten days after the date of the notice, appeal to the borough for a
hearing on the revocation, and the decision of the borough shall be final.
Penalty, see §
72.999
§ 72.003  NO PARKING ON BOROUGH STREETS ON STREET CLEANING DAY.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful to park any vehicle on any public highway in the
borough on the day designated by the Street Commissioner for the cleaning of
that particular street or highway.
   (B)   The Street Commissioner is authorized and directed to post permanent
or temporary signs giving notice of the day and time that said street or

Code, 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 6109(a)(22), and gives authority to the borough to remove
and impound those vehicles which are parked in a tow-away zone and in violation
of parking regulations of this chapter. Vehicles which have been abandoned (as
defined by the Vehicle Code) or which are parked in such a manner as to
interfere with traffic or pose a hazard to others may be towed under the
provisions of the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code.
§ 72.071  AUTHORITY TO REMOVE AND IMPOUND.
   The borough shall have authority to remove and impound, or to order the
removal and impounding, of any vehicle parked overtime or otherwise illegally;
provided that the circumstances of its parking were within the conditions
stated in §

strict adherence to the provisions of this subchapter or the provisions of the
Vehicle Code.
§ 72.072  DESIGNATION OF APPROVED STORAGE GARAGES; BONDING; TOWING AND STORAGE.
   Removal and impounding of vehicles under this subchapter shall be done only

borough. Every such garage shall submit evidence to the borough that it is
bonded or has acquired liability insurance in an amount satisfactory to the
borough as sufficient to indemnify owners of impounded vehicles against loss or
damage to those vehicles while in the custody of the garage keeper for the
purpose of towing or storage. The approved storage garage shall submit to the
borough its schedule of charges for towing and storage of vehicles under this
subchapter and, when the schedule is approved by the borough, those charges
shall be adhered to by the approved storage garage; no different schedule of
charges shall be demanded of or collected from any person whose vehicle is
removed or impounded under this subchapter by any approved storage garage. The
borough shall delete from its list of approved storage garages any garage that
makes any unapproved charge in connection with any vehicle removed or impounded
under this subchapter.
§ 72.073  PAYMENT OF TOWING AND STORAGE CHARGES.
   The payment of towing and storage charges shall not relieve the owner or
driver of any vehicle from liability for any fine or penalty for the violation
of the provision of this subchapter for which the vehicle was removed or
impounded.
§ 72.074  RECLAMATION COSTS.
   In order to reclaim his or her vehicle, the owner shall pay towing and
storage costs plus a $50 fee, of which $25 shall be transferred to the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation by the garage to which the vehicle
was taken.
§ 72.075  RECORDS OF VEHICLES REMOVED AND IMPOUNDED.
   The borough shall cause a record to be kept of all vehicles impounded under
this subchapter and shall be able at all reasonable times to furnish the owners
or the agents of the owners of those vehicles with information as to the place
of storage of the vehicle.
§ 72.076  RESTRICTIONS UPON REMOVAL OF VEHICLES.
   No vehicle shall be removed under the authority of this subchapter or the
Vehicle Code if, at the time of the intended removal, the owner or the person
for the time being in charge of the vehicle is present and expresses a
willingness and intention to remove the vehicle immediately.
§ 72.077  REPORTS AND DISPOSITION OF UNCLAIMED VEHICLES.
   If after a period of 15 days the vehicle in storage remains unclaimed, a
report shall be filed with PennDOT in accordance with § 7311 of the Vehicle
Code, 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 7311 by the person having legal custody of the vehicle. If
the vehicle has not been claimed after 30 days, the vehicle may be transferred

structure, and the designated officer shall return the amount of the funds
transferred to the municipality in excess of the estimate to the named insured,

the bottom elevation of the existing pavement.
      (4)   The borough may require the permit holder to have material proposed

LOITERING
§ 130.01  NO LOITERING.
   (A)   A person commits a violation if he or she loiters or prowls in a
place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under
circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the
vicinity.  Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining
whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon
appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or
manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object.  Unless
flight by the person or other circumstances makes it impractical, a police
officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford
the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be
warranted, by requesting the person to identify himself or herself and to
explain his or her presence or conduct.  No person shall be convicted of an
offense under this section if the police officer did not comply with the
preceding sentence, or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the
person was true and, if it had been believed by the police officer at the time,
would have dispelled the alarm.  Any police officer may arrest any person
suspected of being a loiterer or prowler without a warrant if it reasonably
appears that the delay in arresting the suspect caused by obtaining a warrant
would result in the suspect’s escape.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person, after first being warned by a
police officer, or where a “no loitering” sign or signs have been posted, to
loiter, stand, sit, or lie in or upon any public or quasi-public sidewalk,
street, curb, cross-walk, walkway area, mall or that portion of private
property utilized for public use, so as to hinder or obstruct unreasonably the
free passage of pedestrians or vehicles thereon.  It shall be unlawful for any
person to block, obstruct, or prevent free access to the entrance to any
building open to the public.
   (C)   For the purpose of this section, PUBLIC PLACE has the following
definition unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning:  an area generally visible to public view, including streets,
sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots, automobiles
(whether moving or not), and buildings open to the general public, including
those which serve food or drink or provide entertainment, and the doorways and

on any public way, street, thoroughfare, road, avenue or highway or any public
sidewalk between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 4:30 a.m. prevailing time unless
said person is in transit to or from work, school or home or in the company of
a parent or a person in loco parentis. As used in this section, the term IN
TRANSIT shall mean travel from one place to another by a direct route without
stopping except for reasonable and necessary stops that may be required for
safe travel.

      (6)   On the sidewalk abutting the minor’s residence or abutting the
residence of a next-door neighbor if the neighbor did not complain to the
police department  about the minor’s presence;
      (7)   Attending an official school, religious, or other recreational
activity supervised by adults and sponsored by the city, a civic organization,
or another similar entity that takes responsibility for the minor, or going to
or returning home from, without any detour or stop, an official school,
religious, or other recreational activity supervised by adults and sponsored by
the city, a civic organization, or another similar entity that takes
responsibility for the minor;

into between the owner and occupant only if entered into in good faith and not
for the purpose of evading the obligations of the owner or occupant.

to ensure that common areas and the outside premises are in compliance with
borough codes.
   (I)   Eviction. In the event that an occupant(s) of a regulated rental unit
is involved in a third disruptive conduct violation within any three-year
period during which a residential rental license was required, the Code
Enforcement Officer shall provide a written statement to the owner or his or
her manager to order him or her to evict the occupants of the regulated rental
unit. If the disruptive conduct was caused by only one occupant, then the Code
Enforcement Officer shall limit the eviction order to that person. Occupants
shall be responsible to prevent their guests from engaging in disruptive
conduct on the premises. Once an eviction is ordered, those occupant(s) shall
not be permitted to occupy any area on the same lot for a minimum period of two
years. In addition, once an eviction is ordered, those occupant(s) shall not be
permitted to occupy any dwelling unit or boarding/rooming house unit that is
owned by the same person or entity within the borough for a minimum period of
two years. The owner shall begin eviction proceedings within 15 days after
receiving such statement and shall continue such proceedings to completion,
without interruption, unless the occupants vacate the premises.
      (1)   Failure of an owner to carry out an order to evict occupants shall
result in suspension or revocation of the residential rental license and shall
be a violation of this subchapter.
      (2)   This subchapter shall not limit the ability of an owner to evict
tenants in compliance with state law for reasons other than violations of this
subchapter.
      (3)   A requirement to evict occupants shall not apply if a successful
appeal is made to the Property Maintenance Board of Appeals, or if the district
magistrate rules in the occupant’s favor during eviction proceedings that have
been prosecuted by the landlord in good faith, or where a court appeal or other
legal action has been filed that would lawfully prevent eviction.
      (4)   The Code Enforcement Officer shall maintain a list of occupants who
were ordered to be evicted and the affected addresses. Such list shall be
maintained for a minimum of three years and shall be available for public
review.
   (J)   Code violations. Upon receiving notice of any code violations from the
Code Enforcement Officer, the owner shall take necessary action, or cause such
action to be taken, to eliminate the violation within the time limit provided
on the notice or citation.
   (K)   Borough can make repairs.
      (1)   In case the owner of premises shall neglect, fail or refuse to
comply with any notice from the borough or its Code Enforcement Officer to
correct a violation relating to maintenance and repair of the premises under
any code within the period of time stated in such notice, the borough may cause
the violation to be corrected. There shall be imposed upon the owner a charge
of the actual costs involved, plus 25% of said costs or $50 whichever is
greater, for each time the borough shall cause a violation to be corrected. The
owner of the premises shall be billed after such work has been completed. The
owner shall be personally liable for any such bill which remains unpaid and
outstanding after the time specified therein for payment shall be grounds for
the imposition of interest, together with interest at the legal rate, attorney
fees and court costs.
      (2)   The remedies provided by this division (K) are not exclusive and
the borough and its Code Enforcement Officer may invoke such other remedies
available under this subchapter or other applicable codes, ordinances or
statutes, including where appropriate, condemnation proceedings or declaration
of premises as unfit for habitation; or suspension, revocation or non-renewal
of the residential rental license.
   (L)   Inspections by Code Enforcement Officer. The owner or manager shall
allow and schedule inspections by a Code Enforcement Officer of the premises
during borough business hours, after a minimum of seven calendar days’ notice
have been provided to the owner or manager. The owner or manager shall provide
a minimum of three calendar days’ advance notice to at least one adult occupant
of each rental unit of the time and date of the inspection. These advance
notice requirements shall not apply when the Code Enforcement Officer has
reason to believe that a imminent threat to public health and safety may exist.

illegal sale or distribution of controlled substances under the Controlled
Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act (35 P.S. §§ 780-101 et seq.), or their

conduct, as defined in §
150.61. The information provided in this report shall include, if possible, the
identity or identities of the alleged perpetrator(s) of the disruptive conduct
and the factual basis for the disruptive conduct.
      (3)   When a police officer issues a disruptive conduct report concerning
a regulated rental unit, a copy shall be provided by the police to the Code
Enforcement Officer, who shall maintain records of such reports. The Code
Enforcement Officer shall mail a copy of the disruptive conduct report to an
occupant and the owner or manager after his or her receipt of the report.
      (4)   A criminal or civil citation is not required in order for a
disruptive conduct report to be issued.
      (5)   If a citation is issued and successfully prosecuted or a guilty
plea entered before a district justice, such citation may automatically be
considered a disruptive conduct report. However, if an appeal of a citation is
filed from a decision of a district justice, the matter shall not be deemed to
constitute disruptive conduct unless a finding of guilty is affirmed by a final
decision on appeal.
   (E)   Damage to premises. The occupant shall not intentionally cause, nor
permit nor tolerate others to cause, damage to the premises. Conduct which
results in damages in excess of $500 shall be considered disruptive conduct

         (e)   One dwelling unit that is on the same lot as a second dwelling

      (3)   Housing authority. Dwelling units that are owned by the housing
authority of the county shall be exempted from the requirements of this
subchapter for a regularly scheduled borough inspection and for payment of a
rental housing licensing fee if the Borough Codes Enforcement Administrator
annually determines in writing that the housing authority’s inspection program
is sufficient for serving the purposes of this subchapter. Dwellings owned by
the housing authority shall be required to comply with requirements of this
subchapter concerning evictions, disruptive conduct reports or and other
provisions of this subchapter, unless such provision is specifically preempted
by federal law.
      (4)   Form. The application for the license shall use a form provided by
the borough.
      (5)   Owner or manager duties. The owner or manager shall:

         (c)   Notify the borough in writing of any changes in the number or
names of occupants age 18 or older within 30 days after a change.
   (B)   Licenses and fees.
      (1)   Each residential rental license shall have an annual term and each
regulated rental unit shall be subject to not more than one inspection every
year, based upon a schedule established by the Code Enforcement Officer in
consultation with the Borough Manager. The borough is not obligated to complete
all inspections within this schedule if the borough, through no fault of the
owner, manager or tenant, was not able to complete an inspection in a regulated
rental unit.
      (2)   The following time extensions shall apply for the requirements to
have a rental unit inspection, unless there is evidence of a possible code
violation on the property. These time extensions shall only apply if the
property has not been subject of any code enforcement actions (other than items
that were satisfactorily corrected within 30 days), and has no outstanding
taxes, fines or fees due to the borough or a borough authority.
         (a)   If an owner or manager provides evidence that a rental unit has
been occupied by the same occupants for the last three years, then a Code
Enforcement Officer may allow an inspection to be delayed to once every three
years.
         (b)   If a regulated rental unit was inspected by the borough for code
compliance within the previous one year, then an inspection under this
subchapter may be delayed to result in a minimum of one year until the next
inspection.
      (3)   Upon application for a license and prior to issuance or renewal
thereof, each applicant shall pay to the borough an annual license and
inspection fee.
         (a)   The annual fee for a residential rental unit shall be $40
dollars per dwelling unit, $20 per each rooming house unit and $10 for each
sleeping room in a fraternity or sorority. The fee for a calendar year shall be
paid by June 1 of each year. If the annual fee is not paid by June 1, an
additional fee of $20 shall apply for each subsequent month. This fee is
intended to cover the borough’s actual costs for administering the program and
for inspections and related vehicle, office, administrative and overhead
expenses.
         (b)   If a second inspection is needed for a dwelling unit or rooming
house unit because the unit was found to be in violation of borough codes
during the initial inspection, then an additional fee of $25 shall apply. For
each subsequent inspection that is needed in any within year period from the
date of the last inspection, an additional fee of $75 shall apply.
         (c)   The fee to reinstate a revoked residential rental license shall
be $100 per dwelling unit or $100 per rooming house building.
         (d)   The fees provided in this subchapter may be revised by written
resolution of Borough Council.
         (e)   A residential rental license shall not be issued or renewed if
the owner has not paid any fines and costs arising from enforcement of this
subchapter or any codes of the borough relating to land use and/or code
enforcement or if any licensing fees under this subchapter are past due to the
borough.
         (f)   If a second or subsequent inspection is needed for a dwelling
unit or rooming house unit because the Code Enforcement Officer was not able to
enter the unit at the time that had been scheduled with the owner or manager,
then an additional fee of $50 shall apply.
      (4)   A license or inspection by itself shall not warrant that a rental
unit is lawful, safe, habitable or in compliance with all borough codes.
   (C)   Inspection.
      (1)   Each regulated rental unit shall be subject to inspection by the
Code Enforcement Officer or another duly authorized agent of the borough under
the schedule outlined in this subchapter.
      (2)   Borough Code Enforcement Officers are the officials authorized to
enforce this subchapter and to take appropriate measures to abate violations
hereof, for and on behalf of the borough.
      (3)   This subchapter shall not be construed as to limit the Code
Enforcement Officer’s authority to conduct inspections or enforcement actions
under other borough codes or to require that a property be made available for
inspection whenever there is probable cause that a violation of borough codes
may be present.
      (4)   To minimize disruption to occupants, owners and managers are
encouraged to ask to attempt to schedule inspections during times when a rental
unit is unoccupied between tenants.
   (D)   Warrant. Within the limitations of federal and state law, a Code
Enforcement Officer may apply to a district justice having jurisdiction for an
administrative search warrant to enter and inspect a regulated rental unit and
the premises. Such warrant is only required where access to a regulated rental
unit or common areas is denied to the Code Enforcement Officer after a request.

      (1)   Notice of violations. A Code Enforcement Officer shall provide
written notification of violations of borough codes and require that they be
corrected within a reasonable maximum time period that the Code Enforcement
Officer establishes in the enforcement notice.
         (a)   A Code Enforcement Officer may determine that the rental unit is
unfit for human habitation, in which case it shall be vacated and remain
vacated until such situation is corrected.
         (b)   For serious violations that do not require the property to be
immediately vacated, a Code Enforcement Officer may require that the violations
be corrected within 24 hours, or another time period stated on the notice or
citation.
      (2)   Non-renewal. A Code Enforcement Officer shall delay or deny the
renewal of a residential rental license if there are outstanding violations of
borough codes for that rental unit that have not been corrected at the time of
license renewal. If the violations are not a threat to safety of occupants or
other members of the public, a Code Enforcement Officer shall permit the
current occupants to continue to reside in the premises for a reasonable period
of time established by a Code Enforcement Officer in the notice of non-renewal,
with the time limit removed when the violations of borough codes are corrected.
A Code Enforcement Officer may issue a temporary license that is conditioned
upon certain actions being taken within a maximum time period.
      (3)   Revocation. The immediate revocation of the license to rent a
regulated rental unit shall occur if a Code Enforcement Officer determines that
violations of borough codes present a threat to the safety of occupants or
other members of the public. Such revocation shall occur until violations of
borough codes are corrected and the property has been re-inspected. Upon
revocation, the owner shall take immediate steps to evict the occupants and/or
to locate alternative housing for the occupants.
      (4)   Suspension. A Code Enforcement Officer may suspend the license to
rent a regulated rental unit if violations of borough codes have not been
corrected within a time limit established by a Code Enforcement Officer. Such
suspension shall continue until such time as a violation(s) of borough codes is
corrected.
         (a)   If the violations are not a threat to safety of occupants or
other members of the public, a Code Enforcement Officer shall permit the
current occupants to continue to reside in the premises for a reasonable period
of time established by a Code Enforcement Officer in the notice of suspension.
         (b)   A Code Enforcement Officer may suspend the license to rent a
regulated rental unit if the owner or his or her designated manager are not
available or do not respond to contacts by a Code Enforcement Officer, or if
the name and contact information for the owner or manager are no longer valid,
or if the manager no longer represents the owner.
      (5)   Reinstatement. A residential rental license shall be reinstated if
the owner of a regulated rental unit corrects the reason for the revocation of
the residential rental license and has paid the residential rental license
reinstatement fee.
   (C)   Criteria for applying sanctions. The Code Enforcement Officer, when
deciding upon the sanctions provided in division (B) above, shall consider the
following:
      (1)   The effect of the violation on the health and safety of occupants
of the regulated rental unit, other residents of the premises and neighboring
residents;
      (2)   Whether the owner has prior violations of this code and whether
those violations were satisfactorily corrected in a timely manner;
      (3)   The effect of sanctions upon the occupants, particularly when the
occupants did not cause the violation; and
      (4)   The actions taken by the owner to remedy the violation and to
prevent future violations, including any written plan submitted by the owner
and good faith efforts of the owner to bring the property into compliance.
   (D)   Reasonable conditions. In addition to enforcing sanctions set forth
above, a Code Enforcement Officer may establish reasonable conditions upon a
residential rental license that will fulfill the purposes of this subchapter.
   (E)   Grounds for imposing sanctions. Any of the following may subject an
owner to sanctions as provided for in this subchapter:

subchapter by occupants of regulated rental units as required by this
subchapter; and
      (4)   Failure to evict occupants after having been directed to do so by a
Code Enforcement Officer as provided for in this subchapter.
   (F)   Procedure for non-renewal, suspension or revocation of license.
Following a determination that grounds for non-renewal, suspension or
revocation of a license exist, a Code Enforcement Officer shall notify the
owner or manager of the action to be taken and the reason therefor. Such
notification shall be in writing, addressed to the owner or manager in
question, and shall contain the following information:
      (1)   The address of the premises in question and identification of the
affected regulated rental unit(s);
      (2)   A description of the violation which has been found to exist;

appeals of enforcement matters under the Borough Existing Structures Code. The
appeal provisions in such Code are hereby included by reference.

staggered three-year terms, with at least one term ending each year.
         (a)   A minimum of two votes shall be needed for any action by the
Board, such as to delete a disruptive conduct report or to halt an order for
eviction. A one to one vote shall be considered to have been no action, in
which case the determination of the Code Enforcement Officer shall stand.
         (b)   Two alternate members of the Property Maintenance Board of
Appeals may also be appointed by the Borough Council, who may be named by the
Chairperson of the Board to serve when regular members are unable to serve.

and non-renewals shall be sent to the owner, and manager if applicable, by
certified mail.
      (1)   In the event that the notice is returned by the postal authorities
marked “unclaimed” or “refused”, then the Code Enforcement Officer shall
attempt delivery by personal service on the owner or manager if applicable. The
Code Enforcement Officer shall also post the notice at a conspicuous place on
the premises.
      (2)   The borough shall not be responsible for failing to provide notice
where the owner has not provided an up-to-date name and address for the owner
or the manager for the rental unit.
      (3)   For purposes of this subchapter, any notice required hereunder to
be given to a Manager shall be deemed as notice given to the owner.
      (4)   There shall be a presumption that any notice required to be given
to the owner under this subchapter shall have been received by such owner if
the notice was given to the owner in the manner provided by this subchapter.
      (5)   A claimed lack of knowledge by the owner of any violation hereunder
cited shall not be a defense to rental license non-renewal, suspension or
revocation or an eviction order as long as all required notices involving such
proceedings have been sent to the last known address of the owner.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.001  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The legislature of the commonwealth has, by the passage of the Pennsylvania
Floodplain Management Act of 1978 (32 P.S. §§ 679.101 et seq.), delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Borough Council does hereby order as follows.
(Ord. 1090, passed 9-16-2014)
§ 151.002  INTENT.
   The intent of this chapter is to:
   (A)   Promote the general health, welfare and safety of the community;
   (B)   Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in
order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future;
   (C)   Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage;
   (D)   Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units and its residents by preventing excessive development in areas subject to
flooding; and
   (E)   Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
(Ord. 1090, passed 9-16-2014)
§ 151.003  APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or
corporation to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or
development anywhere within the borough unless a permit has been obtained from
the Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing buildings
or structures.
(Ord. 1090, passed 9-16-2014)  Penalty, see §
151.999
§ 151.004  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in
effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance provisions
shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those provisions are
more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of
this chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
(Ord. 1090, passed 9-16-2014)
§ 151.005  SEVERABILITY.
   If any section, division, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this
chapter shall be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such a decision
shall not affect the remaining portions of the chapter, which shall remain in
full force and effect, and for this purpose the provisions of this chapter are
hereby declared to be severable.
(Ord. 1090, passed 9-16-2014)
§ 151.006  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   (A)   The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this
chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
accepted engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights
may be increased by human-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge
openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that areas outside
any identified floodplain areas, or that land uses permitted within such areas
will be free from flooding or flood damages.
   (B)   This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the borough or
any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance
on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 1090, passed 9-16-2014)
§ 151.007  ENACTMENT.
   This chapter shall be effective on September 26, 2014 and shall remain in
force until modified, amended or rescinded by borough.
(Ord. 1090, passed 9-16-2014)

IDENTIFICATION OF FLOODPLAIN AREAS
§ 151.045  IDENTIFICATION.
   The identified floodplain area shall be:
   (A)   Any areas of borough, classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs)
in the flood insurance study (FIS) and the accompanying flood insurance rate
maps (FIRMs) dated September 26, 2014 and issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof, including all
digital data developed as part of the flood insurance study; and
   (B)   The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and
amendments, are hereby adopted by borough and declared to be a part of this
chapter.
(Ord. 1090, passed 9-16-2014)
§ 151.046  DESCRIPTION AND SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF IDENTIFIED FLOODPLAIN AREAS.
   The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific
areas.
   (A)   The floodway area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without increasing the water surface elevation by more than one foot at any
point. This term shall also include floodway areas which have been identified
in other available studies or sources of information for those special flood
hazard areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
      (1)   Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements or other development shall be permitted
unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed
encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      (2)   Within any floodway area, no new construction or development shall
be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the Department of
Environmental Protection Regional Office.
   (B)   (1)   The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE
Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided.
      (2)   The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for
which base flood elevations have been provided and a floodway has been
delineated.
   (C)   (1)   The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone
on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base flood
elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and floodway
information from other federal, state or other acceptable sources shall be used
when available. Where other acceptable information is not available, the base
flood elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on the
boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction
site.
      (2)   In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional
engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the
technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
Studies, analyses, computations and the like shall be submitted in sufficient
detail to allow a thorough technical review by the municipality.
(Ord. 1090, passed 9-16-2014)
§ 151.047  CHANGES IN IDENTIFICATION OF AREA.
   The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Borough
Council where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person
documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such change to the
special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from FEMA. Additionally,
as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such
information becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA of the changes to
the special flood hazard area by submitting technical or scientific data. See §
151.060(B) for situations where FEMA notification is required.
(Ord. 1090, passed 9-16-2014)
§ 151.048  BOUNDARY DISPUTES.
   Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the borough and any party aggrieved by
this decision or determination may appeal to the Borough Council. The burden of
proof shall be on the appellant.
(Ord. 1090, passed 9-16-2014)
§ 151.049  JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARY CHANGES.
   Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other corporate
boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community shall review
flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary changes. The
community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in areas subject to
annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or exceed those in 44
C.F.R. § 60.3.
(Ord. 1090, passed 9-16-2014)
TECHNICAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.060  GENERAL.
   (A)   Alteration or relocation of watercourse.
      (1)   No encroachment, alteration or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse until all adjacent municipalities which may be affected
by such action have been notified by the municipality, and until all required
permits or approvals have first been obtained from the Department of
Environmental Protection Regional Office.
      (2)   No encroachment, alteration or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse unless it can be shown that the activity will not
reduce or impede the flood carrying capacity of the watercourse in any way.
      (3)   In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community and
Economic Development, shall be notified prior to any alteration or relocation
of any watercourse.
   (B)   Encroachments. When a community proposes to permit the following
encroachments: any development that causes a rise in the base flood elevations

occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or
other improvement of a structure, of which the cost equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial
damage” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local Code Enforcement Official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
   UNIFORM CONSTRUCTION CODE (UCC). The statewide building code adopted by the
Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1999 applicable to new construction in all
municipalities whether administered by the municipality, a third party or the
Department of Labor and Industry. Applicable to residential and commercial
buildings, the Code adopted the International Residential Code (IRC) and the
International Building Code (IBC), by reference, as the construction standard
applicable with the state floodplain construction. For coordination purposes,
references to the above are made specifically to various sections of the IRC
and the IBC.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain
management regulation.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully

§ 153.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Purpose. These regulations are adopted and implemented to achieve the
following general purposes and objectives:
      (1)   To manage and control stormwater runoff resulting from land
alteration and disturbance activities in accordance with the watershed
stormwater management plans adopted pursuant to the Pennsylvania Stormwater
Management Act (Act 167 of 1978, as amended), being 32 P.S. §§ 680.1 et seq.;
      (2)   To utilize and preserve the desirable existing natural drainage
systems and to preserve the flood-carrying capacity of streams;
      (3)   To encourage natural infiltration of rainfall to preserve
groundwater supplies and stream flows; and
      (4)   To provide for adequate maintenance of all permanent stormwater
management structures in the borough.
   (B)   Applicability. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all
subdivisions and land development activity within the borough.
   (C)   Liability disclaimer.
      (1)   Neither the granting of any approval under the stormwater
management provisions of this chapter, nor the compliance with the provisions
of this chapter, or with any condition imposed by a borough official hereunder,
shall relieve any person from any responsibility for damage to persons or
property resulting therefrom, or as otherwise imposed by law, nor impose any
liability upon the borough for damages to persons or property.
      (2)   The granting of a permit which includes any stormwater management
facilities shall not constitute a representation, guarantee or warranty of any
kind by the borough, or by an official or employee thereof, of the
practicability or safety of any structure, use or other plan proposed, and
shall create no liability upon or cause of action against such public body,
official or employee for any damage that may result pursuant thereto.
(Ord. 980, passed 3-16-1993; Ord. 991, passed 2-21-1995)
§ 153.02  STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (A)   Stormwater management performance districts.
      (1)   For purposes of stormwater management, the borough is divided into
the following stormwater management districts:
 
District A 50% runoff  Turtle Creek Watershed
District B 100% runoff Turtle Creek Watershed
 
      (2)   The location and boundaries of the watershed(s) and subareas are
shown on the borough stormwater management district map which is hereby adopted
as a part of this section.
   (B)   General standards.
      (1)   The following provisions shall be considered the overriding
performance standards against which all proposed stormwater control measures
shall be evaluated and shall apply throughout the borough.
         (a)   Any landowner and any person engaged in the alteration or
development of land which may affect stormwater runoff characteristics shall
implement such measures as are reasonably necessary to prevent injury to
health, safety or other property. Such measures shall include such actions as
are required:
            1.   To assure that the maximum rate of stormwater runoff is no
greater after development than prior to development activities; and
            2.   To manage the quantity, velocity and direction of resulting
stormwater runoff in a manner which otherwise adequately protects health and
property from possible injury.
      (2)   The stormwater management plan for the development site must
consider all the stormwater runoff flowing over the site.
      (3)   No discharge of toxic materials shall be permitted into any
stormwater management system.
   (C)   Watershed standards; Turtle Creek Stormwater Management District.
      (1)   Standards. The stormwater performance standards contained in this
section are intended to implement the standards and criteria contained in the
Turtle Creek stormwater management plan, adopted and approved in accordance
with the Pennsylvania Stormwater Management Act (32 P.S. §§ 680.1 et seq.) If
there is any discrepancy between the provisions of this section and the
standards and criteria of the plan, or if the watershed plan is subsequently
amended, then the standards/criteria of the current watershed plan shall
govern.
      (2)   Storm frequencies. Stormwater management facilities on all
development sites shall control the peak stormwater discharge for the two-,
ten-, 25- and 100-year storm frequencies. The SCS 24-hour, Type II Rainfall
Distribution shall be used for analyzing stormwater runoff for both pre- and
post-development conditions. The 24-hour total rainfall for these storm
frequencies in the watershed are:
 
Storm Frequency Rainfall Depth (inches)
2-year          2.50
10-year         3.61
25-year         4.31
100-year        5.71
 
      (3)   Calculation methods.
         (a)   Development sites. For the purpose of computing peak flow rates
and runoff hydrographs from development sites, calculations shall be performed
using one of the following: SCS publications; Technical Release (TR) 55 or 20;
EEC I; or Penn State Runoff Model.
         (b)   Stormwater collection/conveyance facilities. For the purposes of
designing storm sewers, open swales and other stormwater runoff collection and
conveyance facilities, any of the above listed calculation methods or the
Rational Method may be used. Rainfall intensities for design should be obtained
from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation rainfall charts.
         (c)   Pre-development conditions. Pre-development conditions shall be
assumed to be those which exist on any site at the time of adoption of the
Turtle Creek stormwater management plan. Hydrologic conditions for all areas
with pervious cover (i.e., fields, woods, lawn areas, pastures, cropland and
the like) shall be assumed to be in “good” condition, and the lowest
recommended SCS runoff curve number (CN) shall be applied for all pervious land
uses within the respective range for each land use and hydrologic soil group.
         (d)   Routing of hydrographs. Routing of hydrographs through
detention/retention facilities for the purpose of design those facilities shall
be accomplished using the Modified-Puls Method or recognized reservoir routing
method subject to the approval of the borough and county.
      (4)   Release rate percentage.
         (a)   Definition. The RELEASE RATE PERCENTAGE defines the percentage
of the pre-development peak rate of runoff that can be discharged from an
outfall on the site after development. It applies uniformly to all land
development or alterations within a subarea. A listing of the release rate
percentage by subarea appears in Appendix A of this chapter; the subareas are
delineated on the borough stormwater management district map.
         (b)   Procedure for use.
            1.   Identify the specific subarea in which the development site is
located from the watershed map and obtain the subarea release rate percentage
from Appendix A;
            2.   Compute the pre- and post-development runoff hydrographs for
each stormwater outfall on the development site using an acceptable calculation
method for the two-, ten-, 25- and 100-year storms. Apply no on-site detention
for stormwater management but include any techniques to minimize impervious
surfaces and/or increase the time of concentration for stormwater runoff
flowing from the development site. If the post-development peak runoff rate and
the runoff volume are less than or equal to the predevelopment peak runoff rate
and volume, then additional stormwater control shall not be required at that
outfall. If the post-development peak runoff rate and volume are greater than
the pre-development peak runoff rate and volume, then stormwater detention will
be required and the capacity of the detention facility must be calculated in
the manner prescribed below;
            3.   Multiply the subarea release rate percentage by the pre-
development rate of runoff from the development site to determine the maximum
allowable release rate from any detention facility for the four prescribed
storm events; and
            4.   Design the outlet control facilities and size the volume of
the detention facility using the calculated post development hydrograph and
accepted hydrograph routing procedures in consideration of the maximum
allowable release rate.
      (5)   No harm evaluation.
         (a)   An applicant may seek to exceed the otherwise applicable subarea
release rate percentage by performing the “no harm evaluation”. This evaluation
requires an independent engineering analysis to demonstrate that other
reasonable options exist to prevent the occurrence of increased stormwater
runoff discharge rates and/or velocities or that measures can be provided to
prevent increased stormwater discharge rates and/or velocities from increasing
flood elevations and accelerating erosion at all downstream points in the
watershed.
         (b)   A “no harm evaluation” will be considered only in instances
where the discharge to a stream channel from the development occurs directly to
the Monongahela River, channelized portion of Turtle Creek, or through a
properly sized and designed regional stormwater detention facility.
         (c)   The analysis for the “no harm evaluation” shall be submitted to
the Borough Engineer and County Planning Department (Westmoreland Conservation
District) for review and approval.
         (d)   The “no harm evaluation” shall be prepared by a registered
engineer who is experienced in hydrology and hydraulics. The “no harm
evaluation” shall be completed using the following procedure: the Penn State
Runoff Model (PSRM) is the hydrologic model required in this procedure. Use of
this model would produce results from a “no harm evaluation” analysis that
could be compared to the results of the watershed study.
               1.   Develop the runoff hydrograph(s) for the design storms of
the site and areas tributary to it using the PSRM and the Turtle Creek
Watershed Stormwater Management Plan land use of the development for both pre-
development and post-development conditions;
               2.   Develop the runoff hydrograph(s) for the proposed site
using the PSRM. If no management or controls are proposed, this would be
equivalent to the runoff hydrograph under post-development conditions. If some
management or controls are proposed, then the runoff hydrograph under post-
development conditions would be modified to reflect their effect on the rate,
volume and timing of discharges;
               3.   Subtract the runoff hydrograph ordinates under pre-
development conditions (division (C)(5)(d)1. above) from the discharge
hydrograph ordinates (division (C)(5)(d)2. above), maintaining the time scales
of both hydrographs for one-to-one correspondence;
               4.   Obtain the PSRM for existing conditions for the Monongahela
Watershed from the county;
               5.   Locate the subbasin(s) in which the proposed development is
located and into which the discharge hydrograph enters. If more than one
subbasin receives this incremental flow, divide the flow accordingly;
               6.   Add the incremental increase computed in division (C)(5)
(d)3. above to the runoff hydrograph for the subbasin(s) identified in division
(C)(5)(d)5. above;
               7.   Route the adjusted runoff hydrograph through the
Monongahela Watershed PSRM and note any increase in peak flows which would
occur in downstream subbasins. If no increase is noted, then the “no harm
evaluation” has been demonstrated. If no increase is observed in peak flows,
the increased potential for erosion and/or sedimentation in downstream channels
resulting from any change in the flood hydrograph predicted by the model shall
be evaluated. If no increased potential can be demonstrated by appropriate
technical means, then the “no harm evaluation” exemption may be requested; and
               8.   If an increase if peak flow is observed in any of the
downstream subbasins or increased potential for erosion and/or sedimentation is
indicated, the “no harm evaluation” exemption shall not be granted.

§ 153.03  DESIGN CRITERIA FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT CONTROLS.
   (A)   General criteria.
      (1)   Applicants may select runoff control techniques, or a combination
of techniques, which are most suitable to control stormwater runoff from the
development site. All controls must be subject to approval of the Borough
Engineer. The Borough Engineer may request specific information on design and/
or operating features of the proposed stormwater controls in order to determine
their suitability and adequacy in terms of the standards of this chapter.
      (2)   The applicant should consider the effect of the proposed stormwater
management techniques on any special soil conditions or geological hazards
which may exist on the development site. In the event such conditions are
identified on the site, the Borough Engineer may require in-depth studies by a
competent geotechnical engineer. Not all stormwater control methods may be
advisable or allowable at a particular development site.
      (3)   The stormwater management practices to be used in developing a
stormwater management plan for a particular site shall be selected according to
the following order of preference:
         (a)   Infiltration of runoff on-site;
         (b)   Flow attenuation by use of open vegetated swales and natural
depressions; and
         (c)   Stormwater detention/retention structures.
      (4)   Infiltration practices shall be used to the extent practicable to
reduce volume increases and promote groundwater recharge. A combination of
successive practices may be used to achieve the applicable minimum control
requirements. Justification shall be provided by the applicant for rejecting
each of the preferred practices based on actual site conditions.
   (B)   Criteria for infiltration systems.
      (1)   Infiltration systems shall be sized and designed based upon local
soil and ground water conditions.
      (2)   Infiltration systems shall be greater than three feet deep and
shall be located at least ten feet from basement walls.
      (3)   Infiltration systems shall not be used to handle runoff from
commercial or industrial working or parking areas. This prohibition does not
extent to roof areas which are demonstrated to be suitably protected from the
effects of the commercial/industrial activities.
      (4)   Infiltration systems may not receive runoff until the entire
drainage area to the system has received final stabilization.
      (5)   The stormwater infiltration facility design shall provide an
overflow system with measures to provide a non-erosive velocity of flow along
its length and at the outfall.
   (C)   Criteria for stormwater detention facilities.
      (1)   If detention facilities are utilized for the development site, the
facility(ies) shall be designed such that post-development peak runoff rates
from the developed site are controlled to those rates defined by the subarea
release rate percentage for the two-, ten-, 25- and 100-year storm frequencies.
      (2)   All detention facilities shall be equipped with outlet structures
to provide discharge control for the four designated storm frequencies.
Provisions shall also be made to safely pass, at minimum, the post-development
100-year storm runoff without breaching or otherwise damaging (i.e., impairing
the continued function of) the facilities.
      (3)   Shared-storage facilities, which provide detention of runoff for
more than one development site within a single subarea maybe considered and are
encouraged. Such facilities shall meet the criteria contained in this section.
In addition, runoff from the development sites involved shall be conveyed to
the facility in a manner that avoids adverse impacts (such as flooding or
erosion) to channels and properties located between the development site and
the shared-storage facilities.
      (4)   Where detention facilities will be utilized, multiple use
facilities, such as wetlands, lakes, ballfields or similar recreational/open
space uses are encouraged wherever feasible, subject to the approval of the
borough and 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105 regulations.
      (5)   Other considerations which should be incorporated into the design
of the detention facilities include:
         (a)   Inflow and outflow structures shall be designed and installed to
prevent erosion and bottoms of impoundment type structures should be protected
from soil erosion;
         (b)   Control and removal of debris both in the storage structure and
in all inlet or outlet devices shall be a design consideration;
         (c)   Inflow and outflow structures, pumping stations and other
structures shall be designed and protected to minimize safety hazards;
         (d)   The water depth at the perimeter of a storage pond should be
limited to that which is safe for children. This is especially necessary if
bank slopes are steep or if ponds are full and recirculating in dry periods.
Restriction of access (fence, walls and the like) may be necessary depending on
the location of the facility;
         (e)   Side slope of storage ponds shall not exceed a ratio of two and
one-half to one horizontal to vertical dimension;
         (f)   Landscaping shall be provided for the facility which harmonizes
with the surrounding area; and
         (g)   Facility shall be located to facilitate maintenance, considering
the frequency and type of equipment that will be required.

around the structure in order to prevent any potential flooding damage.
         (b)   Lots located on the high side of streets shall extend roof and
french drains to the curb line storm sewer (if applicable). Low side lots shall
extend roof and french drains to a stormwater collection/conveyance control
system or natural watercourse in accordance with the approved stormwater
management plan for the development site.
         (c)   Collection/conveyance facilities should not be installed
parallel and close to the top or bottom of a major embankment to avoid the
possibility of failing or causing the embankment to fail.
         (d)   All collection/conveyance facilities shall be designed to convey
the 25-year storm peak flow rate from the contributing drainage area and to
carry it to the nearest suitable outlet such as a stormwater control facility,
curbed street, storm sewer or natural watercourse.
         (e)   Where drainage swales or open channels are used, they shall be
suitably lined to prevent erosion and designed to avoid excessive velocities.
      (2)   Wherever storm sewers are proposed to be utilized, they shall
comply with the following criteria:
         (a)   Where practical, designed to traverse under seeded and planted
areas. If constructed within ten feet of road paving, walks or other surfaced
areas, drains shall have a narrow trench and maximum compaction of backfill to
prevent settlement of the superimposed surface or development;

§ 153.05  MAINTENANCE OF STORMWATER MANAGEMENT CONTROLS.
   (A)   Maintenance responsibilities.
      (1)   The stormwater management plan for the development site shall
contain an operation and maintenance plan prepared by the developer and
approved by the Borough Engineer. The operation and maintenance plan shall
outline required routine maintenance actions and schedules necessary to ensure
proper operation of the facility(ies).
      (2)   The stormwater management plan for the development site shall
establish responsibilities for the continuing operation and maintenance of all
proposed stormwater control facilities, consistent with the following
principals.
         (a)   If a development consists of structures or lots which are to be
separately owned and in which streets, sewers and other public improvements are
to be dedicated to the borough, stormwater control facilities should also be
dedicated to and maintained by the borough.
         (b)   If a development site is to be maintained in single ownership or
if sewers and other public improvements are to be privately owned and
maintained, then the ownership and maintenance of stormwater control facilities
should be the responsibility of the owner or private management entity.
      (3)   The Borough Council, upon recommendation of the Borough Engineer,
shall make the final determination on the continuing maintenance
responsibilities prior to final approval of the stormwater management plan. The
Borough Council reserves the right to accept the ownership and operating
responsibility for any or all of the stormwater management controls.
   (B)   Maintenance agreement for privately owned stormwater facilities.
      (1)   Prior to final approval of the site’s stormwater management plan
the property owner shall sign and record a maintenance agreement covering all
stormwater control facilities which are to be privately owned. The agreement
shall stipulate that:
         (a)   The owner shall maintain all facilities in accordance with the
approved maintenance schedule and shall keep all facilities in a safe and
attractive manner;
         (b)   The owner shall convey to the borough easements and/or rights-
of-way to assure access for periodic inspections by the borough and maintenance
if required;
         (c)   The owner shall keep on file with the borough the name, address
and telephone number of the person or company responsible for maintenance
activities; in the event of a change, new information will be submitted to the
borough within ten days of the change; and
         (d)   If the owner fails to maintain the stormwater control facilities
following due notice by the borough to correct the problem(s), the borough may
perform the necessary maintenance work or corrective work and the owner shall
reimburse the borough for all costs.
      (2)   Other items may be included in the agreement where determined
necessary to guarantee the satisfactory maintenance of all facilities. The
maintenance agreement shall be subject to the review and approval of the
Borough Solicitor and Borough Council.

§ 153.06  STORMWATER PLAN REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   General requirements. No final subdivision/land development plan shall
be approved, no permit authorizing construction issued, or any earthmoving or
land disturbance activity initiated until the final stormwater management plan
for the development site is approved in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter.
   (B)   Exemptions for small developments.
      (1)   At the time of application, the borough shall determine if the
subdivision/land development qualifies as a small development and, therefore,
is eligible for a simplified stormwater plan submission. For the purposes of
this chapter, a SMALL DEVELOPMENT is any subdivision or land development which
results (or will result when fully constructed) in the creation of 5,000 or
less square feet of impervious area and one acre or less of any land cover
change.
      (2)   Applications for small developments shall include a plan which
describes the type and location of proposed on-site stormwater management
techniques or the proposed connection to an existing storm sewer system. The
plan should show accurately site boundaries, two-foot interval contours,
locations of watershed and/or subarea boundaries on the site (if applicable)
and any watercourses, floodplains or existing drainage facilities or structures
located on the site. Contingent upon the approval of the Borough Engineer,
alternative runoff computational techniques such as the Rational Method may be
used where applicable. The borough reserves the right to require that the plan
be prepared by a registered professional engineer, surveyor or landscape
architect.

§ 153.07  PLAN REVIEW PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Pre-application phase.
      (1)   Before submitting the stormwater plan, applicants are urged to
consult with the borough, County Planning Department and County Conservation
District on the requirements for safely managing from the development site in a
manner consistent with the borough ordinances and applicable watershed
stormwater management plan. These agencies may also be helpful in providing
necessary data for the stormwater management plan.
      (2)   Applicants are encouraged to submit a sketch plan with a narrative
description of the proposed stormwater management controls for general guidance
and discussion with the borough and other agencies.
      (3)   The pre-application phase is not mandatory; any review comments
provided by the borough or other agencies are advisory only and do not
constitute any legally binding action on the part of the borough or any county
agency.
   (B)   Stormwater plan reviews.
      (1)   Submission of plans. Stormwater plan applications shall be
submitted with the preliminary and final subdivision/land development
applications.
      (2)   Notification of affected municipalities. The borough shall notify
municipalities upstream and downstream of the development site, which may be
affected by the stormwater runoff and proposed controls for the site. Copies of
the plans will be made available to the municipalities upon request. Comments
received from any affected borough will be considered by the Borough Engineer
and county agencies in their reviews.
      (3)   County Planning review.
         (a)   A copy of the stormwater plan, along with all runoff
calculations, shall be forwarded to the County Planning Department. A report of
the findings will be returned to the borough within 30 days.
         (b)   If the Planning Department review identifies that the plan fails
to comply with the watershed standards and criteria or that a possibility
exists for harmful downstream impacts from the development site, the applicant
will be advised so that the necessary modifications can be made to the
stormwater management controls for the development site. The Borough Engineer
shall not approve the development site’s stormwater management plan until
modifications are made and the plan receives a positive review from the County
Planning Department.
      (4)   Borough Engineer’s review. The Borough Engineer shall approve or
disapprove the stormwater management plan based on the requirements of the
borough ordinances, the standards and criteria of the watershed plan and good
engineering practice. The Engineer shall submit a written report, along with
supporting documentation, stating his or her reasons for approval or
disapproval.
      (5)   Status of the Engineer’s determination. The approval/disapproval of
the site’s stormwater management plan by the Borough Engineer shall be
considered final. The Borough Council shall not reverse the Engineer’s
determination by approving or disapproving the site’s stormwater management
plan or any specific control measure in contradiction to the engineers action.
The Borough Council may request modifications or alternative approaches to the
stormwater management controls, provided these are agreed to by the Borough
Engineer and the applicant’s engineer.
      (6)   Permits required from other governmental agencies. Where the
proposed development requires an obstruction permit from the Pennsylvania DEP
or an erosion/sedimentation permit from the County Conservation District, then
final stormwater management plan approval shall be conditional upon receipt of
such permits. However, no building permit shall be issued, nor construction
started, until the permits are received and copies filed with the borough.
(Ord. 980, passed 3-16-1993; Ord. 991, passed 2-21-1995)
§ 153.08  STATUS OF THE STORMWATER PLAN AFTER FINAL APPROVAL.
   (A)   Upon final stormwater plan approval and receipt of all necessary
permits, the applicant may commence to install or implement the approved
stormwater management controls.
   (B)   If site development or building construction does not begin within two
years of the date of final approval of the stormwater management plan, then
before doing so, the applicant shall resubmit the stormwater management plan to
verify that no condition has changed within the watershed that would affect the
feasibility or effectiveness of the previously approved stormwater management
controls. Further, if for any reason development activities are suspended for
two years or more, then the same requirement for resubmission of the stormwater
management plan shall apply.
(Ord. 980, passed 3-16-1993; Ord. 991, passed 2-21-1995)
§ 153.09  STORMWATER PLAN MODIFICATION.
   (A)   If the request for a plan modification is initiated before
construction begins, the stormwater plan must be resubmitted and reviewed
according to the procedures contained in §
153.07.
   (B)   If the request for a plan modification is initiated after construction
is underway, the Borough Engineer shall have the authority to approve or
disapprove the modification based on field inspection provided:
      (1)   The requested changes in stormwater controls do not result in any
modifications to other approved borough land use/development requirements
(e.g., building setbacks, yards and the like); and
      (2)   The performance standards in §
153.02 are met. Notification of the Engineer’s action shall be sent to the
Borough Council which may issue a stay of the plan modification within five
days and require the permitted to resubmit the plan modification for full
stormwater plan review in accordance with §
153.07.
(Ord. 980, passed 3-16-1993; Ord. 991, passed 2-21-1995)
§ 153.10  INSPECTIONS OF STORMWATER MANAGEMENT CONTROLS.
   (A)   The Borough Engineer or a designated representative shall inspect the
construction of the temporary and permanent stormwater management system for
the development site. The permittee shall notify the Engineer 48 hours in
advance of the completion of the following key development phases:
      (1)   At the completion of preliminary site preparation including
stripping of vegetation, stockpiling of topsoil and construction of temporary
stormwater management and erosion control facilities;
      (2)   At the completion of rough grading but prior to placing topsoil,
permanent drainage or other site development improvements and ground covers;
      (3)   During construction of the permanent stormwater facilities at such
times as specified by the Borough Engineer;
      (4)   Completion of permanent stormwater management facilities including
established ground covers and plantings; and
      (5)   Completion of final grading, vegetative control measures or other
site restoration work done in accordance with the approved plan and permit.
   (B)   No work shall commence on any subsequent phase until the preceding one
has been inspected and approved. If there are deficiencies in any phase, the
Borough Engineer shall issue a written description of the required corrections
and stipulate the time by which they must be made.
   (C)   If during construction the contractor or permittee identifies any site
condition, such as subsurface soil conditions, alterations in surface, or
subsurface drainage which could affect the feasibility of the approved
stormwater facilities, he or she shall notify the Borough Engineer within 24
hours of the discovery of such condition and request a field inspection. The
Borough Engineer shall determine if the condition requires a stormwater plan
modification.
   (D)   In cases where stormwater facilities are to be installed in areas of
landslide-prone soils or other special site conditions exist, the borough may
require special precautions such as soil tests and core borings, full-time
inspectors and/or similar measures. All costs of any such measures shall be
borne by the permittee.

§ 155.036  ZONING MAP.
   The boundaries of the zoning districts are shown upon the borough zoning
map. This map shall be known and commonly referred to as the zoning map. The
map and all the notations, references and other information shown thereon are a
part of this chapter and have the same force and effect as if they were all
fully set forth or described herein. The original, properly attested zoning map
shall be available for examination at the Borough Office and shall be reviewed
and amended as deemed necessary by the Borough Council.
(Ord. 1089, passed 5-19-2014)
§ 155.037  DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   The district boundaries on the zoning map are intended to follow property
lines; centerlines of roads, watercourses or railroads; other identifiable
physical features; or measured distances from property lines, centerlines or
identifiable physical features. When the Zoning Officer cannot determine the
location of a zoning district boundary by reference to the zoning map, the
Zoning Officer shall refuse action; and the Board shall interpret the location
of the district boundary with reference to the scale of the map, the
comprehensive plan and the purposes set forth in all relevant provisions of
this chapter.
(Ord. 1089, passed 5-19-2014)
§ 155.038  ZONING DISTRICT REGULATIONS.

(Ord. 1089, passed 5-19-2014)
§ 155.039  SPLIT LOT ZONING.
   Where a zoning district boundary splits a lot, resulting in differing and
nonuniform requirements for the lot, the following provisions shall apply.
   (A)   Where the lot is large enough to be subdivided into two or more lots,
each within a single zoning district, no zoning approval will be given for any
authorized use which would utilize any portion of the lot other than that
portion of the lot in which the principal use is located. Further development
will require subdivision.
   (B)   Where a lot cannot be subdivided in compliance with this chapter and
the subdivision and land development ordinance, the authorized use permitted on
the lot is limited to those authorized uses permitted in the zoning district in
which the largest part of the lot is located, and the smaller part of the lot
located in another zoning district will be subject to the provisions of this
chapter where the largest portion of the lot is located. If this section
creates an undue hardship, the Board has jurisdiction to grant such relief as
the Board deems necessary.

   (C)   With respect to two-sided, multi-sided or three-dimensional signs, the
sign surface area shall be computed as described in divisions (C)(1) and (C)(2)

communicate information that can be seen at any one time by a person from one
vantage point. Without otherwise limiting the generality of the foregoing:
      (1)   The sign surface of a double-faced, back-to-back sign shall be
calculated by using the area of only one side of such sign, so long as the
distance between the backs of such sign does not exceed two feet; and

   (A)   Unless otherwise prohibited by this chapter, signs may be illuminated
if such illumination is in accordance with this section.
   (B)   Lighting directed toward a sign shall be shielded so that it

   (C)   Except as herein provided, internally illuminated signs are not
permissible in any residential districts, and where permissible, internally
illuminated freestanding signs may not be illuminated during hours that the

operation. This division (C) shall not apply to the following types of signs:
      (1)   Signs that constitute an integral part of a vending machine,
telephone booth, device that only indicates the time, date or weather
conditions or similar device whose principal function is not to convey an

apparent movement to attract the attention of the public are prohibited. The
restriction of this division (B) shall not apply to signs indicating the time,
date or weather conditions.
   (C)   No sign may be erected so that by its location, color, size, shape,
nature or message it would tend to obstruct the view of or be confused with
official traffic signs or other signs erected by governmental agencies.
   (D)   Freestanding signs shall be securely fastened to the ground or to some
other supportive structure.
   (E)   Electronic changeable copy signs are permitted, with the following

      (1)   Electronic changeable copy signs are limited to 50% of the total
area of the sign, or 25 square feet in area, whichever is more restrictive; and

or display shall be a maximum of one second. There shall not be any appearance
of a visual dissolve or fading, in which any part of one electronic message or
display appears simultaneously with any part of a second message or display.

sidewalks in the NC, C and VC districts during hours that the business or
enterprise advertised by such sign is open for business or in operation. The

commodity, accommodation, attraction or other enterprise or activity that is no
longer operating or being offered or conducted, that sign shall be considered
abandoned and shall, within 180 days after such abandonment, be removed.

is located or other person having control over such sign shall, within 180 days
of the removal of the message portion of the sign, either replace the entire
message portion of the sign or remove the remaining components of the sign.
This division (C) shall not be construed to alter the effect of §
155.224, which prohibits the replacement of a nonconforming sign, nor shall
this division (C) be construed to prevent the changing of the message of a
sign.

chapter for a specific type of use or development.
      (1)   The proposed use shall conform to the district and conditional use
provisions and all general regulations of this chapter.
      (2)   The proposed use shall meet all special standards which may be
applied to its class of conditional use as set forth in this subchapter.
      (3)   The proposed use shall not involve any element or cause any
condition that may be dangerous, injurious or noxious to any other property or
persons, and shall comply with the performance standards set forth in §
155.056.
      (4)   The proposed use shall be sited, oriented and landscaped so that
the relationship of its building and grounds to adjacent buildings and
properties does not impair health, safety or comfort and does not adversely
affect values of adjacent property.
      (5)   The proposed use shall produce a total environmental effect which
is consistent with, and not harmful to, the environment of the neighborhood.
      (6)   The proposed use shall organize vehicular access and parking to
minimize conflicting traffic movement on adjacent streets.
      (7)   The proposed use will not impede the normal and orderly development

Borough Council shall refuse an application for conditional use where opponents
to the application establish by a preponderance of evidence that the
application is contrary to the health, safety and general welfare of the
community at large. The Borough Council, in granting a conditional use, may
attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards other than those related to
off-site transportation or road improvement, in addition to those expressed in

federal permitting authorities for the same existing or proposed mining or
processing activity; and

§ 155.206  PROCEDURE.
   The Board shall hear and decide requests for special exceptions in
accordance with the procedures of §§
155.240 through
155.254.
(Ord. 1089, passed 5-19-2014)
§ 155.207  GENERAL STANDARDS AND CRITERIA.
   (A)   Before approving a special exception application, the Zoning Hearing
Board shall determine that the proposed use complies with the following general
standards and criteria, which are in addition to any other requirements in this
chapter for a specific type of use or development.
      (1)   The proposed use shall conform to the district and special
exception provisions (§§
155.205 through
155.208) and all general regulations of this chapter.
      (2)   The proposed use shall meet all special standards which may be
applied to its class of special exception use as set forth in this subchapter.
      (3)   The proposed use shall not involve any element or cause any
condition that may be dangerous, injurious or noxious to any other property or
persons, and shall comply with the performance standards set forth in §
155.056.
      (4)   The proposed use shall be sited, oriented and landscaped so that
the relationship of its building and grounds to adjacent buildings and
properties does not impair health, safety or comfort and does not adversely
affect values of adjacent property.
      (5)   The proposed use shall produce a total environmental effect which
is consistent with, and not harmful to, the environment of the neighborhood.
      (6)   The proposed use shall organize vehicular access and parking to
minimize conflicting traffic movement on adjacent streets.
      (7)   The proposed use will not impede the normal and orderly development
and improvement of surrounding property as permitted by this chapter.
      (8)   The proposed use will be adequately served by existing storm and
sanitary drainage facilities, public water, access streets and other necessary
facilities.
      (9)   The proposed use shall promote the objectives of this chapter and
shall be consistent with the comprehensive plan for the borough.
   (B)   The Board shall grant a special exception only if it finds adequate
evidence presented by the applicant that the proposed special exception is duly
authorized under provisions of this chapter, that the application falls within
the terms of the specific provisions allowing for special exception and that
the proposed use complies with all other requirements of this chapter. The
Board shall refuse an application for special exception where opponents to the
application establish by a preponderance of evidence that the application is
contrary to the health, safety and morals or general welfare of the community
at large. The Board, in granting a special exception, may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards other than those related to off-site
transportation or road improvement, in addition to those expressed in the
chapter, as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of the MPC Act and
the zoning regulations, except that conditions of approval shall not include
those related to off-site transportation or road improvements.
(Ord. 1089, passed 5-19-2014)
§ 155.208  EXPRESS STANDARDS AND CRITERIA FOR EACH USE AUTHORIZED BY SPECIAL
EXCEPTION PROCEDURE.
   These shall be the same requirements as §§
155.126 and
155.140 through
155.192.
(Ord. 1089, passed 5-19-2014)
NONCONFORMING LOTS, STRUCTURES, USES AND SIGNS
§ 155.220  INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   If, within the zoning districts established by this chapter or due to
amendments that may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures or uses of
lots which were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended but which
would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this chapter or
future amendments, it is the intent of this chapter to permit those
nonconformities. Such uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with
authorized uses in the zoning districts involved. It is further the intent of
this chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or
extended nor be used as grounds for adding other signs, structures or uses
prohibited elsewhere in the same zoning district.
   (B)   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any structure
on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter and upon which actual construction has
been diligently commenced. ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION is hereby defined to include the
placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a
permanent manner, except that where demolition or removal of an existing
structure has substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or
removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be
diligently carried on until completion of the structure involved.
(Ord. 1089, passed 5-19-2014)
§ 155.221  NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   The following regulations shall apply to all nonconforming lots, as defined
by this chapter, in any zoning district.
   (A)   Where two or more adjacent lots of record with continuous frontage
have less than the required area and width and are held by one owner, the lots
shall be considered to be an undivided lot for the purpose of complying with
this subchapter. No division of any lot shall be made which does not comply
with the requirements of this subchapter.
   (B)   Where structures exist on adjacent nonconforming lots of record which
have front yards less than the minimum depth required, the minimum front yard
for an adjacent undeveloped nonconforming lot of record shall be the average
depth of the nonconforming front yards of the adjacent developed nonconforming
lots which are in the same block on the same side of the street and in the same
recorded plan as the undeveloped lot. Private garages, storage sheds, swimming
pools and similar structures shall be located to the rear of the permitted
principal structure and may be permitted in the rear yard, provided that they
are no closer than ten feet from the rear property line and are not located on
any easements or rights-of-way.
(Ord. 1089, passed 5-19-2014)
§ 155.222  NONCONFORMING USE OF LOTS.
   Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, a
lawful use of a lot exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms
of this chapter as enacted or amended, such use may be continued as long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.
   (A)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased or extended
to occupy a greater lot area than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter, unless the Board shall interpret that
the enlargement or extension is necessary by the natural expansion and growth
of trade of the nonconforming use.
   (B)   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the lot not occupied by such use at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter.
   (C)   If any such nonconforming use of a lot ceases for any reason for a
period of more than 12 consecutive months, it shall be presumed that the
nonconforming use has been abandoned, and any subsequent use of such lot shall
conform to the regulations specified by this chapter for the zoning district in
which such lot is located.
(Ord. 1089, passed 5-19-2014)
§ 155.223  NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this chapter that could not be built under the requirements of
this chapter, such structure may be continued as long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions.
   (A)   Structural alterations of 100 square feet or less are permitted. For
those alterations that exceed 100 square feet, the Planning Commission will
review and recommend to Council if an undue hardship exists and may authorize a
reasonable modification of such structure.
   (B)   Should such structure be destroyed by any means, repairs or
reconstruction may be undertaken, provided that such restoration is started
within 12 months of the date of damage.
   (C)   Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the requirements of the zoning
district in which it is located.
(Ord. 1089, passed 5-19-2014)
§ 155.224  NONCONFORMING USE OF STRUCTURES.
   If a lawful use of a structure or of a structure and lot in combination
exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that
would not be allowed in the zoning district under the terms of this chapter,
the lawful use may be continued, subject to the following provisions.
   (A)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter
in the zoning district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or otherwise have any structural alterations
made to it except in changing the use of the structure to an authorized use in
the zoning district in which it is located, unless the Board shall interpret
that the enlargement, extension, construction, reconstruction or structural
alteration is necessitated by the natural expansion and growth of trade of the
nonconforming use.
   (B)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of a
structure which was manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any lot or portion of a lot outside such structure, except on a lot or
portion of a lot owned at the time the use became nonconforming.
   (C)   Any structure or structure and lot in combination in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by an authorized use shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the zoning district in which such structure is located,
and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
   (D)   When a nonconforming use of a structure or structure and lot in
combination ceases for a period of more than 12 consecutive months, it shall be
presumed that the nonconforming use has been abandoned, and any subsequent use
of such structure or structure and lot in combination shall conform to the
regulations specified by this chapter for the zoning district in which such lot
is located.
   (E)   Where nonconforming status applies to both the use and the structure
on the lot, removal or destruction of the nonconforming structure shall
eliminate the nonconforming use on the lot.
   (F)   Nonconforming signs may be repaired or reconstructed, provided that no
structural alterations are made which increase the sign area computed in
accordance with §
155.102.
   (G)   Nonconforming signs may not be enlarged, added to or replaced by
another nonconforming sign, use or structure, except that interchange of poster
panels shall be permitted.
(Ord. 1089, passed 5-19-2014)
§ 155.225  REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of any structure or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any official charged with protecting the safety of the populace.
(Ord. 1089, passed 5-19-2014)

as such and may succeed themselves. For the conduct of any hearing and the
taking of any action, a quorum shall be not less than two members, but the
Zoning Hearing Board may appoint a hearing officer from its own membership to
conduct any hearings on its behalf. In such a case, the parties may, prior to
the decision, waive a decision by the Zoning Hearing Board and accept the

within 45 days after the last hearing before the Zoning Hearing Board. Where
the application is contested or denied, each decision shall be accompanied by
findings of fact and conclusions based thereon, together with the reasons
therefor. Conclusions based on any provisions of this chapter, or any other
land use ordinance, rule or regulation or any provision of the MPC shall
contain a reference to the provisions relied on and the reasons why the
conclusion is deemed appropriate in the light of the facts found. If the

      (1)   Application. The Board shall hear requests for variances where it
is alleged that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter
inflict unnecessary hardship upon the applicant. Application for a variance
shall be made in writing on the prescribed form obtained from the Zoning
Officer. The Zoning Officer shall forward the application to the Board, which
shall determine the time and place of the hearing.

         (a)   There are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including
irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property
and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of this chapter
in the neighborhood or district which the property is located;
         (b)   That, because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity
with the provisions of this chapter; and that authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of property;
         (c)   Such unnecessary hardship had not been created by the applicant;
         (d)   The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property nor be detrimental to the public welfare; and
         (e)   The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance
which will afford relief and represent the least modification possible of the
regulation in issue.
      (4)   Review by Planning Commission. The Zoning Hearing Board may request
the review and comments of the Planning Commission on any variance application,
which shall be made part of the public record.
      (5)   Conditions. In granting any variance, the Zoning Hearing Board may
attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to
implement the purposes of this chapter and the MPC.

date of the Zoning Hearing Board’s written decision unless:
         (a)   The applicant has applied for and obtained a building permit and
commenced construction; or
         (b)   In the case where the variance does not require the issuance of
a building permit, the applicant has applied for and obtained an occupancy

      (1)   No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Zoning
Hearing Board later than 30 days after an application for development,
preliminary or final, has been approved by an appropriate borough officer,
agency or body, if such proceeding is designed to secure reversal or to limit
the approval in any manner, unless such person alleges and proves that he or
she had no notice, knowledge or reason to believe that such approval had been
given. If such person has succeeded to his or her interest after such approval,
he or she shall be bound by the knowledge of his or her predecessor interest.
      (2)   Any appeals from determinations adverse to the landowner shall be
filed by the landowner within 30 days after notice of the determination is

land development pursuant to any challenged ordinance, order or approval of the
Zoning Officer or any agency or body and all official action thereunder shall
be stayed, unless the Zoning Officer or any other appropriate agency or body
certifies to the Zoning Hearing Board facts indicating that such stay would
cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case, the development or
official action shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which
may be granted by the Zoning Hearing Board or the county court of common pleas,
on petition, after notice to the Zoning Officer or other appropriate agency or
body.

§ 155.254  VARIANCE OF ORDINANCE; SUBSTANTIVE QUESTIONS.
   (A)   A landowner who, on substantive grounds, desires to challenge the
validity of an ordinance or map or any provision thereof which prohibits or
restricts the use or development of land in which he or she has an interest
shall submit the challenge either:
      (1)   To the Zoning Hearing Board; or
      (2)   To the governing body, together with a request for a curative
amendment under §
155.250.
   (B)   Persons aggrieved by a use or development permitted on the land of
another by an ordinance or map, or any provision thereof, who desires to
challenge its validity on substantive grounds shall first submit their
challenge to the Zoning Hearing Board for a decision.
   (C)   The submissions referred to in divisions (A) and (B) above shall be
governed by the following.
      (1)   In challenges before the Zoning Hearing Board, the challenging
party shall make a written request to the Board that it hold a hearing on its
challenge. The request shall contain the reasons for the challenge. Where the
landowner desires to challenge the validity of such ordinance and elects to
proceed by curative amendment under §
155.250, his or her application to the governing body shall contain, in
addition to the requirements of the written request hereof, the plans and
explanatory materials describing the use or development proposed by the
landowner in lieu of the use or development permitted by the challenged
ordinance or map. Such plans or other materials shall not be required to meet
the standards prescribed for preliminary, tentative or final approval or for
the issuance of a permit, so long as they provide reasonable notice of the
proposed use or development and a sufficient basis for evaluating the
challenged ordinance or map in light thereof. Nothing herein contained shall
preclude the landowner from first seeking a final approval before submitting
his or her challenge.
      (2)   If the submission is made by the landowner to the governing body
under division (A)(2) above, the request also shall be accompanied by an
amendment or amendments to the ordinance proposed by the landowner to cure the
alleged defects therein.
      (3)   If the submission is made to the governing body, the Municipal
Solicitor shall represent and advise it at the hearing or hearings.
      (4)   The governing body may retain an independent attorney to present
the defense of the challenged ordinance or map on its behalf and to present
witnesses on its behalf.
      (5)   Based upon the testimony presented at the hearing or hearings, the
governing body or the Zoning Board, as the case may be, shall determine whether
the challenged ordinance or map is defective, as alleged by the landowner. If a
challenge heard by a governing body is found to have merit, the governing body
shall proceed as provided in Pa. Mun. Plan Code, 53 P.S. § 10609.1. If a
challenge heard by a Zoning Hearing Board is found to have merit, the decision
of the Zoning Hearing Board shall include recommended amendments to the
challenged ordinance which will cure the defects found. In reaching its
decision, the Zoning Hearing Board shall consider the amendments, plans and
explanatory material submitted by the landowner and shall also consider:
         (a)   The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools and other public service facilities;
         (b)   If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the
proposal upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of the proposal in
providing housing units of a type actually available to and affordable by
classes of persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by the challenged provisions
of the ordinance or map;
         (c)   The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by
the site’s soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers, natural
resources and other natural features;
         (d)   The impact of the proposed use on the site’s soils, slopes,
woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, natural resources and natural features, the
degree to which these are protected or destroyed, the tolerance of the
resources to development and any adverse environmental impacts; and
         (e)   The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture
and other land uses which are essential to public health and welfare.
      (6)   The governing body or the Zoning Hearing Board, as the case may be,
shall render its decision within 45 days after the conclusion of the last
hearing.
      (7)   If the governing body or the Zoning Board, as the case may be,
fails to act on the landowner’s request within the time limits referred to in
division (C)(6) above, a denial of the request is deemed to have occurred on
the forty-sixth day after the close of the last hearing.
   (D)   The Zoning Hearing Board or governing body, as the case may be, shall
commence its hearings within 60 days after the request is filed unless the
landowner requests or consents to an extension of time.
   (E)   Public notice of the hearing shall include notice that the validity of
the ordinance or map is in question and shall give the place where and the
times when a copy of the request, including any plans, explanatory material or
proposed amendments may be examined by the public.
   (F)   The challenge shall be deemed denied when:
      (1)   The Zoning Hearing Board or governing body, as the case may be,
fails to commence the hearing within the time limits set forth in division (D)
above;
      (2)   The governing body notifies the landowner that it will not adopt
the curative amendment;
      (3)   The governing body adopts another curative amendment which is
unacceptable to the landowner; or
      (4)   The Zoning Hearing Board or governing body, as the case may be,
fails to act on the request 45 days after the close of the last hearing on the
request, unless the time is extended by mutual consent by the landowner and
borough.
   (G)   Where, after the effective date of this act, a curative amendment
proposal is approved by the grant of a curative amendment application by the
governing body or a validity challenge is sustained by the Zoning Hearing Board
or the court acts finally on appeal from denial of a curative amendment
proposal or a validity challenge, and the proposal or challenge so approved
requires a further application for subdivision or land development, the
developer shall have two years from the date of such approval to file an
application for preliminary or tentative approval. Within the two-year period,
no subsequent change or amendment in the zoning, subdivision or other governing
ordinance or plan shall be applied in any manner which adversely affects the
rights of the applicant as granted in the curative amendment or the sustained
validity challenge. Where the proposal appended to the curative amendment
application or the validity challenge is approved but does not require further
application under any subdivision or land development ordinance, the developer
shall have one year within which to file for a building permit. Within the one-
year period, no subsequent change or amendment in the zoning, subdivision or
other governing ordinance or plan shall be applied in any manner which
adversely affects the rights of the applicant as granted in the curative
amendment or the sustained validity challenge. During these protected periods,
the court shall retain or assume jurisdiction for the purpose of awarding such
supplemental relief as may be necessary.
   (H)   Where municipalities have adopted a multi-municipal comprehensive plan
but have not adopted a joint municipal ordinance and all municipalities
participating in the multi-municipal comprehensive plan have adopted and are
administering zoning ordinances generally consistent with the provisions of the
multi-municipal comprehensive plan, and a challenge is brought to the validity
of a zoning ordinance of a participating borough involving a proposed use, then
the Zoning Hearing Board or governing body, as the case may be, shall consider
the availability of uses under zoning ordinances within the municipalities
participating in the multi-municipal comprehensive plan within a reasonable
geographic area and shall not limit its consideration to the application of the
zoning ordinance on the borough whose zoning ordinance is being challenged.
   (I)   A landowner, who has challenged on substantive grounds the validity of
a zoning ordinance or map either by submission of a curative amendment to the
governing body or to the Zoning Hearing Board, shall not submit any additional
substantive challenges involving the same parcel, group of parcels or part
thereof until such time as the status of the landowner’s original challenge has
been finally determined or withdrawn; provided, however, that if after the date
of the landowner’s original challenge the borough adopts a substantially new or
different zoning ordinance or zoning map, the landowner may file a second
substantive challenge to the new or different zoning ordinance or zoning map
under division (A) above.
