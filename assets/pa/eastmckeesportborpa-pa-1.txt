FOREWORD
FOREWORD
History
This comprises the codification of the ordinances of the Borough of East
McKeesport. The Borough was originally settled in 1895 and was incorporated as
the Borough of East McKeesport from pat-ts of North Versailles Township.
The Code of Ordinances of the Borough was prepared by Penns Valley Publishers,
a division of Fry Communications, Inc., and adopted by the Borough Council on
June 12,
2003 by Ordinance Number 828.
Organization
The Code contains four parts which are (1) the valid current ordinances of the
Borough contained in Chapters 1 through 27, (2) the Appendix, which lists by
abstracted title all ordinances of a temporary or "one time" nature, (3) the
Key to the disposition of each ordinance ever enacted by the Borough, and ( 4)
the Index, which is an alphabetical arrangement of subjects.
In the Code each Chapter is separated by a divider tab, and specific ordinances
can be located by subject on the contents page at the beginning of each
Chapter. The Index may also be used to search for a subject when one is looking
for general information on a particular subject, or if it is not known in which
Chapter the subject might be found. The Appendix consists of several general
categories containing a chronological listing of short subject descriptions
along with a reference to the original ordinance and its date of enactment, if
known.
The Key to disposition indicates what action has been taken by the Borough
Council with regard to every ordinance ever enacted. An ordinance has either
been (1) specifically repealed, (2) superseded by another ordinance, (3) is
located in a Chapter of the Code book, or ( 4) is located in the Appendix.
Annual tax rate and budget ordinances are located only in the Key. The Key is a
cross reference to the original ordinance books of the Borough, and to the
location within the Code of each ordinance by number.

or to create an obligation to pay delinquent property taxes or unpaid removal

PART 1
STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION
§ 8-101. Statutory Authorization.
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage of
the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978, delegated the
responsibility to local government units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Council of the Borough of East McKeesport, Allegheny
County, does hereby order as follows:
(Ord. 902, 9/13/2012, §1.00)
PART 2
GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 8-201. Intent.
   The intent of this Chapter is to:
   A.   Promote the general health, welfare and safety of the community.
   B.   Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in
order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
   C.   Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and natural
drainage.
   D.   Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units, and its residents, by preventing excessive development in areas subject
to flooding.

   No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted or altered without full compliance with the term of this Chapter and
other applicable regulations. Violation of the requirements (including
violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with
conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the
East McKeesport Borough from taking such lawful action as is necessary to
prevent or remedy any violation.

or after March 4, 2013, and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures. Any construction started after October 4, 1994, and before March 4,
2013, is subject to the ordinance in effect at the time the permit was issued,
provided the start of construction was within 180 days of permit issuance.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION - a manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final sit
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
PERSON - an individual, partnership, public or private association or
corporation, firm, trust, estate, municipality, governmental unit, public
utility or any other legal entity whatsoever, which is recognized by law as the
subject of rights and duties.

truck.
   D.   Not designed for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living
quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
REGULATORY FLOOD ELEVATION - the base flood elevation (BFE) or estimated flood
height as determined using simplified methods plus a freeboard safety factor of
1½ feet.
REPETITIVE LOSS - flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a 10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the
time of each such flood event, on average, equals or exceeds 25% of the market
value of the structure before the damages occurred.
SPECIAL PERMIT - a special approval which is required for hospitals, nursing
homes, jails, and new manufactured home parks and subdivisions and substantial
improvements to such existing parks, when such development is located in all,
or a designated portion of a floodplain.

A, AO, A1- A30, AE, A99, or, AH.
START OF CONSTRUCTION - includes substantial improvement and other proposed new
development and means the date the Permit was issued, provided the actual start
of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement,
or other improvement was within 180 days after the date of the permit and shall
be completed within 12 months after the date of issuance of the permit unless a
time extension is granted, in writing, by the Floodplain Administrator. The
actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and walkways; nor does
it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the
erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not

any means into two or more lots, tracts, parcels or other divisions of land
including changes in existing lot lines for the purpose, whether immediate or
future, of lease, partition by the court for distribution to heirs, or
devisees, transfer of ownership or building or lot development. Provided,
however, that the subdivision by lease of land for agricultural purposes into
parcels of more than 10 acres, not involving any new street or easement of
access or any residential dwelling, shall be exempted.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE - damage from any cause sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or
exceed 50% or more of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT - any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, of which the cost equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial
damage” (or “repetitive loss” when a repetitive loss provision is used)
regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however,
include any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
   Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would
constitute a substantial improvement, as defined in this Chapter, must comply
with all ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific ordinance
requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of
Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places must be obtained from
the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any
exemption from ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
   Uniform Construction Code (UCC) - the statewide building code adopted by the
Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1999 applicable to new construction in all
municipali ties whether administered by the municipality, a third party or the
Department of Labor and Industry. Applicable to residential and commercial
buildings, The Code adopted the International Residential Code (IRC) and the
International Building Code (IBC), by reference, as the construction standard
applicable with the State floodplain construction. For coordination purposes,
references to the above are made specifically to various sections of the IRC
and the IBC.
VIOLATION - the failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR §60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)
(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4) or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until
such time as that documentation is provided.

(Ord. 965, 10/13/2022)
§ 9-109. Mandatory Inspections and Certification of Completion.
   1.   The Borough Engineer or his designee shall, when requested, make the
inspections hereinafter required and shall either approve that portion of the
work which has been completed or notify the permit holder wherein the same
fails to comply with the provisions of this Part. Where it is found by
inspection that the soil or other conditions are not as stated or shown in the
application, the Manager may refuse to approve further work until approval is
obtained for a revised grading plan conforming to the existing conditions.
   2.   Plans for grading work, approved by the Borough Engineer or his
designee, shall be maintained at the site and available for inspection during
the progress of the work until final approval is received from the Borough
Engineer or his designee.
   3.   The permit holder shall notify the Borough Engineer or his designee in
order to obtain inspections in accordance with the following schedule and such
notification shall be made by the permit holder at least 24 hours before the
inspection is to be made:
      A.   Initial Inspection. When work on the excavation or fill is about to
be commenced.
      B.   Rough Grading. When all rough grading has been completed.
      C.   Drainage Facilities. When drainage facilities are to be installed
and before such facilities are backfilled.
      D.   Special Structures. When excavations are complete for retaining,
crib walls erected, reinforcing steel in place, and before concrete is poured.
      E.   Final Inspection. When all work, including the installation of all
drainage and other structures has been completed.
   4.   If, at any stage of the work, the Borough Engineer or his designee
shall determine by inspection that the nature of the formation is such that
further work as authorized by an existing permit is likely to endanger any
public or private property, or streets, or alleys, or create hazardous
conditions, the Borough Engineer or his designee may suspend operations. The
Borough Engineer or his designee may require, as a condition to allowing the
work to continue, that the permit holder take reasonable safety precautions to
avoid such likelihood of danger. Safety precautions may include, but shall not
be limited to, specifying a flatter exposed slope, construction of additional
drainage facilities, beans, terracing, compaction, cribbing or walls.
   5.   The cost for all inspections shall be borne by the owner of the land at
rates established by the Borough.
   6.   Upon completion of all grading installation and other work on the
permit site to the satisfaction of the Borough Engineer or his designee, a
certificate of completion shall be issued by said Manager.
(Ord. 965, 10/13/2022)
§ 9-110. Requirements and Standards for Excavations.
   1.   No excavation shall be made with a cut face steeper in slope than two
horizontal to one vertical, except under one or more of the following
conditions:
      A.   A governmental review agency, professional engineer or engineering
geologist may classify according to the soil survey the types of soil on the
site to be graded. Maximum slopes must then be determined as follows:
         (1)   Landslide-prone soils where slopes are greater than 25% shall
have cut slopes no steeper than three horizontal to one vertical. Soil survey
map symbols relative to this requirement are:
         (2)   Landslide-prone soils where slopes are less than 25% shall have
cut slopes no steeper than two horizontal to one vertical. Soil survey map
symbols relative to this requirement are:
         32-B-2   65-B-2   32-C-2   65-C-2   34-B-2
         65-D-2   34-C-2   67-C-2   34-D-2   67-D-2
         (3)   Soils which are not or have a low probability of being
landslide-prone shall have a slope no steeper than one and one half horizontal
to one vertical. All soil survey map symbols except the symbols listed above
denote soils of low landslide probability.
      B.   Cut slopes which are steeper than those specified in §
9-110, Subsection 1.A., may be allowed under a grading permit, provided one or
both of the following is satisfied:
         (1)   The material in which the excavation is made is sufficiently
stable to sustain a slope steeper than the slope specified above for recognized
soil conditions on the site. A written statement, signed and sealed by a
professional engineer, stating that the steeper slope will have sufficient
stability and that risk of creating a hazard will be slight, must be submitted
to the Borough Engineer or his designee.
         (2)   A retaining wall or other approved support, designed by a
professional engineer and approved by the Borough Engineer or his designee, is
provided to support the face of the excavation.
      C.   The excavation is located so that a line having a slope of two
horizontal to one vertical and passing through any portion of the cut face will
be entirely inside the property lines of the property on which the excavation
is made.
      D.   A written statement from a registered professional engineer,
licensed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and experienced in soils
engineering, certifying that he has inspected the site and that the material in
which the excavation is to be made is sufficiently stable to sustain a slope
steeper than two horizontal to one vertical and that said steeper slope will
not endanger any property or result in property damage, is submitted to and
approved by the Borough Engineer or his designee.
      E.   A retaining wall or other approved support designed by a registered
professional engineer is provided to support the face of the excavation.
         (1)   A retaining wall is a structure composed of concrete, steel or
other approved building material constructed for the purpose of supporting a
cut or filled embankment which would otherwise not comply with the requirements
of the standards set forth in this Part, and which is more than four feet in
height as measured on the exposed vertical surface of the wall.
         (2)   If a retaining wall is constructed to satisfy a requirement of
this Part, a building permit, as provided for by other Borough regulations,
shall not be required. The grading permit will apply to the retaining wall, and
the requirements for inspection, etc., as stated herein will be complied with.
         (3)   Retaining walls must be constructed in accordance with sound
engineering practice. The plans submitted for approval shall bear the seal of a
professional engineer.
         (4)   The backfilling of retaining walls and the insertion of
subterranean drainage facilities shall be done strictly in accordance with the
provisions of this Part and the appropriate Borough specifications.
         (5)   In general, where a wall is replacing an exposed slope, the
vertical face of the wall shall be three feet back from the adjoining property.
            (a)   A special exception to this requirement may be applied for
and granted by the Borough Engineer or his designee if it can be satisfactorily
demonstrated that such a variance is necessary to insure normal use of the
property, i.e., for a sideline driveway.
            (b)   An exception to the requirements of this clause may also be
made when the proposed retaining wall is a joint venture between adjacent
property owners, and appropriate documents so stating are filed with the
application for the permit.
   2.   The top or bottom edge of slopes shall generally be set back from
adjacent property lines or street right-of-way lines in order to permit the
normal rounding of the edge without encroaching on the abutting property or
street.
   3.   The Borough Engineer or his designee may require an excavation to be
made with a cut face flatter in slope than two horizontal to one vertical if he
finds the material in which the excavation is to be made unusually subject to
erosion, or if other conditions exist which, under applicable engineering
practice, make such flatter cut slope necessary for stability and safety.
   4.   Excavations adjacent to any footing, foundation or structure shall not
extend below the angle of repose or natural slope of the soil under the nearest
point of same unless such footing, foundation or structure is first properly
underpinned or protected against settlement.
   5.   Before commencing any excavation which will in any way affect an
adjoining property or structures thereon, the person making or causing the
excavation to be made shall give notice to the owners of adjoining buildings
not less than 30 days before such excavation is to be made that the excavation
is to be made.
   6.   Guidelines for minimizing erosion and sediment in the "Erosion and
Sediment Control Handbook for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania" should be
followed. One or a combination of guidelines should be used to minimize hazard,
depending on site conditions and proposed grading. However, the Borough
Engineer or his designee may approve grading plans not meeting guidelines of
the handbook if the proposed grading will not constitute a hazard. Governmental
and/or engineering reports should be used as evidence that proposed grading
will not constitute a hazard.
(Ord. 965, 10/13/2022)
§ 9-111. Requirements and Standards for Fills.
   1.   Guidelines for fills in the "Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook for
Allegheny County, Pennsylvania" should be followed. One or a combination of
guidelines should be used to minimize hazard, depending on site conditions and
proposed grading.
   2.   No fill shall be made which creates any exposed surface steeper in
slope than two horizontal to one vertical, except under one or more of the
following conditions:
      A.   The fill, in the opinion of the Borough Engineer or his designee, is
located so that settlement, sliding or erosion of the fill material will not
result in property damage or be a hazard to adjoining property, street, alleys
or buildings.
      B.   A written statement from a registered professional engineer,
licensed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and experienced in soils
engineering, certifying that he has inspected the site and that the proposed
deviation from the slope specified above will not endanger any property or
result in property damage, is submitted to and approved by the Borough Engineer
or his designee.
   3.   The Borough Engineer or his designee may require that the fill be
constructed with an exposed surface flatter than two horizontal to one vertical
if he finds that under the particular conditions such flatter surface is
necessary for stability and safety.
   4.   Fills, embankments and finish grading shall be designed in accordance
with the following:
      A.   Because of the potential for unexpected conditions in earth
materials and a possibility of earth movement, the bearing value and stability
of the material under proposed fills and embankments shall be determined by
subsurface investigation performed by a qualified registered professional
engineer.
      B.   The type of fill material available in each stage of the grading
operations shall be specified in order to plan proper filling procedures.
         (1)   Broken concrete, concrete block, cinder block, brick, slag and
stone may be incorporated in fills and embankments, but only in layers 24
inches thick, maximum, as per Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of
Highways Specification, 1961, Form 408, Section 3.4.3, Paragraph D, or later
specifications which the Commonwealth may adopt, with voids filled and a
blanket of compacted fill separating one layer of rock from the next. Rock fill
should be placed near the bottom of fill away from building foundations,
building caissons and subsurface utility installations. Suitable earth shall be
reserved or be provided to cover rock fill under proposed seeded or planted
areas.
         (2)   Coal, boney, red-dog, expansive shale and cinders, shall not be
placed in fill areas.
         (3)   Wood or decomposable material shall not be placed in fill areas.
      C.   All organic debris and all topsoil shall be removed from areas to
receive fill.
      D.   On major fills or embankments, as determined by the Borough Engineer
or his designee, a toe bench shall be constructed below mantle under the toe of
fill in accordance with §
9-113 of this Part.
      E.   To take care of ground and subsurface water in the proposed fill
area, a porous drain shall be installed on the bottom and back wall of the toe
bench, together with a drain pipe and suitable discharge pipe to existing
surface, beyond and below the toe of the proposed fill.
      F.   Overfilling of slopes is desirable to permit final shaping of
surface to proposed grade without the addition of loose fill over the surface
of the slope; provided, that no fill shall be higher than six feet vertically
before the slope is shaped to proper grade.
      G.   At the end of each work day, the horizontal surface of the fill area
shall be shaped, compacted and rolled to slope to the outside edge to provide
for drainage.
   5.   No grading permit shall be issued for the filling of materials other
than clean soil or earth until a performance bond in the amount of 110% of the
Borough Engineer or his designee's estimate of the cost of adequately covering
such fill with clean soil or earth has been furnished to the Borough. Such bond
shall be executed by an approved corporate surety, as well as by the principal,
and shall be subject to the approval of the Borough Solicitor as to form. The
bond shall inure to the benefit of the Borough and be conditioned upon the
faithful performance of the work required under the terms and conditions of the
grading permit to the satisfaction of the Borough Engineer or his designee. In
lieu of a surety bond, a cash deposit in the same amount may be made with the
Borough or with a bank or trust company under an escrow agreement prepared at
applicant's cost and approved by the Borough Solicitor.
(Ord. 965, 10/13/2022)
§ 9-112. Slope Treatment and Ground Covering.
   1.   In order to prevent erosion, the permittee shall provide adequate
ground covering of such kind and character as may be approved by the Borough
Engineer or his designee. For slopes steeper than three horizontal to one
vertical, the ground covering shall be an approved mixture of crown vetch and
tall fescue. These areas shall be mulched in an approved manner. The ground
covering for other slopes shall be either grass, crown vetch, or other approved
variety of vegetation.
   2.   The completion of fills, embankments and finish grading should be done
during a season of the year when turf or ground cover can best be established.
(Ord. 965, 10/13/2022)
§ 9-113. Standards for Compaction of Fills and Benching.
   1.   All fills shall be compacted to provide stability of material and to
prevent undesirable settlement. Except as provided in §
9-111, Subsection 4.B.(1), the fill shall be spread in a series of layers, each
not exceeding eight inches in thickness and shall be compacted by a spread.
Fill should be placed at the optimum moisture content for the specified degree
of compaction. The Borough Engineer or his designee may require, at the
applicant's expense, any tests or other information he deems necessary.
   2.   Where fills are placed on slopes of 5% or more, benching of the surface
shall be required and indicated on the cross sections.
(Ord. 965, 10/13/2022)
§ 9-114. Drainage.
   1.   Adequate provisions shall be made to prevent any surface water from
damaging the cut face of an excavation or the sloping surface of a fill.
   2.   The drainage pattern prior to construction shall be indicated on the
plans and adequate measures shall be taken to eliminate any erosion and water
runoff damage to adjacent properties during the grading and/or construction and
after completion of grading and/or construction.
   3.   The grading and/or necessary storm sewers, catch basins, drainage
ditches and swales to protect adjacent properties shall be constructed before
the property to be graded is cleared and grubbed and before any excavation or
filling is started.
   4.   The storm sewers, catch basins, drainage ditches and swales must be
maintained, cleaned, cleared and open during construction. If the above is not
complied with, the Borough Engineer or his designee shall stop all clearing and
grading on the site until the necessary drainage facilities are completed, or
the permit will be revoked and the required bond will be forfeited.
   5.   Drainage ditches shall be constructed at the toe and top of cut and
ahead of fill slopes to divert the surface water to drainage facilities during
and after construction.
   6.   New storm sewers and other facilities and utilities traversing a
proposed fill area shall be buried a minimum of three feet from top of pipe to
existing grade, or the fill shall be constructed in such area prior to
excavating for the installation of said sewers and utilities.
   7.   The minimum size storm sewer shall be 15 inches in diameter unless a
variation in size is approved by the Borough Engineer or his designee.
   8.   Slopes steeper than two horizontal to one vertical and of more than 15
feet in vertical height shall be separated by a level berm of at least four
feet in width at intervals of no more than 15 feet vertically.
      A.   Cut slopes which are steeper than that specified in Subsection 8.,
above, shall not require separation by a level berm of at least four feet
vertically; provided the following requirements are satisfied:
         (1)   The material in which the slope is cut is rock.
         (2)   A written statement, signed and sealed by a professional soils
engineer is delivered to the Borough Engineer or his designee stating that the
requirement of level berms may be eliminated without creating a condition
damaging to the cut face of an excavation or hazardous to adjacent property or
lives, or in the alternative, recommending, to the Borough Engineer or his
designee a safe, sufficient and appropriate interval for placement of level
berets of at least four feet in width.
         (3)   Having considered the likelihood of a landslide, and protection
of adjacent property and lives, the Borough Engineer shall deliver a written
statement, signed and sealed, to the Borough concurring in the opinion of the
professional soils engineer retained on behalf of the applicant.
   9.   On slopes of two horizontal to one vertical, or less steep, the four-
foot level berms will not be required unless deemed necessary by the Borough
Engineer or his designee.
   10.   Drainage ditches with a grade of 7%, or a velocity of less than seven
feet per second, shall be grassed and sloped in such a manner that they can be
conveniently cut and maintained.
   11.   Drainage ditches with a grade of 7% or greater, or a velocity more
than seven feet per second, shall be paved with concrete, bituminous mixture,
brick, half pipe, rubble or other hard surface material.
   12.   Drainage structures, storm sewers and appurtenances shall be of proper
design and so constructed as to carry surface water and any subsurface water
encountered to the nearest practical storm drain or natural watercourse
approved by the Borough Engineer or his designee as a safe place to deposit and
receive such waters.
   13.   Approval by the Borough Engineer or his designee shall not relieve the
owner of his legal responsibilities to adjacent property owners.
   14.   If, in the opinion of the Borough Engineer or his designee, the
proposed drainage structures, storm sewers and appurtenances are not adequate,
he shall require the addition of such facilities as necessary to prevent
erosion damage and to satisfactorily carry off both surface waters and
subsurface drainage.
(Ord. 965, 10/13/2022)
§ 9-115. Maintenance.
   1.   The owner of any property on which an excavation or fill has been made
shall maintain in good condition and repair all retaining walls, cribbing,
drainage structures, fences, ground cover and other protective devices as
established by permit.
   2.   The continued use of said area shall be contingent upon its maintenance
and upkeep in a manner satisfactory to the Borough and shall be subject to such
further conditions as the Borough may prescribe from time to time.
   3.   The certificate of completion issued under § 9-109, Subsection 6., may
at any time be revoked by the Council upon a finding of the Borough Engineer or
his designee that the conditions of the permit are not being observed and that
conditions exist that prejudice the health, safety and welfare of any person,
persons or property. Such procedure is in addition to the procedure outlined
for hazardous conditions in §
9-108, "Abatement of Hazardous Conditions."
(Ord. 965, 10/13/2022)

property or right- of-way lines of streets in order to permit the normal
rounding of the edge without encroaching on the abutting property. A fence not
less than four feet in height, approved by the Borough Engineer or his designee
and meeting Borough fence requirements, shall be placed at the top of all cuts
or fill slopes in excess of 1 ½ horizontal to one vertical. Before a grading
permit is issued, a bond shall be required as provided in § 9-105, to guarantee
the protection of steep slopes.
   2.   The acceptance by the Borough of such statement of the permit holder or
the issuing by the Borough of a certificate of completion in no way relieves
the permit holder, property owner or future property owners, from the
responsibility to maintain the project in a safe and acceptable condition.
   3.   Whenever it is found that the project or work covered by a Certificate
of Completion has been extended or altered without a permit to do so; or that
any retaining walls, cribbings, drainage structures, fence or other protective
means or device shown on the approved plans and/or specifications submitted for
a permit have not been built, or maintained in good order and repair, the
Borough Engineer shall advise the Borough Engineer or his designee of all of
the work required to be done so as to make the project substantial and safe.
The Borough Engineer or his designee shall give written notice to the property
owner, specifying the defective condition(s) and stating that unless such

      B.   As provided for in this Part, every owner shall be responsible for
regulating the proper and lawful use and maintenance of every dwelling which
he, she or it owns.
      C.   As provided for in this Part, every owner shall also be responsible
for regulating the conduct and activities of the occupants of every regulated

      D.   In order to achieve those ends, every owner of a regular rental unit
shall regulate the conduct and activity of the occupants thereof, both
contractually and through enforcement, as more fully set forth below.
      E.   This Section shall not be construed as diminishing or relieving, in
any way, the responsibility of occupants or their guests for their conduct or
activity; nor shall it be construed as an assignment, transfer or projection
over or onto any owner of any responsibility or liability which occupants or
their guests may have as a result of their conduct or activity under any
private cause of action, civil or criminal enforcement proceeding, or criminal
law; nor shall this Section be construed so as to require an owner to indemnify
or defend occupants or their guests when any such action or proceeding is
brought against the occupant based upon the occupant’s conduct or activity.
Nothing herein is intended to impose any additional civil/criminal liability
upon owners other than that which is imposed by existing law.
      F.   This Part is not intended, nor shall its effect be, to limit any
other enforcement remedies which may be available to the borough against an
owner, occupant or guest thereof.

specified repairs, maintenance tasks, alterations or remodeling. In such case,
however, such agreement between the owner and occupant must be in writing. Such

         (1)   The agreement of the parties is entered into in good faith and
not for the purpose of evading the obligations of the owner or occupant.
         (2)   The agreement does not diminish or affect the obligation of the

   5.   Written Rental Agreement.

writing. No oral leases and no oral modifications thereof are permitted. All

subsection included in a rental agreement shall be unenforceable.

and the behavior of occupants and guests in the common areas, the owner shall
be directly responsible for the behavior of occupants and guests in the common
area as if the owner were an occupant.
   9.   Enforcement.
      A.   Within 10 days after receipt of written notice from the Code
Enforcement Officer that an occupant of a regulated rental unit has violated a
provision of this Part, the owner shall take immediate steps to remedy the

violation.
      B.   Within 20 days after receipt of a notice of violation, the owner

future if the violation recurs.
      C.   The Code Enforcement Officer shall review the report and, if

permit the occupant to occupy the premises during the subsequent licensing
period.

this Part, he or she shall not be eligible to rent any other regulated unit

fail or refuse to comply with any notice from the Borough or its Code
Enforcement Officer to correct a violation relating to maintenance and repair
of the premises under any code within the period of time stated in such notice,
the Borough may cause the violation to be corrected. There shall be imposed
upon the owner a charge of the actual costs involved, plus 10% of said costs
for each time the Borough shall cause a violation to be corrected; and the
owner of the premises shall be billed after same has been completed. Any such
bill which remains unpaid and outstanding after the time specified therein for
payment shall be grounds for the imposition of a municipal lien upon the
premises as provided by law. Such a lien may be reduced to judgment and
enforced and collected as provided by law, together with interest at the legal
rate and court costs. The remedies provided by this paragraph are not exclusive
and the Borough and its Code Enforcement Officer may invoke such other remedies

the following rules and regulations governing short-term rentals within the
boundaries of the Borough.
(Ord. 960, 7/8/2021)
§ 13-303. Interpretation.
   1.   This Part is not intended to, and does not, excuse any landowner from
compliance with the East McKeesport Borough Zoning Ordinance, as amended from
time to time. Whenever possible, this Part and the Zoning Ordinance should be
construed and interpreted as being consistent, and not in conflict.
   2.   This Part is not intended to, and does not supersede the declarations
or covenants in a planned community where a short-term rental may be located.

§ 15-409. Residential Permit Parking.
   1.   Findings and Purpose. The Borough of East McKeesport finds that:
      A.   Certain residential areas in the Borough of East McKeesport are
subjected to commuter vehicle parking, therefore, depriving the residents of
those areas of spaces in which to park their own vehicles;
      B.   Those residential streets are also subjected to a high degree of
commuter traffic which substautially reduces the quality of the ambient air
level; and,
      C.   The establishment of a parking permit program for certain affected
areas should facilitate efficient movement of traffic by providing for parking
preference during certain hours of the day and days of the week. Therefore, the
Borough of East McKeesport considers it to be in the interest of the people of
the Borough of East McKeesport to provide for the establishment of a
residential permit parking program to insure primary access to available
parking spaces by neighborhood residents and also to provide a cleaner ambient
air level.
   2.   Definitions. For the purpose of this Section, words and terms listed in
this subsection, as follows, shall have the following meanings:
      COMMUTER VEHICLE - a motor vehicle parked in a residential area by a
person not a resident of that residential area;
      PROPRIETOR - a person who owns or leases real estate within a residential
area of which he is not a resident, but who owns or manages a business
enterprise or professional office maintained at that address; for the purpose
of this Section, a proprietor shall be entitled to one parking permit for that
business or professional office address;
      RESIDENT - a person who owns or leases real property within a residential
area and who maintains either a voting residence, or bona fide occupancy, or
both, at that address;
      RESIDENTIAL AREA - a contiguous area containing public highways or parts
of public highways primarily abutted by residential property or residential and
non-business property (such as schools, parks, places of worship, hospitals and
nursing homes).
   3.   Criteria. The residential areas designated in subsection (4) of this
Section are those deemed impacted and hence eligible for residential parking on
the basis of the following criteria:
      A.   During any period between the hours of 7 a.m. and 6:30 p.m., Monday
through Saturday, except legal holidays, the number of vehicles parked (or
standing), legally or illegally, on the streets in the area is equal to 70% or
more of the legal, on-street parking capacity of the area. For the purpose of
this criterion, a legal parking space shall be 20 linear feet.
      B.   During the same period as specified in subsection (A), directly
above, 10% or more of the vehicles parked (or standing) on the streets in the
area are not registered in the name of a person residing in the area. For the
purpose of this criterion, the latest available information from the Bureau of
Motor Vehicles and Licensing of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
regarding registration of motor vehicles shall be used.
Provided, in determining that a specific area identified as impacted and
eligible for residential permit parking is designated as a residential permit
parking area, the following factors are taken into consideration:
         (1)   The local and metropolitan needs with respect to clean air and
environment;
         (2)   The possibility of a reduction in total vehicle miles driven in
the Borough of East McKeesport;
         (3)   The likelihood of alleviatiug traffic congestion, illegal
parking and related health and safety hazards;
         (4)   The proximity of public transportation to the residential area;
         (5)   The desire and need of the residents for residential permit
parking and their willingness to bear the administrative costs in connection
with it; and,
         (6)   The need for parking in excess of the residential permit parking
program in proximity to establishments located in the residential permit
parking area and used by the general public for religious, health or
educational purposes.
   4.   Designation of Residential Permit Parking Areas.. The following are
designated as residential permit parking areas:
 
Area Bounded By And Including

      Signs shall be erected along the streets in each residential permit
parking area, indicating the days, hours, locations and conditions under which

shall be made to the Chief of Police by the person desiring the permit, who
shall be only the owner or the driver of a motor vehicle who resides on or is a
proprietor of property immediately adjacent to a street or other location
within a residential parking permit area. A separate application shall be
required for each motor vehicle, and each application shall be accompanied by a
permit fee, set pursuant to a resolution of the Borough Council, which shall be
for the use of the Borough of East McKeesport, to be applied to the cost of
administering the residential permit parking program. Each application shall
contain the following information: the name of the owner or the driver, as the
case may be, of the motor vehicle; the address of the resident or the
proprietor, as the case may be; the make, model and registration number of the
motor vehicle; and the driver number as taken from the applicant's current
driver's license. At the discretion of the Chief of Police, the applicant shall
be required, at the time of making application, to present his driver's license
and the vehicle registration card.
   6.   Issuance of Permit. Upon receipt of the application and the permit fee,
and determination by him that the information upon the application shows that
the applicant is entitled to a residential parking permit, the Chief of Police
shall issue to the applicant a residential parking permit, which shall be valid
for the remainder of the calendar year. The permit shall display the serial and
registration numbers of the motor vehicles, the residential parking area
number, and the expiration date. The permit shall be renewable annually before
the expiration date, upon making application for renewal and payment of the
permit fee. It shall be unlawful and a violation of this Section for any person
to display other than the current and valid permit while standing or parking in
a residential permit parking area at any time when those permits are to be
displayed.
   7.   Temporary and Exemption Parking Permits. Temporary parking permits may
be issued by the Chief of Police, upon payment of a fee established pursuant to
a resolution, to bona fide visitors of residents of a designated residential
permit parking area, and exemption parking permits may be issued, without
payment of a fee, to handicapped persons.
   8.   Responsibility of Permit Holder.
      A.   Notwithstanding any provision of this Section to the contrary, the
holder of a residential parking permit shall be permitted to stand or park a
motor vehicle operated by him in any designated residential parking area during
those times when parking of motor vehicles is permitted in that area. While a
vehicle for which a residential parking permit has been issued is so parked,
that permit shall be displayed so as to be clearly visible through the
windshield of the vehicle. A residential parking permit shall not guarantee or
reserve to the holder a parking space within a designated residential permit
parking area.
      B.   A residential parking permit shall not authorize its holder to stand
or park a motor vehicle in any place where or at any time when stopping,
standing or parking of motor vehicles is prohibited or set aside for other
specified types of vehicles, nor shall the permit exempt its holder from the
observance of any traffic or parking regulation other than residential permit
parking regulation or restriction.
      C.   No person other than the permit holder whose name appears on the
permit shall use a residential parking permit or display it on a vehicle
operated; any such use or display by a person other than the permit holder
shall constitute a violation of this Section by the permit holder and by the
person who so used or displayed the parking permit.
      D.   It shall constitute a violation of this Section for any person
falsely to represent himself as eligible for a residential parking permit or to
furnish false information in an application to the Chief of Police in order to
obtain a residential parking permit.
         (1)   Revocation of Permits. The Chief of Police shall have authority
to revoke the residential parking permit of any permit holder found to be in
violation of any provision of this Section. Upon written notification to him of
the revocation, the permit holder shall surrender the permit to the Chief of
Police. Failure to do so, when so requested, shall constitute a violation of
this Section. Provided: any person receiving such a notice may, within 10 days
after the date of the notice, appeal to the Borough Council for a hearing on
the revocation, and the decision of the Borough Council shall be final.

   1.   Prohibited Discharge Standards.
      A.   General Prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be
introduced into the POTW any- pollutant or wastewater which causes pass through
or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW
whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any
other National, State or local pretreatment standards or requirements.
      B.   Specific Prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be
introduced into the POTW the following pollutants, substances or wastewater:
         (1)   Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the POTW
including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed-cup flashpoint of
less than 140°F (60°C) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21.
         (2)   Wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 or otherwise causing
corrosive structural damage to the POTW or equipment.

activity in the treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case
wastewater which causes the temperature at the introduction into the treatment
plant to exceed 104°F (40°C).
         (6)   Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil or products of
mineral oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference or pass through.
         (7)   Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors
or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and
safety problems.
         (8)   Trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points
designated by MACM in accordance with §
18-703(4) of this Part.
         (9)   Noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids or other wastewater
which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to
create a public nuisance or a hazard to life, or to prevent entry into the
sewers for maintenance or repair.
         (10)   Wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by the
treatment process such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning
solutions, which consequently imparts color to the treatment plant's effluent,
thereby violating MACM NPDES permit.
         (11)   Wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes except
in compliance with applicable State or Federal regulations.
         (12)   Stormwater, surface water, ground water, artesian well water,

the point of discharge into the POTW, or at any point in the POTW, of more than
5% or any single reading over 10% of the lower explosive limit of the meter.
      C.   Pollutants, substances or wastewater prohibited by this Part shall
not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to
the POTW.
   2.   National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The categorical
pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471,
are hereby incorporated.
      A.   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, MACM may
impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6
(c).
      B.   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, MACM shall impose an
alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
      C.   A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment
standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive
provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are
fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the
categorical pretreatment standard.
      D.   A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard
in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.
   3.   State Pretreatment Standards. (Reserved.)
   4.   Local Limits. No industrial user shall discharge wastewater containing
a mass of any pollutant which, when taken together with the mass of that
pollutant discharged by all other industrial users will cause the mass of the
pollutant to exceed the mass of that pollutant specified in the Headworks
Industrial Allowance which has been approved by the Approval Authority for the
POTW into which the industrial user discharges. MACM may establish local limits
regulating the discharge of specific pollutants by industrial users.
Discharging any pollutant in excess of a local limit or an industrial user's
permit shall constitute a violation of this Part.
   5.   MACM's Right of Revision. MACM reserves the right to establish, by
ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or
requirements on discharges to the POTW.
   6.   Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in
any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless
expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement.
MACM may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the
imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
(Ord. 810, 4/12/2001, §2)
§ 18-703. Pretreatment of Wastewater.
   1.   Pretreatment Facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as
necessary to comply with this Part and shall achieve compliance with all
categorical pretreatment standards, local limits and the prohibitions set out
in §
18-702(1) of this Part within the time limitations specified by EPA, the State
or MACM, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance
shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed
plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to
MACM for review, and shall be acceptable to MACM before such facilities are
constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way
relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as
necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to MACM under the provisions of
this Part.
   2.   Additional Pretreatment Measures.
      A.   Whenever deemed necessary, MACM may require users to restrict their
discharge peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged
only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge,
separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other
conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's
compliance with the requirements of this Part.
      B.   MACM may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and
maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-
control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit
may be issued solely for flow equalization.
      C.   Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of MACM, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater
containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that such
interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception
units shall be of type and capacity approved by MACM and shall be so located to
be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be
inspected, cleaned and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at their
expense.
      D.   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
   3.   Accidental Discharge/Slug Control Plans. At least once every 2 years,
MACM shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an
accidental discharge/slug control plan. MACM may require any user to develop,
submit for approval and implement such a plan. Alternatively, MACM may develop
such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall
address, at a minimum, the following:
      A.   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges.
      B.   Description of stored chemicals.
      C.   Procedures for immediately notifying MACM of any accidental or slug
discharge, as required by § 18-706(6) of this Part.
      D.   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of contaminant structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
   4.   Hauled Wastewater.
      A.   Septic tank waste or municipal digested sewage sludge may be
introduced into the POTW only at locations designated by MACM, and at such
times as are established by MACM. Such waste shall not violate §
18-702 of this Part or any other requirements established by MACM. MACM may
require waste haulers to obtain wastewater discharge permits.
      B.   MACM shall require haulers of industrial waste to obtain wastewater
discharge permits. MACM may require generators of hauled industrial waste to
obtain wastewater discharge permits. MACM also may prohibit the disposal of
hauled industrial waste. The discharge of hauled industrial waste is subject to
all other requirements of this Part.
      C.   Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations
designated by MACM. No load may be discharged without prior consent of MACM.
MACM may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with
applicable standards. MACM may require the industrial waste hauler to provide a
waste analysis of any load prior to discharge.
      D.   Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for
every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the
industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and
addresses of sources of waste and volume and characteristics of waste. The form
shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste constituents and
whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes.
(Ord. 810, 4/12/2001, §3)
§ 18-704. Wastewater Discharge Permit Application.
   1.   Wastewater Analysis. When requested by MACM, a user must submit
information on the nature and characteristics of its wastewater within 60 days
of the request. MACM is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may
periodically require users to update this information.
   2.   Wastewater Discharge Permit Requirement.
      A.   No significant industrial user shall discharge wastewater into the
POTW without first obtaining a wastewater discharge permit from MACM, except
that a significant industrial user that has filed a timely application pursuant
to §18-704(3) of this part may continue to discharge for the time period
specified therein.
      B.   MACM may require other users to obtain wastewater discharge permits
as necessary to carry out the purposes of this Part.
      C.   Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge
permit shall be deemed a violation of this part and subjects the wastewater
discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in §§ 18-710 through 18-712 of
this Part. Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a permittee
of its obligation to comply with all Federal and State pretreatment standards
or requirements or with any other requirements of Federal, State and local law.
   3.   Wastewater Discharge Permitting; Existing Connections. Any user
required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit who was discharging wastewater
into the POTW prior to the effective date of this Part and who wishes to
continue such discharges in the future, shall, within 60 days after said date,
apply to MACM for a wastewater discharge permit in accordance with §
18-704(5) of this Part, and shall not cause or allow discharges to the POTW to
continue after 120 days of the effective date of this part except in accordance
with a wastewater discharge permit issued by MACM.
   4.   Wastewater Discharge Permitting; New Connections. Any user required to
obtain a wastewater discharge permit who proposes to begin or recommence
discharging into the POTW must obtain such permit prior to the beginning or
recommencing of such discharge. An application for this wastewater discharge
permit, in accordance with §
18-704(5) of this Part, must be filed at least 90 days prior to the date upon
which any discharge will begin or recommence.

      I.   To reflect a transfer of the facility ownership or operation to a
new owner or operator.
   5.   Wastewater Discharge Permit Transfer. Wastewater discharge permits may
be transferred to a new owner or operator only if the permittee gives at least
60 days advance notice to MACM and MACM approves the wastewater discharge
permit transfer. The notice to MACM must include a written certification by the
new owner or operator which:
      A.   States that the new owner and/or operator has no immediate intent to
change the facility's operations and processes.
      B.   Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur.
      C.   Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing
wastewater discharge permit.
      Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the wastewater
discharge permit void as of the date of facility transfer.
   6.   Wastewater Discharge Permit Revocation. MACM may revoke a wastewater
discharge permit for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following
reasons:
      A.   Failure to notify MACM of significant changes to the wastewater
prior to the changed discharge.
      B.   Failure to provide prior notification to MACM of changed conditions
pursuant to § 18-706(5) of this Part.
      C.   Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in
the wastewater discharge permit application.
      D.   Falsifying self-monitoring reports.
      E.   Tampering with monitoring equipment.
      F.   Refusing to allow MACM timely access to the facility premises and
records.
      G.   Failure to meet effluent limitations.
      H.   Failure to pay fines.
      I.   Failure to pay sewer charges.
      J.   Failure to meet compliance schedules.
      K.   Failure to complete a wastewater survey or the wastewater discharge
permit application.
      L.   Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of business
ownership of a permitted facility.
      M.   Violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement, or any terms
of the wastewater discharge permit or this Part.
      Wastewater discharge permits shall be voidable upon cessation of
operations or transfer of business ownership. All wastewater discharge permits
issued to a particular user are void upon the issuance of a new wastewater
discharge permit to that user.
   7.   Wastewater Discharge Permit Reissuance. A user with an expiring
wastewater discharge permit shall apply for wastewater discharge permit re-
issuance by submitting a complete permit application, in accordance with §
18-704(5) of this Part, a minimum of 180 days prior to the expiration of the
user's existing wastewater discharge permit.
   8.   Regulation of Waste Received from Other Jurisdictions.
      A.   If another municipality, or user located within another
municipality, contributes wastewater to the POTW, MACM shall enter into an
intermunicipal agreement with the contributing municipality.
      B.   Prior to entering into an agreement required by subsection (A),
above, MACM shall request the following information from the contributing
municipality.
         (1)   A description of the quality and volume of wastewater discharged
to the POTW by the contributing municipality.
         (2)   An inventory of all users located within the contributing
municipality that are discharging to the POTW.
         (3)   Such other information as MACM may deem necessary.
      C.   An intermunicipal agreement, as required by subsection (A), above,
shall contain the following conditions:
         (1)   A requirement for the contributing municipality to adopt a sewer
use ordinance which is at least as stringent as this Part and local limits
which are at least as stringent as those set out in §
18-702(4) of this Part. The requirement shall specify that such ordinance and
limits must be revised as necessary to reflect changes made to MACM's ordinance
or local limits.
         (2)   A requirement for the contributing municipality to submit a
revised user inventory on at least an annual basis.
         (3)   A provision specifying which pretreatment implementation
activities, including wastewater discharge permit issuance, inspection and
sampling and enforcement, will be conducted by the contributing municipality;
which of these activities will be conducted by MACM; and which of these
activities will be conducted jointly by the contributing municipality and MACM.
         (4)   A requirement for the contributing municipality to provide MACM
with access to all information that the contributing municipality obtains as
part of its pretreatment activities.
         (5)   A provision ensuring MACM access to the facilities of users
located within the contributing municipality's jurisdictional boundaries for
the purpose of inspection, sampling and any other duties deemed necessary by
MACM.

commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject
to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to MACM a report
containing the information described in § 18-706(1)(B)(4-6) of this Part. For
users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in
accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a
reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users
subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable
pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation),
this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate
sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with §
18-704(6) of this Part.
   4.   Periodic Compliance Reports.
      A.   All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by
MACM but in no case less than twice per year (in June and December), submit a
report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge
which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated
average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic
compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with §18-704(6)
of this Part.
      B.   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in n good working
order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
      C.   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this part monitors
any pollutant more frequently than required by MACM, using the procedures
prescribed in § 18-706(11) of this Part, the results of this monitoring shall
be included in the report.
   5.   Reports of Changed Conditions. Each user must notify MACM of any
planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which might
alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater at least 90 days before
the change:
      A.   MACM may require the user to submit such information as may be
deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of
a wastewater discharge permit application under §
18-704(5) of this Part.
      B.   MACM may issue a wastewater discharge permit under §
18-704(7) of this Part or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under
§18-704(5) of this Part in response to changed conditions or anticipated
changed conditions.
      C.   For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but
are not limited to, flow increases of 20% or greater, and the discharge of any
previously unreported pollutants.
   6.   Reports of Potential Problems.
      A.   In the case of any discharge including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge or a slug load, that may cause potential problems
for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify MACM of the
incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type
of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by
the user.
      B.   Within 5 days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by MACM, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the
discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future
occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss,
damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
POTW, natural resources or any other damage to person or property; nor shall
such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties or other liability
which may be imposed pursuant to this Part.
      C.   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a
discharge described in subsection (A), above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
   7.   Reports from Unpermitted Users. All users not required to obtain a
wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to MACM as MACM
may require.
   8.   Notice of Violation/Repeat Sampling and Reporting. If sampling
performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify MACM within 24
hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the
sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to MACM
within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required
to resample if MACM monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or
if MACM samples between user's initial sampling and when the user receives the
results of this sampling.
   9. Notification of the Discharge of Hazardous Waste.
      A.   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous wastes shall
notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director and State
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR, part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous wastes
as set forth in 40 CFR, Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type
of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the user discharges more than 100
kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also
shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known
and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All
notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge
commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once
for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed
conditions must be submitted under §18-706(5) of this part. The notification
requirement in this part does not apply to pollutants already reported by users
subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring
requirements of §§
18-706(1),
18-706(3) and
18-706(4) of this Part.
      B.   Dischargers are exempt from the requirement of subsection (A),
above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15
kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity
of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e),
requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user
discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
      C.   In the case of any new regulations under §3001 of RCRA identifying
additional characteristics hazardous waste or listing any additional substance
as a hazardous waste, the user must notify MACM, the EPA Regional Waste
Management Division Director and State hazardous waste authorities of the
discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such
regulations.
      D.   In the case of any notification made under this Section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
      E.   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance
not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this Part, a permit issued
thereunder or any applicable Federal or State law.
   10.   Analytical Requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling
or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses
must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA.
   11.   Sample Collection.
      A.   Except as indicated in subsection (B), below, the user must collect
wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In
the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, MACM may authorize the use
of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user
demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent
being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance
with instantaneous discharge limits.
      B.   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
   12.   Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the
date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern.
   13.   Record Keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
Part shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records
of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this
Part and additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring
activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records
shall include the date, exact place, method and time of sampling, and the name
of the person(s) taking the samples; the date analyses were performed; who
performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the
results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of
at least 3 years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration
of any litigation concerning the user or MACM, or where the user has been
specifically notified of a longer retention period by MACM.
(Ord. 810, 4/12/2001, §6)
§ 18-707. Compliance Monitoring.
   1.   Right of Entry; Inspection and Sampling. MACM shall have the right to
enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with
all requirements of this part and any wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder. User shall MACM ready access to all parts of the premises for
the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying and the
performance of any additional duties.
      A.   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, MACM will be permitted to enter without delay for
the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
      B.   MACM shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or
require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/
or metering of the user's operations.
      C.   MACM may require the user to install monitoring equipment as
necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained
at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own
expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be
calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
      D.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
user at the written or verbal request of MACM and shall not be replaced. The
costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
      E.   Unreasonable delays in allowing MACM access to the user's premises
shall be a violation of this part.
(Ord. 810, 4/12/2001, §7)
§ 18-708. Confidential Information.
   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits and monitoring
programs and from MACM's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available
to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and
is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of MACM, that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable State law. Any such
request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data.
When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such
information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might
disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for
inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request
to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment
program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the
report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data"
as defined in 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information
and will be available to the public without restriction.
(Ord. 810, 4/12/2001, §8)
§ 18-709. Publication of Users in Significant Noncompliance.
   MACM shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the
municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users which, during he
previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance
shall mean:
      A.   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of wastewater measurements taken during a 6 month
period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant
parameter by any amount.
      B.   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter
during a 6 month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum
limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD,
TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
      C.   Any other discharge violation that MACM believes has caused, alone
or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through,
including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public.
      D.   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment, or has resulted in MACM's exercise of its
emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge.
      E.   Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement
order for starting construction, completing construction or attaining final
compliance.
      F.   Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any required
reports; including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with
categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports,
and reports on compliance with compliance schedules.
      G.   Failure to accurately report noncompliance.
      H.   Any other violation(s) which MACM determines will adversely affect
the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.
(Ord. 810, 4/12/2001, §9)
§ 18-710. Administrative Enforcement Remedies.
   1.   Notification of Violation. When MACM finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this Part, a wastewater discharge permit
or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
MACM may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within 5 days of
the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required
actions, shall be submitted by the user to MACM. Submission of this plan in no
way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this Section shall limit the
authority of MACM to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
   2.   Consent Orders. MACM may enter into consent orders, assurances of
voluntary compliance or other similar documents establishing an agreement with
any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific
action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time
period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and
effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to §§
18-710(4) and
18-710(5) of this Part and shall be judicially enforceable.
   3.   Show Cause Hearing. MACM may order a user which has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this Part, a wastewater discharge permit
or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to
appear before MACM and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should
not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place
for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action
and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 10 days prior
to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of
the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
   4.   Compliance Orders. When MACM finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this part, a wastewater discharge permit
or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
MACM may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing
that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does
not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated.
   Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A
compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a
pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the
user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation.
Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user.
   5.   Cease and Desist Orders. When MACM finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this part, a wastewater discharge permit
or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, MACM may issue an order
to the user directing it to case and desist all such violations and directing
the user to:
      A.   Immediately comply with all requirements.
      B.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
      Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   6.   Administrative Fines.
      A.   When MACM finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this Part, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, MACM may assess a
civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $25,000 per day for each violation.
Each violation for each separate day shall constitute a separate and distinct
offense. MACM may recover its costs for reestablishing the operating of the
POTW in addition to any civil penalty imposed hereunder. In addition, MACM may
recover attorney's fees, all court costs and all other expenses of litigation
to the extent permitted by law.
      B.   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
MACM to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within
30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, MACM may
convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful,
the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to
the user. MACM may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement
actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
      C.   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   7.   Emergency Suspensions. MACM may immediately suspend a user's discharge,
after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to
stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or
cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons. MACM may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and
opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the
POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
      A.   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, MACM may take such
steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream or
endangerment to any individuals. MACM may allow the user to recommence its
discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of MACM that the
period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in §
18-710(8) of this Part are initiated against the user.
      B.   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to MACM prior to the date of any show cause or
termination hearing under §§
18-710(3) or
18-710(8) of this Part.
   Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to
any emergency suspension under this Section.
   8.   Termination of Discharge. In addition to the provisions in §
18-705(6) of this Part, any user who violates the following conditions is
subject to discharge termination:
      A.   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions.
      B.   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge.
      C.   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge.
      D.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring or sampling.
      E.   Violation of the pretreatment standards in §
18-702 of this Part.
   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and
be offered an opportunity to show cause under §
18-710(3) of this part why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of
this option by MACM shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user.
(Ord. 810, 4/12/2001, §10)
§ 18-711. Judicial Enforcement Remedies.
   1.   Injunctive Relief. When MACM finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this Part, a wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, MACM may petition the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County
through MACM's attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent
injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance
of the wastewater discharge permit, order or other requirement imposed by this
part on activities of the user. MACM may also seek such other action as is
appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the
user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief
shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the user.
   2.   Civil Penalties.
      A.   A user who has violated, or continues to violate any provisions of
this Part, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to MACM for a
maximum civil penalty not to exceed $25,000 per violation per day. In the case
of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue
for each day during the period of violation.
      B.   MACM may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs and other
expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and
monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by MACM.
      C.   In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user and any other factor as
justice requires.
      D.   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   3.   Criminal Penalties. Any person who knowingly makes any false
statements, representation or certification in any application, record, report,
plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this
part, or pretreatment permit, or who falsifies, tampers with or knowingly
renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this Part
shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to a fine of not more than $1,000 plus
costs and, in default of payment of said fine and costs, to a term of
imprisonment of not more than 30 days. Each occurrence shall be a separate
offense. This section shall not preclude prosecution under the Pennsylvania
Crimes Code. [Ord. 828]
   4.   Remedies Nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this part are not
exclusive. MACM may take any, all or any combination of these actions against a
noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in
accordance with MACM's enforcement response plan. However, MACM may take other
action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, MACM is
empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant
user.

§ 18-712. Supplemental Enforcement Action.
(Reserved.)
(Ord. 810, 4/12/2001, §12)
§ 18-713. Affirmative Defenses to Discharge Violations.
   1.   Upset.
      A.   For the purposes of this Section, "upset" means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance or careless or
improper operation.
      B.   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of subsection (C), below, are met.
      C.   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or
other relevant evidence that:
         (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset.
         (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures.
         (3)   The user has submitted the following information to MACM within
24 hours of becoming aware of the upset.
            (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance.
            (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue.
            (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      D.   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
      E.   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
      F.   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
   2.   Prohibited Discharge Standards. A user shall have an affirmative
defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the
general provisions in §
18-702(1)(A) of this part or the specific prohibitions in §§
18-702(1)(B)(3) through (17) excluding (8) of this Part if it can prove that it
did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in
conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or
interference and that either:
      A.   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through
or interference.
      B.   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when
MACM was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
   3.   Bypass.
      A.   For the purposes of this Section,
         (1)   "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from
any portion of a user's treatment facility.
         (2)   "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
      B.   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provision of subsections (C) and (D) of this Section.
      C.   Notice of a Bypass.
         (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to MACM, at least 10 days before the date of the bypass, if
possible.
         (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to MACM of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the
time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be
provided within 5 days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The
written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the
duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has
not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps
taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
MACM may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report
has been received within 24 hours.
      D.   Bypass Exceptions.
         (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and MACM may taken enforcement action
against the user for a bypass, unless:
            (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury or severe property damage.
            (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as
the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance.
            (c)   The user submitted notices as required under subsection (C)
of this Section.
         (2)   MACM may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if MACM determines that it will meet the three conditions
listed in subsection D(1) of this Section.

§ 18-803. Materials that may be Prohibited in Sewers.
   1.   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into any sewer line
substances, materials, waters or wastes if it appears likely in the opinion of
the Borough, or its designated agent, that such wastes can harm the sewage
disposal system or the treatment processes or equipment, or can otherwise
endanger life, limb, public property or constitute a nuisance.
   2.   In forming their opinion as to the acceptability of these waters, the
Borough, or its designated agent, will give consideration to such factors as to
the qualities of subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the
sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, nature of the sewage treatment
process, capacity of the wastewater treatment plan, degree of treatability of
wastes in the sewage treatment plan, and other pertinent factors.
   3.   In all cases, the Borough, or its designated agent, shall require
compliance by the user with all aspects of latest applicable ALCOSAN
Pretreatment Standards.
   4.   See provision Part 4 of the ALCOSAN Pretreatment Standards.
      A.   Plumbing to be in Good Repair. Every building or room occupied or
used as a food preparation facility or restaurant shall be well drained. All
soil pipes, waste pipes, drains or other plumbing fixtures shall be of adequate
size to enable the passage of any waste intended to pass through it to the main
public sewer. All drains, sewers, waste and soil pipes, traps and water in gas
pipes shall, at all times, be kept in good repair and order so that no gases or
odor shall escape therefrom and so that the same shall not leak, and all vent
pipes shall be kept in good order and repair and free from obstruction.
      B.   Installation of Grease Interceptors and Grease Traps.
         (1)   Every building, room or space or part thereof used as a food
preparation facility or restaurant, whether new or existing, shall install or
cause to be installed, if not already installed, a grease interceptor or grease
trap. The type of installation shall be determined by the total fixture flow
through rate of potential grease laden fixtures discharging through the
building sewage lines as determined by the Allegheny County Health Department
(ACHD) Plumbing Division. For flow through rates 35 gpm or less, an internal
grease trap may be installed in certain existing structures used as food
preparation facilities and restaurants. For flow through rates exceeding 35
gpm, an external, underground grease interceptor must be installed in all new
structures, major remodeling or renovation of existing structures, or changes
of use involving food preparation facilities or restaurants.
         (2)   Said grease trap or grease interceptor shall be installed at an
appropriate location along the sewer line between the food preparation facility
or restaurant and the line’s entry in the main public newline. An inspection
site tee shall be installed between the interceptor discharge and connect to
the public sewer system. All installations shall be in accordance with the ACHD
Plumbing Code and Regulations. No solid waste devices, such as waste grinders,
disposals, potato peelers, etc. shall discharge through the grease trap or
grease interceptor. Only potential grease laden fixtures may discharge through
the trap or interceptor.
         (3)   All new food preparation facilities and restaurants shall be
required to install an exterior, underground grease interceptor of a minimum
1,000 gallon capacity, regardless of the flow through rate.
         (4)   In all existing food preparation facilities and restaurants
there shall be installed a grease interceptor or grease trap as determined by
the flow through rate, as detailed above, if not already installed. In existing
facilities where it is determined by the Borough that a grease trap is not
sufficient, the Borough may require that a grease interceptor (as detailed
above) be installed. Such insufficiency shall be evidenced by excessive amounts
of grease being discharged into the public sewer system by a facility. All
existing food preparation facilities and restaurants shall, at a change of
ownership or remodeling or renovation thereof, install an exterior, underground
grease interceptor of a minimum 1,000 gallon capacity. In all existing
structures, buildings or parts thereof in which there is a change of use or
occupancy to that of a food preparation facility or restaurant there shall be
installed a grease interceptor of a minimum 1,000 gallon capacity, regardless
of the flow through rate.
         (5)   All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the
wastewater superintendent and shall be located under cover and so as to be
readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Interceptors shall
not be located so as to receive rainwater or unpolluted run-off.
         (6)   Grease and oil interceptors shall be constructed of impervious
materials capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperature.
They shall be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped with easily
removable covers which, when bolted in place, shall be gastight and watertight.
      C.   Maintenance of Grease Interceptors and Grease Traps.
         (1)   All grease interceptors and grease traps shall be maintained and
kept in good working order at all times. The interceptor or trap shall limit
the amount of grease discharge into the public sewer system to levels not
exceeding those permitted by ALCOSAN. Oil/grease discharges shall not exceed
200 ppm downstream of the interceptor or tap.
         (2)   It shall be the duty and responsibility of all owners, lessees
or agents of all food preparation facilities and restaurants to, at a minimum
of annually, inspect the grease interceptor or trap. A written record shall be
kept of all inspections. The inspection record shall, at a minimum, list the
name (inspector and company), address and phone number of the inspection/
disposal company, the method and frequency of cleaning scheduled and the date
of the cleaning/inspection. Such records shall be immediately presented to the
Borough upon request. A more frequent cleaning/inspection schedule may be
ordered to be performed by the facility when it is determined by the Borough
that the facility is charging excessive amounts of grease to the public sewer
system.
         (3)   Grease and all debris removed from a trap or interceptor shall
only be disposed of at a facility approved by the Allegheny County Health
Department (ACHO) and/or the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection (DEP). Under no circumstances shall this material be deposited into
another sanitary or storm sewer.
         (4)   Where installed, all grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be
maintained by the owner, at his/her expense, in continuously efficient
operation at all times. Interceptors shall be cleaned at least once a week.
         (5)   Failure by the owner to properly clean and maintain these units
shall be considered sufficient cause for disconnection of premises from the
public sewer, or punitive actions as provided for in this Part.
      D.   Rate of Flow Control. Grease interceptors shall be equipped with
devices to control the rate of water flow so that the water flow does not
exceed the rated flow.

whatsoever, without first obtaining a permit from the office of the Borough
Secretary.
   2.   The charge for said permits shall be as follows:
      A.   A permit fee and inspection fee shall be paid to the Borough prior

greater than 5 feet by 5 feet or 25 square feet are assigned an additional fee
of $10 per square foot, not to exceed a total of $3,000.
         (2)   Permittees are also required to pay a $100 inspection fee per
street opening.
      Note: Applicants who promptly submit their application prior to start of
construction will owe a $100 permit fee instead of $150. Fifty dollars of the
original fee will be waived.
      B.   The Borough Secretary shall submit all applications to the Borough
Engineer, which shall investigate same and if the Engineer finds it necessary
to do said work in the manner described therein, and that the same can be done
without closing the highway to public travel, the said Engineer shall approve
the application in writing and fix the amount to be charged as hereinafter
provided.
      C.   If said application is approved in writing by the Engineer, the
Borough Engineer shall issue a permit to the applicant upon the payment, by the
applicant, of the amount hereinafter fixed, or the furnishing of a prescribed
bond.
      D.   After a permit is issued by the Borough, it shall not be assigned or
transferred.
(Ord. 971, 4/13/2023)
§ 21-102. Applications.
   Permit applications to the Borough of East McKeesport shall comply with the
following:
      A.   Shall be submitted in person or by mail on a form provided by the

the entire work period.
      H.   Not more than 200 linear feet shall be opened in any street at any
time.
      I.   Basis of Measurements. The basis of measurement of street surface
opening shall be the actual number of square yards of paving or surfacing
necessary to completely repair the street surface at such opening. A fraction
of one-half of a square yard shall be considered as a full square yard and
payment shall be made on this basis. All openings shall be measured by the
Borough Engineer and such measurements shall be final and conclusive.
      J.   Supervision and Inspection. All work done under the authority of any
permit shall be supervised and inspected by the Borough Engineer or, with his
consent, the Street Department Head, and such supervision shall be done at the

construction, applicant shall notify the Borough Engineer, prior to
backfilling.
(Ord. 971, 4/13/2023)
§ 21-103. Insurance.
   An applicant shall file a properly executed certificate of insurance with
the Borough and verify that the applicant is insured against claims for
personal injury as well as against claims for property damages which may arise

applicant or by anyone directly or indirectly employed by him/her. Such
insurance shall include protection against liability arising from completed
operations, underground utility damage and collapse of any property. Liability
insurance for bodily injury shall be in an amount not less than $300,000 for
each person and $300,000 for each accident, and for property damages an amount
not less than $100,000. Failure of an applicant to file a certificate of
insurance shall be sufficient reason for denying said permit. The applicant
shall save harmless the Borough from any and all damages and liability by
reason of personal injury or property damage arising from work done by the
applicant under the provisions of this Part.
(Ord. 971, 4/13/2023)
§ 21-104. Bond Required.
   The applicant shall be required to execute and deliver unto the Borough an
agreement, or its performance and labor and materials payment bond(s) with
approved surety, or both, as a prerequisite to the issuance of any such permit,
in an amount to be determined by the appropriate issuing Borough official, the
amount of which shall equal the estimated cost of the work, for the purpose of
indemnifying the Borough for any costs, damages or expenses incurred or
estimated as the result of the restoration of such Borough street and right-of-
way, which is the subject of said application. Upon completion of restoration,
the applicant shall be required to execute and deliver to the Borough an
agreement or its maintenance bond with an approved surety, or both, as its
guarantee and warranty against defects regarding said restoration for a period
of one year from the date of acceptance by the Borough of said restoration
work. At the expiration of the period of one year after the completion of the
resurfacing of the street, alley, sidewalk or curb of the Borough occasioned by
the openings authorized by the permit or permits, the Borough Engineer shall
order the return of all cash deposits and bonds posted if the conditions which
they cover have been performed. In the event the Borough has been compelled to
make repairs after notice as above recited, the cost of such repairs shall be
withheld from such cash deposit and the bond shall be subject to payment of the
Borough for such amount. It shall be incumbent upon the holder of the permit to
give written notice to the Borough Manager of the expiration of the one-year
period.
(Ord. 971, 4/13/2023)
§ 21-105 Responsibility of Permit Holder for Certain Work to Restore Borough
Roads.
   Any applicant or permittee shall be required to restore a Borough road or
street to the same condition as it was prior to entry thereon by the permittee
in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Borough of East McKeesport.
The estimate of such restoration shall be set forth in detail on the permit
issued by the Borough of East McKeesport. If the permittee and/or its
contractor, after making an opening in the street or right-of-way to place or
repair pipe or for any purpose, fails to restore any portion of the street or
right-of-way to conform with the specifications of the Borough of East
McKeesport, the Borough reserves the right to do the work and bill the
permittee for the cost of restoration, plus 20%.
(Ord. 971, 4/13/2023)
§ 21-106. Conformance with Borough Requirements and Standards.
   1.   All work shall be done at such time and in such manner as shall be
consistent with the safety of the public, and shall conform to requirements and
standards of the Borough of East McKeesport. If at any time, it shall be
determined by the appropriate official of the Borough that the work is not
being done or has not been properly performed, the permittee, upon being
notified in writing by said official, shall immediately take the necessary
steps, at its own expense, to place the work in condition to conform to such
requirements or standards. In case any dispute arises between the permittee and
the aforementioned appropriate Borough official, the Borough shall have the
authority to suspend work until the question at issue is resolved.
   2.   When four or greater openings occur within one block, within a 12 month
period, the contractor shall be required to perform the following work:
      A.   Mill and replace the entire street of pavement surface from 15 feet
beyond the outermost street openings from back of curb to back of curb.
(Ord. 971, 4/13/2023)
§ 21-107. Backfilling.
   Any person who shall open or excavate any improved street in the Borough,
shall thoroughly and completely backfill the opening or excavation,
mechanically compact same so as to prevent any settling thereafter as it was
before the opening or excavation, to the same surface and base materials, line
and grade as it were before the opening or excavation; as restored, the surface
and base shall conform to the line and grade and be of the same materials as
that of the undisturbed existing adjacent surfaces and bases. An opening shall
be backfilled by the permittee in accordance with the following:
      A.   The opening may first be backfilled with fine aggregate materials,
meeting applicable Pennsylvania Department of Transportation standards, or
standards as promulgated by the Borough from time to time, and placed to a
height not to exceed one foot over the top of the facility, if the material is
compacted in not more than four inch loose layers or as authorized by the
Borough. To help protect its facility from future excavations, the permittee
shall place a permanent ribbon at least one foot above its facility. If the
facility is nonmetallic, the permittee shall place a metallic ribbon at a depth
from which the ribbon can be sensed by typical metal locating instruments. The
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Standards refers to Specifications
Publication 408, current edition and as amended from time to time and
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Standards for Roadway Construction,
Series RC-IM to 1 QOM, current edition, and as amended from time to time. Both
publications are incorporated into and made a part of this Part.
      B.   The opening shall then be backfilled with 2A or 2B stone, compacted
in 411 layers as directed by the Engineer, unless retained suitable materials
are authorized by the Borough. The aggregate material will be required for use
as backfill of openings in pavements, paved shoulders and improved shoulders as
well as unimproved shoulders within three feet of the edge of pavement.
Retained suitable material will normally be authorized for use as backfill of
openings outside shoulders and in unimproved shoulders more than three feet
outside the edge of pavement and up to within three feet of the surface.
      C.   Backfill shall be compacted as follows:
         (1)   General Rule. Backfill material shall be placed in loose layers
not to exceed eight inches if vibratory compaction equipment is used or
authorized. Each layer shall be thoroughly compacted to preclude subsidence,
otherwise, compaction shall occur every four inches.
         (2)   Compaction Outside Pavement and Shoulders. At least 15 days
prior to the start of work, the applicant may submit its written compaction
plan to the Borough office requesting backfill in an opening outside the
pavement and shoulder to be placed in layers thicker than eight inches prior to
vibratory compaction. The compaction plan shall include full details of
equipment, materials and work methods as well as the permittee's acknowledgment
of its obligation and commitment to regularly monitor the restoration of the
permitted work and to promptly correct failure or subsidence of the roadway.
The Borough may condition its approval of a compaction plan on the execution of
a bond if a part of the opening is within the improved area.
         (3)   Existing Pavement Elevation. Compaction shall be completed to
the bottom elevation of the existing pavement.
         (4)   The Borough may require the permittee to have material proposed
for use as backfill and compacted material tested, at the expense of the
permittee.
(Ord. 971, 4/13/2023)
§ 21-108 Restoration.
   1.   Temporary Restoration. A temporary pavement consisting of bituminous
cold patch material, not less than one inch compacted depth shall be installed
flush with the surface of the existing undisturbed pavement and shall be
maintained until permanent restoration has been completed. On unimproved
streets, compacted 2-A stone material, not less than three inches compacted
depth shall be installed and maintained until permanent restoration has been
completed.
   2.   Permanent restoration shall be performed and completed as soon as the
utility work has been completed, but in no instance shall permanent restoration
be completed any longer than three months from the official date of said
completion, except as may be necessitated by winter weather conditions and as
approved by the Borough. Failure to comply shall result in the penalties as set
forth elsewhere herein. Permanent restoration shall include back of curb-to-
back of curb replacement. This includes the entire curb for the length of the
restoration. The street shall be milled 1-1/2" for a distance of fifteen feet
beyond the excavation opening. See Drawing No. IX:2.03:14 and Drawing No. IX:
2.04:06 in the appendix following this Part.
   3.   Bituminous pavement restoration shall consist of the following: Saw one
foot outside the initial excavation and remove temporary paving and base to a
depth of seven and one half inches below the existing finished surface and
furnish and install the following: See Drawing No. IX:2.03:05 following this
Part.
      A.   Thoroughly compact subgrade.
      B.   Place eight-inch compacted depth of a 2-A modified stone base.
      C.   Place six-inch compacted depth of 25.0 mm Superpave Binder Material.
      D.   Place one and a half inch compact depth of 9.5 mm Superpave Wearing
Material.
      E.   Immediately following paving operations, hand mop and seal all edges
where new pavement meets existing surfaces with AC-20 sealing material.
   4.   Where concrete curb is to be restored, the contractor shall saw cut and
remove affected curb to the next undisturbed expansion or contraction joint,
shall place one half inch premolded expansion joint material and install medium
depth 18-inch plain cement curb to match width and reveal of the adjacent
existing undisturbed curb. Concrete shall be 4,000 PSI air entrained. All new
finished concrete surfaces shall be treated with BASF Enviroseal 40 or
equivalent. See drawing No. IX:3.05:02 following this Part.
   5.   Where concrete sidewalk is to be restored, the contractor shall
excavate and remove existing affected sidewalk to the next undisturbed
expansion or contraction joint, shall saw cut smooth and replace full slabs.
Specifications shall include five-inch minimum depth of compacted 2B or crushed
stone subbase and five-inch thickness of 4,000 p.s.i. air entrained concrete,
with No. 10/10 gauge welded wire fabric, one half inch pre-molded expansion
joints where new concrete construction meets existing construction and placed
at 30-foot center to center, with contraction joints at ten-foot center to
center. All new finished concrete surfaces shall be treated with BASF
Enviroseal 40 or equivalent. See drawing No. IX:3.05:04B following this Part.
   6.   Additional restoration shall be required as follows:
      A.   If disturbed lanes adjacent to undisturbed lanes are overlaid, the
edge of the disturbed lanes shall be saw cut or milled to a depth of one and
one half inches or the depth of the existing surface course, whichever is less,
for the length of the opening to insure a smooth joint, with proper elevation
and cross sections. A full width overlay may be authorized on various roadways
instead of saw cutting or milling the disturbed land.
      B.   Restored openings in the pavement or paved shoulder shall be sealed
in the case of bituminous concrete or in the case of cement concrete.
   7.   Test holes shall require a street opening permit for any test hole
work. No test holes shall be made in or upon a greater surface of the highway
than as specified in such permit, and no excavation may interfere with any
water pipes, sewers or drains of the Borough or any other underground utility
service. Test holes shall be promptly backfilled in accordance with provisions
set by the Borough.
(Ord. 971, 4/13/2023)
§ 21-109. Violation.
   Any person, firm or corporation violating any of the provisions of this
Part, upon conviction thereof before a Magisterial District Judge, shall be
sentenced to pay a fine of not less than $100 nor more than $300 for each and
every offense, plus the costs of prosecution and in default of payment of said
fine and costs, to a term of imprisonment not to exceed 30 days. In addition,
the proper authorities of the Borough of East McKeesport may institute any
appropriate action or proceeding to prevent violations of the provisions of
this Part, or of any permit issued by the Borough. Upon receipt of oral or
written notice of any violations from the proper Borough official, the
permittee shall cease to perform any further work in the permitted area, except
to restore the area to a safe condition. No further work shall commence in the

normal street movement, not result in excessive traffic flow or congestion on
Borough streets and not create a hazard.
      B.   Location. The following standards shall apply:
         (1)   Driveway should access onto streets of type and character to
handle the type and amount of vehicular traffic using the driveway. Driveways
from nonresidential uses normally used by more than 60 vehicles per day shall
not be permitted access onto local residential streets. The Borough Council may
approve an exception to this standard based on special site conditions and
traffic studies showing no negative impact on the existing residential street.
For purposes of this section, a residential street is one on which 50% or more
of the abutting properties are single or multifamily residences.
         (2)   Driveway shall not be located at highway interchanges or ramp

property.
      D.   Approach. The location and angle of access of driveway in relation
to street intersection shall be such that a vehicle entering or leaving
driveway can do so in orderly and safe manner and with minimum interference to
street traffic.
      E.   Design Guidelines. The applicable requirements for "minimum" and
"low volume" driveways found in PennDOT Regulations, 67 Pa. Code § 1.8, shall
apply unless otherwise specified by the provisions of this Part. These
requirements may be modified by the Borough to accommodate specific site or
street conditions in order to protect the safety and traffic capacity of
Borough streets.

DISCLOSURE STATEMENT OF BOROUGH OF EAST MCKEESPORT
LOCAL TAXPAYERS BILL OF RIGHTS
It is the obligation of all taxpayers in a local municipality to file all local
taxes to which they are subject. However, when the duly appointed Tax Collector
for the Borough in which the taxpayer resides determines that a required return
has not been filed, or a tax liability has not been paid, it has certain rights
granted by law that set forth how it may enforce a taxpayer's obligations. The
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania now has a Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights that
provides rights to local taxpayers and creates obligations for the Borough, so
that equity and fairness govern the administration and collection of local
taxes.
TAXPAYERS' RIGHTS AND THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE BOROUGH
DURING AN AUDIT OR ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW
When determining if the appropriate tax liability has been paid, the rights of
a taxpayer and the obligations of the Borough during an audit are as follows:
o   The Borough shall prepare a written explanation of the basis for assessment
of any tax liability determined during the audit.
o   The Borough shall explain the taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment of
any tax liability determined during the audit.
o   A taxpayer shall have the right to obtain an extension to reply to an
initial request for information for good cause. The bequest for an extension
must be in writing and must be received by the Borough before the end of the
initial 30 day response period. (See information provided below).
o   The Borough shall take no lawful fiction against the taxpayer for
collection of tax until the expiration of the applicable response period
(including extensions).
o   The Borough may require a taxpayer to provide copies of the taxpayers'
Federal individual income tax return if such information is reasonably
necessary for the enforcement or collection of a local tax and the information
is not available from other sources or from the Department of Revenue.
o   A taxpayer has the right to be represented. Notice of representation must
be in writing, signed by the taxpayer and must contain a statement allowing the
named representative to view and discuss confidential information.
o   All overpayments of tax due to the taxpayer shall bear simple interest from
the date of overpayment until the date of resolution unless the overpayment is
refunded or applied against any other tax, interest or penalty that is due
within 75 days.
o   A taxpayer may be eligible for the abatement of certain interest and
penalties.
The Borough may, but is not obligated to, enter into a written agreement with a
taxpayer to allow the taxpayer to pay his or her tax liability in installments.
A taxpayer's eligibility to enter into an installment agreement shall be
determined on a case by case basis.
Each voluntary payment of tax shad be applied in the following order: (1) tax;
(2) interest; (3) penalty; and (4) any other fees or charges, unless otherwise
directed by the taxpayer on each payment.
All information gathered by the Borough as a result of any audit, return,
report, investigation, hearing or verification shall be kept strictly
confidential.
An initial request by the Borough regarding the taxpayers' compliance with any
eligible tax may only pertain to taxes that are required to be paid or tax
returns that are required to be filed no more than 3 years prior to the mailing
date of the initial request. This rule does not apply in the case where the
Borough has sufficient information to indicate that the taxpayer failed to file
a required return or pay a local tax that was due more than 3 years prior to
the date of the notice.
TAXPAYER APPEAL RIGHTS
Any taxpayer who disagrees with an assessment or determination of a local tax
may petition the Borough for a hearing. To obtain a hearing, the taxpayer must:
(1) obtain a petition form from the Borough; (2) fill out and complete the
Petition; (3) sign and date the petition; and (4) timely file a complete and
accurate petition with the Hearing Officer. The Hearing Officer shall review
the case as provided by the taxpayer and shall issue a ruling within 60 days of

Title 42, Pa. Cons. Stat. A petition is timely filed if it is postmarked by the

velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying
capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public
facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines flood plain management
and flood control efforts in downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, threatens public health and safety, and increases nonpoint source
pollution of water resources.
      B.   A comprehensive program of stormwater management (SWM), including
regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff, is
fundamental to the public health, safety, and welfare and the protection of
people of the Commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
      C.   Stormwater is an important water resource that provides groundwater
recharge for water supplies and supports the base flow of streams.
      D.   The use of green infrastructure (Gl) and low impact development
(LID) are intended to address the root cause of water quality impairment by
using systems and practices which use or mimic natural processes to:
         (1)   Infiltrate and recharge,
         (2)   Evapotranspire, and/or
         (3)   Harvest and use precipitation near where it falls to earth.
Green infrastructure practices andLID contribute to the restoration or
maintenance of pre-development hydrology.
      E.   Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are required
to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer
systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
program.
(Ord. 946, 11/8/2018, §102)
§ 26-103. Purpose.

Enforcement Officers (as amended or replaced from time to time by DEP).
   FLOODWAY - The channel of the watercourse and those portions of the
adjoining floodplains that are reasonably required to carry and discharge the
100-year flood. Unless otherwise specified, the boundary of the floodway is as
indicated on maps and flood insurance studies provided by FEMA. In an area
where no FEMA maps or studies have defined the boundary of the 100-year
floodway, it is assumed, absent evidence to the contrary, that the floodway
extends from the stream to 50 feet from the top of the bank of the stream.
   FOREST MANAGEMENT/TIMBER OPERATIONS - Planning and activities necessary for
the management of forestland. These include conducting a timber inventory,

Municipalities Planning Code.
   LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT (LID) - Site design approaches and small-scale
stormwater management practices that promote the use of natural systems for
infiltration, evapotranspiration, and reuse of rainwater. LID can be applied to
new development, urban retrofits, and revitalization projects. LID utilizes
design techniques that infiltrate, filter, evaporate, and store runoff close to
its source. Rather than rely on costly large-scale conveyance and treatment
systems, LID addresses stormwater through a variety of small, cost-effective
landscape features located on-site.

of a given magnitude can be expected to occur one time. For example, the 25-
year return period rainfall would be expected to occur on average once every 25
years; or stated in another way, the probability of a 25-year storm occurring
in any one year is 0.04 (i.e., a 4% chance).

applicant from the requirements in §
26-121 4. through 10.
   7.   The Borough may deny or revoke any exemption pursuant to this section
at any time for any project that the Borough believes may pose a threat to
public health and safety or the environment.
   8.   Voluntary Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI) retrofit projects that
are solely intended to better manage runoff from existing development and are
not part of new development or redevelopment, are exempt from the stormwater
management provisions of this Part. This does not exempt such projects from any
other municipal, state, or federal regulation.
(Ord. 946, 11/8/2018, §302)
§ 26-123. Volume Controls.
   The green infrastructure and low impact development practices provided in
the BMP Manuals shall be utilized for ah regulated activities wherever
possible. Water volume controls shall be implemented using the Design Storm
Method in Subsection A. or the Simplified Method in Subsection B. below. Water
volume controls shall be implemented using the Design Storm Method in
Subsection A. or the Simplified Method in Subsection B. below, or alternative
design criteria as allowed by PA Code Title 25, Chapter 102.
      A.   The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manuals) is applicable as a
method to any size of regulated activity. This method requires detailed
modeling based on site conditions. The following shah be incorporated into the
CG-1 method:
         (1)   Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the 2-year 24-hour duration precipitation.
         (2)   At least the first one inch of runoff from the net increase in
impervious surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it
shall not be released into the surface waters of this Commonwealth. Removal
options include reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration. If the
developer provides justification that the listed removal options are not
feasible, and the Designated Plan Reviewer agrees, runoff shall be detained in
a facility designed for a 24 to 72 hour dewatering time in an area with a
dedicated stormwater system (not contributory to a combined sewer system) and
shall be detained in a facility designed for a 72 hour dewatering time in an
area contributory to a combined sewer system before discharge to local
stormwater systems or the environment.
         (3)   For modeling purposes:
            (a)   Existing (predevelopment) non-forested pervious areas must be
considered meadow in good condition.
            (b)   Twenty percent (20%) of existing impervious area, when
present, shall be considered meadow in good condition in the model for existing
conditions.
      B.   The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manuals) provided below is
independent of site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm Method is
not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated activities greater
than one acre or for projects that require design of stormwater storage
facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
         (1)   Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two
inches of runoff from the net increase in impervious surfaces.
         (2)   At least the first one inch of runoff from the net increase in
impervious surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it
shall not be released into the surface waters of this Commonwealth. Removal
options include reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration. If the
developer provides justification that the hsted removal options are not
feasible, and the Designated Plan Reviewer agrees, runoff shall be detained in
a facility designed for a 24-hour dewatering time in an area with a dedicated
stormwater system (not contributory to a combined sewer system) and shall be
detained in a facility designed for a 72-hour dewatering time in an area
contributory to a combined sewer system before discharge to local stormwater
systems or the environment.
         (3)   Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed runoff; however, in
ah cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the permanently removed runoff should
be infiltrated.
         (4)   This method is exempt from the requirements of §
26-124, Rate Controls.
(Ord. 946, 11/8/2018, §303)
§ 26-124. Rate Controls.
   1.   For areas not covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
Stormwater Management Plan:
   Post-development discharge rates shah not exceed the pre-development
discharge rates for the 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year, 24-hour storm
events. This is the equivalent to a 100% release rate area when compared to
those rates shown in the maps contained in Appendix A (New and Existing Release
Rate Management Districts). This Pre-development to Post-development control is
not to be misconstrued as the same as the "Conditional Direct Discharge" areas
on the Release Rate maps. If it is shown that the peak rates of discharge
indicated by the post-development analysis are less than or equal to the peak
rates of discharge indicated by the pre-development analysis for 1-, 2-, 5-,
10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year, 24-hour storms, then the requirements of this
section have been met. Otherwise, the applicant shall provide additional
controls as necessary to satisfy the peak rate of discharge requirement. Peak
flows should be computed using the methods included in the Chapter titled
"Stormwater Calculations and Methodology" of the PADEP Stormwater Management
BMP Manual.
   2.   For areas covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
Stormwater Management Plan:
   For the 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year, 24-hour storm events, the
post-development peak discharge rates will follow the applicable approved
release rate maps. These maps are contained in Appendix A (New and Existing
Release Rate Management Districts) of this Part. For any areas not shown on the
release rate maps, the post-development discharge rates shah not exceed the
pre-development discharge rates for the specified design events. Peak flows
should be computed using the methods included in Chapter 8 of the PADEP
Stormwater Management BMP Manual.
(Ord. 946, 11/8/2018, §304)
§ 26-125. Reparian Buffers.
   1.   In order to protect and improve water quality, a riparian buffer
easement shall be created and recorded as part of any subdivision or land
development that encompasses a riparian buffer. The intent of this Part in
establishing a riparian buffer is to protect and improve stream water quality.
The riparian buffer is intended to slow overland flow to the stream through the
presence of native grasses, trees and shrubs, allowing infiltration/groundwater
recharge; causing deposition of sediment, nutrients, pesticides, and other
pollutants in the buffer rather than in the stream; and reducing erosion by
providing stream bank stabilization. The trees provide shade for streams;
keeping waters cooler and reducing evaporation.
   2.   Except as required by PA Code Title 25 Chapter 102, the riparian buffer
easement shall be required for ah streams (as defined in § 26-111) with a
contributing watershed area of greater than ten acres. The Riparian Buffer
Easement shah be measured to be a minimum of 35 feet from the top of the
streambank (on each side).
   3.   Minimum Management Requirements for Riparian Buffers.
      A.   No use or construction within the riparian buffer shall be permitted
that is inconsistent with the intent of the riparian buffer as described in
subsection 1. above.
      B.   Existing native vegetation shall be protected and maintained within
the riparian buffer easement.
      C.   Whenever practicable, invasive vegetation shall be actively removed
and the riparian buffer easement shah be planted with native trees, shrubs and
other vegetation to create a diverse native plant community appropriate to the
intended ecological context of the site.
   4.   The riparian buffer easement shah be enforceable by the Borough and
shall be recorded in the appropriate County Recorder of Deeds Office, so that
it shah run with the land and shall limit the use of the property located
therein. The easement shall allow for the continued private ownership and shall
count toward the minimum lot area required by zoning, unless otherwise
specified in the municipal Zoning Ordinance.
   5.   Any permitted use within the riparian buffer easement shall be
conducted in a manner that will maintain the extent of the existing 100-year
flood plain, improve or maintain the stream stability, and preserve and protect
the ecological function of the floodplain.
   6.   Stormwater drainage pipes shall be permitted within the riparian buffer
easement, but they shall cross the easement in the shortest practical distance.
Other structural stormwater management facilities are not permitted within the
riparian buffer easement.
   7.   The following conditions shall apply when pubhc and/or private
recreation trails are permitted by the Borough within riparian buffers:
      A.   It is preferred that trails be designed to be permeable and for non-
motorized use only; however, impermeable trails are permitted provided they
have adequate drainage.
      B.   Trails shall be designed to have the least impact on native plant
species and other sensitive environmental features.
   8.   Septic drainfields and sewage disposal systems shall not be permitted
within the riparian buffer easement and shall comply with setback requirements
estabhshed under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 73.
   9.   Underground utilities shall be permitted within the riparian buffer
easement; however, work shall be performed to minimize disturbance area and
removal of trees. Restoration within the riparian buffer easement shall be with
native species of trees, grasses, and other plantings. One tree shall be
planted for each tree removed and the restoration shall be designed by a
Registered Professional with the requisite experience. Aboveground utilities
shall only be permitted to cross the easement perpendicular to the easement or
in the shortest practical distance. Existing utilities may remain and be
maintained as required.

APPENDIX C
SMALL PROJECT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SITE PLAN
 
This small project stormwater site plan has been developed to assist those
proposing residential projects to meet the requirements of the Allegheny County
Stormwater Management Plan Model Ordinance without having to hire professional
services to draft a formal stormwater management plan. This small project site
plan is only permitted for projects with earth disturbances between one-quarter
(0.25) acre and one (1) acre of earth disturbance § 26-1222. and using The
Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual3) for Volume Control as described in
§ 26-123B. Additional information can be found in Chapter 6 of the Pennsylvania
Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual
A.   What is an applicant required to submit?
All requirements of § 26-123 B. including a brief description of the proposed
stormwater facilities, including types of materials to be used, total square
footage of proposed impervious areas, volume calculations, and a simple sketch
plan showing the following information:
   o   Location of proposed structures, driveways, or other paved areas with
approximate surface area in square feet.
   o   Location of any existing or proposed onsite septic system and/or potable
water wells showing proximity to infiltration facilities.
   o   County Conservation District erosion and sediment control "Adequacy"
letter as may be required by Municipal, County or State regulations.
B.   Determination of Required Volume Control and Sizing Stormwater Facilities
By following the simple steps outlined below in the provided example, an
applicant can determine the runoff volume that is required to be controlled and
how to choose the appropriate stormwater facility to permanently remove the
runoff volume from the site. Impervious area calculations must include all
areas on the lot proposed to be covered by roof area or pavement which would
prevent rain from naturally percolating into the ground, including impervious
surfaces such as sidewalks, driveways, parking areas, patios or swimming pools.
Sidewalks, driveways or patios that are designed and constructed to allow for
infiltration are not included in this calculation.

IMAGES/0-0-0-39.png]
Step 2: Determine Required Volume Control (cubic feet) using the following
equation:
Volume (cu. ft.) = (Total impervious area in square feet x 2 inches of runoff)
/12 inches
(3,000 sq. ft. x 2 inches of runoff) /12 inches = 500 cu. ft.
Step 3: Sizing the Selected Volume Control BMP
Several Best Management Practices (BMPs), as described below, are suitable for
small stormwater management projects. However, their application depends on the
volume required to be controlled, how much land is available, and the site
constraints. Proposed residential development activities can apply both
nonstructural and structural BMPs to control the volume of runoff from the
site. A number of different volume control BMPs are described below. Note that
Figure 1 is an example of how these BMPs can be utilized in conjunction to
control the total required volume on one site.
Structural BMPs
1.   Infiltration Trench
An Infiltration Trench is a linear stormwater BMP consisting of a continuously
perforated pipe at a minimum slope in a stone-filled trench. During small storm
events, infiltration trenches can significantly reduce volume and serve in the
removal of fine sediments and pollutants. Runoff is stored between the stones
and infiltrates through the bottom of the facility and into the soil matrix.
Runoff should be pretreated using vegetative buffer strips or swales to limit
the amount of coarse sediment entering the trench which can clog and render the
trench ineffective. In all cases, an infiltration trench should be designed
with a positive overflow.
Design Considerations:
   o   Although the width and depth can vary, it is recommended that
Infiltration Trenches be limited in depth to not more than six (6) feet of
stone.
   o   Trench is wrapped in nonwoven geotextile (top, sides, and bottom).
   o   Trench needs to be placed on uncompacted soils.
   o   Slope of the Trench bottom should be level or with a slope no greater
than 1%.
   o   A minimum of 6" of topsoil is placed over trench and vegetated.
   o   The discharge or overflow from the Infiltration Trench should be
properly designed for anticipated flows.
   o   Cleanouts or inlets should be installed at both ends of the Infiltration
Trench and at appropriate intervals to allow access to the perforated pipe.
   o   Volume of facility = Depth x Width x Length x Void Space of the gravel
bed (assume 40%).
Maintenance:
   o   Catch basins and inlets should be inspected and cleaned at least two
times a year.
   o   The vegetation along the surface of the infiltration trench should be
maintained in good condition and any bare spots should be re-vegetated as soon
as possible.
   o   Vehicles should not be parked or driven on the trench and care should be
taken to avoid soil compaction by lawn mowers.

IMAGES/0-0-0-41.png]
 
Sizing Example for Infiltration Trench
   1.   Determine Total Impervious Surface to drain to Infiltration Trench:
 
Garage Roof (Left) 6 ft. x 24 ft.  = 144 sq. ft.
Driveway           12 ft. x 50 ft. = 1000 sq. ft.
Walkway            4 ft. x 20 ft.  = 80 sq. ft.
 
   2.   Determine the required infiltration volume:
(1224 sq. ft. x 2 inches of runoff)/12 ft. = 204 cu. ft. / 0.4* = 510 cu. ft.
(*0.4 assumes 40% void ratio in gravel bed)
   3.   Sizing the infiltration trench facility:
      Volume of Facility = Depth x Width x Length
      Set Depth to 3 feet and determine required surface area of trench.
      510 cu. ft. / 3 ft. = 170 sq. ft.
      The width of the trench should be greater than 2 times its depth (2 x D),
therefore in this example the trench width of 6 feet selected.
      Determine trench length: L = 170 sq. ft. / 6 ft. = 28.3 ft.
      Final infiltration trench dimensions: 3 ft. (D) x 6 ft. (W) x 28.3 ft.
(L)
2.   Rain Garden
A Rain Garden is a planted shallow depression designed to catch and filter
rainfall runoff. The garden captures rain from a downspout or a paved surface.
The water sinks into the ground, aided by deep rooted plants that like both wet
and dry conditions. The ideal location for a rain garden is between the source
of runoff (roofs and driveways) and the runoff destination (drains, stream, low
spots, etc.).
Design Considerations:
   o   A maximum of 3:1 side slope is recommended.
   o   The depth of a rain garden can range from 6 - 8 inches. Ponded water
should not exceed 6 inches.
   o   The rain garden should drain within 72 hours.
   o   The garden should be at least 10-20 feet from a building's foundation
and 25 feet from septic system drainfields and wellheads.
   o   If the site has clay soils, soil should be amended with compost or
organic material.
   o   Choose native plants. See http://pa.audubon.org/habitat/PDFs/RGBrochure
complete.pdf for a native plant list. To find native plant sources go to
www.pawildflower.org.
   o   At the rain garden location, the water table should be at least 2' below
the soil level. If water stands in an area for more than one day after a heavy
rain you can assume it has a higher water table and is not a good choice for a
rain garden.
Maintenance:
   o   Water plants regularly until they become established.
   o   Inspect twice a year for sediment buildup, erosion and vegetative
conditions.
   o   Mulch with hardwood when erosion is evident and replenish annually.
   o   Prune and remove dead vegetation in the spring season.
   o   Weed as you would any garden.
   o   Move plants around if some plants would grow better in the drier or
wetter parts of the garden.

IMAGES/0-0-0-43.png]
 
Sizing Example for Rain Garden
   1.   Pick a site for the rain garden between the source of runoff and a low
lying area, a.k.a., a drainage area.
   2.   Perform an infiltration test to determine the depth of the rain garden:
      o   Dig a hole 8" x 8"
      o   Fill with water and put a popsicle stick at the top of the water
level.
      o   Measure how far it drains down after a few hours (ideally 4 hours).
      o   Calculate the depth of water that will drain out over 24 hours.
   3.   Determine total impervious surface area to drain to rain garden:
 
House Roof (Front) 14 ft. x 48 ft. = 672 sq. ft.
 
   4.   Sizing the rain garden:
      For this example, let's say the infiltration test determined 6" of water
drained out of a hole in 24 hours. The depth of the rain garden should be set
to the results of the infiltration test so 6" is the depth of the rain garden.
The sizing calculation below is based on controlling 1" of runoff. First divide
the impervious surface by the depth of the rain garden.
672 sq. ft. / 6 (depth of rain garden in inches) = 112 sq. ft.
   In order to control 2" of runoff volume, the rain garden area is multiplied
by 2.
112 sq. ft. * 2 = 224 sq. ft.
   The rain garden should be about 225 sq. ft. in size and 6" deep.
3.   Dry Well (a.k.a., Seepage Pit)
A Dry Well, sometimes called a Seepage Pit, is a subsurface storage facility
that temporarily stores and infiltrates stormwater runoff from the roofs of
structures. By capturing runoff at the source, Dry Wells can dramatically
reduce the increased volume of stormwater generated by the roofs of structures.
Roof leaders connect directly into the Dry Well, which may be either an
excavated pit filled with uniformly graded aggregate wrapped in geotextile, or
a prefabricated storage chamber or pipe segment. Dry Wells discharge the stored
runoff via infiltration into the surrounding soils. In the event that the Dry
Well is overwhelmed in an intense storm event, an overflow mechanism (surcharge
pipe, connection to a larger infiltration are, etc.) will ensure that
additional runoff is safely conveyed downstream.
Design Considerations:
   o   Dry Wells typically consist of 18 to 48 inches of clean washed,
uniformly graded aggregate with 40% void capacity (AASHTO No. 3, or similar).
"Clean" gravel fill should average one and one-half to three (1.5 - 3.0) inches
in diameter.
   o   Dry Wells are not recommended when their installation would create a
significant risk for basement seepage or flooding. In general, 10-20 feet of
separation is recommended between Dry Wells and building foundations.
   o   The facility may be either a structural prefabricated chamber or an
excavated pit filled with aggregate.
   o   Depth of dry wells in excess of three-and-a-half (3.5) feet should be
avoided unless warranted by soil conditions.
   o   Stormwater dry wells must never be combined with existing,
rehabilitated, or new septic system seepage pits. Discharge of sewage to
stormwater dry wells is strictly prohibited.
   o   As shown in Figure 5, the installation should include a surcharge or
overflowpipe.
Maintenance:
   o   Dry wells should be inspected at least four (4) times annually as well
as after large storm events.
   o   Remove sediment, debris/trash, and any other waste material from a dry
well.
   o   Regularly clean out gutters and ensure proper connections to the dry
well.
   o   Replace the filter screen that intercepts the roof runoff as necessary.

IMAGES/0-0-0-45.png]
 
Sizing Example for Dry Wells:
   1.   Determine contributing impervious surface area:
 
House Roof (Rear) 14 ft. x 48 ft. = 672 sq. ft.
 
   2.   Determine required volume control:
      (672 sq. ft. x (2 inches of runoff /12 inches/ft.) = 112 cu. ft.
      112 cu ft. / 0.4 = 280 cu. ft. (assuming the 40% void ratio in the gravel
bed)
   3.   Sizing the dry well:
      Set the depth to 3.5 ft.; Set the width equal to the length for a square
chamber.
      3.5 ft. x L x L = 280 cu. ft.; LxL = 280 cu. ft. / 3.5 ft.; thus LxL= 80
sq. ft.; L=9 (approx)
      Dimensions = 3.5 ft. (D) x 9 ft. (L) x 9 ft. (W)
NonStructural BMPs
1.   Tree Plantings and Preservation
Trees and forests reduce stormwater runoff by capturing and storing rainfall in
the canopy and releasing water into the atmosphere through evapotranspiration.
Tree roots and leaf litter also create soil conditions that promote the
infiltration of rainwater into the soil. In addition, trees and forests reduce
pollutants by taking up nutrients and other pollutants from soils and water
through their root systems. A development site can reduce runoff volume by
planting new trees or by preserving trees which existed on the site prior to
development. The volume reduction calculations either determine the cubic feet
to be directed to the area under the tree canopy for infiltration or determine
a volume reduction credit which can be used to reduce the size of any one of
the planned structural BMPs on the site.
Tree Considerations:
   o   Existing trees must have at least a 4" trunk caliper or larger.
   o   Existing tree canopy must be within 100 ft. of impervious surfaces.
   o   A tree canopy is classified as the continuous cover of branches and
foliage formed by a single tree or collectively by the crowns of adjacent
trees.
   o   New tree plantings must be at least 6 ft. in height and have a 2" trunk
caliper.
   o   All existing and newly planted trees must be native to Pennsylvania. See
http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/forestrv/commontr/commontrees.pdf for a guide book
titled Common Trees of Pennsylvania for a native tree list.
   o   When using trees as volume control BMPs, runoff from impervious areas
should be directed to drain under the tree canopy.
Determining the required number of planted trees to reduce the runoff volume:
   1.   Determine contributing impervious surface area:
 
Garage Roof (Right) 6 ft. x 24 ft. = 144 ft.
 
   2.   Calculate the required control volume:
      (144 sq. ft. x 2 inches of runoff) / 12 inches = 24 cu. ft.
   3.   Determine the number of tree plantings:
      o   A newly planted deciduous tree can reduce runoff volume by 6 cu. ft.
      o   A newly planted evergreen tree can reduce runoff volume by 10 cu. ft.
      24 cu. ft. / 6 cu. ft. =4 Deciduous Trees
Determining the volume reduction for preserving existing trees:
   1.   Calculate approximate area of the existing tree canopy:
       ~22 sq. ft. x ~23 sq. ft. = 500 sq. ft.
   2.   Measure distance from impervious surface to tree canopy: 35 ft.
   3.   Calculate the volume reduction credit by preserving existing trees:
      o   For Trees within 20 feet of impervious cover:
         Volume Reduction cu. ft. = (Existing Tree Canopy sq. ft. x 1 inch) /
12
      o   For Trees beyond 20 feet but not farther than 100 feet from
impervious cover:
         Volume Reduction cu. ft. = (Existing Tree Canopy sq. ft. x 0.5 inch) /
12
               (500 sq. ft. x 0.5 inches) / 12 = 21 cu. ft.

      This volume credit can be utilized in reducing the size of any one of the
structural BMPs planned on the site. For example, the 21 cu. ft. could be
subtracted from the required infiltration volume when sizing the infiltration
trench;
               510 cu. ft. - 21 cu. ft. = 489 cu. ft.
         489 cu. ft. / 3 ft. (Depth) = 163 / 6 ft. (Width) = 27.1 ft. (Length)
      Using the existing trees for a volume credit would decrease the length of
the infiltration trench to 27.1 ft. instead of 28.3 ft.
2.   Minimize Soil Compaction and Replant with Lawn or Meadow
When soil is overly compacted during construction it can cause a drastic
reduction in the permeability of the soil and rarely is the soil profile
completely restored. Runoff from vegetative areas with highly compacted soils
similarly resembles runoff from an impervious surface. Minimizing soil
compaction and re-planting with a vegetative cover like meadow or lawn, not
only increases the infiltration on the site, but also creates a friendly
habitat for a variety of wildlife species.
Design Considerations:
   o   Area shall not be stripped of topsoil.
   o   Vehicle movement, storage, or equipment/material lay down shall not be
permitted in areas preserved for minimum soil compaction.
   o   The use of soil amendments and additional topsoil is permitted.
   o   Meadow should be planted with native grasses. Refer to Meadows and
Prairies: Wildlife Friendly Alternatives to Lawn at http://pubs.cas.psu.edu/
FreePubs/pdfs/UH128.pdf for reference on how to properly plant the meadow and
for a list of native species.
Determining the volume reduction by minimizing soil compaction and planting a
meadow:
   1.   Calculate approximate area of preserved meadow:
      ~22 sq. ft. x ~23 sq. ft. = 500 sq. ft.
   2.   Calculate the volume reduction credit by minimizing the soil compaction
and planting a lawn/meadow:
      o   For Meadow Areas: Volume Reduction (cu. ft.) = (Area of Min. Soil
Compaction (sq. ft.) x 1/3 inch of runoff) /12
         (500 sq. ft. x 1/3 inch of runoff) /12 = 13.8 cu. ft.
      o   For Lawn Areas: Volume Reduction (cu. ft.) = (Area of Min. Soil
Compaction (sq. ft.) x 1/4 inch of runoff) /12
         (500 sq. ft. x 1/4 inch of runoff) /12 = 10.4 cu. ft.
This volume credit can be used to reduce the size of any one of the structural
BMPs on the site. See explanation under the volume credit for preserving
existing trees for details.
Alternative BMP to Capture and Reuse Stormwater
Rain Barrels
Rain barrels are large containers that collect drainage from roof leaders and
temporarily store water to be released to lawns, gardens, and other landscaped
areas after the rainfall has ended. Rain barrels are typically between 50 and
200 gallons in size. It is not recommended for rain barrels to be used as a
volume control BMP because infiltration is not guaranteed after each storm
event. For this reason, a rain barrel is not utilized in the site plan example.
However, the information is included to provide an alternative for a homeowner
to utilize when considering capture and reuse stormwater methods.
Design Considerations:
   o   Rain barrels should be directly connected to the roof gutter/spout.
   o   There must be a means to release the water stored between storm events
to provide the necessary storage volume for the next storm.
   o   When calculating rain barrel size, rain barrels are typically assumed to
be 25% full because they are not always emptied before the next storm.
   o   Use screens to filter debris and cover lids to prevent mosquitoes.
   o   An overflow outlet should be placed a few inches below the top with an
overflow pipe to divert flow away from structures.
   o   It is possible to use a number of rain barrels jointly for an area.

Sizing Example for a Rain Barrel
1.   Determine contributing impervious surface area:
 
Garage Roof (Right) 6 ft. x 24 ft. = 144 sq. ft.
 
2.   Determine the amount of rainfall to be captured by the Rain Barrel. A
smaller storm, no more than 2", is recommended to calculate the runoff to be
captured. This example chose the 1" storm event.
3.   Calculate the volume to be captured and reused:
   (144 sq. ft. x 1 inch of runoff) / 12 inches = 12 cu. ft.
4.   Size the rain barrel:
   1   cu. ft. = 7. 48 gallons
   12   cu. ft. x 7.48 = 90 gallons
   90 gallons x (0.25*) = 22.5 gallons (*assuming that the rain barrel is
always at least 25% full)
   90 gallons + 22.5 gallons =112 gallons
   The rain barrel or barrels should be large enough to hold at least 112
gallons of water.

      ZONING OFFICER - The official who is charged with the administration and
enforcement of this code, or any duly authorized representative.
(Ord. 935, 5/10/2018, §27-301)
ARTICLE IV
BULK STANDARDS, RULES, AND REGULATIONS
§ 27-400. Interpretation.
   1.   Where any provisions of this Chapter conflict with other applicable
state and federal laws, the stricter shall apply. In particular, this Chapter
does not intend to conflict with any of the laws or acts regarding mining and
agriculture as are outlined in §
603B of the MPC.
   2.   This Chapter is not intended to annul or supercede any private
easements, covenants, or agreements, except where provisions of this Chapter
are more restrictive. The Zoning Officer shall not be responsible for the
enforcement of the aforesaid agreements unless the Borough is a party thereof.
   3.   The zoning classification of improved and unimproved rights-of-way
within the Borough boundaries shall be considered part of the adjacent zoning
district. In cases where these areas are bordered by more than one district,
the abutting zoning shall extend to the centerline of the subject right-of-way.
Thus, any activities or use of existing rights-of-way which become private
property through adverse possession or any other legal claim to said property
shall adhere to the standards of its respective zoning district classification.
   4.   Zoning classifications as initially determined follow existing parcel
boundaries, as defined by recorded deeds. However, the revision, through
subdivision, of current boundary lines does not constitute any revision of
zoning district boundaries, which shall retain the boundary of the original lot
line, unless an amendment to the zoning map and this Chapter is approved.
   5.   In cases where the lines of a zoning district, as initially determined
by the zoning map, cross a parcel such that the parcel possesses multiple areas
of zoning classification, said lines shall be determined as lines extending
from the most adjacent parcel or lot boundary, where the zoning extends to said
boundary, to the next immediate lot or parcel boundary to which the zoning
boundary of the particular district coincides. The aforementioned situations
occur, initially, on through lots where one face of the block on which the
through lot fronts possesses one zoning and the other lies within a different
zoning district.
   6.   Permitted Use Interpretation.
      1.   The permitted uses defined in this Chapter are based upon the North
American Industrial Classification Standard, 2002. Uses are listed by the
numerical code, as defined and presented in the aforesaid national standard. As
such, uses listed at particular code levels shall be inclusive of all specific
uses classified as part of the listed code level, unless such more detailed
uses are specifically exempted or restricted.
      2.   Where any use specifically defined within this Chapter conflicts
with the use definitions utilized by the North American Industrial
Classification Code, the use defined in this Chapter shall prevail. Therefore,
when uses specifically defined within this Chapter, separate from or
conflicting with the NAICS Code are presented or specifically restricted; the
function and intent of said uses shall prevail against any such conflicting
interpretations as defined in the NAICS Code.
      3.   No portion of this Chapter shall be interpreted such that it
violates the Federal Fair Housing Act, the 1988 Fair Housing Amendments Act,
and related housing and urban development regulations. In particular, the term
“family” shall apply to unrelated members regardless of their membership in
classes protected by the aforementioned acts and regulations, including
handicap.
(Ord. 935, 5/10/2018, §27-400)
§ 27-401. Use Performance Standards.

constitute uniform performance standards for all uses within the Borough and
shall further define the character of the use. Any use, which cannot
demonstrate compliance with the following performance standards, shall not be

materials in any manner.
      2.   Storage of hazardous materials shall be within a principle
structure.
      3.   Storage of hazardous waste shall be within a principle building and
shall not constitute a principle use; whereby said storage shall be temporary,
being permanently disposed of offsite.
      4.   No use shall be noxious or offensive by reason of the emission of
odor, dust, fumes, smoke, gas, vibration or noise detectable at the property
line as to constitute a nuisance or otherwise conflict with any municipal
ordinance.
      5.   No establishment, excepting municipal and school district
activities, as part of its regular operations, shall exceed the noise levels as
measured at the property lines of the parcel upon which the establishment is
operated in the following manners:
         A.   The sound level at any one point in time exceeds 90 decibels.
         B.   The sound exceeds any of the established limits in Item C by a
measured sound level of 10 dB(A) for a cumulative total of one minute or more
out of any ten-minute period.
         C.   The sound exceeds any 75 decibels continually for a period of
five minutes, or a total of five minutes out of any ten minutes.
      D.   Where stricter noise standards are adopted by local ordinance, the
stricter shall prevail.
      6.   On-site display of products associated with an authorized
establishment shall be limited to impervious areas improved as sidewalks or
paved as parking lots pursuant to the construction standards of the Borough.
Said areas specifically designated or intended for the use of such displays
shall not exceed 15% of the gross floor area of the associated establishment.
Storage or display of merchandise accessory to or as part of the principal use
of a retail establishment shall be limited to the gross floor area occupied by

      1.   Fences in all residential, N, MU, and Traditional Neighborhood
Development Districts shall be permitted up to six feet. No fences shall be
constructed of potentially injurious materials such as barbed wire. Fences on
lots with nonconforming structures, which infringe on a front yard setback, may
infringe on the front yard setback up to the building line of the existing
structure.

ARTICLE V
ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS
§ 27-500. Establishment and Purpose of Districts.
   In order to encourage and promote those purposes outlined in Article II of
this Chapter as well as the Borough’s community development objectives, the
Borough hereby establish the following zoning districts, the purposes of which
are hereinafter defined:
   1.   N, Neighborhood Use. The Neighborhood Use District aims to maintain and
enhance the vitality and sustainability of the traditional cores of the
boroughs. The establishment of this district aims to maintain the stability of
residential neighborhoods while permitting businesses which are either
ancillary to or present a low impact on these neighborhoods. Additional forms
of office or small-scale retail are permitted such that they contribute to the
economic vitality of the neighborhood and the entire Borough without negative
impact upon the basic residential and small business environment of the
district. Additionally, the residential mix of this district aims to provide
for alternative housing needs, such as those of the elderly, within a
pedestrian environment offering nearby basic services.
   2.   MU, Mixed Use. The Mixed Use District is established to provide for
single-family based residential uses, residential uses of compatible scale, and
retail and office designed to serve local and regional market demands. The
district therefore primarily aims to maintain a neighborhood scale of
development in portions of Route 30 currently bearing a traditional mixed-use
scale of development and to provide a market based, yet compatible, transition
of residences fronting key north-south collectors of North Versailles.
   3.   R-3, Multi-Family Residential. The Multi-Family District aims to
provide an affordable alternative form of housing to seniors, younger families,
and smaller households in an environment near commercial and retail
conveniences.
   4.   R-2, Neighborhood Residential. The District protects the stability and
integrity of the Borough’s oldest residential neighborhoods, which are
primarily situated on relatively small lots near the traditional main corridors
of the Boroughs and specific areas of the Township.
   5.   P, Neighborhood Park. The Neighborhood Park District is established to
provide for the recreational needs of the Borough’s residents. This district is
intended to enhance the quality of life and sense of community by providing
passive and active recreational amenities in parks and general open space.
   The above districts are depicted on the Zoning Map of East McKeesport
Borough, which are incorporated as part of this Chapter and are filed with the
Borough Office.
(Ord. 935, 5/10/2018, §27-500)

ARTICLE VI
PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT
§ 27-600. Purpose.
   The Borough establishes planned residential development in forms authorized
by district for the following purposes:
   1.   To provide an adequate array of housing opportunities and choices for
existing and future residents of the Borough.
   2.   To encourage the preservation of wooded hillsides and open space
throughout the Borough.
   3.   To facilitate connected open space throughout the Borough in a manner
consistent with the comprehensive plan.
   4.   To encourage the development of unique nodes of residential and mixed
use development that are properly integrated into adjacent transportation
networks and uses with properly buffering and separation from traditional
neighborhoods and mixed use development.
   5.   To provide for development and redevelopment in sustainable forms and
proportions.
   6.   To further the general and municipal community development objectives
upon which this Chapter is based.
(Ord. 935, 5/10/2018, §27-600)
§ 27-601. Residential Community PRD Development Standards.
   1.   Common Open Space. Forty percent of the site shall be dedicated as
common open space adhering to the following standards:
      1.   Said open space shall be distributed in a manner that provides
adequate buffering from adjacent neighborhoods of differing housing type and
design, in a manner in which adjacent neighborhoods of varied or contrasting
character are bordered by open space. Topography, landscaping, and types of
adjacent uses shall determine said adequacy.
      2.   Five percent of the open space required shall be distributed in
central areas of the plan, directly visible from and faced by housing
constructed therein. Such open space shall bear at least 50 feet of frontage on
streets within the planned residential development. The grading of said open
space shall not exceed 8%.
      3.   The common open space shall be distributed in such a manner so as to
preserve, by private covenant in favor of the Borough and by the PRD itself,
wooded hillsides and other valuable natural features within the plan, including
jurisdictional wetlands and floodplains.
      4.   Each phase of the PRD shall bear at least a proportional amount of
open space or may include the dedication of all open space required per the
tentative approval.
   2.   Uses Authorized. The following uses are authorized in the Residential
Community PRD:
      1.   Single-family.
      2.   Duplex.
      3.   Townhouse.
      4.   Elderly residential facilities.
      5.   Neighborhood public and semi-public uses.
   3.   The amount of dwelling units permitted per acre shall be calculated as
follows:
      1.   Forty-three thousand, five hundred sixty square feet divided by the
minimum lot size in square feet of the respective underlying zoning district
shall equal the base density or units per acre.
      2.   The following table shall serve to outline the number of units by
type permitted per acre for the gross acreage included in the PRD. Each acre
against which dwelling unit types are calculated shall not be included in the
calculation of other types permitted. Therefore, the multipliers listed times
the base density equal the number of units permitted per the proportional
acreage of land applied to that dwelling unit type:
 
Use or Dwelling Unit Type                          Multiplier
Single-family                                      1.2
Duplex                                             2.4
Townhouse                                          2.5
Elderly residential facility (number of residents) 7
 
      3.   One establishment of neighborhood public and semi-public use shall
be permitted per 25 dwelling units or for every 60 residents licensed by the
Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare for Elderly Residential Facilities.
   4.   Lot Standards.
      1.   All lots shall bear safe and legal access to a street or access
drives.
      2.   Maximum building height of any structure is 45 feet or three
stories, whichever is less.
      3.   Yard setbacks or front yard build-to lines shall be proposed by the
developer, wherein approved lines shall not impede the administration of
emergency services.
      4.   Types of units authorized are listed in the table below. The table
establishes the distances, in lineal feet, that each such structure or group of
units or structures must be setback from another, by type. General lot design
of fee simple building lots shall be capable of accommodating specific use
types for which each is designated, allowing a building footprint permitting
the following setback distances from neighboring structures, as designated.

      5.   Considering elderly residential facilities as one unit by
establishment, all types of units shall be capable of separate fee simple
conveyance through placement on fee simple lots or property interest created as
condominiums. Generally lots proposed to bear single-family residences shall be
at least 40 feet in width at the proposed and accepted building line.
   5.   Landscaping. At a minimum, townhouse units shall be landscaped around
the front of the units which face the street or access drive bearing one high
level planting per unit or two ornamental trees per unit; and four low level
plantings per unit. Elderly residential facilities shall provide 30% of the lot
on which they are constructed as landscaped area bearing grass, groundcover, or
decorative stone or mulch. Said area shall include one high-level or two
ornamental trees for every 1,500 square feet of landscaped area and one low
level planting for every 300 square feet of said landscaped area.
   6.   Elderly residential and neighborhood public or semi-public
establishments shall be housed within structures adhering to the standards of §
27-905.
   7.   Applicability of Zoning Ordinance Provisions, Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance, and Related Ordinances. Unless expressly modified by the
standards of this Section, all other requirements of this Chapter, the local
subdivision and land development ordinance, and local street, grading, and
other land development standards shall apply to developments proposed under
this Section. Such ordinance standards may be modified only when the developer
demonstrates that literal enforcement will exact undue hardship because of
peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question, provided that such
modification will not be contrary to the public interest and that the purpose
and intent of the ordinance is observed; or that a modification meets or
exceeds standards meeting the purpose or intent of the ordinance in question.
The above shall not withstand all standard post approval requirements
instituted by the local subdivision and land development ordinance, namely the
required posting of financial security for streets, public improvements, and
certain private amenities.
(Ord. 935, 5/10/2018, §27-601)
§ 27-602. Mixed Use Community, PRD Development Standards.
   1.   The land area of residential components that include the uses
authorized in the Residential Community PRD Standards shall be so designated on
the plan and subject to and limited to the standards authorized in the
Residential Community PRD, including open space requirements.
   2.   The commercial component shall be designated on the plan and subject to
the specific standards of this Section, the provisions of §
27-603.1 not withstanding for the residential components.
   3.   The maximum building height shall be 65 feet.
   4.   All uses expressly authorized as permitted or conditional in the
underlying zoning district shall be authorized as such in the underlying
district. Additionally, mixed use buildings are authorized.
   5.   Principal structures shall provide a front yard setback of at least 50
feet.
   6.   Unless connected by party walls, structures shall provide for side and
rear yard setbacks of at least 50 feet with one additional foot of setback for
each foot in height above two stories. Where multiple principle structures
exist on one lot, this setback shall be enforced between principal structures
as well.
   7.   Thirty percent of the land area in the commercial portion shall be
dedicated as common open space. Five percent of the open space required shall
be provided in a central area faced by more than one principle structure and
fronting a street. Said space shall be 5% or less in grade and shall provide
for pedestrian usage.
   8.   Principal commercial structures shall be set back at least 50 feet from
residentially designated sections of the development.
   9.   Landscaping shall be provided around the perimeter of all parking lots
at a rate of one high level planting for each 50 lineal feet of perimeter,
including access drives. Additionally, landscaping shall be disbursed around
visible portions of the principal structure at a rate of one high level
planting or one ornamental tree and four low level plantings for each 25 lineal
feet of the structure’s perimeter.
   10.   The residential component of the development, those uses solely
authorized in the Residential Community PRD, shall comprise at least 20% of the
square footage of all uses within the PRD and no more than 60% of the total
square footage.
   11.   The proportion of retail, office, and manufacturing/warehouse shall be
submitted as proposed and shall be authorized given the proportion of uses
reasonably related to the similar proportion in the Borough at large,
determined by the most recent economic census and subsequent permit data.
Employment within or regular utilization of ancillary establishment intended
primarily for use by residents of the PRD shall also serve as a finding of fact
or justification for approved use proportions.
   12.   All final phases approved shall contain the proportions of commercial
development type commensurate with that approved in the overall or tentative
approval. Same shall also include at least 20% of the land area as residential
or may develop all residential in the first final phase constructed. In lieu of
such provisions, a developer may submit covenants in favor of the municipality,
in a form acceptable to the municipality, which restrict future development to
those uses shown on the tentative plan.
   13.   Applicability of zoning ordinance provisions, subdivision and land
development ordinance, and related ordinances. Unless expressly modified by the
standards of this Section, all other requirements of this Chapter, the local
subdivision and land development ordinance, and local street, grading, and
other land development standards shall apply to developments proposed under
this Section. Such ordinance standards may be modified only when the developer
demonstrates that literal enforcement will exact undue hardship because of
peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question, provided that such
modification will not be contrary to the public interest and that the purpose
and intent of the ordinance is observed; or that a modification meets or
exceeds standards meeting the purpose or intent of the ordinance in question.
The above shall not withstand all standard post approval requirements
instituted by the local subdivision and land development ordinance, namely the
required posting of financial security for streets, public improvements, and
certain private amenities.
(Ord. 935, 5/10/2018, §27-602)

(Ord. 935, 5/10/2018, §27-604)
§ 27-605. Tentative Plan Approval Process.
   1.   The Zoning Officer shall review an application for tentative approval
within one week of delivery and shall notify the applicant of any deficiencies
of certify the applicant as complete. Submissions of deficient items shall be
reviewed in the same manner. The Zoning Officer shall, when all application
materials are submitted, certify the application as complete. The date on which
completion is certified shall constitute the official filing date.
   2.   The Planning Commission shall review the application at the next
regular meeting scheduled 21 days or later from the official filing date.
   3.   The governing body shall hold a public hearing on the matter pursuant
to public notice within 60 days of the official filing date. The governing body
may hold subsequent hearings, provided that all hearings are concluded within
60 days of the initial hearing.
   4.   Decision. Within 60 days following the conclusion of the public
hearings or 180 days from the official filing date, whichever is less, the
governing body shall, by official written communication, either grant tentative
approval of the development plan, as submitted; grant tentative approval of the
development plan, subject to specified conditions not included in the
development plan as submitted; or deny tentative approval. Failure to act
within said period shall be deemed to be a grant of tentative approval of the
development plan as submitted. In the event, however, that tentative approval
is granted subject to conditions, the landowner may, within 30 days after
receiving a copy of the official written communication of the governing body,
notify the governing body of his refusal to accept all said conditions, in
which case, the governing body shall be deemed to have denied tentative
approval of the development plan. In the event that the landowner does not,
within said period, notify the governing body of his refusal to accept all said
conditions, tentative approval of the development plan, with all said
conditions, shall stand as granted. The decision will be filed with the
secretary of the governing body and the applicant. The decision shall include
an approved schedule of final plan application filing which shall not be less
than three months from the tentative approval date.
   5.   Tentative approval of a development plan shall not qualify a plat of
the planned residential development for recording nor authorize development or
the issuance of any building permits. A development plan which has been given
tentative approval as submitted, or which has been given tentative approval
with conditions which have been accepted by the landowner (and provided that
the landowner has not defaulted nor violated any of the conditions of the
tentative approval), shall not be modified or revoked nor otherwise impaired by
action of the municipality pending an application or applications for final
approval, without the consent of the landowner, provided an application or
applications for final approval is filed or, in the case of development over a
period of years, provided applications are filed, within the periods of time
specified in the official written communication granting tentative approval.
   6.   In the event that a development plan is given tentative approval and
thereafter, but prior to final approval, the landowner shall elect to abandon
said development plan and shall so notify the governing body in writing, or in
the event the landowner shall fail to file application or applications for
final approval within the required period of time or times, as the case may be,
the tentative approval shall be deemed to be revoked and all that portion of
the area included in the development plan for which final approval has not been
given shall be subject to those local ordinances otherwise applicable thereto
as they may be amended from time to time, and the same shall be noted on the
zoning map and in the records of the municipal secretary or clerk of the
municipality.
(Ord. 935, 5/10/2018, §27-605)
§ 27-606. Tentative Plan Approval Findings.

based on the following findings of fact.
   1.   In those respects in which the development plan is or is not consistent
with the comprehensive plan for the development of the municipality.
   2.   The extent to which the development plan departs from zoning and
subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the subject property including,
but not limited to, density, bulk and use, and the reasons why such departures
are or are not deemed to be in the public interest.
   3.   The purpose, location and amount of the common open space in the
planned residential development, the reliability of the proposals for
maintenance and conservation of the common open space, and the adequacy or
inadequacy of the amount and purpose of the common open space as related to the
proposed density and type of residential development.
   4.   The physical design of the development plan and the manner in which
said design does or does not make adequate provision for public services,
provide adequate control over vehicular traffic, and further the amenities of
light and air, recreation and visual enjoyment.
   5.   The relationship, beneficial or adverse, of the proposed planned
residential development to the neighborhood in which it is proposed to be
established.
   6.   In the case of a development plan which proposes development over a
period of years, the sufficiency of the terms and conditions intended to
protect the interests of the public and of the residents of the planned
residential development in the integrity of the development plan.
   7.   The mixture of uses and housing choices and commercial establishments
and their ability or inability to meet current and anticipated needs of present
and future residents and patrons.
   8.   Adherence to all specific performance standards and requirements of
this Article or lack thereof.
(Ord. 935, 5/10/2018, §27-606)
§ 27-607. Final Approval Application Requirements.
   Final applications shall include the following:
   1.   All final reports demonstrating compliance with local erosion and
sedimentation, grading, and stormwater ordinances in forms required by the
municipal engineer and the respective ordinances.
   2.   A plan showing existing and proposed contours at intervals of five

§ 27-608. Final Plan Approval Process.
   1.   The Zoning Officer shall review an application for final approval
within one week of delivery and shall notify the applicant of any deficiencies
of certify the applicant as complete. Submissions of deficient items shall be
reviewed in the same manner. The Zoning Officer shall, when all application
materials are submitted, certify the application as complete. The date on which
completion is certified shall constitute the official filing date.
   2.   Variation from Original Plan. In the event that the development plan
submitted contains variations from the development plan granted tentative
approval, the governing body may refuse to grant final approval and may, within
45 days of the official filing date of the application for final approval
(Provided, however, that should the next regular meeting occur more than 30
days following the official filing date, the 45-day period shall be measured
from the 30th day following the day the application has been filed), advise the
applicant, in writing, of said refusal, setting forth in said notice the
reasons why one or more of the variations are not in the public interest. In
the event of such refusal, the landowner may either refile the application for
final approval without the variations objected; or file a written request with
the Borough that it hold a public hearing on the application for final
approval. If the landowner wishes to take either alternate action, he may do so
at any time within which he shall be entitled to apply for final approval, or
within 30 additional days, if the time for applying for final approval shall
have already passed at the time when the landowner was advised that the
development plan was not in substantial compliance. If the landowner fails to
take either of these alternate actions within said time, he shall be deemed to
have abandoned the development plan. Any such public hearing shall be held
pursuant to public notice within 30 days after request for the hearing is made
by the landowner, and the hearing shall be conducted in the manner described in
this Article for public hearings on applications for tentative approval. Within
30 days after the conclusion of the hearing, the governing body shall by
official written communication either grant final approval to the development
plan or deny final approval. The grant or denial of final approval of the
development plan shall, in cases arising under this Section, be in the form and
contain the findings required for an application for tentative approval set
forth in this Article. Failure of the governing body to render a decision on an
application for final approval and communicate it to the applicant within the
time and in the manner required by this Section shall be deemed an approval of
the application for final approval, as presented, unless the applicant has
agreed in writing to an extension of time or change in the prescribed manner of
presentation of communication of the decision, in which case, failure to meet
the extended time or change in manner or presentation of communication shall
have like effect.
   3.   In the event the application for final approval has been officially
filed, together with all drawings, specifications and other d   ocuments in
support thereof, and as required by this Article and the official written
communication of tentative approval, the municipality shall, within 45 days
from the date of the regular meeting of the local planning commission,
whichever first reviews the application, next following the date the
application is filed, grant such development plan final approval. Provided,
however, that should the next regular meeting occur more than 30 days following
the filing of the application, the 45-day period shall be measured from the
30th day following the official filing date.
   4.   The developer shall post financial security and shall execute a
developer’s agreement as required by the local subdivision ordinance prior to
recording of the final plat. The plat shall be recorded within 90 days of final
plan approval. The developer’s agreement shall at a minimum, in addition to
that required by the local subdivision ordinance, cite those provisions of the
notice of tentative approval applicable to the respective phase, include a
timeline for development proposed by the developer but not to exceed five
years, reference construction inspections and responsibilities, reference the
installation of landscaping and private amenities, and address the recordation
of homeowners’ association documents and covenants.
   5.   The developer shall be afforded the five-year timeline to commence and
complete development as noted in § 508 of the Municipalities Planning Code and
otherwise applicable to subdivisions and land developments. Where the developer
notifies the governing body that he has abandoned the plan or the aforesaid
timeline cited in § 508 expires, the plan shall be deemed abandoned and no
further development or permits for such development shall take place. The
governing body shall amend its ordinance to reclassify the property to a zoning
district.
(Ord. 935, 5/10/2018, §27-608)
§ 27-609. Modification of Planned Residential Development Provisions.
   1.   An applicant for permits which do not conform strictly to the approved
plan may request a modification to the plan by providing all reports and plans
required by final approval which are proposed to be modified. A statement
concerning consistency with the comprehensive plan and community development
objectives shall be submitted along with any required fees and forms provided
by the municipality. Upon acceptance, the application shall be afforded the
timelines and process provided for final PRD approval. The governing body,
however, shall hold a public hearing pursuant to public notice prior to voting
on the application.
   2.   Modification approval shall be provided in a manner that meets all
requirements and standards of this Article.
   3.   Findings regarding approval shall consider the following:
      1.   No such modification, removal or release of the provisions of the
development plan by the municipality shall affect the rights of the residents
of the planned residential development to maintain and enforce those
provisions, at law or equity, as provided in this Section.
      2.   No modification, removal or release of the provisions of the
development plan by the municipality shall be permitted except upon a finding
by the governing body or the planning agency, following a public hearing
thereon pursuant to public notice called and held in accordance with the
provisions of this Article, that the same is consistent with the efficient
development and preservation of the entire planned residential development,
does not adversely affect either the enjoyment of land abutting upon or across
the street from the planned residential development or the public interest, and
is not granted solely to confer a special benefit upon any person.
      3.   No part of the approval shall conflict with private covenants that
run in favor of residents or property owners within the entire PRD.

§ 27-704. TND Standards.
   The following outline the standards by which all proposed TND’s shall be
evaluated and also constitute the regulations to which all future uses and
improvements within those approved TND’s must adhere.
   1.   Bulk Standards and Public Improvements.
      1.   The following definitions shall apply to this Article:
         A.   MIXED USE BUILDING - any structure containing residential
dwellings units combined with commercial uses permitted as of right in the
respective zoning district of the traditional neighborhood development in which
it is located, where the commercial component comprises at least 20% of the
gross square footage of the structure.
         B.   COMMON OPEN SPACE - space provided for the use and enjoyment of
residents of a plan or patrons and employees of an establishment, or of the
public at large.
      2.   A build-to line shall be established, which shall be between 15 and
30 feet. Unenclosed porches may invade said line by eight feet. Both the
proposed character of the development and the present character of adjacent
neighborhoods shall determine the build-to line. Twenty percent of the proposed
structures are encouraged to deviate from the build-to line by five to ten feet
and may be between 15 to 40 feet from the right-of-way line. Namely, the offset
of larger nonresidential structures is encouraged in the aforementioned manner
as approved by the governing body.
      3.   All lighting, parking, signage, and accessory structure standards
cited in this Chapter shall apply to this Article, unless expressly modified
herein.
      4.   Lighting. Street lighting shall be required within ten feet of the
right-of-way. Covenants in favor of the Borough shall require the maintenance
of said lighting. The height of said lighting shall be limited to 15 feet and
shall be approved by Council based on designs appropriate to a residential and
pedestrian scale.
      5.   Numbers of Units and Size of TND Development. Each phase of a TND
proposed shall contain at least five dwelling units which may include up to two
repaired units as outlined in §§
27-704.2.5 and

Board shall be returned to the appealing party by the Borough if the Zoning
Hearing Board, or any court in a subsequent appeal, rules in the appealing
party’s favor. The enforcement notice shall state at least the following:

shall, upon being found liable therefore in a civil enforcement proceeding
commenced by the governing body, pay a judgment of not more than $500 plus all
court costs, including reasonable attorney fees incurred by a municipality as a
result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or payable
until the date of the determination of a violation by the district justice. If
the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the governing body
may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure.
Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation,
unless the district justice determining that there has been a violation further
determines that there was a good faith basis for the person, partnership or
corporation violating this Chapter to have believed that there was no such
violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have been only one such
violation until the fifth day following the date of the determination of a
violation by the district justice and thereafter each day that a violation
continues shall constitute a separate violation. All judgments, costs and
reasonable attorney fees collected for the violation of zoning ordinances shall
be paid over to the Borough.

the required fee for a variance as outlined in the Borough fee schedule and a
completed application with all required contact information as well as
additional information, if any, required by the Board.
      2.   The Board shall grant a variance, only when findings of fact are
supported by all of the following where relevant in a given case and therefore
constitute an unnecessary hardship inflicted by this Chapter.
         A.   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or
exceptional topographical property and that the unnecessary hardship is due to
such conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally’ created by
the provisions of this Chapter in the neighborhood in which the property is
located.
         B.   That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there
is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with
the provisions of this Chapter and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
         C.   That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
         D.   That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
         E.   That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulation in issue.
      3.    In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards, as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes
of this act and this Chapter.

a completed application with all required contact information as well as
additional information, if any, required by the Board.
      3.   Special exceptions for nonconforming uses shall be evaluated by the
following criteria at a minimum.
         A.   The impact of any proposed use on the neighborhood of which it is
a part compared with the impact of the existing nonconforming use. A proposed
use shall not present a greater adverse impact as compared with the existing
use.
         B.   The impact of an expansion of the nonconforming use and the
manner in which the expansion changes or redefines the impact of the current
nonconforming use.
         C.   The extent to which a proposed expansion changes the scale of use
such that the use itself may be changed such that it does not present an
adverse impact on the neighborhood and district in which it is located. The
expansion shall be considered a natural outgrowth necessary to the economic
vitality and sustainability of the current nonconforming use.
         D.   The consistency of any proposed expansion with the current
character of a neighborhood or district.
         E.   The change in parking required and traffic circulation associated
with any proposed expansion or change in use.
      4.   In granting any special exception, the Board may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes of this act and this Chapter.
      5.   Proposed additions shall conform dimensionally and otherwise to the
standards of the present ordinance, or shall otherwise require a dimensional
variance.

Borough’s fee schedule, name and contract information, copies of the permit
application, and any additional details relating to the denial or order issued.

based on procedural defects associated with the adoption process.
   9.   Validity Challenges.

classes of persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by the challenged provisions
of the ordinance or map.
         C.   The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by
the site’s soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers, natural

public health and welfare.
      5.   If the Board fails to act on the landowner’s request within the time
limits referred to in § 27-1102.9(3), a denial of the request is deemed to have

ARTICLE XII
FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS
§ 27-1200. Purpose.
   1.   The purpose of these provisions is to prevent the loss of property and
life, the protection of health and safety, to prevent the disruption of
commerce and governmental services, the extraordinary and unnecessary
expenditure of public funds for flood protection and relief, and the impairment
of the tax base by:
      1.   Regulating uses, activities, and development which, acting alone or
in combination with other existing or future uses, activities, and development,
will cause unacceptable increases in flood heights, velocities and frequencies.
      2.   Restricting or prohibiting certain uses, activities, and development
from locating within areas subject to flooding.
      3.   Requiring all those uses, activities, and developments that do occur
in floodprone areas to be protected and/or flood-proofed against flooding and
flood damage.
      4.   Protecting individuals from buying lands and structures which are
unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards.
(Ord. 935, 5/10/2018, §27-1200)
§ 27-1201. Applicability.
   1.   These provisions shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of
the Borough and shown as being located within the boundaries of the designated
floodplain districts which shall be considered to be a part of the official
Zoning Map.
   2.   There is hereby established and approved a map as part of the official
Zoning Map of the Borough, which is incorporated and made part of this Chapter
as an overlay district, modifying the provisions of the underlying districts.
Said map shall be referred to as the Floodplain Overlay Map, as amended. Said
map shall include the Floodway, Flood-Fringe, and General Floodplain Districts,
the delineation of which is defined herein.
(Ord. 935, 5/10/2018, §27-1201)
§ 27-1202. Compliance.
   1.   No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure shall be
located, relocated, constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, or structurally
altered except in full compliance with the terms and provisions of this Article
and any other applicable ordinances and regulations which apply to uses within
the jurisdiction of this Article.
(Ord. 935, 5/10/2018, §27-1202)
§ 27-1203. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
   1.   The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this Article
is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on acceptable
engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and
bridge openings restricted by debris. This Article does not imply that areas
outside the floodplain districts or that land uses permitted within such
districts will be free from flooding or flood damages.
   2.   This Article shall not create liability on the part of the Township, or
any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance
on this Article or any administrative decision.
(Ord. 935, 5/10/2018, §27-1203)
§ 27-1204. Basis of Districts.
   1.   The various floodplain districts shall include areas subject to
inundation by waters of the 100-year flood. The basis for the delineation of
these districts shall be the Flood Insurance Study for the governing body
prepared by the Federal Insurance Administration dated August 15, 1979,
effective February 15, 1980, as amended.
   2.   The FW (Floodway District) is delineated for purposes of this Article
using the criteria that a certain area within the floodplain must be capable of
carrying the waters of the 100-year flood more than one foot at any point. The
areas included in this area are defined in the floodway data table contained in
the Flood Insurance Study as prepared by FEMA and shown on the recorded FIRM.
Where no floodway has been delineated in the FIS, such information contained in
any other available Federal, State or other acceptable source should be used.
   3.   The FF (Flood-Fringe District) shall be that area of the 100-year
floodplain not included in the floodway. The basis for the outermost boundary
of this area shall be the 100-year flood elevations contained in the flood
profiles provided in the FIS. Where elevation information is not provided in
the FIS, such information provided in any other available Federal, State or
other acceptable source should be used.
   4.   The General Floodplain District (FA) shall be that floodplain area for
which no detailed flood profiles or elevations have been provided. They are
shown on the maps accompanying the FIS prepared by FIA. Where the specific 100-
year flood elevation cannot be determined for this area using other sources of
data such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Floodplain Information Reports,
U.S. Geological Survey FloodProne Quadrangles, etc., then the applicant for the
proposed use, development and/or activity shall determine this elevation in
accordance with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others
of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods
used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies,
analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow
a thorough technical review by the governing body.
(Ord. 935, 5/10/2018, §27-1204)
§ 27-1205. District Standards.
   1.   Any nonresidential structure, or part thereof, having a lowest floor
which is not elevated to at least one and one-half feet above the 100-year
flood elevation shall be floodproofed in a completely or essentially dry manner
in accordance with the W1 or W2 space classification standards contained in the
publication entitled “Floodproofing Regulations” published by U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers (June, 1972) or with some other equivalent standard. All plans and
specifications for such floodproofing shall be accompanied by a statement
certified by a registered professional engineer or architect which states that
the proposed design and methods of construction are in conformance with the
above referenced standards.
   2   District Boundary Changes. The delineation of any of the floodplain
districts may be revised by the Borough where natural or man-made changes have
occurred and/or more detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, a River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or
individual documents the notification for such change. However, prior to any
such change, approval must be obtained from the Federal Insurance
Administration (FIA).
   3.   Interpretation of District Boundaries. Initial interpretations of the
boundaries of the floodplain districts shall be made by the Zoning Officer.
Should a dispute arise concerning the boundaries of any of the districts, the
Zoning Hearing Board shall make the necessary determination. The person
questioning or contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to present his case to the Board and to submit his own
technical evidence if he so desires.
   4.   Within any identified floodplain district, fully enclosed spaces below
the lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be
prohibited.
   5.   All uses, activities and development occurring with any floodplain
district shall be undertaken only in strict compliance with the provisions of
this Part and with all other applicable codes and ordinances such as the
Uniform Construction Code, and the local subdivision and land development
ordinance. In addition, all such uses, activities and development shall be
undertaken only in compliance with Federal or State law including §404 of the
Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. §1334.
   6.   Under no circumstance shall any use, activity and/or development
adversely affect the capacity of the channels or floodways of any watercourse,
drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
   7.   Prior to any proposed alteration or relocation of any stream,
watercourse, etc., within the Borough, a permit shall be obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection, Dam Safety, Obstructions and Stormwater
Management Division. Further, notification of the proposal by the Borough shall
be given to all affected adjacent municipalities. Copies of such notifications
shall be forwarded to both the Federal Insurance Administration and the
Department of Community and Economic Development.
(Ord. 935, 5/10/2018, §27-1205)
§ 27-1206. Floodway District.
   1.   Floodway District (FW). In the Floodway District no development shall
be permitted except where any rise in flood heights caused by the proposed
development will be fully offset by accompanying improvements which have been
approved by all appropriate local and/or State authorities as required above.
   2.   Permitted Uses.
      1.   Public and private recreational uses and activities such as parks,
day camps, picnic grounds, golf courses, boat launching and swimming areas,
hiking, and horseback riding trails, wildlife and nature preserves, game farms,
fish hatcheries, trap and skeet game ranges, and hunting and fishing areas, not
including buildings related thereto.
   3.   Special Exceptions.
      1.   Essential services.

§ 27-1207. Flood-Fringe District (FF).
   1.   In the Flood-Fringe District the development and/or use of land shall
be permitted in accordance with the regulations of the underlying district
provided that all such uses, activities, and/or development shall be undertaken
in strict compliance with the flood-proofing and related provisions contained
in all other applicable codes and ordinances.
(Ord. 935, 5/10/2018, §27-1207)
§ 27-1208. General Floodplain District (FA).
   1.   In the General Floodplain Conservation District, the development and/or
use of land shall be permitted in accordance with the regulations of the
underlying district provided that all such uses, activities, and/or development
shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the flood-proofing and related
provisions contained in all other applicable codes and ordinances.
(Ord. 935, 5/10/2018, §27-1208)
§ 27-1209. Special Exception and Variances, Additional Criteria.
   In passing upon applications for special exceptions and variances the Zoning
Hearing Board shall consider all relevant factors and procedures specified in
other Sections of this Chapter and the following:
   1.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments. No special exception or variance shall be
granted for any proposed use, development, or activity that will cause any
increase in flood levels in the Floodway District.
   2.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other lands or downstream
to the injury of others.
   3.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.
   4.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owners.
   5.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
community.
   6.   The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location.
   7.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for
the proposed use.
   8.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
   9.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for the area.
   10.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood of ordinary and
emergency vehicles.
   11.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise; and sediment
transport of the flood waters expected at the site.
   12.   The Zoning Hearing Board may refer any application and accompanying
documentation pertaining to any request for a special exception or variance to
any engineer or other qualified person or agency for technical assistance in
evaluating the proposed project in relation to flood heights and velocities,
and the adequacy of the plans for protection and other related matters.
   13.   Special exceptions and/or variances shall only be issued after the
Zoning Hearing Board has determined that the granting of such will not result
in (a) unacceptable or prohibited increases in flood heights, (b) additional
threats to public safety, (c) extraordinary public expense, (d) create
nuisances, (e) cause fraud or victimization of the public, or (f) conflict with
local laws or ordinances.
   14.   In considering the presence of a hardship on a subject property,
extraordinary justification shall be required for properties over one and one-
half acres.

AIRPORT DISTRICT OVERLAY
§ 27-1300. Purpose.
   The purpose of this Article is to create an Airport District Overlay that
considers safety issues around the Allegheny County Airport, regulates and
restricts the heights of constructed structures and objects of natural growth,
creates appropriate zones, establishing the boundaries thereof and providing
for changes in the restrictions and boundaries of such zones, creates the
permitting process for use within said zones and provides for enforcement,
assessment of violation penalties, an appeals process, and judicial review.
(Ord. 935, 5/10/2018, §27-1300)
§ 27-1301. Relation to Other Zone Districts.
   The Airport District Overlay shall not modify the boundaries of any
underlying zoning district. Where identified, the Airport District Overlay
shall impose certain requirements on land use and construction in addition to
those contained in the underlying zoning district.
(Ord. 935, 5/10/2018, §27-1301)
§ 27-1302. Definitions.
   The following words and phrases when used in this Article shall have the
meaning given to them in this Section unless the context clearly indicates
otherwise:
   AIRPORT ELEVATION - the highest point of an airport’s useable landing area
measured in feet above sea level. The airport elevation of the Allegheny County
Airport is 1,250 feet above mean sea level.
   AIRPORT HAZARD - any structure or object, natural or man-made, or use of

surface zone, as shown on Figure 1, is based on the conical surface.
   DEPARTMENT - Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.
   FAA - Federal Aviation Administration of the United States Department of
Transportation.
   HEIGHT - for the purpose of determining the height limits in all zones set
forth in this Article and shown on the zoning map, the datum shall be mean sea
level elevation unless otherwise specified.
   HORIZONTAL SURFACE (ZONE) - an imaginary plane 150 feet above the
established airport elevation that is constructed by swinging arcs of various
radii from the center of the end of the primary surface and then connecting the
adjacent arc by tangent lines. The radius of each arc is based on the planned
approach. The horizontal surface zone, as shown on Figure 1, is derived from
the horizontal surface.

(Ord. 935, 5/10/2018, §27-1303)
§ 27-1304. Permit Applications.
   As regulated by Act 164 and defined by 14 CFR, Part 77.13(a) (as amended or
replaced), any person who plans to erect a new structure, to add to an existing
structure, or to erect and maintain any object (natural or manmade), in the
vicinity of the airport, shall first notify the Department’s Bureau of Aviation
(BOA) by submitting PennDOT Form AV-57 to obtain an obstruction review of the
proposal at least 30 days prior to commencement thereof. The Department’s BOA
response must be included with this permit application for it to be considered
complete. If the Department’s BOA returns a determination of no penetration of
airspace, the permit request should be considered in compliance with the intent
of this Article. If the Department’s BOA returns a determination of a
penetration of airspace, the permit shall be denied, and the project sponsor
may seek a variance from such regulations as outlined in §
27-1305.
   No permit is required to make maintenance repairs to or to replace parts of
existing structures which do not enlarge or increase the height of an existing
structure.
(Ord. 935, 5/10/2018, §27-1304)
§ 27-1305. Variance.
   Any request for a variance shall include documentation in compliance with 14
CFR, Part 77, Subpart B (FAA Form 7460-1 as amended or replaced).
Determinations of whether to grant a variance will depend on the determinations
made by the FAA and the Department’s BOA as to the effect of the proposal on
the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of
navigable air space. In particular, the request for a variance shall consider
which of the following categories the FAA has placed the proposed construction
in:
   1.   No Objection. The subject construction is determined to not exceed
obstruction standards and marking/lighting is not required to mitigate
potential hazard. Under this determination a variance shall be granted.
   2.   Conditional Determination. The proposed construction/alteration is
determined to create some level of encroachment into an airport hazard area
which can be effectively mitigated. Under this determination, a variance shall
be granted contingent upon implementation of mitigating measures as described
in §27-1308, “Obstruction Marking and Lighting.”
   3.   Objectionable. The proposed construction/alteration is determined to be
a hazard and is thus objectionable. A variance shall be denied and the reasons
for this determination shall be outlined to the applicant.
   Such requests for variances shall be granted where it is duly found that a
literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in
unnecessary hardship and that relief granted will not be contrary to the public
interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial
justice, and will be in accordance with the intent of this Article.
(Ord. 935, 5/10/2018, §27-1305)
§ 27-1306. Use Restrictions.
   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Article, no use shall be made
of land or water within the Airport District Overlay in such a manner as to
create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio
communications between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots
to distinguish between airport lights and others, impair visibility in the
vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards or otherwise endanger or
interfere with the landing, takeoff or maneuvering of aircraft utilizing the
Allegheny County Airport.
(Ord. 935, 5/10/2018, §27-1306)
§ 27-1307. Pre-Existing Nonconforming Uses.
   The regulations prescribed by this Article shall not be construed to require
the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure or tree
not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of this Article, or
otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use. No
nonconforming use shall be structurally altered or permitted to grow higher, so
as to increase the nonconformity, and a nonconforming use, once substantially
abated (subject to the underlying zoning ordinance,) may only be reestablished
consistent with the provisions herein.
(Ord. 935, 5/10/2018, §27-1307)
§ 27-1308. Obstruction Marking and Lighting.
   Any permit or variance granted pursuant to the provisions of this Article
may be conditioned according to the process described in §27-1305 to require
the owner of the structure or object of natural growth in question to permit
the municipality, at its own expense, or require the person requesting the
permit or variance, to install, operate, and maintain such marking or lighting
as deemed necessary to assure both ground and air safety.
