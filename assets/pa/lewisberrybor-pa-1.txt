§ 1-104.   Headings.
   Chapter, Subchapter, Part, Subpart, Section, Subsection, Paragraph,
Subparagraph, Clause, and Subclause headings contained in the Code may not be
deemed to govern, limit, modify or affect the scope, meaning or intent of the
Code. The headings of Sections, Subsections or other divisions of this Code are
intended as mere captions to indicate the contents of the Section, Subsection
or other division and shall not be deemed to be taken as titles of such
Section, Subsection or other division, nor as any part of said Section,
Subsection or other division unless expressly so provided.
(Ord. 2007-2, 12/17/2007)
§ 1-105.   Tenses, Gender and Number.
   Except as may be otherwise stated in any provision of this Code, the present
tense includes the past and future tenses, and the future the present; the
masculine gender includes the feminine and neuter, the feminine includes the
masculine and neuter, and the neuter includes the masculine and feminine; and
the singular includes the plural, and the plural the singular.
(Ord. 2007-2, 12/17/2007)
§ 1-106.   Construction.
   1.   Except as may be otherwise specifically provided by any provision of
this Code, the Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1501 et seq.,
shall be applied in construing this Code.
   2.   Effect of Repeal or Expiration of Code Section.
      A.   The repeal of a Code Section or ordinance, or its expiration by
virtue of any provision contained therein, shall not affect any right accrued
or any offense committed, any penalty or punishment incurred, or any proceeding
commenced before the repeal took effect or the ordinance expired.
      B.   When any ordinance repealing a former Code Section, ordinance,
clause or provision shall itself be repealed, such repeal shall not be
construed to revive such former Code Section, ordinance, clause or provision,
unless it shall be expressly so provided.
   3.   Saving Clause. The provisions of this Code, so far as they are the same
as those ordinances and regulations in force immediately prior to the adoption
of this Code, are intended as a continuation of such ordinances, resolutions
and regulations and not as a new enactment. The provisions of this Code shall
not affect any suit or prosecution pending or to be instituted to enforce any
of the prior ordinances or regulations. Except as specifically stated in this
Code or in the ordinance adopting this consolidation, codification and revision
of the ordinances and regulations of the Borough of Lewisberry, it is the
intention of the Borough Council that no ordinance or regulation of the Borough
be amended, revised or repealed by implication.
   4.   Resolutions. The provisions of this Code of Ordinances may contain
resolutions, that is, actions of the Borough Council of the Borough of
Lewisberry (in written form and designated "resolution”) which did not require
prior public notice in accordance with the provisions of the Borough Code, 53
P.S. § 45101 et seq., at the time of their passage by the Borough Council. Such
"resolutions” are included herein for ease of reference and the Borough Council
does not intend by their inclusion herein to require prior public notice before
amending, revising or repealing such resolution or resolutions as may have been
included herein in the future. It is the intention of the Borough Council that
such actions of the Borough Council that may be included in this Code and
specifically cited and designated as a resolution shall not become an ordinance
(requiring prior public notice before amendment, revision or repeal) by the
simple fact of inclusion in this Code.
(Ord. 2007-2, 12/17/2007)
§ 1-107.   Normal Numbering.
   1.   Chapters. Chapters are numbered sequentially in Arabic throughout this
Code.
   2.   Parts. Parts are numbered sequentially in Arabic throughout this Code.
   3.   Whenever other divisions are necessary, Chapters shall be divided into
Subchapters, Parts into Subparts and designated with the Chapter or Part number
followed by a capital letter. For instance, Chapter 1 may be divided into
Subchapters 1A and 1B.
   4.   Sections. Sections are numbered sequentially throughout a Chapter and a
Part such that the first number or numbers is the Chapter number, followed by a
hyphen, followed by the Part number, followed by the Section number within the
Part. For example, "§ 1-101" designates Chapter 1, Part 1, Section 1.
Similarly, “§ 27-305" designates Chapter 27, Part 3, Section 5.
   5.   Internal Divisions of Sections. Whenever internal divisions are
necessary, Sections shall be divided into Subsections, Subsections into
Paragraphs, Paragraphs into Subparagraphs, Subparagraphs into Clauses, and
Clauses into Subclauses, and Subclauses into Items, designated as follows:
   1.   Subsection.
      A.   Paragraph.
         (1)   Subparagraph.
            (a)   Clause.
               1)   Subclause.
                  a)   Item.
                     i.   Subitem
(Ord. 2007-2, 12/17/2007)
§ 1-108.   Special Numbering Problems.
   1.   Addition of New Units Between Existing Units. If it becomes necessary
to introduce a new Chapter, Part or Section between existing Chapters, Parts or
Sections, the new Chapter, Part or Section shall be designated by the addition
of a capital letter suffix to the preceding Chapter, Part or Section number.
Thus, a Chapter introduced between Chapters 5 and 6 would be Chapter 5A and
Sections in that Chapter would be numbered, for instance, “§ 5A-101.” If it
becomes necessary to introduce a Part between existing Parts 5 and 6 the new
Part would be Part 5A and Sections in that Part would be numbered, for
instance, “§ 5-5A01.” A new Section introduced between existing Sections 5 and
6 would be “§ 5-105A.” When a number of new Parts or Sections have been
introduced the Chapter or Part shall be renumbered.
   2.   If it becomes necessary to introduce a Subsection between Subsections,
for instance, Subsections .5 and .6, the new Subsection would be numbered
Subsection .5-A.
   3.   If it becomes necessary to introduce a unit smaller than a Subsection
between existing unites, the entire Subsection shall be revised and renumbered.
   4.   Vacated Numbers. Whenever a number is vacated by a revocation or
repeal, the remaining elements in the overall unit shall retain their old
numbers until the overall unit is completely revised. Prior to revision, the
vacated number may be marked: “[Reserved].”
(Ord. 2007-2, 12/17/2007)
§ 1-109.   Amending Code.
   1.   All ordinances passed subsequent to the adoption of this Code which
amend, repeal or in any way affect this Code shall be numbered in accordance
with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion herein. In the
case of repeal of Chapters, Parts, Sections, Paragraphs, Clauses or other part
or provision hereof, by subsequent ordinance, such repealed portions may be
excluded from this Code by omission from reprinted pages affected thereby. The
subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed, or omitted in the case of
repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such
time as this Code and subsequent ordinances omitted are readopted as a new Code
by the Borough Council.
   2.   Amendment to any provision of this Code shall be made by specific
reference to the Chapter, Part, Section and/or Subsection number of this Code
in the following language:
      A.   Amendment or Revision. "Chapter        , Part        , Section
       , Subsection        , is hereby amended (revised) to read as follows . .
. .” The amended or revised provisions may then be set out in full as desired.
      B.   Addition. "Chapter        , Part        , Section        ,
Subsection        , is hereby amended by the addition of the following . . . .”
The new provision shall then be set out in full as desired.
      C.   Repeal. "Chapter        , Part       , Section        , Subsection
       , is hereby repealed in its entirety.”
   3.   It is the intention of the Borough Council that the numbering scheme of
this Code be adhered to in enacting future ordinances. In the event that any
ordinance or other enactment be adopted which does not conform to the numbering
system of this Code, it is the intention of the Borough Council that such
enactment be renumbered in the process of supplementing, revising or updating
this Code to conform to the numbering scheme of this Code. The Borough Council
hereby acknowledges and confirms that the numbering scheme herein is for ease
of reference and that the renumbering or reformatting of any enactment when
added to this Code shall not in any manner affect the validity of said
enactment.
(Ord. 2007-2, 12/17/2007)
§ 1-110. Altering Code.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to change or amend by addition or
deletion any part or portion of this Code, or to insert or delete pages or
portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner
whatsoever, except by ordinance or resolution or other official act of the
Borough Council.
(Ord. 2007-2, 12/17/2007)
§ 1-111.   Penalties.
   1.   Penalty Where No Penalty Provided. Whenever in this Code or in any
ordinance of the Borough any act is prohibited or is declared to be unlawful,
or whenever in this Code or other ordinance the doing of any act is declared to

fine and costs, to a term of imprisonment not to exceed 30 days. Each day that

of this Part, upon conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to a fine of not less

and costs, to a term of imprisonment not to exceed 30 days. Each day that a
violation of this Part continues or each Section of this Part which shall be
found to have been violated shall constitute a separate offense.
   2.   The imposition of a penalty under the provisions of this Code shall not
prevent the revocation of any permit or license or the taking of other punitive
or remedial action where called for or permitted under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the United States of America. In addition, the
Borough may institute injunctive, mandamus or any other appropriate action or
proceeding at law or in equity for the enforcement of this Code. Any court of

   1.   No insurance company, association or exchange (hereinafter “insurer”)
doing business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall pay a claim of a named
insured for fire damage to a structure located with the Borough of Lewisberry
where the amount recoverable for the fire loss to the structure under all
policies exceeds $7,500, unless the insurer is furnished by the Borough of
Lewisberry with a certificate pursuant to § 508(b) of the Insurance Company Law
of 1921, as amended by Act 98 of 1992 and Act 93 of 1994 (collectively, the
“Act”) and unless there is compliance with the procedures set forth in §508(c)
and (d) of the Act, 40 P.S. § 638.
   2.   Where there are delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties or user
charges against the property (“municipal claims”), or there are expenses which
the Borough of Lewisberry has incurred as a cost of the removal, repair or
securing of a building or other structure on the property (collectively
“municipal expenses”), a designated official of the Borough of Lewisberry shall
immediately render a bill for such work, if he has not already done so. Upon
written request of the named insured specifying the tax description of the
property, the name and address of the insurer and the date of receipt by the
insurer of a loss report of the claim, the Treasurer shall furnish a
certificate within 14 working days after the request, to the insurer, a
certificate (or at his discretion an oral notice confirmed in writing) either:
      A.   Stating that there are no unpaid municipal claims or municipal
expenses against the property.
      B.   Specifying the nature and amount of such claims or expenses,
accompanied by a bill for such amounts.
      C.   Taxes, assessments, penalties and user charges shall be deemed
delinquent for this purpose if a lien could have been filed for claims under
applicable law. Upon receipt of a certificate and bill pursuant to paragraph .A
of this subsection, the insurer shall transfer to the Treasurer an amount from
the insurance proceeds sufficient to pay such sums prior to making payment to
the named insured, subject to the provisions of subsection .3 hereof.
   3.   When all municipal claims and municipal expenses have been paid
pursuant to subsection .2 of this Section, or where the Treasurer has issued a
certificate described in subsection .2.A indicating that there are no municipal
claims or municipal expenses against the property, the insurer shall pay the
claim of the named insured; provided, however, that if the loss agreed upon by
the named insured and the insurer equals or exceeds 60% of the aggregate limits
of liability on all fire policies covering the building or structure, the
following procedures must be followed:
      A.   The insurer shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the
Treasurer, in the aggregate, $2,000 for each $15,000 of such claim or fraction
thereof.
      B.   If at the time a loss report is submitted by the insured, such
insured has submitted to the insurer, with a copy to the Borough of Lewisberry,
a contractor's signed estimate of the cost of removing, repairing or securing
the building or structure in an amount less than the amount calculated under
the foregoing transfer formula, the insurer shall transfer to the Treasurer
from the insurance proceeds the amount specified in the estimate. If there is
more than one insurer, the transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by
all insurers insuring the building or other structure.
      C.   Upon receipt of the above described portion of the insurance
proceeds, the Treasurer shall do the following:
         (1)   Place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used solely as
security against the total municipal expenses anticipated by the Borough of
Lewisberry to be required in removing, repairing or securing the building or
structure as required by this Part. Such costs shall include, without
limitation, any engineering, legal or administrative costs incurred by the
Borough of Lewisberry in connection with such removal, repair or securing or
any proceedings related thereto.
         (2)   Mail to the named insured, at the address received from the
insurer, a notice the proceeds have been received by the Borough of Lewisberry
and that the procedures under this subsection shall be followed.
         (3)   After the transfer, the named insured may submit to the Borough
of Lewisberry a contractor's signed estimate of the cost of removing, repairing
or securing the building or other structure, in which event the Treasurer
shall, if such estimate is deemed by the Treasurer to be reasonable, return to
the insured the amount of the funds transferred to the Borough of Lewisberry in
excess of that required to pay the municipal expenses; provided, the Borough of
Lewisberry has not commenced to remove, repair or secure the building or other
structure, in which case the Borough of Lewisberry will complete the work.
         (4)   Pay to the designated official, for reimbursement to the Borough
of Lewisberry general fund, the amount of the municipal expenses paid by the
Borough of Lewisberry.
         (5)   Pay the remaining balance in the fund (without interest) to the
named insured upon receipt of a certificate issued by the designated official
that the repair, removal or securing of the building or other structure has
been completed in accordance with all applicable codes and regulations of the
Borough of Lewisberry.
         (6)   Nothing in this Section shall be construed to limit the ability
of the Borough of Lewisberry to recover any deficiency in the amount of
municipal claims or municipal expenses recovered pursuant to this Part, or to
insurance proceeds, by an action at law or in equity to enforce the codes of
the Borough of Lewisberry or to enter into an agreement with the named insured

hereby enacts this part for the purpose of promoting the general welfare and
protecting the general public through reduction of juvenile violence and crime
within the Borough of Lewisberry, promoting the safety and welfare of the
Borough's citizens under the age of 18 whose youth and inexperience renders
them particularly vulnerable to becoming participants in criminal activity and

§ 8-101.   Statutory Authorization.
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage of
the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978, delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Council of the Borough of Lewisberry does hereby
order this Chapter.
(Ord. 2015-07, 12/7/2015, Art. I)
§ 8-102.   Intent.
   The intent of this Chapter is to:
      A.   Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
      B.   Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in
order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
      C.   Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.
      D.   Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units, and its residents, by preventing excessive development in areas subject
to flooding.
      E.   Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
(Ord. 4-82, 12/28/1982, §1.00; as amended by Ord. 2015-07, 12/7/2015, §2.01)
§ 8-103.   Applicability.
   1.   It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business, or
corporation to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or
development anywhere within the Borough unless a permit has been obtained from
the Floodplain Administrator.
   2.   A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing buildings
or structures.
(Ord. 4-82, 12/28/1982, §1.01; as amended by Ord. 2007-2, 12/17/2007; as
amended by Ord. 2015-07, 12/7/2015, §2.02)
§ 8-104.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.
   This Chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in
effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance provisions
shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those provisions are
more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of
this Chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
(Ord. 4-82, 12/28/1982, §1.02; as amended by Ord. 2015-07, 12/7/2015, §2.03)
§ 8-105.   Severability.
   If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this

shall not affect the remaining portions of the Chapter, which shall remain in
full force and effect, and for this purpose the provisions of this Chapter are
hereby declared to be severable.
(Ord. 2015-07, 12/7/2015, §2.04)
§ 8-106.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
   1.   The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this Chapter
is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on acceptable
engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur. Flood heights may be
increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings
restricted by debris. This Chapter does not imply that areas outside any
identified floodplain area, or that land uses permitted within such areas, will
be free from flooding or flood damages.
   2.   This Chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Borough or
any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance
on this Chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

§ 8-203.   Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator.
   1.   The Floodplain Administrator shall issue a permit only after it has
been determined that the proposed work to be undertaken will be in conformance
with the requirements of this Chapter and all other applicable codes and
ordinances.
   2.   Prior to the issuance of any permit, the Floodplain Administrator shall

issued until this determination has been made.
   3.   In the case of existing structures, prior to the issuance of any
development/permit, the Floodplain Administrator shall review the history of
repairs to the subject building, so that any repetitive loss concerns can be
addressed before the permit is issued.
   4.   During the construction period, the Floodplain Administrator or other

Part 3
Identification of Floodplain Areas
§ 8-301.   Identification.
   The identified floodplain area shall be:
   A.   Any areas of Borough of Lewisberry, classified as special flood hazard
areas (SFHAs) in the flood insurance study (FIS) and the accompanying flood
insurance rate maps (FIRMs) dated December 16, 2015 and issued by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof,
including all digital data developed as part of the flood insurance study and,
   B.   The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and
amendments are hereby adopted by Borough and declared to be a part of this
Chapter.
(Ord. 2015-07, 12/7/2015, §4.01)
§ 8-302.   Description and Special Requirements of Identified Floodplain
Areas. 
   The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific
areas:
      A.   The floodway area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without increasing the water surface elevation by more than one foot at any
point. This term shall also include floodway areas which have been identified
in other available studies or sources of information for those special flood
hazard areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
         (1)   Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted
unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed
encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
         (2)   Within any floodway area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the Department
of Environmental Protection Regional Office.
      B.   The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone
on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided.
         (1)   The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for
which base flood elevations have been provided and a floodway has been
delineated.
         (2)   AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an
AE zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided but no floodway has been determined.
            (a)   No permit shall be granted for any construction, development,
use, or activity within any AE Area/District without floodway unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development would not,
together with all other existing and anticipated development, increase the BFE
more than one foot at any point.
            (b)   No new construction or development shall be located within
the area measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse,
unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection Regional Office.
      C.   The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base flood
elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and floodway
information from other Federal, State, or other acceptable sources shall be
used when available. Where other acceptable information is not available, the
base flood elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on
the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site. In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the
applicant to determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by
professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall
certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted
technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted
in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the municipality.
      D.   The AO and AH Area/ District shall be those areas identified as
Zones AO and AH on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject to
inundation by 1%-annual -chance shallow flooding where average depths are
between one and three feet. In Zones AO and AH, drainage paths shall be
established to guide floodwaters around and away from structures on slopes.
(Ord. 2015-07, 12/7/2015, §4.02)
§ 8-303.   Changes in Identification of Area.
   The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Council
where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person documents
the need for such revision. However, prior to any such change to the special
flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from FEMA. Additionally, as soon
as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA of the changes to the special
flood hazard area by submitting technical or scientific data. See §
8-401 2. for situations where FEMA notification is required.
(Ord. 4-82, 12/28/1982, §3.01; as amended by Ord. 2015-07, 12/7/2015, §4.03)
§ 8-304.   Boundary Disputes.
   Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Borough and any party aggrieved by
such decision or determination may appeal to the Council. The burden of proof
shall be on the appellant.
(Ord. 4-82, 12/28/1982, §3.02; as amended by Ord. 2015-07, 12/7/2015, §4.04)
§ 8-305. Jurisdictional Boundary Changes.
   Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other corporate
boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community shall review
flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary changes. The
community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in areas subject to
annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or exceed those in CFR 44
60.3.
(Ord. 2015-07, 12/7/2015, §4.05)
Part 4
Technical Provisions
§ 8-401.   General.
   1.   Alteration or Relocation of Watercourse.
      A.   No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse until all adjacent municipalities which may be affected
by such action have been notified by the municipality, and until all required
permits or approvals have first been obtained from the Department of
Environmental Protection Regional Office.
      B.   No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse unless it can be shown that the activity will not
reduce or impede the flood carrying capacity of the watercourse in any way.
      C.   In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community and
Economic Development, shall be notified prior to any alteration or relocation
of any watercourse.
   2.   When a community proposes to permit the following encroachments: any
development that causes a rise in the base flood elevations within the
floodway; or any development occurring in Zones A1-30 and Zone AE without a
designated floodway, which will cause a rise of more than one foot in the base
flood elevation; or alteration or relocation of a stream (including but not
limited to installing culverts and bridges), the applicant shall (as per 44 CFR
Part 65.12):
      A.   Apply to FEMA for conditional approval of such action prior to
permitting the encroachments to occur.
      B.   Upon receipt of the Administrator's conditional approval of map
change and prior to approving the proposed encroachments, a community shall
provide evidence to FEMA of the adoption of floodplain management ordinances
incorporating the increased base flood elevations and / or revised floodway
reflecting the post-project condition.
      C.   Upon completion of the proposed encroachments, a community shall
provide as-built certifications. FEMA will initiate a final map revision upon
receipt of such certifications in accordance with 44 CFR Part 67.
   3.   Any new construction, development, uses or activities allowed within
any identified floodplain area shall be undertaken in strict compliance with
the provisions contained in this Chapter and any other applicable codes,
ordinances and regulations.

they are more restrictive.
      B.   Non-Residential Structures.
         (1)   In AE, A1-30 and AH Zones, any new construction or substantial
improvement of a non-residential structure shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated up to, or above, the regulatory flood elevation,
or be designed and constructed so that the space enclosed below the regulatory
flood elevation:
            (a)   Is floodproofed so that the structure is watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and,
            (b)   Has structural components with the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy:
         (2)   In A Zones, where no base flood elevations are specified on the

(Ord. 2018-01, 2/5/2018)
§ 12-106.   Disconnection and Reconnection.
   1.   Disconnection. Lewisberry Borough Electric may disconnect electric
service to a customer for any of the following reasons:
      A.   The written request of the customer to Lewisberry Borough Electric.
      B.   Failure to pay any bill for electric service by the fifth day of the
month following issuance of the bill.
      C.   Failure to pay in full any required security deposit within 45 days
of the date demand for said payment was rendered by Lewisberry Borough
Electric.
      D.   Whenever, in the judgment of Lewisberry Borough Electric, the
customer's installation has become dangerous or defective.
      E.   Whenever, in the judgment of Lewisberry Borough Electric, the
customer's service wires have been altered, tampered with or otherwise
interfered with by the customer.
      F.   Electric energy is being used which is not registering on the
authorized meter.
      G.   Failure to permit access to meters, service connection(s) or those
portions of the property required for electric inspection, monitoring and
metering.
      H.   The customer violates any provision of this Chapter.
      I.   Tampering with any service wires, meter, seal or any other
facilities belonging to Lewisberry Borough Electric.
      J.   Repairs or emergency maintenance of Lewisberry Borough Electric
facilities.
      K.   An unauthorized electrical connection.
      L.   The use of equipment which adversely affects the Lewisberry Borough
Electric's service to other customers.
   2.   Disconnection procedure. Except in an emergency or in order to protect
life or property, the following procedures will be followed by Lewisberry
Borough Electric prior to the disconnection of electric service:
      A.   The regular billing of the customer shall set forth the date upon
which the account is due and payable.
      B.   Whenever the customer is not the property owner, a notice of
nonpayment may be mailed to the record owner or owners of the premises.
   3.   Exceptions to disconnection procedures. Nonpayment shall not be cause
for discontinuance of service under the following instance:
      A.   If a customer scheduled for disconnection contacts Lewisberry
Borough Electric and informs such they cannot be disconnected due to medical
reasons (i.e. breathing, dialysis, heart monitors or other medical issues), the
customer must provide written confirmation of the medical necessity signed by a
licensed physician. Lewisberry Borough Electric will then require that written
payment arrangements be made with that customer. If the account continues to be
delinquent and payment arrangements are not being followed, the meter will then
be disconnected. At that time, disconnection and reconnection rules will apply.
   4.   Effect of disconnection upon customer responsibilities. The
disconnection of service by the Borough shall not relieve the customer of any
duty or liability for services provided by Lewisberry Borough Electric.
   5.   Reconnection. No electric service shall be reconnected unless and until
all account balances have been settled in full. The owner(s) of the property to
which service has been provided shall remain liable for all account balances,
whether or not the account is or was in the owner's name or in the name of the
owner's tenant. Pursuant to the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the
Borough shall lien the real property to which service has been provided as a
municipal claim in those instances where demand for payment has been made and
such payment has remained unpaid.
   6.   Reconnection fee. No electric service shall be reconnected unless a
reconnection fee has been paid. The reconnection fee is $85 and may be changed
from time to time by resolution of the Borough Council. When service is
disconnected other than at the meter the actual cost to reconnect shall be
charged to the customer as the reconnection charge.
   7.   Authorized representative. In order to avoid unnecessary terminations
of service and to protect public health and safety, residential customers, upon
written request, may designate and authorize a representative individual or
entity to be sent a duplicate copy of all reminder notices, past due notices,
delinquent account notices or termination notices issued by Lewisberry Borough
Electric. All notices to such representative shall serve as notice to the
customer.
(Ord. 2018-01, 2/5/2018)
§ 12-107.   Electrical Equipment and Facilities.
   1.   Meter reading intervals. Meters shall be read at regular intervals of
approximately 30 days.
   2.   Omitted readings; estimated billing. Whenever a scheduled reading of
meters is not obtained, Lewisberry Borough Electric shall estimate the amount
of service supplied and issue an estimated bill. Any necessary adjustment to an
account will be made on the next bill rendered for service. Payment of an
estimated bill shall be made in the same manner and under the same requirements
as bills derived from meter readings.
   3.   Point of delivery. The point of delivery of electrical service is that
point designated by Lewisberry Borough Electric where it connects its
electrical conductors to the customer's service entrance facilities. The
customer may request from Lewisberry Borough Electric the location of the point
of delivery prior to commencing any electrical installation. Lewisberry Borough
Electric shall not be responsible for any work done by the customer to
accommodate a point of delivery other than that determined by Lewisberry
Borough Electric.
   4.   Wiring and electrical equipment. All wiring and electrical equipment
(including service for customer-owned substations) shall be installed and
maintained by the customer to meet, at a minimum, the standards and
requirements of the electrical code adopted by the Borough. Compliance with the
code neither guarantees that an adequate wiring system has been installed nor
that the installation can be expanded for additional uses of electricity.
   5.   New wiring and major wiring alterations. In all buildings where the
wiring is new or where a major alteration of wiring has been made, Lewisberry
Borough Electric will not furnish service unless and until the installation
conforms to the electrical code adopted by the Borough and a certificate of
approval has been issued by a third party agency certified by the Pennsylvania
Department of Labor & Industry. Lewisberry Borough Electric is not responsible
for any injury or damage which may result from defects in wiring or devices on
the customer's premises upon connection of the customer's wires to Lewisberry
Borough Electric's system.

Electric shall remain the exclusive property of Lewisberry Borough Electric

Lewisberry Borough Electric at the customer's request and not provided for in a
standard installation shall be paid by or leased to the customer for whom such
facilities are furnished. No special facilities will be installed unless and
until approval for all said facilities is given by Lewisberry Borough Electric.
   8.   Failure of meter to register accurately.
      A.   In the event that Lewisberry Borough Electric's meter or metering
equipment fails to properly register the electricity supplied during any month
or other period of time, Lewisberry Borough Electric will estimate the number
of kilowatt-hours or the kilowatt-hours of the electricity supplied during such
period, having due regard for the use to which the customer put the electricity
supplied to him during such period and any other information and data
permitting a reasonable conclusion as to the kilowatt-hours of electricity
supplied but not measured or inaccurately measured. The customer may present
any information or data within his knowledge on the subject. If Lewisberry
Borough Electric has undercharged the customer as the result of a meter or
metering inaccuracy or other continuing problem under its control Lewisberry
Borough Electric will only bill the customer for the amount of unmetered
electricity rendered in the two years immediately prior to the date Lewisberry
Borough Electric remedies the meter inaccuracy. The customer shall be given at
least 12 months to pay the undercharged amount if he so desires, in monthly
payments equal to 1/12 of the undercharge. Lewisberry Borough Electric shall
continue to furnish service to the customer and the customer shall continue to
pay the amounts billed pending the determination of a proper and reasonable
adjustment.
      B.   Lewisberry Borough Electric will test the accuracy of its meter
serving the premises of any user who shall request such test and make a deposit
of $40. Such deposit shall stand as security in the event that the costs of
such tests shall be borne by the customer as herein provided, and appropriate
refund may be made accordingly at the completion of such tests if or to the
extent that the costs are not imposed upon the customer. Meters or metering
equipment shall be considered accurate if they register within 3% fast or 3%
slow. Whenever a meter or metering equipment is found to be inaccurate, it or
they shall be restored to accuracy or shall be replaced by Lewisberry Borough
Electric with an accurate meter or metering equipment without expense to the
customer. If a customer notified Lewisberry Borough Electric that his meter or
metering equipment is inaccurate and subsequent tests show the meter or
metering equipment to be within the 3% fast or slow tolerance, the costs of
such test shall be borne by the customer.
   9.   Extension of service lines. Lewisberry Borough Electric will extend
service lines, overhead or underground for a distance of not more than 60 feet
from its distribution lines at no cost to the customer. Any customer whose
service line or lines exceed 60 feet will be required to make a nonrefundable
payment for the estimated excess costs for that portion of said extension which
exceeds 60 feet.
   10.   Customer constructed service line. Any service line constructed by the
customer must conform to Lewisberry Borough Electric's standards and
specifications. All such lines will be inspected for such compliance prior to
any connection to Lewisberry Borough Electric's system.
   11.   Undergrounding of facilities. At the request of the customer,
Lewisberry Borough Electric may determine the practicality and costs of
providing underground service to that customer. When Lewisberry Borough
Electric agrees to install such service, the customer shall, prior to any
installation, pay to Lewisberry Borough Electric all costs in excess of the
costs which would be incurred for normal overhead service.
   12.   Pole removal and/or relocation. The costs of pole removal and/or
relocation by Lewisberry Borough Electric shall be the responsibility of the
property owner or customer requesting such work. The customer shall pay such
costs to Lewisberry Borough Electric for the removal and/or relocation of any
pole.
   13.   No additions of any kind may be made to electric equipment of
Lewisberry Borough Electric. The customer shall be responsible for safeguarding
Lewisberry Borough Electric's electric equipment and shall not decrease the
protection of the equipment by using fuses and circuit breakers that are too
large or overload the equipment. If any of the equipment or property of
Lewisberry Borough Electric upon the premises of a customer is damaged in any
manner other than normal usage or act of God, the cost of inspection, repair,
or replacement of such damaged equipment or property, or any part thereof,
shall be paid by the customer. Any repairs, changes, or additions to Lewisberry
Borough Electric's electric equipment or meters shall be done by Lewisberry

            (a)   To keep buildings in the area being drained free of runoff
concentrations.
            (b)   To protect the point where surface waters are discharged from
the subdivision or land development, and downstream areas, from adverse impact
on account of the subdivision or land development.
         (3)   Be adequate to limit the peak rate of runoff during storms
having frequencies of occurrence up to 100 years from the subdivision or land
development to a rate no greater than the rate of runoff from the site prior to
the subdivision or land development.
         (4)   Be adequate to percolate waters into the ground so as to
recharge underground aquifers to the same extent as prior to the subdivision or
land development.

to convey and distribute water from the Borough's water system to each dwelling
unit, commercial establishment and industrial establishment, and to provide
water for firefighting, within the subdivision or land development.
         (2)   Source of Supply. In the event that the estimated demand for
water to be produced by the proposed subdivision or land development when added
to the existing demand for water will exceed the capacity of the Borough's
present sources of supply, additional sources of supply to satisfy such excess
and the facilities connecting such additional sources to Borough's system; or,
in the event that the Borough Council decides to take initiative to acquire
such additional sources itself, a monetary contribution in the amount of the
cost of such additional sources.
      E.   Other. Such other improvements as, in the discretion of the Council,
are necessary to promote and protect the public health, safety, morals, and
general welfare by solving any problems expected to occur due to the

   This Chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Lewisberry Borough
Stormwater Management Ordinance.”
(Ord. 2022-01, 10/3/2022)
§ 23-102.   Statement of Findings.
   The Governing Body of Lewisberry Borough finds that:
      A.   Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases runoff volumes, flood, flows
and velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of
public facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines flood plain
management and flood control efforts in downstream communities, reduces
groundwater recharge, threatens public health and safety, and increases non-
point source pollution of water resources.
      B.   A comprehensive program of stormwater management (SWM), including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff,
is fundamental to the public health, safety, and welfare and the protection of
people of the Commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
      C.   Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams, which also
protects and maintains surface water quality.
      D.   Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are required
to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer
systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).
      E.   Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
      F.   Non-stormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of water s of the Commonwealth by the Municipality.
      G.   The use of green infrastructure and low impact development (LID) are
intended to address the root cause of water quality impairment by using systems
and practices which use or mimic natural processes to 1) infiltrate and
recharge; 2) evapotranspire; and/or 3) harvest and use precipitation near where
it falls to earth. Green infrastructure practices and LID contribute to the
restoration or maintenance of pre-development hydrology.
(Ord. 2011-4, 10/3/2011, §101; as amended by Ord. 2022-01, 10/3/2022)
§ 23-103.   Purpose.
   The purpose of this Chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
the Borough and its watersheds by minimizing the harm and maximizing the
benefits described in §
23-102 of this Chapter, through provisions designed to:
      A.   Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim, and restore the
existing and designated uses of the waters of this Commonwealth.
      B.   Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.
      C.   Manage stormwater runoff close to the source, reduce runoff volumes,
and mimic predevelopment hydrology.
      D.   Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater planning
and management.
      E.   Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and
groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources.
      F.   Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and stream beds.
      G.   Provide proper operation and maintenance of all SWM BMPs that are
implemented within the Borough.
      H.   Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.
      I.   Control accelerated erosion and sedimentation problems at their
source by regulating activities which cause such problems.
      J.   Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses in
the Borough and the Commonwealth.
      K.   Implement an illegal discharge and detection program to address non-
stormwater discharges into the Municipality’s separate storm sewer system.

   B.   Waivers or modifications of the requirements of this Chapter may be
approved by the Borough if enforcement will exact undue hardship because of
peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question, provided that the
modifications will not be contrary to the public interest and that the purpose
of the Chapter is preserved. Cost or financial burden shall not be considered a
hardship. Modification may be considered if an alternative standard or approach
will provide equal or better achievement of the purpose of this Chapter. A
request for modifications shall be in writing and accompany the SWM Site Plan
submission. The request shall provide the facts on which the request is based,
the provision(s) of the Chapter involved and the proposed modification.

Part 3
Stormwater Management Standards
§ 23-301.   General Requirements.
   A.   The developer of any project within the Borough, with the exception of
those projects exempted from the requirements of this Chapter in §
23-302 shall submit an application for and obtain approval of a stormwater
management site plan. Although not a requirement of this Chapter, prior to
proceeding with stormwater management site plan preparation and submission, the
developer is encouraged to request a pre-application meeting with the Borough
Engineer and a staff member of the Conservation District to discuss the plan
concept and responsibility for submission of required documents and
information.
   B.   When a project is proposed to be developed in phases or sections and
the developer submits stormwater management site plans for each section or
phase, all proposed temporary facilities required for construction of a section
or phase shall be included in the submitted stormwater management site plan for
that section.
   C.   Stormwater management facilities located within or affecting the
floodplain, or any watercourse shall also be subject to the requirements of the
Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27], any ordinance which regulates construction and development within
areas of the Borough subject to flooding, and any other applicable requirements
of Act 166, the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act.
   D.   Runoff from impervious surface areas shall be drained when possible, to
pervious areas of the project site.
   E.   Stormwater runoff shall not be transferred from one watershed to
another unless the watersheds are sub-watersheds of a common watershed which
join together within the perimeter of the project site, or the effect of the
transfer does not alter the peak discharge onto downstream lands, or drainage
easements from the affected landowners are provided.
   F.   Stormwater drainage systems shall be provided in order to permit
unimpeded flow along natural watercourses.
   G.   It shall be unlawful to commence any regulated activity prior to
submission and unconditional approval of a stormwater management site plan, or
conditional approval of a stormwater management site plan if proper financial
security is posted in accordance with this Chapter.
   H.   Approval of a stormwater management site plan does not exempt or
relieve the developer or any builder or owner from any requirements to submit
grading plans to the Borough prior to issuance of a land use or building
permit.
   I.   All construction activity shall be in accordance with the construction
and material specifications, Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27] and Subdivision Ordinance [
Chapter 22], as applicable. Deviations from the construction and materials
specifications must be noted on the stormwater management site plan and
approved by the Township Engineer.
   J.   For all regulated activities, unless preparation of a SWM Site Plan is
specifically exempted in Section 302:
      1.   Preparation and implementation of an approved SWM Site Plan is
required.
      2.   No regulated activities shall commence until the Borough issues
written approval of a SWM Site Plan which demonstrates compliance with the
requirements of this Chapter.
   K.   SWM Site Plans approved by the Borough, in accordance with Section 406,
shall be on site throughout the duration of the regulated activity.
   L.   The Borough may, after consultation with the DEP and receiving a
favorable response, approve measures for meeting the State Water Quality
Requirements other than those in this Chapter, provided that they meet the
minimum requirements of, and do not conflict with, State law including, but not
limited to, the Clean Streams Law. The Borough shall maintain a record of
correspondence with the DEP pursuant to this paragraph. If after 45 days of
notification there is no response from the DEP, the Borough may issue approval
with the acknowledgment that the DEP has not responded, and that the property
owner may proceed at his own risk.
   M.   For all regulated earth disturbance activities, erosion and sediment
control BMPs shall be designed, implemented, operated, and maintained during
the regulated earth disturbance activities, i.e., during construction, to meet
the purposes and requirements of this Chapter and to meet all requirements
under Title 25 of the Pennsylvania Code and the Clean Streams Law. Various BMPs
and their design standards are listed in the Erosion and Sediment Pollution
Control Program Manual (E&S Manual), No. 363-2134-008, as amended and updated.
   N.   For all regulated activities, implementation of the volume controls in
§
23-303 is required, unless specifically exempted under §
23-301.C. or §
23-302.A. or exempted by an approved modification request as specified in §
23-403.B. of this Chapter.
   O.   Impervious areas:
      1.   The measurement of impervious areas shall include all of the
impervious areas in the total proposed development even if development is to
take place in phases.
      2.   For development taking place in phases, the entire development plan
must be used in determining conformance with this Chapter.
      3.   For projects that add impervious area to a parcel, the total
impervious area on the parcel is subject to the requirements of this Chapter;
except that the volume controls in §
23-303 and the peak rate controls of §
23-304 do not need to be retrofitted to existing impervious areas that are not
being altered by the proposed regulated activity.
   P.   All stormwater runoff flowing over the project site shall be considered
in the design of the stormwater management facilities. This includes existing
points of concentrated drainage that discharge onto adjacent property.
Stormwater flows onto adjacent property shall not be created, increased,
decreased, relocated, or otherwise altered without written notification to the
adjacent property owner(s). A copy of such notice shall be provided to the
Borough prior to issuance of the stormwater management permit. Such Stormwater
flows shall be subject to the requirements of this Chapter.
   Q.   All regulated activities shall include such measures as necessary to:
      1.   Protect health, safety, and property.
      2.   Meet the water quality goals of this Chapter, as stated in §
23-103, by implementing measures to:
         a.   Minimize disturbance to Floodplains, wetlands, wooded areas, and
existing vegetation.
         b.   Maintain or extend riparian buffers.
         c.   Avoid erosive flow conditions in natural flow pathways.
         d.   Minimize thermal impacts to waters of this Commonwealth.
         e.   Disconnect impervious surfaces by directing runoff to pervious
areas, wherever possible.
         f.   Minimize soil disturbance and compaction. Topsoil, if removed,
shall be replaced to a minimum depth equal to its depth prior to removal or a
four-inch minimum depth, whichever is greater. The applicant is not required to
install greater than eight inches of topsoil unless required by the design and/
or plant material.
      3.   To the maximum extent practicable, incorporate the techniques for
low impact development practices described in the Pennsylvania Stormwater Best
Management Practices Manual (BMP Manual).
   R.   The design of all facilities in areas of carbonate geology or karst
topography shall include an evaluation of measures to minimize adverse effects,
including hydro-geologic studies if required by the Borough.
   S.   Infiltration BMPs shall be spread out, made as shallow as practicable,
and located to maximize use of natural on-site infiltration features while
still meeting the other requirements of this Chapter. In addition, infiltration
BMPs shall include pre-treatment BMPs where appropriate.
   T.   Normally dry, open-top storage facilities, designed as such, shall
completely drain at a volume control capacity over a period of time not more
than 72 hours from the end of the design storm and drain the rate control
capacity over a period of time not more than 24 hours from the end of the
design storm.
   U.   Infiltration facilities shall be designed to infiltrate in not less
than 24 hours, however, any designed infiltration at such facilities is exempt
from the minimum 24-hour standard, i.e., may infiltrate in a shorter period of
time, so long as none of the stormwater flowing into the Infiltration facility
is discharged directly into the surface waters of the Commonwealth.
(Inordinately rapid infiltration rates may indicate the presence of large
fractures or other conditions for which an additional soil buffer may be
required.)
   V.   The design storm volumes and precipitation intensities to be used in
the analysis of discharge or runoff shall be obtained from the Precipitation-
Frequency Atlas of the United States, Atlas 14, Volume 2, Version 3.0, U.S.
Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),
National Weather Service, Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center, Silver
Spring, Maryland, in effect at the time of application. NOAA’s Atlas 14 can be
accessed at: http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/.
   W.   For all regulated activities, SWM BMPs shall be designed, implemented,
operated, and maintained to meet the purposes and requirements of this Chapter
and to meet all requirements under Title 25 of the Pennsylvania Code, the Clean
Streams Law, and the Storm Water Management Act.
   X.   Various BMPs and their design standards are listed in the BMP Manual.
   Y.   Permanent stormwater management standards. The developer shall
demonstrate by substantial evidence that the stormwater management facilities
for the project will meet or exceed all of the following standards:
      1.   The volume and rate of any stormwater discharges allowed by this
Chapter must be managed to prevent the physical degradation of receiving
waters, such as streambank scour and erosion. If a detention facility is
proposed that is part of the BMPs approved for a project, the facility(ies)
must be designed to provide for the 24-hour extended detention of the 2-year,
24-hour storm event (i.e., the stormwater runoff will be released over a
minimum of 24 hours for the 2-year, 24-hour storm event).
      2.   The Borough shall impose the following additional restrictions on
stormwater discharges:
         a.   When a probable risk to downstream structures or unique natural
areas exists or previous (historical) flooding problems could be further
aggravated, the Borough shall require developer to further restrict peak
discharge.
         b.   The Borough shall impose measures to protect against ground or
surface water pollution from significant pollution producing sources (so called
“hot spots” including, but not limited to, industrial uses, gas stations, fast
food another commercial uses generating large numbers of vehicle trips, and
other uses at the determination of the Borough) or where the nature of the
soils or bedrock underlying a stormwater management facility constitutes
substantial risk of contamination, such as carbonate areas. The developer shall
install special provisions that act to remove pollutant loadings (including,
but not limited to, filtration devices like sand peat filters, multiple chamber
catch basins and inlets, oil separators and others).
         c.   Where groundwater yields are very low or where a groundwater
supply already is heavily used or where maintenance of downstream wetlands is a
special concern, the Borough shall require that the entire volume of the 2-
year, 24-hour design storm from the project site be retained and infiltrated.
If substantial irrigation needs are anticipated, portion of stored stormwater
may be re-used for irrigation purposes.
(Ord. 2011-4, 10/3/2011, § 301; as amended by Ord. 2022-01, 10/3/2022)
§ 23-302.   Exemptions.
   Any regulated activity that meets the following exemption criteria is exempt
from the part(s) of this Chapter as specified herein. However, the requirements
of the Ordinance shall otherwise remain in effect. The criteria for exemption
in this Section apply to the total development proposed, including instances in
which the development is proposed to take place in phases. The date of
enactment of this Chapter shall be the starting point from which future
development and the respective proposed impervious surface computations shall
be cumulatively considered and regulated. Exemption shall not relieve an
applicant from implementing such measures as necessary to meet the intent of
this Chapter, or compliance with any NPDES Permit requirements, nor from
implementing such measures as are necessary to protect health, safety, and
property.
      A.   New impervious surface creation shall be based on impervious
surfaces being created by past and present owners on the project site. New
impervious surface created by owners of easements and rights-of-way located on
the project site shall not be considered in the property owners impervious
surface calculation to determine exemption status.
      B.   Regulated activities that create impervious areas equal to or less
than those set forth on Table 1 (cumulative) or result in cumulative earth
disturbances less than one acre, shall be exempt from the requirements of §§
23-303 and
23-304 and Part 4 of this Chapter, provided the activity will not adversely
affect downstream property owners and will not cause erosion. The Borough
reserves the right to have its designee make the determination of adverse
effect after review of the stormwater permit application and review of the
proposed site.
         (1)   Subject to the requirements of §
23-111, and notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection B. and
Table 1, activities that would otherwise be regulated activities pursuant to
this Chapter but are 100 square feet or less shall be exempt from the SWM Site
Plan preparation, volume control, peak rate control, and Municipal review and
approval provisions of this Chapter provided that the regulated activity does
not adversely affect adjoining properties or cause erosion. A stormwater permit
application must be submitted for record purposes. All new impervious surfaces
shall be considered in the cumulative totals in determining exemption status
      C.   Regulated activities that create impervious areas less than or equal
to 5,000 square feet (cumulative) but do not qualify for an exemption from SWM
Site Plan Preparation requirements per §
23-302.B. may qualify for submission of a Simplified SWM Site Plan per §
23-401.D. The Borough may be submitted in lieu of a full SWM Site Plan (per §
23-401) after review of the stormwater management permit application and review
of the proposed site. The Simplified SWM site plan must demonstrate that the
proposed activity will not adversely affect adjoining property owners or cause
erosion.
      D.   Agricultural activity is exempt from the SWM Site Plan preparation
requirements of this Chapter provided the activities are performed according to
the requirements of 25 Pa.Code Chapter 102 and no adverse impacts to adjoining
property owners will occur because of stormwater runoff.
      E.   Forest management and timber operations may be exempt from the SWM
Site Plan preparation requirements of this Chapter provided the activities are
performed according to the requirements of 25 PA Code Chapter 102 and no
adverse impacts to adjoining property owners will occur because of Stormwater
Runoff.
      F.   Domestic gardening and landscaping are exempt from specific approval
and permitting under this Chapter so long as those activities are associated
with one, and only one, dwelling unit and the activities comply with all other
applicable ordinances and statutes.
      G.   Exemptions from certain provisions of this Chapter shall not relieve
the Applicant from the requirements in §
23-301.D. through X of this Chapter. For all regulated activities that are
exempted from stormwater management site plan requirements, the applicant shall
submit drawings and calculations in sufficient detail to show existing
conditions and proposed improvements.
      H.   The Borough may deny or revoke any exemption pursuant to this
Section at any time for any project that poses a threat to public health,
safety, property, or the environment.

      I.   Emergency maintenance work performed for the protection of public
health, safety and welfare. A written description of the scope and extent of
any emergency work performed shall be submitted to the Borough within 24 hours
of the commencement of the activity. If the Borough determines the work is not
an emergency, them the work shall cease immediately, and the requirements of
this Chapter shall be addressed as applicable.
      J.   Any maintenance to an existing stormwater management system made in
accordance with plans and specifications approved as part of an O&M plan or by
the Borough Engineer.
(Ord. 2011-4, 10/3/2011, § 302; as amended by Ord. 2022-01, 10/3/2022)
§ 23-303.   Volume Controls.
   The Green Infrastructure and low impact development practices provided in
the BMP Manual shall be utilized for all regulated activities to the maximum
extent practicable. Water volume controls shall be implemented using the Design
Storm Method in Subsection A. or the Simplified Method in Subsection B. below.
For regulated activity areas equal or less than one acre that do not require
hydrologic routing to design the stormwater facilities, this Chapter
establishes no preference for either methodology; therefore, the applicant may
select either methodology on the basis of economic considerations, the
intrinsic limitations on applicability of the analytical procedures associated
with each methodology, and other factors.
      A.   The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) is applicable to
any size of regulated activity. This method requires detailed modeling based on
site conditions.
         1.   No plan shall increase the post-development total runoff volume
for all storms equal to or less than the two-year 24-hour duration
precipitation to more than the pre-development total runoff volume.
         2.   For modeling purposes:
            a.   Existing (pre-development) non-forested pervious areas must be
considered meadow in good condition.
            b.   Twenty percent of the existing impervious area of a project
site, when present, shall be considered meadow in the model for existing
conditions, if the existing impervious area is being altered by the proposed
regulated activity.
      B.   The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual) provided below is
independent of site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm Method is
not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated activities greater
than one acre or for projects that require design of Stormwater storage
facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
         1.   Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches
of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
         2.   At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious
surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it shall not
be released into the surface waters of this Commonwealth. Removal options for
the first one inch of runoff include reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and
Infiltration.
         3.   Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed runoff; however, in
all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the permanently removed stormwater
runoff shall be infiltrated.
         4.   This method is exempt from the requirements of §
23-304, Rate Controls.
(Ord. 2022-01, 10/3/2022)
§ 23-304.   Rate Controls.
   A.   For computation of pre-development peak discharge rates, twenty percent
of the existing impervious area of a project site, when present, shall be
considered meadow, if the existing impervious area is being altered by the
proposed regulated activity.
   B.   Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the pre-development
discharge rates for the 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year 24-hour storms.
If it is shown that the peak rates of discharge indicated by the post-
development analysis are less than or equal to the peak rates of discharge
indicated by the pre-development analysis for 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50- and
100-year, 24-hour storms, then the requirements of this section have been met.
Otherwise, the applicant shall provide additional controls as necessary to
satisfy the peak rate of discharge requirement.
   C.   Infiltration BMPs must be provided for all development to capture all
volume from impervious area associated with development for a 2-year, 24-hour
Type II SCS rainfall distribution. See requirements specified in §
23-405 .
   D.   Off-site areas which drain through a proposed project site are not
subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable peak discharge
rates. However, on-site drainage facilities shall be designed to safely convey
off-site flows through the project site.
   E.   Any “downstream hydraulic capacity analysis” conducted in accordance
with this Chapter shall use the following criteria for determining adequacy for
accepting increased peak discharge rates.
   F.   Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey the
increased runoff associated with a 100-year return period event within their
banks at velocities consistent with protection of the channels from erosion.
Acceptable velocities shall be based upon criteria included in the DEP “Erosion
and Sediment Pollution Control Program Manual.”
      1.   Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
increased 100-year return period runoff without creating any hazard to persons
or property.
      2.   Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other stormwater management
facilities which must pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be
designed in accordance with DEP [25 Pa.Code,] Chapter 105, and PennDOT
regulations (if applicable) and, at minimum, pass the increased 100-year return
period runoff.
   G.   For certain areas within the Borough, it may be more cost-effective to
provide one stormwater management facility for more than one project site than
to provide an individual stormwater management facility for each project site.
The initiative and funding for any regional runoff control alternatives are the
responsibility of prospective developers. The design of any regional control
basins must incorporate reasonable development of the entire upstream
watershed. The peak outflow of a regional basin would be determined on a case-
by-case basis using the hydrologic model, if available, of the watershed
consistent with protection of the downstream watershed areas. Any regional
management plan must be a covenant or restriction running with the land that
shall be set forth in a recorded agreement approved by the Borough.

§ 23-305.   Stormwater Management Facilities for Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation and Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission Roadways and Associated
Facilities.
   A.   For the purposes of the Act 167 Stormwater Management (Plan) elements,
contained within the York County Integrated Water Resources Plan, and this
Chapter, design policy pertaining to Stormwater Management Facilities for
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and Pennsylvania Turnpike
Commission (PTC) roadways and associated facilities is provided in Section 13.7
(Antidegradation and Post Construction Stormwater Management Policy) of PennDOT
Publication No. 13M, Design Manual Part 2 (August 2009), as developed, updated,
and amended in consultation with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection (DEP). As stated in DM-2.13.7.D (Act 167 and Municipal Ordinances),
PennDOT and PTC roadways and associated facilities shall be consistent with Act
167 Plans. Dm-2.13.7.B (Policy on Antidegradation and Post Construction
Stormwater Management) was developed as a cooperative effort between PennDOT
and DEP. DM-2.13.7.C (Project Categories) discusses the anticipated impact on
the quality, volume, and rate of Stormwater Runoff.
   B.   Where standards in the Act 167 elements of the IWRP and this Chapter
are impractical, PennDOT or the PTC may request assistance from DEP, in
consultation with the County, to develop an alternative strategy for meeting
State water quality requirements and the goals and objectives of the Act 167
elements within the IWRP.
   C.   For the purposes of the Act 167 elements in the IWRP and this Chapter,
road maintenance activities are regulated under 25 PA Code Ordinance Chapter
102.
(Ord. 2022-01, 10/3/2022)
§ 23-306.   Regulation Governing Stormwater Management Facilities.
   1.   For the purposes of the County Act 167 plan elements, contained within
the IWRP, and this Chapter, design policy pertaining to stormwater management
facilities for PennDOT roadways and associated facilities is provided in §13.7
(Antidegradation and Post Construction Stormwater Management Policy) of PennDOT
Publication No. 13M, Design Manual, Part 2 (August 2009), as developed,
updated, and amended in consultation with the DEP. As stated in DM-2.13.7.D
(Act 167 and municipal ordinances), PennDOT roadways and associated facilities
shall be consistent with Act 167 plans. DM-2.13.7.B (Policy on Antidegradation
and Post Construction Stormwater Management) was developed as a cooperative
effort between PennDOT and DEP. DM2.13.7.0 (Project Categories) and discusses
the anticipated impact on the quality, volume, and rate of stormwater runoff.
Where standards in the Act 167 elements of the IWRP and this Chapter are
impractical, PennDOT may request assistance from DEP, in consultation with the
County, to develop an alternative strategy for meeting State water quality
requirements and the goals and objectives of the Act 167 elements within the
IWRP. For the purposes of the Act 167 elements in the IWRP and this Chapter,
road maintenance activities are regulated under 25 Pa.Code, Chapter 102.
   2.   Any stormwater management facility (i.e., detention basin) designed to
store runoff and requiring a berm or earthen embankment required or regulated
by this Chapter shall be designed to provide an emergency spillway to handle
flow up to and including the 100-year post-development conditions. The height
of embankment must be set as to provide a minimum 1.0 foot of freeboard above
the maximum pool elevation computed when the facility functions for the 100-
year post-development inflow. Should any stormwater management facility require
a dam safety permit under DEP [25 Pa.Code,] Chapter 105, the facility shall be
designed in accordance with Chapter 105 concerning dam safety.
   3.   Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this Chapter that
would be located in or adjacent to waters of the Commonwealth or wetlands shall
be subject to approval by DEP through the joint permit application process, or,
where deemed appropriate by DEP, the applicable general permit process. When
there is a question whether wetlands may be involved, it is the responsibility
of the developer or his agent to show that the land in question cannot be
classified as wetlands, otherwise approval to work in the area must be obtained
from DEP.
   4.   Any drainage conveyance facility and/or channel that does not fall
under DEP [Pa.Code,] Chapter 105, regulations, must be able to convey, without
damage to the drainage structure or roadway, runoff from the 100-year design
storm. Conveyance facilities to or exiting from stormwater management
facilities (i.e., detention basins) shall be designed to convey the design flow
to or from that structure. Roadway crossings located within designated
floodplain areas must be able to convey runoff from a 100-year design storm.
Any facility located within a PennDOT right-of-way must meet PennDOT minimum
design standards and permit submission requirements.
   5.   Storm sewers must be able to convey post-development runoff from a 100-
year design storm without surcharging inlets, where appropriate. Any post-
development drainage area that does not naturally convey stormwater runoff to a
stormwater management facility shall incorporate a storm sewer system capable
of collecting and conveying the stormwater runoff during a 100-year design
storm to said facilities. A combination of aboveground and overland conveyance
will be accepted without creation of hazardous conditions to any person or
property.
   6.   Any earthmoving activities subject to review by the Conservation
District must be granted approval of the Conservation District prior to
commencing work.
   7.   The design of all stormwater management facilities shall incorporate
good engineering principles and practices. The Borough shall reserve the right
to disapprove any design that would result in the occurrence or continuation of
adverse hydrologic or hydraulic conditions within the watershed.
   8.   The existing points of concentrated drainage that discharge onto
adjacent property shall be subject to applicable discharge criteria in this
Chapter. The volume of runoff may not be increased by more than the volume of
the 2-year return period storm unless an analysis is completed that shows
adequate facilities are in place to adequately convey post-development flows.
The downstream owner(s)’ signatures must be included on the stormwater
management site plan or a letter of approval acceptable to the Borough must be
obtained signifying approval to alter the concentrated drainage where
inadequate downstream drainage conveyance facilities exist to convey the
concentrated discharge. This requirement shall be limited to owner(s)’ less
than 500 yards downstream of the concentrated drainage point. The adequacy of
downstream drainage conveyance facilities shall be as determined by the Borough
Engineer with reference to this Chapter. Should the downstream owner(s)’ refuse
to accept the altered discharge, the developer must modify the stormwater
management site plan so the plan does not increase the drainage area or volume
of discharge at the discharge point.
   9.   Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge shall be subject to any
applicable discharge criteria in the general direction of existing discharge,
whether proposed to be concentrated or maintained as diffused drainage areas,
except as otherwise provided by this Chapter. If diffused flow is proposed to
be concentrated and discharged onto adjacent property, the developer must
document that adequate downstream drainage conveyance facilities exist to
safely transport the concentrated discharge, or otherwise prove that no
erosion, sedimentation, flooding or other harm will result from the
concentrated discharge. The downstream owner(s)’ signatures must be included on
the stormwater management site plan or a letter of approval acceptable to the
Borough must be obtained signifying approval to alter the concentrated drainage
where inadequate downstream drainage conveyance facilities exist to convey the
concentrated discharge. This requirement shall be limited to owner(s)’ less
than 500 yards downstream of the concentrated drainage point. The adequacy of
downstream drainage conveyance facilities shall be as determined by the Borough
Engineer with reference to this Chapter. Should the downstream owner(s)’ refuse
to accept the altered discharge, the developer must modify the stormwater
management site plan so the plan does not increase the drainage area or volume
of discharge at the discharge point.
   10.   Where a project site is traversed by watercourses, drainage easements
shall be provided conforming to the line of such watercourses. The terms of the
drainage easement shall prohibit excavation, the placing of fill or structures,
and any alterations that may adversely affect the flow of stormwater within any
portion of the drainage easement. Also, maintenance, including mowing of
vegetation within the drainage easement shall be required, except as approved
by the appropriate governing authority.
   11.   When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural
drainageways on the site cannot adequately provide for drainage, open channels
may be constructed conforming substantially to the line and grade of such
natural drainageways. Work within natural drainageways shall be subject to
approval by DEP through the joint permit application process, or, where deemed
appropriate by DEP, through the general permit process.
   12.   Roof drains must not be connected to streets, sanitary or storm sewers
or roadside ditches to promote overland flow and infiltration/percolation of
stormwater where advantageous to do so. When it is more advantageous to connect
directly to streets or storm sewers, then it shall be permitted on a case by
case basis by the Borough. In no case shall roof drains be positioned in a
manner that promotes drainage to adjacent structures or onto adjacent
properties.
   13.   Special requirements for areas falling within defined exceptional
value and high quality subwatersheds: The temperature and quality of water and
streams that have been declared as exceptional value and high quality is to be
maintained as defined in Chapter 93, “Water Quality Standards,” Title 25
[Pa.Code] of the DEP rules and regulations. Temperature sensitive BMPs and
stormwater conveyance systems are to be used and designed with storage pool
areas and supply outflow channels and should be shaded with trees. This will
require modification of berms for permanent ponds and the relaxation of
restrictions on planting vegetation within the facilities, provided that
capacity for volumes and rate control is maintained. At a minimum, the southern
half on pond shorelines shall be planted with shade or canopy trees within 10
feet of the pond shoreline. In conjunction with this requirement, the maximum
slope allowed on the berm area to be planted is 10 to 1. This will lessen the
destabilization of berm soils due to root growth. A long term maintenance
schedule and management plan for the thermal control BMPs is to be established
and recorded for all project sites within defined exceptional value and/or high
quality subwatersheds.
   14.   Outlet control shall be accomplished utilizing (6-inch diameter or 6-
inch width minimum) perforations arranged vertically to provide for positive
control of runoff. Outlet controls shall also provide for modification of the
orifice to a smaller diameter through the use of removable plates or similar
devices.
   15.   Discharges from piping outlets of stormwater management facilities
shall be provided with an approved level spreader to convert point discharge
back to simulated sheet flow.
   16.   All detention basins shall have a minimum bottom slope of 2 percent
unless infiltration structures are provided. Where infiltration structures are
provided an infiltration and/or percolation rate must be sufficient to accept
the additional storm load and drain completely as determined by field tests
conducted by the owner’s professional designer.
   17.   The permitted depth for detention or retention basins shall be 6 feet,
measured §
23-403 Stormwater Management §
23-403 23-31 Supp. III; added 12/5/2011 from the bottom of the emergency
spillway to the lowest point in the basin.
   18.   The maximum permitted side slopes for detention or retention basins
shall be 4 horizontal to 1 vertical.
   19.   All stormwater management facilities are considered structures and
must comply with applicable building setback requirements as set forth in the
Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27] or other applicable regulations. No part of the discharge structure
or piping shall encroach into the setback area.
   20.   Any stormwater detention/retention facility located in or adjacent to
a Residential Zone or Village Center Zone shall be subject to the following
fencing requirements: A. Stormwater facility must be completely surrounded by a
fence or wall of not less than 4 feet in height, which shall be so constructed
as not to have openings, holes or gaps larger than 2 inches in any dimension
(including the distance between horizontal or vertical pickets in a picket
fence). B. All gates or doors opening through such enclosure shall be equipped
with a self-closing and self-latching device for keeping the gate or door
securely closed at all times. C. The fences or walls erected shall further
comply with all applicable provisions of the Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27].
   21.   No stormwater management facilities shall be installed over existing
utility mains or services.
   22.   Plans showing outlet control structures shall contain a drainage
easement dedication as follows: “An easement is hereby granted to Lewisberry
Borough to access and modify the basin outlet control device at the expense of
the developer or owner so as to function within design parameters.”
   23.   In general, inlets shall be spaced such that, based upon the rational
method, time-of-concentration (Tc) = 5 minutes and 50-year design storm
intensity, the area contributing to the inlet shall not produce a peak
discharge of greater than 4 cubic feet per second. Also, inlets shall be spaced
so that their efficiency, based upon efficiency curves published by the
PennDOT, is not less than 65 percent. Additional inlets shall be placed at the
upper side of driveway/street intersections to prevent stormwater from
discharging onto the roadway. Other devices such as high efficiency grates or
perforated pipe may be required if conditions warrant.
   24.   In all cases where drainage is picked up by means of a head wall, and
inlet or outlet conditions control, the pipe shall be designed as a culvert.
The minimum diameter of culvert shall be 18 inches. The procedure contained in
“Hydraulic Engineer Circular,” Nos. 5 and 13, as prepared by the U. S.
Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, Washington, D.C.,
shall be used for the design of culverts.
   25.   When a pipe or culvert is intended to convey the discharge from a
stormwater management facility, its required capacity shall be computed by the
rational method and compared to the peak outflow from the stormwater management
facility for the 50- year design storm. The greater flow shall govern the
design of the pipe or culvert.
(Ord. 2022-01, 10/3/2022)
§ 23-307.   Calculation Methodology.
   Stormwater runoff from all project sites shall be calculated using either
the rational method or a soil cover complex methodology.
      A.   Any stormwater runoff calculations involving drainage areas greater
than 200 acres, including on- and off-site areas, shall use generally accepted
calculation technique that is based on the NRCS soil cover complex method. It
is assumed that all methods will be selected by the design professional based
on the individual limitations and suitability of each method for a particular
site. The Borough may allow the use of the rational method to estimate peak
discharges from drainage areas that contain less than 200 acres.
      B.   The design storm volumes and precipitation intensities to be used in
the analysis of discharge or runoff shall be obtained from the Precipitation-
Frequency Atlas of the United States, Atlas 14, Volume 2, Version 3.0, U.S.
Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),
National Weather Service, Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center, Silver
Spring, Maryland. NOAA’s Atlas 14 can be accessed at: http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/
hdsc/pfds/.
      C.   For computation of pre-development flow rates, 20 percent of the
existing impervious area of a project site, when present, shall be considered
meadow. Undeveloped land, including disturbed areas, shall be considered as
“meadow” in good condition, unless the natural ground cover generates a lower
curve number or rational “C” value (i.e., forest), as listed in Table 23-4-1.
      D.   Peak discharge computed using the rational method should follow the
formula, Q = CIA where:
         Q = Peak discharge in cubic feet per second
         C = Runoff factor expressed as a percent of the total rainfall
         I = Rainfall intensity in inches per hour
         A = The drainage area expressed in acres
      E.   Times-of-concentration for overland flow shall be calculated using
the methodology presented in Chapter 3 of Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
NRCS, TR-55 (as amended or replaced form time to time by NRCS). Time-of
concentration for channel and pipe flow shall be computed using Manning’s
equation.
      F.   Runoff curve numbers (CN) for both existing and proposed conditions
to be used in the soil cover complex method shall be obtained from
Table 23-4-2.
      G.   Runoff coefficients (c) for both existing and proposed conditions
for use in the rational method shall be obtained from
Table 23-4-1.
      H.   Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning equation shall be
used for hydraulic computations such as the capacity of open channels, pipes,
and storm sewers. Values for Manning’s roughness coefficient (n) shall be
consistent with
Table 23-4-3.
      I.   Outlet structures for stormwater management facilities shall be
designed to meet the performance standards of this Chapter using any generally
accepted hydraulic analysis technique or method.
      J.   The design of any stormwater detention facilities intended to meet
the performance standards of this Chapter shall be verified by routing the
design storm hydrograph through these facilities.
(Ord. 2022-01, 10/3/2022)
§ 23-308.   Groundwater Recharge (Infiltration/Recharge/Retention).
   1.   Maintaining runoff volumes of pre-development conditions requires
groundwater recharge of the areas being developed. The applicant shall be
responsible to reduce the post-development runoff volume to that of the pre-
development, for the 2-year, 24- hour storm event. Design of the infiltration/
recharge stormwater management facilities shall incorporate groundwater
recharge to compensate for the reduction in the percolation that occurs when
the ground surface is converted to an impervious surface. These measures are
required unless the applicant can prove the project site is physically
incapable of recharge. If physical limitations exist preventing groundwater
recharge, runoff volumes must be reduced through another acceptable BMP
proposed by the developer’s engineer.
   2.   Infiltration BMPs shall meet the following minimum requirements:
      A.   Infiltration BMPs intended to receive runoff from developed areas
shall be selected based on suitability of soils and site conditions and shall
be constructed on soils that have the following characteristics:
         (1)   A minimum depth of 12 inches between the bottom of the facility
and the seasonal high water table and/or bedrock (limiting zones). Limiting
zones to be determined by probe hole excavation.
         (2)   An infiltration and/or percolation rate sufficient to accept the
additional stormwater load and drain completely as determined by field tests
conducted by the owner’s professional designer.
      B.   The recharge volume provided at the project site shall be directed
to the most permeable soils available.
      C.   The recharge facility shall be capable of completely infiltrating
the impounded water within 48 hours.
   3.   A detailed soils evaluation of the project site shall be performed to
determine the suitability of recharge facilities. The evaluation shall be
performed by a qualified professional, and at a minimum, address soil
permeability, depth to bedrock, susceptibility to sinkhole formation, and
subgrade stability. The general process for designing the infiltration BMP
shall be: A. Site evaluation to determine general areas of suitability for
infiltration practices. B. Provide field test to determine appropriate
percolation rate and/or hydraulic conductivity. C. Design infiltration
structure for required storm volume based on all available data.
   4.   Extreme caution shall be exercised where infiltration is proposed in
geologically susceptible areas such as strip mine or limestone areas. Extreme
caution shall also be exercised where salt or chloride would be a pollutant
since soils do little to filter this pollutant and it may contaminate the
groundwater. It is also extremely important that the design professional
evaluate the possibility of groundwater contamination from the proposed
infiltration/recharge facility and recommend a hydrogeologic justification
study be performed, if necessary. Whenever a basin will be located in an area
underlain by limestone, a geological evaluation of the proposed location shall
be conducted to determine susceptibility to sinkhole formations. The design of
all facilities over limestone formations shall include measures to prevent
ground water contamination and, where necessary, sinkhole formation. The
infiltration requirement in the high quality/exceptional waters shall be
subject to the DEP’s [25 Pa.Code,] Chapter 93, and antidegradation regulations.
The Borough may require the installation of an impermeable liner in detention
basins. A detailed hydrogeologic investigations may be required by the Borough.
   5.   The Borough may require the developer to provide safeguards against
groundwater contamination for uses which may cause groundwater contamination,
should there be a mishap or spill. It shall be the developer’s responsibility
to verify if the project site is underlain by limestone. A note shall be
included on all stormwater management site plans and signed and sealed by the
developer’s engineer/surveyor/landscape architect/geologist certifying whether
any detention or retention basins are underlain by limestone, i.e.: “I,
                , certify that the proposed detention/retention basin (circle
one) is/is not underlain by limestone.”
   6.   Where porous pavement is permitted for parking lots, recreational
facilities, nondedicated streets, or other areas, pavement construction
specifications shall be noted on the stormwater management site plan.
   7.   Recharge/infiltration facilities may be used in conjunction with other
innovative or traditional BMPs, stormwater control facilities, and
nonstructural stormwater management alternatives.
(Ord. 2022-01, 10/3/2022)
§ 23-309.   Riparian Buffers.
   A.   Areas immediately adjacent to the Borough’s perennial streams, areas of
springs, watercourses where the drainage area to the wetland or watercourse
exceeds 75 acres, and areas deemed by the Borough to possess environmental
value shall be defined as the “Riparian Buffer Zone” or “RBZ.” In the RBZ,
special requirements as set forth in this Section shall apply in order to
maintain important natural functions. These RBZ requirements are based on both
the heightened sensitivity of the RBZ and the potential to negatively impact
the stream system when this RBZ is disturbed, as well as the potential of this
RBZ to mitigate to the maximum extent the negative effects of development in
areas adjacent to the stream system.
      1.   In order to protect and improve water quality, a riparian buffer
easement shall be created and recorded as part of any subdivision or land
development that encompasses a Riparian Buffer.
      2.   Except as required by Chapter 102, the riparian buffer easement
shall be measured to be the greater of the limit of the 100-year floodplain or
a minimum of 35 feet from the top of the streambank (on each side).
      3.   Minimum management requirements for riparian buffers.
         a.   Existing native vegetation shall be protected and maintained
within the riparian buffer easement.
         b.   Whenever practicable invasive vegetation shall be actively
removed, and the riparian buffer easement shall be planted with native trees,
shrubs, and other vegetation to create a diverse native plant community
appropriate to the intended ecological context of the site.
      4.   The riparian buffer easement shall be enforceable by the Borough and
shall be recorded in the York County Recorder of Deeds Office, so that it shall
run with the land and shall limit the use of the property located therein, The
easement shall allow for the continued private ownership and shall count toward
the minimum lot area a required by Zoning, unless otherwise specified in the
Borough Zoning Ordinance.
      5.   Any permitted use within the riparian buffer easement shall be
conducted in a manner that will maintain the extent of the existing 100-year
floodplain, improve or maintain the stream stability, and preserve and protect
the ecological function of the floodplain.
      6.   The following conditions shall apply when public and/or private
recreation trails are permitted within riparian buffers:
         a.   Trails shall be for non-motorized use only.
         b.   Trails shall be designed to have the least impact on native plant
species and other sensitive environmental features.
      7.   Septic drain fields and sewage disposal systems shall not be
permitted within the riparian buffer easement and shall comply with setback
requirements established under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 73.
   B.   For areas immediately adjacent to the Borough’s perennial streams,
areas of springs, watercourses where the drainage area to the wetland or
watercourse less than 75 acres, the RBZ shall be defined as a zone extending 15
feet outward from the top of the bank(s) of the watercourse. Within this area,
no disturbance of vegetation and soil except for construction of roadway
structures or conveyance systems in accordance with the design standards of
this Chapter and restoration shall occur, in order to shade the stream with
natural vegetation, to provide a source of numerous other organic inputs to the
aquatic system, to anchor the streambank and floodplain area, and to consume
and otherwise remove nitrogen, sediment, and other substances which can
adversely affect stream systems.
(Ord. 2022-01, 10/3/2022)
§ 23-310.   Erosion and Sedimentation Requirements.
   1.   As required in this Chapter, whenever the vegetation and topography are
to be disturbed, such activity must be in conformance with Chapter 102, Title
25 [Pa.Code] of the DEP, rules and regulations, Part 1, and in accordance with
requirements of the Conservation District.
   2.   It is extremely important that strict erosion and sedimentation control
measures be applied surrounding infiltration structure during installation to
prevent the infiltrative surfaces from becoming clogged. Additional erosion and
sedimentation control design standards and criteria that must be or are
recommended to be applied where infiltration BMPs are proposed shall include
the following:
      A.   Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from
sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase, so as to maintain
their maximum infiltration capacity.
      B.   Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed nor receive runoff until
the entire contributory drainage area to the infiltration BMP has received
final stabilization.
(Ord. 2022-01, 10/3/2022)
§ 23-311.   Water Quality and Stream Protection.
   A.   Developed areas will provide adequate storage and treatment facilities
necessary to capture and treat stormwater runoff. The recharge volume computed
under §
23-405 may be a component of the water quality volume. If the recharge volume
is less than the water quality volume, the remaining water quality volume may
be captured and treated by methods other than recharge/infiltration BMPs.
      1.   The water quality volume (WQv) is the storage capacity needed to
treat stormwater runoff produced by “P” inches of rainfall (90 percent rule)
from the developed areas of the project site. The following calculation formula
is used to determine the storage volume, WQv, in acre-feet of storage:
         WQv = [(P)(Rv)(A)]/12
         WQv = Water quality volume (acre-ft)
         P = Rainfall amount (2-year, 24-hour)
         A = Disturbed project area (acre)
         Rv = 0.05 + 0.009(I)
         I = (Impervious area ÷ total project area) x 100
      2.   WQv shall be designed as part of a stormwater management facility
which incorporates water quality BMPs as a primary benefit of using that
facility, in accordance with design specifications contained in the BMP manual.
The following factors shall be considered when evaluating the suitability of
BMPs used to control water quality at a given project site:
         a.   Total contributing area.
         b.   Permeability and infiltration rate of the site soils.
         c.   Slope and depth to bedrock.
         d.   Seasonal high water table.
         e.   Proximity to building foundations and well heads.
         f.   Erodibility of soils.
         g.   Land availability and configuration of the topography.
         h.   Peak discharge and required volume control.
         i.   The nature of the pollutant being removed.
         j.   Maintenance requirements.
         k.   Creation/protection of aquatic and wildlife habitat.
         l.   Recreational value.
         m.   Enhancement of aesthetic and property value.
      3.   Release of water can begin at the start of the storm (i.e., the
invert of the water quality orifice is at the invert of the facility). The
design of the facility shall consider and minimize the chances of clogging and
sedimentation potential. Orifices smaller than 4 inches in diameter are not
recommended.
   B.   The developer may submit original and innovative designs to the Borough
Engineer for review and approval. Such designs may achieve the water quality
objectives through a combination of BMPs.

submitted with an application for approval under the Subdivision Ordinance [
Chapter 22] shall be granted or denied by the Borough Council following the
recommendation of the Township Engineer. Approval of stormwater management site
plans and waiver requests submitted where an application for approval under the
Subdivision Ordinance [
Chapter 22] is not required shall be granted or denied by the Borough Codes
Enforcement Officer with the recommendation of the Township Engineer where
deemed necessary. Approval of all other stormwater management site plans and
waiver requests shall be granted or denied by the Township Engineer.
   C.   A written review of the stormwater management site plan will be
provided to the Borough by the Borough Engineer, when applicable, outlining the
results of the review. The written review shall detail any discrepancies
between the stormwater management site plan and this Chapter or the IWRP and
any recommendations for the stormwater management site plan to achieve
compliance or a waiver request to be granted.
   D.   For regulated activities that require an NPDES permit, the stormwater
management site plan shall not be finally approved until the Borough has been
provided a letter of consistency from the Conservation District signifying
approval of the E&S plan.
   E.   No building, zoning or other permits for any regulated activity shall
be approved or issued by the Borough if the stormwater management site plan has
been disapproved or approved with conditions. In the latter case, the permits
may be issued by the Borough at its discretion upon acceptance in writing by
the applicant of the conditions to approval.
   F.   Modification Requests:
      1.   When reviewing a SWM Site Plan and supporting information, whether
or not the SWM Site Plan is included in a subdivision and/or land development
plan application, the Borough may, after consulting with DEP as noted in §
23-301.C. of this Chapter, grant a modification of the requirements of one or
more provisions of this Chapter if the literal enforcement will enact undue
hardship because of peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question,
provided that such modification will not be contrary to the public interest and
that the purpose and intent of the Ordinance is observed.
      2.   All requests for modifications from an applicant shall be in writing
and shall accompany and be a part of the application for approval of a SWM Site
Plan and/or a subdivision or Land Development plan as applicable. The request
shall state in full the grounds and facts of unreasonableness or hardship on
which the request is based, the provision(s) of the Ordinance involved and the
minimum modification(s) necessary.
      3.   The Borough shall keep a written record of all action on requests
for modifications. The response of any consultation and/or review by DEP shall
be included as an original report if available or otherwise documented in the
required written record.
   G.   SWM Site Plan Review and Approval Procedure:
      1.   If a SWM Site Plan and supporting information does not involve a
subdivision and/or land development, the review of the SWM Site,
recommendations, approval, approval with conditions, or disapproval, i.e., the
review and decision period, shall occur within 45 days of submission to the
Borough. However, the Borough, in its sole discretion, may extend the review
and decision period another 45 days due to the nature of the application and/or
site conditions. If an extension of another 45 days is imposed or granted by
the Borough beyond the first 45-day review and decision period designated by
this paragraph, the Borough shall notify the applicant in writing and deliver
such notice to said applicant within 15 days of the decision to extend the
review and decision period by the Borough. If no extension is imposed or
granted by the Borough beyond the first 45-day review and decision period, and
no decision has been rendered by the Borough within that period, the SWM Site
Plan shall be deemed approved. Similarly, if after a 45-day extension of the
review and decision period has been imposed or granted by the Borough, and no
decision has been rendered by the Borough within that period, the SWM Site Plan
shall be deemed approved.
      2.   If a SWM Site Plan involves a subdivision and/or land development
plan, the period of time from the submission to the Borough of the subdivision
and/or land development plan application which includes the SWM Plan and the
approval, approval with conditions, or disapproval, i.e., review and decision
period, shall be in accordance with the procedure for approval of plats in §
508 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
      3.   From the time an application for approval of a plat involving a
subdivision or land development plan, whether preliminary or final, which
includes a SWM Site Plan, is duly filed with the Borough, no change or
amendment of this Chapter or other governing ordinance or plan shall affect the
decision on such application in accordance with the provisions of the governing
ordinances or plans as they stood at the time the application was duly filed,
as specified in § 508(4)(I) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
   H.   Decision Notification Procedure: In all cases, the decision of the
Borough to approve or disapprove the SWM Site Plan shall be in writing and
shall be delivered to the applicant no later than 15 days following the
decision. If the SWM Site Plan is disapproved, the written decision by the
Borough shall specify the defects in the application, describe the requirements
which were not met, and shall cite the provisions of the Ordinance relied upon.
If the SWM Site Plan is approved with conditions, the notification to the
applicant shall state the acceptable conditions for approval and the time limit
for satisfying such conditions. The time limit for satisfying conditions of
approval shall be the time limit prescribed for conditional approval of
subdivision and land development plans as stated in the Borough’s Subdivision
and Land Development Ordinance.
   I.   Once the SWM Site Plan and supporting documents are finalized and
approved, digital copies shall be provided to the Borough and its Engineer.
   J.   For any SWM Site Plan that proposes to use any BMPs other than Green
Infrastructure and LID practices to achieve the volume and rate controls
required under this Chapter, the Borough will not approve the SWM Site Plan
unless it determines that Green Infrastructure and LID practices are not
practicable.
(Ord. 2022-01, 10/3/2022)
§ 23-404.   Revision, Modification of Plans.
   A revision to a previously submitted or approved SWM Site Plan that involves
a change in SWM BMPs, Stormwater Management Facilities, or changes in
analytical techniques, or that involves the relocation or redesign of SWM BMPs,
or that is necessary because soil or other conditions are not as stated on the
SWM Site Plan, as determined by the Borough, shall require a re-submission of
the revised SWM Site Plan in accordance with this Chapter, including applicable
fees. For NPDES permitted sites, any revised SWM Site Plan shall also be re-
submitted to the York County Conservation District for review. In the case of a
SWM Site Plan which contains minor deficiencies, such as a missing label,
omission of a required note or minor construction detail, as determined by the
Borough, the Borough may accept a re-submission of such SWM Site Plan without
the requirement of a review fee, or for a lesser fee as provided for in the
Borough’s fee schedule.
(Ord. 2022-01, 10/3/2022)
§ 23-405.   Re-submission of Disapproved SWM Site Plans.
   A disapproved SWM Site Plan may be resubmitted, with the revisions
addressing the Borough’s concerns as stated regarding the original submission,
to the Borough in accordance with this Part 4. The applicable review fee must
accompany the submission of a revised SWM Site Plan, unless such fee is waived
by the Borough (See §
23-404).
(Ord. 2022-01, 10/3/2022)
§ 23-406.   Authorization to Construct and Term of Validity.
   A.   SWM Site Plans Independent of Subdivision and Land Development Plans.
The Borough’s approval of a SWM Site Plan, when such Plan is submitted
independent of a subdivision and/or land development plan, authorizes the
regulated activities contained in the SWM Site Plan for a maximum term of
validity of five years following the date of approval. The Borough may, in its
sole discretion, specify a term of validity shorter than five years in the
approval for any specific SWM Site Plan, particularly if the nature of the
proposed SWM facilities require more frequent maintenance and/or short-term
replacement of certain components. Terms of validity shall commence on the date
the Borough signs the approval for an SWM Site Plan. If an approved SWM Site
Plan is not completed according to §
23-407 within the term of validity, then the Borough may consider the SWM Site
Plan disapproved and may revoke any and all permits. SWM Site Plans that are
considered disapproved by the Borough may be resubmitted in accordance with §
23-405 of this Chapter.
   B.   SWM Site Plans Included in a Subdivision and/or Land Development Plan.
The Borough’s approval of a SWM Site Plan, which is a part of a subdivision
and/or land development plan, authorizes that plan and the regulated activities
therein so that no subsequent change or amendment in this Chapter or other
governing ordinances or plans shall be applied to affect adversely the right of
the applicant to commence and to complete any aspect of the approved
development in accordance with the terms of such approval within five years
from such approval, as specified in § 508.(4)(ii) - (vii) of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code.
(Ord. 2022-01, 10/3/2022)
§ 23-407.   As-Built Plans, Completion Certificate, and Final Inspection.
   A.   The developer shall be responsible for providing as-built plans of all
SWM BMPs included in the approved SWM Site Plan. The as-built plans and an
explanation of any discrepancies with the construction plans shall be submitted
to the Borough.
   B.   The as-built submission shall include a certification of completion
signed by a qualified professional on behalf of the applicant, or other
qualified person if approved by the Borough, on a case-by-case basis, verifying
that all permanent SWM BMPs have been constructed according to the approved
plans and specifications. If any licensed qualified person contributed to the
construction plans, then a licensed qualified person must sign the completion
certificate.
   C.   After receipt of the completion certification by the Borough, the
Borough may conduct a final inspection to verify compliance with, and accuracy
of, the as-built plans.
   D.   Once the as-built plans are approved by the Borough, digital copies of
the as-built plans and executed certification of completion shall be provided
to the Borough and their Engineer. This shall be in addition to the digital
copies of the plan required by §
23-403.E., above.
(Ord. 2022-01, 10/3/2022)
§ 23-408.   Performance Guarantee.
   A.   The applicant shall provide financial security to the Borough prior to
approval of a SWM Site Plan to guarantee installation and construction of all
Stormwater Management Facilities depicted on the approved SWM Site Plan
(including associated erosion and sedimentation facilities) in the amount of
110% of the total estimated construction cost. Financial security shall be
provided in a form that is acceptable to the Borough’s legal counsel. The
financial security shall comply with the requirements of § 509 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, except that the financial security
shall only be released upon submittal and approval of an as-built plan and
professional certification as required by §
23-407. All remedies available to the Borough pursuant to §§ 509, 510, and 511
of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code shall be available pursuant to
this Chapter.
   B.   No work shall be commenced on the installation of stormwater management
facilities until unconditional stormwater management plan approval or financial
security is posted in an amount and type as required by § 509 of the MPC.
   C.   As work of installing the required stormwater management facilities
proceeds, the developer may request the Borough Council to release or authorize
to release portions of the financial security. The Borough shall process such
requests in accordance with Article V of the MPC.
   D.   Final completion and full release of financial security shall not occur
until the Borough has been supplied with a final “as-built” survey signed by a
licensed engineer or surveyor depicting all stormwater management facilities
installed for the project.

Part 5
Operation and Maintenance
§ 23-501.   Purpose.
   1.   O&M of stormwater management facilities is essential for the proper
functioning of the stormwater management facilities and for their proper
operation. Failure to properly maintain stormwater management facilities may
adversely impact the health and safety of surrounding property owners. It is
the intention of the Borough Council to impose regulations to require the
permanent maintenance of stormwater management facilities which exist on the
effective date of this Chapter, and which are installed in the future.
   2.   Alterations to stormwater management facilities which are not performed
in accordance with a revised stormwater management site plan may create
unforeseen consequences to surrounding property owners. No alterations to
stormwater management facilities will be permitted unless the developer submits
a stormwater management site plan as required by this Chapter and meets all of
the standards and criteria of this Chapter.
(Ord. 2011-4, 10/3/2011, § 701; as amended by Ord. 2022-01, 10/3/2022)
§ 23-502.   Operation and Maintenance of Stormwater Management Facilities
During Development.
   1.   O&M of stormwater management facilities during development of a project
site shall be the responsibility of the developer and owner.
   2.   The developer and owner shall maintain stormwater management facilities
during development of a project site which shall include, but not be limited
to:
      A.   Removal of silt from all stormwater management facilities not
utilized for sediment and erosion control measures when 60 percent of capacity
is filled with silt; provided, however, that in no case shall the sediment
level be permitted to build up higher than 1 foot below the principal outlet
crest. At this elevation, clean out shall be performed to restore the original
design volume to the basin or other structure. The elevation corresponding to
the maximum allowable sediment level shall be determined and stated in the
design data as a distance below the top of the riser. The elevation shall be
clearly marked on the riser to enable proper maintenance. Sediment basins must
be maintained in conformance with [25 Pa. Code,] Chapter 102. All sediment must
be removed prior to converting the basin or trap to a permanent stormwater
management facility.
      B.   Periodic maintenance of temporary control stormwater management
facilities such as replacement of straw bale dikes, straw filters or similar
measures.
      C.   Establishment or reestablishment of vegetation by seeding and
mulching or sodding of scoured areas or areas where vegetation has not
successfully been established.
      D.   Installation of necessary controls to correct unforeseen problems
caused by storm events within design frequencies.
      E.   Removal of all temporary stormwater management facilities upon
installation of permanent stormwater management facilities at completion of the
development.
(Ord. 2011-4, 10/3/2011, § 702; as amended by Ord. 2022-01, 10/3/2022)
§ 23-503.   Operation and Maintenance of Stormwater Management Facilities upon
Completion of a Development.
   1.   It is the purpose and intent of this Chapter that the Borough shall not
become responsible for maintenance and supervision of stormwater management
facilities unless such facilities are within public street rights-of-way
dedicated to and accepted by the Borough or unless such facilities are
specifically accepted by the Borough. The responsibility for stormwater
management facility maintenance falls upon the developer of the project site
who shall remain responsible for those areas of the project site which are
subject to the requirements of this Chapter. This responsibility may be
retained or assigned to third persons approved by the Borough as is deemed most
acceptable to the developer.
   2.   It is the intent of this Chapter that the purposes of this Chapter
shall be carried out through the exercise of responsibility of private person
(s) and, therefore, it is anticipated that stormwater management site plans
shall be designed with a view towards stormwater management facilities which
can effectively be contained within the tracts to be owned and maintained by
private person(s) including homeowners associations. To foster this purpose,
stormwater management facilities which will not otherwise become part of
Borough property shall whenever possible become the responsibility of the
collective property owners benefitted by such stormwater management facilities,
including, but not limited to, retention basins, detention basins, sediment
basins, energy dissipaters, or grassed watercourses, and the Borough and the
owner shall enter into an O&M agreement, which shall be recorded, setting forth
such maintenance responsibilities and binding successor owners of the
subdivided lots of the project to share the costs associated with maintenance.
The O&M agreement shall, at a minimum provide as follows as to the owners, his
or their heirs, executors, successors and/or assigns:
      A.   The owner shall maintain all facilities in accordance with the
approved maintenance schedule in the O&M plan, which schedule, and plan shall
be incorporated in and made part of the O&M agreement.
      B.   The owner shall convey to the Borough easements to assure access for
periodic inspections by the Borough and maintenance, as necessary.
      C.   The owner shall not modify, alter or relocate any stormwater
facilities without the approval of the Borough.
      D.   The owner shall indemnify the Borough from any and all claims
arising from the operation and maintenance of the stormwater facilities.
      E.   The owner shall be responsible for all costs of inspection,
operation and maintenance.
      F.   The owner shall pay all costs of enforcement or abatement by the
Borough, including an express statement granting authority to the Borough to
collect such costs by municipal lien on the property.
      G.   The O&M agreement shall be recorded in the York County Recorder of
Deeds Office and shall thereafter be a covenant running with the land and a
deed restriction for the benefit of the Borough and its citizens.
      H.   The owner shall keep on file with the Borough the name, address, and
telephone number of the person or company responsible for maintenance
activities; in the event of a change, new information shall be submitted by the
owner to the Borough within 10 working days of the change.
      I.   Where costs and maintenance responsibility will not be collectively
shared, the Borough may require a perpetual maintenance bond or adequate funds
be deposited with the Borough to pay for the costs of future maintenance of the
stormwater management facilities.
   3.   Developers shall include a mandatory note reference to the O&M plan and
O&M agreement on the corresponding subdivision and/or land development plan.
Persons, including developers, conveying property within a project site to
another party which contains any stormwater management facilities shall include
a specific deed reference to the O&M agreement affecting such grantee’s
property.
   4.   Required maintenance of stormwater management facilities shall include
at a minimum the following:
      A.   Maintaining vegetated channels and other areas according to
specifications in the E&S Manual.
      B.   Reestablishment of vegetation by seeding and mulching or sodding of
scoured areas or areas where vegetation has not been successfully established.
      C.   Mowing as necessary and where permitted to maintain adequate stands
or grass and to control weeds.
      D.   Removal of silt from all permanent structures which trap silt or
sediment in order to keep the material from building up in the grass waterways
thus reducing their capacity.
      E.   Regular inspection of the areas in questions to assure proper O&M.
BMPs shall be inspected annually for 10 years and immediately after the
cessation of a storm event having a 1-year or greater return period.
Thereafter, BMPs shall be inspected once every 3 years and immediately after
the cessation of a storm event having a 1-year or greater return period. The
entity conducting the inspection shall be required to submit a report to the
Borough regarding the condition of the facility and recommending necessary
repairs, if needed. Any such repairs shall be at the cost of the owner. All
inspection records shall be maintained by the owner and shall be made available
to the Borough on request.
      F.   Removal of silt from all permanent drainage structures in order to
maintain the design storage volumes. Regular maintenance programs shall be
established and maintained.
   5.   The stormwater management agreement and deed restrictions identified
above shall also include notice that in the event the individual property owner
should fail to comply with the terms of this Chapter for the maintenance and
care of the land in question, the Borough shall have the authority to carry out
those duties hereby imposed upon individual property owners. The Borough may,
after giving notice to an individual property owner that he is not properly
maintaining the areas subject to this Chapter, and by making demand that such
compliance shall be made within the time period set forth in the notification,
enter upon said property and take such actions as may be required to bring the
area into compliance with this Chapter. The Borough shall further have the
right to file a municipal lien against such property for the cost of
maintenance work carried out under this Section, plus a penalty of 10 percent
of the costs of such work. The Borough shall in addition to the filing of a
municipal lien have any other remedies provided by law against any property
owner who should fail to comply with the terms of this Chapter.
(Ord. 2011-4, 10/3/2011, § 703; as amended by Ord. 2022-01, 10/3/2022)
§ 23-504.   Maintenance of Stormwater Management Facilities by Private Entity.
   In cases where permanent maintenance of stormwater management facilities is
to be performed by a private person, such as an owner, developer, homeowners
association or a condominium unit owners association, such entity shall be
responsible for the maintenance of such facilities and shall enter into a
legally binding O&M agreement with the Borough. The O&M agreement shall provide
the Borough rights in accordance with § 705 of the MPC relating to the
maintenance of common open space should the private person fail to adequately
maintain the stormwater management facilities. The O&M agreement shall be
approved by the Borough Solicitor and shall contain the same minimum
requirements as set forth in §
23-703.2.
(Ord. 2011-4, 10/3/2011, § 704; as amended by Ord. 2022-01, 10/3/2022)
§ 23-505.   Maintenance of Existing Stormwater Management Facilities.
   Stormwater management facilities existing on the effective date of this
Chapter on individual lots which have not been accepted by the Borough or for
which maintenance responsibility has not been assumed by private entity such as
a homeowners association shall be maintained by the individual property owners.
Such maintenance shall include at a minimum those items set forth in §
23-703 above. If the Borough determines at any time that any permanent
stormwater management facility has been eliminated, altered, blocked through
the erection of structures or the deposit of materials, or improperly
maintained, the Borough may determine that such condition constitutes a public
nuisance and shall notify the property owner of corrective measures which are
required, and provide for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 30 days,
within which the property owner shall take correction action. If the property
owner does not take the required corrective action, the Borough may either
perform the work or contract for the performance of the work and, in such
event, the Borough shall have the right to file a municipal lien against such
property for the cost of the work carried out under this Section, plus a
penalty of 10 percent of the costs of such work. The Borough shall in addition
to the filing of a municipal lien have any other remedies provided by law
against any property owner who should fail to comply with the terms of this
Chapter.

§ 23-506.   Alteration of Stormwater Management Facilities.
   No person shall modify, remove, fill, landscape or alter stormwater
management facilities which may have been installed on a property unless a
stormwater management site plan has been approved which authorizes such
modification, removal, filling, landscaping or alteration. No person shall
place any structure, fill, landscaping or vegetation into a stormwater
management facility or within a drainage easement which will limit or alter the
functioning of the facility or easement in any manner.
(Ord. 2011-4, 10/3/2011, §706; as amended by Ord. 2022-01, 10/3/2022)
§ 23-507.   Municipal Stormwater Maintenance Fund.
   1.   Persons installing stormwater management facilities shall be required
to pay a specified amount to a Borough stormwater maintenance fund to help
defray the Borough’s costs of periodic inspections. The amount of the deposit
shall be calculated to cover the cost of periodic inspections performed by the
Borough for a period of 10 years, as estimated by the Borough Engineer. After
that period of time, inspections will be performed at the expense of the
Borough.
   2.   All money paid to the Borough in this manner shall be kept in an
operating reserve fund established as provided by the Borough. Money in such
operating reserve fund must be used for inspections and emergency maintenance
of stormwater management facilities. Money in such operating reserve fund shall
be invested in accordance with the Borough Code.

Zoning Officer, Building Code Official, Permit Officer or Codes Enforcement
Officer as authorized representatives, any one of whom may commerce and pursue
enforcement proceedings pursuant to this Section. The Borough Solicitor shall

available at law or in equity to restrain, prevent, or abate a violation of
this Chapter. Such proceedings may be initiated before any court of competent
jurisdiction. In cases of emergency where, in the opinion of the court, the
circumstances of the case require immediate abatement of the unlawful conduct,
the court may, in its decree, fix a reasonable time during which the person
responsible for the unlawful conduct shall correct or abate the same. The
expense of such proceedings, including attorney fees, shall be recoverable from
the violator in such manner as may now or hereafter be provided by law.

which event there shall be deemed to have been only one such violation.
   B.   In addition to the penalties prescribed in subsection A., the Borough
may institute civil, injunctive, mandamus, or any other appropriate action or

of the plan. Violations shall be treated in the following manner:
      A.   Any noncompliance with the provisions of the stormwater management
plan that is identified by the Borough Engineer, the code enforcement officer,
zoning officer or other designee of the Borough in the course of inspections as
specified in this Chapter shall be remedied by the developer according to the
terms in this Chapter.

management site plan, including all conditions and specifications and
modifications thereof, the Borough Engineer, Code Enforcement Officer or Zoning
Officer shall issue a written notice to comply to the developer. Such notice
shall set forth the nature of corrections required and the time within which
corrections shall be made. Upon failure to comply within the time specified,

any building or other construction, until corrections are made. If corrections
are not undertaken within a specified time or the developer violates the cease
and desist order: (1) penalties shall be imposed; and/or (2) the work shall be
completed by the Borough and the costs charged to the developer.

§ 23-807.   Compatibility with Other Permit and Ordinance Requirements.
   1.   Approvals issued pursuant to this Chapter do not relieve the developer
of the responsibility to comply with or secure required permits or approvals
for activities regulated by any other applicable resolution, ordinance, code,
rule, regulation or laws (Federal, State, and local). If more stringent
requirements concerning regulation of stormwater or erosion and sedimentation
control are contained in the other regulations, the more stringent regulations
shall apply.
   2.   All stormwater management facilities and regulated activities must also
comply with Chapter 197 [Storm Sewers]. Any violation of Chapter 197 [Storm
Sewers] shall also be a violation of this Chapter subject to all remedies
available under this Chapter.

guarantee or warranty of any kind by the Borough of the practicability or
safety of any proposed structure or use with respect to damage from erosion,
sedimentation, stormwater runoff, flood, or any other matter, and shall create
no liability upon or give rise to any cause of action against the Borough and

promoting this and the general purpose of this Chapter the specific intent of
this zone is:
      A.   To protect sites of historic and patriotic value.
      B.   To promote responsible design within the Historic Zone.
   2.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This Section is intended to create
an overlay district within which all applications for zoning/use permits for
either the purpose of alteration or demolition will be directed to the
Lewisberry Borough Planning Commission for review and comment, as to the effect
of the proposed action on the historic-architectural character of the zone.
Notwithstanding, all of the regulations of the underlying zone shall remain in
full force and effect. [Ord. 2007-2]

any land will be permitted provided that the development or uses adhere to all
the requirements of the underlying zone.
   4.   Approval by the Zoning Officer. In addition to meeting the normal
require ments for obtaining a zoning/use permit, all applications for

harmony, which is the relationship between the proposed alteration and the
texture, size and material of the present structure or building; and (B)
structural affect, which is the architectural historic character of the
property. [Ord. 2007-2]

period not to exceed 30 days after the application has been forwarded by the
Zoning Officer to the Lewisberry Borough Planning Commission, whichever comes
first, the Zoning Officer may proceed in a manner similar to the rules in
effect in the underlying zone to issue the permit. [Ord. 2007-2]
(Ord. 6/6/1988, §305; as amended by Ord. 2007-2, 12/17/2007)
§ 27-306.   Floodplain Zones; Floodway (FW), Flood Fringe (FF), General
Floodplain Area (FA).
   1.   Purpose. The purpose of this zone is to prevent the loss of property
and life, the creation of health and safety hazards, the disruption of commerce
and governmental services, the extraordinary and unnecessary expenditure of
public funds for flood protection and relief, and the impairment of the tax
base by:
      A.   Regulating uses, activities, and development which, acting alone or
in combination with other existing or future    uses, activities, and
development, will cause unacceptable increases in flood heights, velocities and
frequencies.
      B.   Restricting or prohibiting certain uses, activities, and development
from locating within areas subject to flooding.
      C.   Requiring all those uses, activities, and developments that do occur
in floodprone areas to be protected and/or floodproofed against flooding and
flood damage.
      D.   Protecting individuals from buying lands and structures which are
unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards.
   2.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
      A.   The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this
Chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
acceptable engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare
occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such
as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This Chapter does not
imply that areas outside the floodplain zone, or that land uses permitted
within this zone will be free from flooding or flood damages.
      B.   This Chapter shall not create liability on the part of Lewisberry
Borough or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result
from reliance on this Chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   3.   Establishment of the Floodplain Zones.
      A.   Description of Zones.
         (1)   Basis of Zones. The various floodplain zones shall include areas
subject to inundation by waters of the 100-year flood. The basis for the
delineation of these zones shall be the Flood Insurance Study prepared by the
Susquehanna River Basin Commission for the federal insurance administra tion
(FIA) dated November 17, 1982.
            (a)   The Floodway Zone (FW) is delineated for purposes of this
Chapter using the criteria that a certain area within the floodplain must be
capable of carrying the waters of the 100-year flood without increasing the
water surface elevation of that flood more than 1 foot at any point. The areas
included in this zone are specifically defined in Table 1 of the above
referenced Flood Insurance Study and shown on the accompanying Flood Boundary
and Floodway Map.
            (b)   The Flood-Fringe Zone (FF) shall be that area of the 100-year
floodplain not included in the Floodway Zone. The basis for the outermost
boundary of this zone shall be the 100-year flood elevations contained in the
flood profiles of the above referenced Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and as shown
on the accompanying Flood Boundary and Floodway Map.
            (c)   The General Floodplain Zone (FA) shall be that floodplain
area for which no detailed flood profiles or elevations have been provided.
Such areas are shown on the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map accompanying the
FIS prepared for the FIA. Where the specific 100-year flood elevation cannot be
determined for this area using other sources of data such as the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, Floodplain Information Reports, U.S. Geological Survey,
Flood Prone Quadrangles, etc., then the applicant for the proposed use,
development and/or activity shall determine this elevation in accordance with
hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others of
demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses,
computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the Borough.
      B.   Overlay Concept. The aforementioned floodplain zone shall be an
overlay to the existing underlying zones as shown on the Official Zoning Map,
and as such, the provisions for the floodplain zone shall serve as a supplement
to the underlying zone provisions. Where there happens to be any conflict
between the provisions or requirements of the floodplain zones and those of any
underlying zone, the more restrictive provisions and/or those pertaining to the
floodplain zones shall apply. In the event any provision concerning a
floodplain zone is declared inapplicable as a result of any legislative or
administrative actions of judicial desecration, the basic underlying zone
provisions shall remain applicable.
      C.   Inclusion in Zoning Map. The boundaries of the floodplain zones are
established as shown on the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, dated November 17,
1982, prepared by the Susquehanna River Basin Commission for the Federal
Insurance Administration. The said map is hereby incorporated into and made a
part of the Official Zoning Map of Lewisberry Borough. A copy of said map shall
be kept on file at the Borough office and be available for inspection during
regular office hours.
      D.   Zone Boundary Changes. The delineation of any of the floodplain
zones may be revised by Borough Council where natural or man-made changes have
occurred and/or more detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, or other qualified agency or individual documents the
advisability for such change. However, prior to any such change, approval must
be obtained from the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) or its successor
agency.
      E.   Interpretation of Zone Boundaries. Initial interpretations of the
boundaries of the floodplain zones shall be made by the Zoning Officer. Should
a dispute arise concerning the boundaries of the zone, the person questioning
or contesting the location of the zone boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to present his case to the Borough Zoning Hearing Board and to
submit his own technical evidence if he so desires. Should the person choose to
seek a variance to the zoning regulations to accommodate his development, he
must follow the procedures to present his case to the Zoning Hearing Board.
Should the person choose to have the zone boundary changed to reflect more
accurate flooding data, he must follow the procedures to present his case to
Borough Council for a zoning amendment.
   4.   Zone Provisions. All uses, activities, land filling and development
occurring within any Floodplain Zone shall be undertaken only in strict
compliance with the provisions of this Chapter, the Floodplain Management
