FOREWORD
History
   This comprises the codification of the ordinances of the Township of
Clifton. The Township of Clifton was originally settled in 1815. The Township
of Clifton was formed from Covington, December 14, 1875. Jacob Gress, the first
settler, located here in 1840. He opened the first tavern in the log-house in
the most primitive style. He was a brave hunter, and was the proud owner of 73
bear skins. He also killed over 700 deer and a large number of panthers and
wolves, and much small game. The first store was built in 1863 or 1864 by
Herbine, Baum & Co., at Clifton. The population was 282 in 1880; 172 in 1890;
200 in 1900; 203 in 1910.
   The Code of Ordinances of the Township of Clifton was prepared by Keystate
Publishers, Inc., and adopted by the Township of Clifton Board of Supervisors
on November 13, 2008, by Ord. 3-2008.
Organization
   The Code contains four parts which are (1) the valid current ordinances of
the Township of Clifton contained in Chapters 1 through 27, (2) the Appendix,
which lists by abstracted title all ordinances of a temporary or "one time"
nature, (3) the Key to the disposition of each ordinance ever enacted by the
Township of Clifton, and (4) the Index, which is an alphabetical arrangement of
subjects.
   In the Code each Chapter is separated by a divider tab, and specific
ordinances can be located by subject on the contents page at the beginning of
each Chapter. The Index may also be used to search for a subject when one is
looking for general information on a particular subject, or if it is not known
in which Chapter the subject might be found. The Appendix consists of several
general categories containing a chronological listing of short subject
descriptions along with a reference to the original ordinance and its date of
enactment, if known.
   The Key to disposition indicates what action has been taken by the Township
of Clifton Board of Supervisors with regard to every ordinance ever enacted. An
ordinance has either been (1) specifically repealed, (2) superseded by another
ordinance, (3) is located in a Chapter of the Code book, or (4) is located in
the Appendix. Annual tax rate and budget ordinances are located only in the
Key. The Key is a cross reference to the original ordinance books of the
Township of Clifton, and to the location within the Code of each ordinance by
number.

and regulations and not as a new enactment. The provisions of this Code shall
not affect any suit or prosecution pending or to be instituted to enforce any
of the prior ordinances or regulations. Except as specifically stated in this
Code or in the ordinance adopting this consolidation, codification and revision
of the ordinances and regulations of the Township of Clifton, it is the
intention of the Board of Supervisors that no ordinance or regulation of the
Township be amended, revised or repealed by implication.
   4.   Resolutions. The provisions of this Code of Ordinances may contain
resolutions, that is, actions of the Board of Supervisors of the Township of
Clifton (in written form and designated "resolution”) which did not require
prior public notice in accordance with the provisions of the Second Class
Township Code, 53 P.S. §65101 et seq., at the time of their passage by the
Board of Supervisors. Such "resolutions” are included herein for ease of
reference and the Board of Supervisors does not intend by their inclusion
herein to require prior public notice before amending, revising or repealing
such resolution or resolutions as may have been included herein in the future.
It is the intention of the Board of Supervisors that such actions of the Board
of Supervisors that may be included in this Code and specifically cited and
designated as a resolution shall not become an ordinance (requiring prior
public notice before amendment, revision or repeal) by the simple fact of
inclusion in this Code.
(Ord. 3-2008, 11/13/2008)
§ 1-107.   Normal Numbering.
   1.   Chapters. Chapters are numbered sequentially in Arabic throughout this
Code.
   2.   Parts. Parts are numbered sequentially in Arabic throughout this Code.
   3.   Whenever other divisions are necessary, Chapters shall be divided into
Subchapters, Parts into Subparts and designated with the Chapter or Part number
followed by a capital letter. For instance, Chapter 1 may be divided into
Subchapters 1A and 1B.
   4.   Sections. Sections are numbered sequentially throughout a Chapter and a
Part such that the first number or numbers is the Chapter number, followed by a
hyphen, followed by the Part number, followed by the Section number within the
Part. For example, "§ 1-101" designates Chapter 1, Part 1, Section 1.
Similarly, “§ 27-305" designates Chapter 27, Part 3, Section 5.
   5.   Internal Divisions of Sections. Whenever internal divisions are
necessary, Sections shall be divided into Subsections, Subsections into
Paragraphs, Paragraphs into Subparagraphs, Subparagraphs into Clauses, and
Clauses into Subclauses, and Subclauses into Items, designated as follows:
   1.   Subsection.
      A.   Paragraph.
         (1)   Subparagraph.
            (a)   Clause.
               1)   Subclause.

§ 1-108.   Special Numbering Problems.
   1.   Addition of New Units Between Existing Units. If it becomes necessary
to introduce a new Chapter, Part or Section between existing Chapters, Parts or
Sections, the new Chapter, Part or Section shall be designated by the addition
of a capital letter suffix to the preceding Chapter, Part or Section number.
Thus, a Chapter introduced between Chapters 5 and 6 would be Chapter 5A and
Sections in that Chapter would be numbered, for instance, “§5A-101.” If it
becomes necessary to introduce a Part between existing Parts 5 and 6 the new
Part would be Part 5A and Sections in that Part would be numbered, for
instance, “§ 5-5A01.” A new Section introduced between existing Sections 5 and
6 would be “§ 5-105A.” When a number of new Parts or Sections have been
introduced the Chapter or Part shall be renumbered.
   2.   If it becomes necessary to introduce a Subsection between Subsections,
for instance, Subsections .5 and .6, the new Subsection would be numbered
Subsection .5-A.
   3.   If it becomes necessary to introduce a unit smaller than a Subsection
between existing unites, the entire Subsection shall be revised and renumbered.
   4.   Vacated Numbers. Whenever a number is vacated by a revocation or
repeal, the remaining elements in the overall unit shall retain their old
numbers until the overall unit is completely revised. Prior to revision, the
vacated number may be marked: “[Reserved].”
(Ord. 3-2008, 11/13/2008)
§ 1-109.   Amending Code.
   1.   All ordinances passed subsequent to the adoption of this Code which
amend, repeal or in any way affect this Code shall be numbered in accordance
with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion herein. In the
case of repealed Chapters, Parts, Sections, Paragraphs, Clauses or other part
or provision hereof, by subsequent ordinance, such repealed portions may be
excluded from this Code by omission from reprinted pages affected thereby. The
subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed, or omitted in the case of
repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such
time as this Code and subsequent ordinances omitted are readopted as a new Code
by the Board of Supervisors.
   2.   Amendment to any provision of this Code shall be made by specific
reference to the Chapter, Part, Section and/or Subsection number of this Code
in the following language:
      A.   Amendment or Revision. "Chapter        , Part        , Section
       , Subsection        , is hereby amended (revised) to read as follows . .
. .” The amended or revised provisions may then be set out in full as desired.
      B.   Addition. "Chapter        , Part        , Section        ,
Subsection        , is hereby amended by the addition of the following . . . .”
The new provision shall then be set out in full as desired.
      C.   Repeal. "Chapter        , Part       , Section        , Subsection
       , is hereby repealed in its entirety.”
   3.   It is the intention of the Board of Supervisors that the numbering
scheme of this Code be adhered to in enacting future ordinances. In the event
that any ordinance or other enactment be adopted which does not conform to the
numbering system of this Code, it is the intention of the Board of Supervisors
that such enactment be renumbered in the process of supplementing, revising or
updating this Code to conform to the numbering scheme of this Code. The Board
of Supervisors hereby acknowledges and confirms that the numbering scheme
herein is for ease of reference and that the renumbering of any enactment when
added to this Code shall not in any manner affect the validity of said
enactment.

   It shall be unlawful for any person to change or amend by addition or
deletion any part or portion of this Code, or to insert or delete pages or
portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner
whatsoever, except by ordinance or resolution or other official act of the
Board of Supervisors.

and costs, to a term of imprisonment not to exceed 90 days. Each day that a
violation of this Part continues or each Section of this Part which shall be

neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the Township may enforce the
judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure, at which time, in
addition to any penalties, the violator shall be liable for any attorney’s fees
and costs incurred by the Township. Each day that a violation continues or each
Section of this Part which shall be found to have been violated shall
constitute a separate violation.
   2.   The imposition of a penalty under the provisions of this Code shall not
prevent the revocation of any permit or license or the taking of other punitive
or remedial action where called for or permitted under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the United States of America. In addition, the
Township may institute injunctive, mandamus or any other appropriate action or
proceeding at law or in equity for the enforcement of this Code. Any court of

existing or proposed streets or highways, the applicant for the permit may
appeal from the decision of the administrative officer having charge of the
issuance of permits to the Zoning Board of Adjustment, and the same provisions

buildings a notice reading substantially as follows:
   "This building has been found to be a dangerous building by the Board of
Supervisors of the Township of Clifton. This notice is to remain on this
building until it is repaired, vacated or demolished in accordance with the
notice which has been given to the owner, occupant, lessee, mortgagee or agent

Statutory Authorization
§ 8-101.   Statutory Authorization.
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage of
the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978, delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Supervisors of the Township of Clifton does
hereby order as follows.
(Ord. 1-2020, -/-/2020)
Part 2
General Provisions
§ 8-201.   Intent.
   The intent of this Chapter is to:
   1.   Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
   2.   Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in
order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
   3.   Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and natural
drainage.
   4.   Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units, and its residents, by preventing excessive development in areas subject
to flooding.
   5.   Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
(Ord. 1-2020, -/-/2020)
§ 8-202.   Applicability.
   It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or corporation to
undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or development anywhere
within the Township of Clifton unless a permit has been obtained from the
Floodplain Administrator.
(Ord. 1-2020, -/-/2020)
§ 8-203.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.
   This Chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in
effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance provisions
shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those provisions are
more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of
this Chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
(Ord. 1-2020, -/-/2020)
§ 8-204.   Severability.
   If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this
Chapter shall be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such a decision
shall not affect the remaining portions of this Chapter, which shall remain in
full force and effect, and for this purpose the provisions of this Chapter are
hereby declared to be severable.
(Ord. 1-2020, -/-/2020)
§ 8-205.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
   1.   The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this Chapter
is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on accepted
engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be
increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings
restricted by debris. This Chapter does not imply that areas outside any
identified floodplain areas, or that land uses permitted within such areas will
be free from flooding or flood damages.
   2.   This Chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Township of
Clifton or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result
from reliance on this Chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
(Ord. 1-2020, -/-/2020)
Part 3
Administration
§ 8-301.   Designation of the Floodplain Administrator.
   1.   The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors is hereby appointed to

community of its responsibilities pursuant to the participation requirements of
the National Flood Insurance Program as set forth in the Code of Federal
Regulations at 44 C.F.R. §59.22.
   2.   In the absence of a designated Floodplain Administrator, the Floodplain
Administrator duties are to be fulfilled by the Vice Chairperson of the Board
of Supervisors.
(Ord. 1-2020, -/-/2020)
§ 8-302.   Permits Required.
   A permit shall be required before any construction or development is

(Ord. 1-2020, -/-/2020)
§ 8-303.   Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator.
   1.   The Floodplain Administrator shall issue a permit only after it has
been determined that the proposed work to be undertaken will be in conformance
with the requirements of this Chapter and all other applicable codes and
ordinances.
   2.   Prior to the issuance of any permit, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review the application for the permit to determine if all other necessary
government permits required by state and federal laws have been obtained, such
as those required by the Pennsylvania Sewage Facilities Act (Act 1966-537, as
amended); the Pennsylvania Dam Safety and Encroachments Act (Act 1978-325, as
amended); the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Act (Act 1937-394, as amended); and
the U.S. Clean Water Act, Section 404, 33, U.S.C. 1344. No permit shall be
issued until this determination has been made.
   3.   In the case of existing structures, prior to the issuance of any
development/permit, the Floodplain Administrator shall review the proposed cost
of improvements or repairs and the pre-improvement market value of the
structure, so that a substantial improvement/substantial damage determination
can be made, in accordance with FEMA’s Substantial Improvement/Substantial
Damage Desk Reference.
   4.   During the construction period, the Floodplain Administrator or other
authorized official shall inspect the premises to determine that the work is
progressing in compliance with the information provided on the permit
application and with all applicable municipal laws and ordinances. He/she shall
make as many inspections during and upon completion of the work as are
necessary.
   5.   In the discharge of his/her duties, the Floodplain Administrator shall
have the authority to enter any building, structure, premises or development in
the identified floodplain area, upon presentation of proper credentials, at any
reasonable hour to enforce the provisions of this Chapter.
   6.   In the event the Floodplain Administrator discovers that the work does
not comply with the permit application or any applicable laws and ordinances,
or that there has been a false statement or misrepresentation by any applicant,
the Floodplain Administrator shall revoke the permit and report such fact to
the Board of Supervisors for whatever action it considers necessary.
   7.   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain in perpetuity, or for the
lifetime of the structure, all records associated with the requirements of this
ordinance including, but not limited to, finished construction elevation data,
permitting, inspection and enforcement.

a biennial report to FEMA concerning community participation in the National
Flood Insurance Program as requested.

the Floodplain Administrator can be delegated from the person identified.
However, the ultimate responsibility lies with the person identified in the
floodplain ordinance as the Floodplain Administrator/Manager.

(Ord. 1-2020, -/-/2020)
§ 8-309.   Start of Construction.
   1.   Work on the proposed construction or development shall begin within 180
days after the date of issuance of the development permit. Work shall also be
completed within 12 months after the date of issuance of the permit or the
permit shall expire unless a time extension is granted, in writing, by the
Floodplain Administrator. The issuance of development permit does not refer to
the zoning approval.
   2.   The actual start of construction means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first,
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   3.   Time extensions shall be granted only if a written request is submitted
by the applicant, who sets forth sufficient and reasonable cause for the
Floodplain Administrator to approve such a request and the original permit is
compliant with this Chapter and FIRM/FIS in effect at the time the extension is
granted.
(Ord. 1-2020, -/-/2020)
§ 8-310.   Enforcement.

(Ord. 1-2020, -/-/2020)
§ 8-402.   Description and Special Requirements of Identified Floodplain Areas.
   The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific
areas:
   1.   The floodway area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without increasing the water surface elevation by more than 1 foot at any
point. This term shall also include floodway areas which have been identified
in other available studies or sources of information for those special flood
hazard areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
      A.   Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted
unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed
encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      B.   Within any floodway area, no new construction or development shall
be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the Department of
Environmental Protection Regional Office.
   2.   The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations
have been provided.
      A.   The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas identified

zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided but no floodway has been determined.
         (1)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development shall be permitted in an AE Zone without
floodway, unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed development, together with all other existing and anticipated
development, would not result in an increase in flood levels of more than 1
foot within the entire community during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge.
         (2)   No new construction or development shall be located within the
area measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse, unless
the appropriate permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection Regional Office.
   3.   A.   The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone
on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base flood
elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and floodway
information from other Federal, State, or other acceptable sources shall be
used when available. Where other acceptable information is not available, the
base flood elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on
the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site.
      B.   In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional
engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the
technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.

the FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, or AH.
   Start of construction - includes substantial improvement and other proposed
new development and means the date the permit was issued, provided the actual
start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days after the date of the

grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,

devisees, transfer of ownership or building or lot development. Provided,
however, that the subdivision by lease of land for agricultural purposes into
parcels of more than 10 acres, not involving any new street or easement of
access or any residential dwelling, shall be exempted.
   Substantial damage - damage from any cause sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50 percent or more of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
   Substantial improvement - any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, of which the cost equals or exceeds 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction"
of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred
"substantial damage” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to
correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
   Uniform Construction Code (UCC) - the statewide building code adopted by the
Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1999 applicable to new construction in all
municipalities whether administered by the municipality, a third party or the
Department of Labor and Industry. Applicable to residential and commercial
buildings, it is the Code adopted, as well as the International Residential
Code (IRC) and the International Building Code (IBC), by reference, as the
construction standard applicable with the State floodplain construction. For
coordination purposes, references to the above are made specifically to various
sections of the IRC and the IBC.
   Variance - a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain
management regulation.
   Violation - the failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR §60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)
(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until
such time as that documentation is provided.

Adult Businesses
A.   Adult Business Regulations
§ 13-101.   Title.
   This Part shall be known and may be cited as the “Clifton Township Adult
Business Regulation Ordinance.”
(Ord. 1-2000, 6/10/2000, §1)
§ 13-102.   Purpose, Findings, and Intent.
   1.   Purpose.
      A.   Pursuant to the authority granted in the Second Class Township Code,
53 P.S. §65101 et seq., to prohibit nuisances; to promote the health,
cleanliness, comfort, and safety of the citizens of the Township; and to
regulate the time of opening and closing, and the conduct of places of public
entertainment, amusement, and recreation, the Township of Clifton enacts this
Part to minimize and control the adverse effects of adult businesses and
thereby protect the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens; protect the
citizens from increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the
property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods; and deter the
spread of blight.
      B.   The Board of Supervisors has determined that location criteria alone
do not adequately protect the health, safety, and general welfare fo the people
of the Township, and that licensing is a legitimate and reasonable means of
accountabil ity to insure that operators of adult businesses comply with
reasonable regulations and to insure that operators do not knowingly allow
their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or
solicitation.
      C.   The Board of Supervisors does not intend this Part to suppress any
speech activities protected by the First Amendment, but to enact a content
neutral ordinance which addresses the secondary effects of adult businesses.
   2.   Findings. The Board of Supervisors finds:
      A.   In adopting these standards which apply to adult businesses, the
Township Board of Supervisors has made the following findings in regard to the
secondary effects on the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the
Township. The findings are based on evidence concerning the welfare of the
citizens of the Township. The findings are based on evidence concerning the
adverse secondary effects of adult businesses on the community presented in
hearings and in reports made available to the Board of Supervisors, and on
findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters,
Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theaters, 427 U.S. 50 (1976),
and Northend Cinema, Inc., v. Seattle, 585 P. 2d 1153 (Wash. 1978), and on
studies in other communities including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona;
Minneapolis, Minnesota; Saint Paul, Minnesota; Manatee County, Florida; Houston
Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Los Angeles, California; Austin,
Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Beaumont, Texas; and New
York City, New York; and also on findings found in the Report of the Attorney
General’s Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses, June
6, 1989, State of Minnesota.
         (1)   The concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate
health concern of the Township which demands regulation of adult businesses and
adult uses in order to protect the health and well-being of the citizens.
         (2)   Certain employees of adult business regulated by this Part as
adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidents of certain types of
sexually oriented behavior at these businesses than employees of other
establishments.
         (3)   Sexual acts occur at adult businesses, especially those which
provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos,
or live sex shows, as regulated by this Part as adult book stores, adult
novelty shops, adult video stores, adult motion picture theaters, or adult
arcades.
         (4)   Offering and providing such space encourages such activities,
which create unhealthy conditions.
         (5)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and
other adult businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises
of such adult businesses.
         (6)   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in adult businesses, including, but not limited to, syphilis,
gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (AIDS), genital herpes,
hepatitis B, non B amebiasis, salmonella infections, and shigella infections;
and, the incidence of many of these diseases is on the increase.
         (7)   Sanitary conditions in some adult businesses are unhealthy, in
part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part,
because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the
owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities
and maintain those facilities.
         (8)   There is convincing documented evidence that adult businesses,
because of their very nature, have a deleterious effect on both the existing
businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them,
causing increased crime, the downgrading or property values, and the decline of
the overall character of the community. A number of municipal studies,
including the 1986 Austin, Texas study, have demonstrated this.
         (9)   It is generally recognized that adult businesses, due to their
nature, have serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly
when they are located inclose proximity to each other, thereby contributing to
neighbor hood blight and downgrading the quality of life in the adjacent area.
A number of municipal studies, including the 1986 Austin, Texas study, have
demon strated this.
         (10)   The Township desires to minimize and control these adverse
secondary effects and thereby protect the health, safety, and welfare of the
citizenry, protect the citizens from increased crime; preserve the quality of
life, preserve property values and the character of the surrounding community.
      B.   The findings noted in paragraph .A above raise substantial
governmental concerns.
      C.   Adult businesses have operational characteristics which should be
reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental
concerns.
      D.   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators
of the adult businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a
heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the adult
business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of
its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the Township. It is
appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual
operator of the adult business, fully in possession and control of the premises
and activities occurring therein.
      E.   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting
on premises with viewing booths advances a substantial governmental interest in
curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters.
      F.   Requiring of adult businesses to keep information regarding current
employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain
types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential
witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such
establishments.
      G.   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the adult business,
where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental
interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of
sexually transmitted diseases.
      H.   It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees
who may engage in the conduct which this Part is designed to prevent or who are
likely to be witnesses to such activity.
      I.   The fact that an applicant for an adult business license has been
convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the
applicant is likely to engage in that conduct in contravention of this Part.
      J.   The barring of such individuals from the management of adult
businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct
which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
      K.   The general welfare, health, and safety of the citizens of the
Township will be promoted by the enactment of this Part.
      L.   Limitation of operating hours of adult businesses to certain hours
on Mondays through Saturdays, and closure of such businesses on Sundays and
holidays reduces the adverse secondary effects of such businesses, including
particularly, but not limited to late night noise levels, crime, and sexually
offensive materials and activities in public areas, and promotes the public
health, safety, and welfare.
   3.   Intent. It is the intent of this Part to:
      A.   Regulate adult business in order to promote the public health,
safety, and welfare by minimizing the secondary effects on the community which
are associated with such businesses, and which include difficulties for law
enforcement, trash disposal, deleterious effects on business and residential
property values, increased crime (particularly the corruption of morals of
minors and prostitution), and drive residents and businesses to move elsewhere.
      B.   Establish, content neutral standards applicable to such uses.
      C.   Have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually
oriented or adult materials.
      D.   Not totally restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented
materials or adult materials protected by the First Amendment of the Bill of
Rights of the U. S. Constitution.
      E.   Not deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually
oriented entertainment to their intended market.
      F.   Not condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material, or
to encourage any violation of the Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S.A. §101 et seq., or
Obscenity Code.

subject to annual renewal upon the written application of the applicant and a
finding by the Township that the applicant has not been convicted of any
specified criminal activity as defined in this Part or committed any act during
the existence of the previous license, which would be grounds to deny the
initial license application. The renewal of the license shall be subject to the
payment of the fee as set forth in §

operation and maintenance of the tanks to prevent a nuisance or a public health
hazard as authorized by §71.63 of DEP Rules and Regulations.
(Ord. 1-2015, 5/14/2015)
Malfunctions and Repairs
§ 18-117.   All Systems.
   The following requirements shall apply to all sewage disposal facilities:
   1.   Prohibition of Sewage Discharge. No sewage system shall discharge
untreated or partially treated sewage to the surface of the ground or into the
waters of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, except as specifically approved by
DEP pursuant to the Clean Streams Law, 35 P.S. §691.901, et seq., as amended.
Any unauthorized discharge shall constitute a malfunctioning sewage disposal
system, and shall be a violation of this Part and the Township Wastewater
Facilities Plan.
   2.   Containment/Termination and Correction. When so ordered by the SEO, the
owner or operator of a malfunctioning sewage disposal system shall contain or
otherwise terminate said malfunction within ten (10) days, and shall correct
such malfunction within the time specified by the SEO based on the nature of
the required repair and the time of year by taking measures which will achieve
compliance with DEP Rules and Regulations, including if necessary the
reconstruction, upgrading or replacement of the system. Failure to contain the
malfunction within ten (10) days or complete repairs within the time periods
specified in the SEO's initial order shall constitute a violation of this Part
unless the Board of Supervisors grant an extension of time for same based on
good cause as demonstrated by the owner of the system.
   3.   Fees. Fees for work by the SEO in connection with malfunctions shall be
established by Resolution of the Township Board of Supervisors.
(Ord. 1-2015, 5/14/2015)
§ 18-118.   On-Site and Community Systems.
   The following requirements shall apply to on-site and community sewage
disposal facilities:
   1.   Malfunction Identification. A malfunctioning sewage disposal system may
be evidenced by discharge of effluent to the surface of the ground,
bacteriological samples or dye tests which confirm pollution of wells or
streams, or the back-up of sewage into house sewers. The Township SEO shall,
subject to the requirements and authority of the Sewage Facilities Act, the
Second Class Township Code, in response to a written complaint by an affected
person, or with other evidence of nuisance to the public health, inspect any
property, determine the existence of a malfunction and order remedial action.
   2.   Remedial Action Required. In the event of any of the foregoing, the
property owner shall prepare and submit a plot plan showing a layout of the lot
and all surface features which may have caused or contributed to the
malfunction including isolation distances to wells, streams, and the like. Soil
survey information shall also be noted and analyzed. Before ordering other
corrective action the SEO may require the cleaning of the septic tank to
ascertain whether the problem stems from a lack of maintenance. Regular
periodic pumping may also be ordered.
   3.   SEO Inspections. Upon the property owner's completion of the required
measures to correct the malfunction, the SEO shall make such inspections as may
be necessary to determine compliance with this Part and specify a schedule for
periodic follow-up inspections to determine whether the corrective action has
corrected the problem.
   4.   Unsuitable Site Conditions. Where Chapter 73 of DEP Rules and
Regulations cannot be met in the reconstruction of a malfunctioning sewage
disposal system due to inadequate land area, poor soils or other site
characteristics, the SEO may order the use of water conservation devices,
aerobic treatment tanks, septic tank modifications, retaining tanks, or other
measures to reduce the effluent flow or otherwise control effluent
characteristics and thereby reduce the hydraulic and/or organic loadings on the
system.
   5.   High-Risk Areas. The Board of Supervisors may also, upon evidence of
more than one (1) malfunction in a particular area as defined by the boundaries
of a particular soil type, order the inspection of all sewage disposal systems
in that area, and/or require regular periodic inspections for purposes of
identifying and correcting malfunctions in high-risk areas. Additional criteria
for defining the extent of high-risk areas may be established by action of the
Township Board of Supervisors.

   2.   Purpose. The purpose of this Chapter is to:
      A.   Require permits for access to the right-of-way of Township roads or
to the area of any Township facilities within any state road right-of-way for
railways, driveways, private roads, electricity, telephone and cable television
poles and conduits, utilities (such as gas, water and sewer lines), and similar
encroachments and obstructions, and any other structures; it being in the
public interest to regulate:
         (1)   The location and construction of utility facilities and other
such structures within the Township's right-of-way or the area of any Township
facilities within any state road right-of-way, and
         (2)   The location, design, construction, maintenance and drainage of
access driveways and private streets within any Township right-of-way and the
area of any Township facilities within any state road right-of-way, to ensure
the structural integrity of streets and other facilities, economy of
maintenance, preservation of proper drainage, and safe and convenient passage
of traffic.
      B.   Authorize the Township to remove from any Township road right-of-way
or any area of any Township facilities within any state road right-of-way any
grass, brush, shrub, tree or other vegetation deemed to constitute a hazardous
or dangerous condition to the use of the road or those which impair the use or
maintenance of the road or any other facilities.
      C.   Authorize the Township to require the removal of any nuisance or
obstruction on any Township road right-of-way or associated drainage facility
and any area of township facilities within any state road right-of-way created
by felling trees, making fences, excavating the road or facility area,
diverting water, filling or in any other manner.
      D.   Authorize the Township to recover all enforcement, nuisance,
obstruction removal or repair costs in any court of the Commonwealth,
including, but not limited to, the use of equitable or injunctive relief and
filing of a municipal lien.

(Ord. 1-2016, 5/12/2016)
§ 21-106.   Conditions of Permit; Standards.
   1.   Permit Review and Action.
      A.   Review. Once a permit application, together with the prescribed fee
and all required accompanying plans, is submitted, the application and plans
shall be reviewed by the Township Engineer for compliance with the requirements
of this Chapter.
      B.   Issuance. If the plans meet all such requirements, the Township
shall issue the permit.
      C.   Deficiencies; Required Changes. If the plans are found to be
deficient, or, if in the opinion of the Township, the plan could be improved to
better satisfy Ordinance requirements, then the Township shall notify the
permit applicant, in writing, of the changes to be made, whereupon the
applicant shall make such changes and return the revised plans to the Township.
When the plans are found to be acceptable, the Township shall issue the permit
in accord with the acceptable plans.
   2.   Drainage Control. No increase in the flow of water into drainage
facilities or onto the right-of-way or onto the property of some other person
is permitted without a drainage control plan designed to minimize and safely
divert such flows. Such plan shall be submitted by the applicant, and if
required by the Township, the plan shall be prepared by a Professional Engineer
Registered in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Drainage plans shall comply
with all other ordinances of the Township which regulate drainage and storm
water. No permit shall be issued until the Township determines that the
drainage control plan is adequate and the Township may consult with the
Township Engineer prior to making the determination.
   3.   Public Safety; Traffic Control. All work shall be done in such a manner
as is consistent with the safety of the public. Where traffic control is
necessary, it shall be accomplished according to the relevant standards of the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation where applicable, and otherwise such
safety measures as required to provide the safe movement of traffic through the
work site.
   4.   Permittee Responsibility. The permittee shall be responsible for any
facility failure for a period of two (2) years of completion provided the
failure can be attributed to the restoration work performed by the permittee.
In such case, the permittee shall restore all pavement, shoulders, drainage and
other facilities to their required condition at the expense of the permittee in
accord with §
21-107.2. If the permittee fails to comply with this requirement, the Township
shall complete the necessary repairs and collect the costs as per §
21-107.
   5.   Driveways. Driveways shall comply with the following unless the
subdivision and land development ordinance, where applicable, requires a higher
standard.
      A.   All driveways shall contain a straight length of at least twenty-
five (25) feet, measured from the edge of the intersecting road and extending
into the lot being served. The full length of such 25-foot segment shall be
paved with a base of Pennsylvania 3A stone compacted to four inches and a
surface of a minimum of one and one-half (1.5) inches ID-2A bituminous, or
equal as determined by the Township.
      B.   The first twenty-five (25) feet (closest to the intersecting road)
of any driveway shall have a grade of five (5) percent or less.
      C.   A minimum of one parking space, within the first twenty-five (25)
feet, but off the paved cartway, shall be provided where the grade of the
driveway at any point exceeds ten (10) percent.
      D.   Driveways to single-family residences shall intersect roads at
angles of not less than sixty (60) degrees. All other driveways shall intersect
roads at right angles, where practical, and in no case less than seventy-five
(75) degrees.
      E.   The width of a driveway serving a single-family residence within the
legal right- of-way of the intersecting road, and at any point at which it is
carried by a bridge, shall be a minimum of twelve (12) feet. The minimum width
of such a driveway shall be ten (10) feet at all other points within the parcel
of land being served. Where the Township determines it feasible, a shared road
access for a driveway serving more than one (1) parcel will be permissible. A
shared driveway must continue as a shared driveway for a linear distance of at
least twenty-five (25) feet measured from the nearest edge of the intersecting
road cartway. Additional length of a shared driveway may be required and
approved by the Township. Such additional length shall not be permitted,
however, without the express approval of the Township.
      F.   Driveway entrances into all non-residential single use properties
shall be not less than twenty (20) feet in width, and shall not exceed thirty-
six (36) feet in width at the point of intersection with the road.
      G.   The edge of any driveway shall be at least forty (40) feet distant
from the nearest edge of the paved radius of any intersection of two roads.
      H.   The curbs of nonresidential driveway entrances shall be rounded with
a minimum radius of twenty (20) feet where they intersect the road cartway.
      I.   Clear site triangles shall be provided at all driveway entrances and
shall be shown on the plans. Within such triangles, no object greater than two-
and one-half (2.5) feet in height, nor any other object which will obscure the
vision of the motorist, shall be permitted. The legs of such clear site
triangles shall be at least one hundred (100) feet in either direction,
measured from a point twelve (12) feet back from the edge of the cartway of the
intersecting road. Greater distances may be required in specific circumstances
as determined by the Township, and in driveways intersecting roads classified
as collector or arterial by the Township. Wherever a portion of the line of
such a clear site triangle occurs within any proposed building setback line,
such portion shall be shown on the final plan of the subdivision or land
development plan and shall be considered a building setback line.
      J.   Site distances for nonresidential driveways shall comply with the
PennDOT standards for nonresidential driveway access to streets.
      K.   The gutter line, where possible, shall be maintained as a paved
gutter. It shall have a maximum depth of four (4) inches and a minimum width of
twenty-four (24) inches. A pipe may be placed under the driveway entrances only
when approved by the Township. Approval of use of a pipe will be determined by
the gutter depth on each side of the driveway entrance. Where permitted, the
minimum pipe size shall be determined by the Township.
      L.   Driveways shall be graded so as to assure that surface water
drainage will be discharged to the owner's property. In cases where such is not
feasible, sized pipes, inlets, and/or headwalls shall be installed and gutter
improvements shall be made to direct surface water drainage into the road
drainage system, and not onto the cartway of the intersecting road.
   6.   Depth of Pipes and Culverts, and Backfilling of Trench.
      A.   Temporary and permanent depth of pipes and culverts, and backfilling
of trenches, shall comply with this Chapter and any other standards or
amendment of standards established by Resolution of the Board of Supervisors.
      B.   The minimum cover over any pipe or culvert under the subgrade
elevation shall be twelve (12) inches.
      C.   Trenches shall be backfilled with No.2A coarse aggregate to a height
of not less than twelve (12) inches above the top of any pipe or culvert. The
remaining height shall be backfilled with suitable material. All backfill
material shall be placed in four (4)-inch layers with compaction by approved
vibratory compaction equipment. Each layer for its full width shall be
compacted to not less than ninety-seven (97) percent of the determined dry
weight density.
      D.   The placement of utilities underground shall be identified on the
ground surface with permanent markers as required by the Township or in accord
with the standard practice of the governing utility provider.
   7.   Work Schedule. All work involving cuts into the traveled portion of the
road must be started within ninety (90) days of permit issuance. All such work
must be completed within thirty (30) days of work commencement. Temporary
repairs to any and all pavement and shoulder cuts shall be made immediately
after completion of the work designated in the permit. Permanent repairs to any
and all pavement cuts shall be made within sixty (60) days of completion of the
work designated in the permit. Permanent repairs to any and all shoulder cuts
shall be made within thirty (30) days of completion of the work designated in
the permit.
   8.   Prohibited Structures. No permit shall be issued for the construction,
erection or placement in any road, whether such road is defined by right-of-way
or such road is owned in fee simple title by the Township or the area of any
Township facilities within any state road right-of-way, of any building, fence,
or sign, or other structure the Township finds to constitute a hazardous or
dangerous condition to the use of the road or those which impair the use or
maintenance of the road.
   9.   Indemnification. The permittee shall fully indemnify and save harmless
and defend the Township, its agents and employees, of and from all liability
for damages or injury occurring to any person or persons or property through or
in consequence of any act or omission of any contractor, agent, servant,
employee or person engaged or employed in, about, or upon the work, by, at the
instance, or with the approval or consent of the permittee; from any failure of
the permittee or any such person to comply with the permit or this Chapter;
and, for a period of two (2) years after completion of the permitted work, from
the failure of the highway in the immediate area of the work performed under
the permit where there is no similar failure of the highway beyond the area
adjacent to the area of the permitted work.
   10.   Permit Validity. Permits are valid for a period of six (6) months.
   11.   Installation and Costs. For new construction, the applicant shall
install and pay the costs of any and all drainage pipes and other required
improvements.
(Ord. 1-2016, 5/12/2016)
§ 21-107.   Work Completion; Inspection.
   1.   Notice. Upon completion of the work authorized by permit, the permittee
shall give written notice thereof to the Township.
   2.   Inspection. The Township shall cause the work to be inspected and when
necessary, enforce compliance with conditions prescribed by the permit and this
Chapter employing, where necessary, professional expertise at the applicant's
expense for said purpose. The Township may reinspect the work authorized by the
permit within two (2) years after its completion (see §
21-106.4), and if any settlement of the road surface or other defect shall
appear in the work, contrary to the conditions, restrictions and regulations of
the Township, the Township may enforce compliance therewith. If the permittee
fails to rectify any defect which presents an immediate or imminent safety or
health problem within forty-eight (48) hours or any other defect within sixty
(60) days of written notice from the Township to do so, the Township may cause
the work to be performed and impose upon the applicant the cost thereof
together with an additional twenty (20) percent of such cost to offset
administrative costs.
   3.   Costs. Any costs to the Township associated with completion of work not
performed by the permittee, and the interest charge assessed, shall be
recoverable by the Township in any manner available in law.
(Ord. 1-2016, 5/12/2016)
§ 21-108.   Maintenance.
   The maintenance and repair of all work authorized by a permit shall remain
the responsibility of the permittee. However, any drainage pipe or other
required improvements installed in the Township right-of-way shall become a
part of the Township infrastructure and shall thereafter be maintained by the
Township, provided such pipe and other improvements have been permitted,
inspected and approved under the terms of this Chapter.
(Ord. 1-2016, 5/12/2016)
§ 21-109.   Vegetation and Refuse.
   1.   Shrubs and Trees. The Township is hereby authorized to remove from any
Township road right-of-way or the area of any Township facilities within any
state road right-of-way any grass, brush, shrub, tree or other vegetation
deemed to constitute a hazardous or dangerous condition to the use of the road
or those which impair the use or maintenance of the road. No tree having a
trunk diameter in excess of six (6) inches shall be removed without notice of
the proposed removal having first been given to the abutting property owner.
Such notice shall be in a form prescribed by resolution of the Board of
Supervisors.
   2.   Wood. All logs, cordwood, branch wood or other forms of wood derived
from the destruction or removal of any trees growing along any road shall be
surrendered to and remain the property of the abutting property owners.
   3.   Brush and Refuse. The Township may clear out brush and other refuse
along the sides of any road to the width of the right-of-way. All clearing and
removal of brush and refuse shall be confined to growth that is within the
right-of-way and to the removal of branches that in any way interfere with
public travel.
   4.   Dangerous Conditions. Nothing in this §
21-109 shall prevent the Township from removing roadside trees which may be
thrown down by wind or lodged in a position as to become a nuisance to public
travel or which, by reason of any other cause, may become a source of danger to
the public.
(Ord. 1-2016, 5/12/2016)
§ 21-110.   Obstructions and Nuisances.
   1.   General Restriction. No person shall obstruct any road or commit any
nuisance thereon by felling trees, making fences, excavating the road,
diverting water or placing snow onto the road, filling, or in any other manner.
Any such person who does not, upon notice by the Township, immediately remove
the nuisance obstruction and repair the damages done to the road is in
violation of this Chapter.
   2.   Vehicles and Equipment. No person shall park, store or abandon any
vehicle, equipment or other material within any Township road right-of-way and
any such parking, storage or abandonment is hereby declared a public nuisance.
Any such person who does not, upon notice by the Township, immediately remove
the nuisance obstruction is in violation of this Chapter.
   3.   Mailboxes. Nothing in this Chapter shall prohibit the placement of
mailboxes in any Township road right-of-way in accord with the following
provisions:
      A.   A permit shall not be required.
      B.   The mailbox and/or its support shall not create a public safety
hazard or public nuisance, and the Township shall have the authority to require
the relocation or redesign of the mailbox and/or support to minimize hazards
and nuisances.
      C.   The Township shall not be responsible for any damage to or created
by any mailbox and/or support.
(Ord. 1-2016, 5/12/2016)
§ 21-111.   Drains and Ditches.
   1.   Maintenance. The Township is hereby authorized to enter any lands or
enclosures and cut, open, maintain and repair drains or ditches through the
property when necessary to carry the water from the roads.
   2.   Damage. Any person who damages, diverts or fills any drain or ditch
without the authority of the Board of Supervisors is in violation of this
Chapter and is liable for the costs of restoring the drain or ditch.
(Ord. 1-2016, 5/12/2016)
§ 21-112.   Violations and Penalties.
   1.   Fine. Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated
or permitted the violation of any of the provisions of this Chapter shall, upon
being found liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the
Township, pay a judgment of not more than six hundred dollars ($600) plus all
court costs, including reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Township as a
result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or be payable
until the date of the determination of a violation by the Magisterial District
Judge. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the
Township may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil
procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate
violation. All judgments, costs and reasonable attorney fees collected for the
violation of this Chapter shall be paid over to the Township.
   2.   Court of Common Pleas. The court of common pleas, upon petition, may
grant an order of stay, upon cause shown, tolling the per diem fine pending a
final adjudication of the violation and judgment.
   3.   Other Remedies. In addition to any penalty therein provided, any
person, persons, firm, partnership or corporation who or which shall violate
any provision of this Chapter or who refuses to pay the costs of repair or
removal as required by this Chapter is subject to any law or laws, of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which affords a remedy for such violation or
recovery of costs in any court of the Commonwealth, including, but not limited
to, equitable or injunctive relief and filing of a municipal lien.
(Ord. 1-2016, 5/12/2016)
§ 21-113.   Enforcement Officer.
   The Board of Supervisors may appoint one or more Enforcement Officers, who
may be an individual, firm or agency of the Township, to conduct inspections,
make reports and administer other parts of this Chapter as determined by the
Board of Supervisors.
(Ord. 1-2016, 5/12/2016)
§ 21-114.   Notice to Violators; Emergency Cases.
   1.   Notice.
      A.   Service of Notice. Whenever the Board of Supervisors, or the
Enforcement Officer, determines that a violation of this Chapter exists, the
Board, or the Enforcement Officer, shall prepare a written notice to be served
on the owner and/or tenant of the premises on which the violation is located or
originates, or the violator if other than a property owner or tenant. The
written notice shall be served by one or more of the following methods:
         (1)   Personal delivery.
         (2)   Fixing a copy to the door of the building on the premises of the
violation.
         (3)   Certified mail to the last known address of the violator.
         (4)   Publishing in the Township's official newspaper once each week
for two (2) consecutive weeks.
      B.   Content of Notice.
         (1)   The notice shall enumerate the conditions which constitute the
violation and what action is required to abate the violation.
         (2)   The notice shall include a time frame for the abatement of the
violation, with such time frame established by the Board, or the Enforcement
Officer, based upon the nature of the violation and providing a reasonable
period for the owner to take the required action. However, in no case shall the
period for abatement of the violation exceed sixty (60) days from the time
notice is served upon the owner; and, in certain cases, immediate correction
may be required.
   2.   Emergency Cases. (See definition in §
21-102.) Whenever the Enforcement Officer finds that an emergency exists which
requires immediate action to protect the public health, welfare or safety, he
may, without notice or hearing, issue an order reciting the existence of such
an emergency and requiring that such action be taken as is necessary to correct
the violation and eliminate the emergency. Notwithstanding the other provisions
of this Chapter, such order shall be effective immediately. The costs of such
emergency correction shall be collected in the same manner as provided herein
for other cases.
(Ord. 1-2016, 5/12/2016)
§ 21-115.   Waivers and Modifications.
   1.   Intent. The provisions of this Chapter are intended as a minimum
standard for the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. If the
literal compliance with any mandatory provision of these regulations is shown
by the applicant, to the satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors, to be
unreasonable or to cause undue hardship as it applies to a particular property,
or if the applicant shows that an alternative proposal will allow for equal or
better results, the Township may grant a waiver from such mandatory provision,
so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured while
permitting the reasonable utilization of the property. However, the granting of
a waiver/modification shall not have the effect of making null and void the
intent and purpose of this Chapter.
   2.   Conditions. In granting waivers/modifications the Board of Supervisors
may impose such conditions as will, in its judgement, secure substantially the
objectives of the standards and requirements of this Chapter.
   3.   Procedure. All requests for waivers/modifications shall be in writing,
shall accompany and be a part of the development application, and shall
include:
      A.   The specific Section(s) of this Chapter in question.
      B.   Provisions for the minimum modification necessary as an alternate to
the requirements.
      C.   Justification for the waiver/modification including the full grounds
and facts of unreasonableness or hardship.
   4.   Action. If the Board of Supervisors denies the request, the applicant
shall be notified, in writing, of the reasons for denial. If the Township
grants the request, the permit shall include a note which identifies the
waiver/modification as granted. In any case, the Township shall keep a written
record of all actions on all requests for waivers/modifications.
(Ord. 1-2016, 5/12/2016)
§ 21-116.   Severability.
   Should any section, subsection, clause, provision or other portion of this
Chapter be declared invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such
decision shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this Chapter; the
Board of Supervisors having adopted this Chapter as if such invalid portions
had not been included therein.
(Ord. 1-2016, 5/12/2016)
§ 21-117.   Repealer.
   All other existing ordinances or parts thereof inconsistent with this
Chapter are hereby expressly repealed to the extent necessary to give this
Chapter full force and effect.
(Ord. 1-2016, 5/12/2016)
§ 21-118.   Conflicts.
   Should any provision of this Chapter be in conflict with any other section,
provision, regulation or standard of any other Township ordinance, the more
restrictive shall apply.
(Ord. 1-2016, 5/12/2016)
§ 21-119.   Effective Date.
   This Chapter shall become effective five (5) days after its adoption.

(Ord. 1-1982, 10/9/1982, §302; as amended by Ord. 1-1991, 2/9/1991, §3; and by
Ord. 3- 2008, 11/13/2008)
§ 22-303.   Procedure for Installation or Guarantee of Required Improve ments.
   1.   Improvements to Be Provided by Applicant.
      A.   In all cases the subdivider or land developer shall be responsible
for the installation of all required and developer promised improvements in the
manner specified below.
      B.   The applicant subdivider or land developer shall not initiate
installation of any required improvements or any site alterations or erection
of any buildings or structures in any proposed subdivision or land development
prior to final plan approval and prior to receipt of all applicable required
permits and approvals from municipal, County, State, and Federal levels of
government. [Ord. 1-1991]
      C.   The Township Engineer or the Township’s designee shall make such
inspections of the required improvements, and at such intervals, as may be
reasonably necessary to assure compliance with the provisions of this Chapter.
The reasonable cost of such inspections shall be borne by the subdivider or
land developer. The required improvements and the design standards for
constructing them are set forth in this Chapter.
   2.   Method of Providing Improvements.
      A.   No final subdivision plan or land development plan will be approved
by the Commission and the Board of Supervisors unless the streets shown on the
plan have been improved to a mud-free and permanently passable condition. As
used herein, the phrase “mud-free and permanently passable condition” shall
refer to the street design standards of §
22-502.8,
Table 22-1 and the street construction standards of §
22-604 referred to therein; provided, however, that phrase shall not refer to
the obligation under §
22-604.2.D(3) to install surface course road paving.
      B.   Nor shall any final plan (land development, major or minor
subdivision) be approved unless all other required improvements (including the
surface course road paving) and promised improvements have been installed to
the satisfaction of the Supervisors or their authorized designee; provided,
however, in lieu of completion of the improvements mentioned in the preceding
clause of this sentence, the Supervisors will accept Federal or Commonwealth
chartered lending institution irrevocable letters of credit and restrictive or
escrow accounts in such financial institutions or other financial security
acceptable to the Supervisors (hereafter referred to as performance guarantee)
accompanied by a signed development agreement in a satisfactory form.
      C.   Where submission of a final plan by sections or stages has been
approved, the Planning Commission and Supervisors may require construction of,
or guarantee of, improvements in future sections or stages before granting
final approval to the plan under consideration, if such future improvements are
essential for the protection of the stage or section under consideration.
         (1)   Performance Guarantee. The performance guarantee for completion
of required improvements and promised improvements shall meet the following
requirements:
            (a)   It shall provide for, and secure to the public, the
completion of any improvements which may be required on or before the date
fixed in the Board’s formal action of approval or in the executed developers
agreement for completion of the improvements.
            (b)   The amount of financial security to be posted shall be equal
to 110 percent of the cost of completion estimated as of 90 days following the
date scheduled for completion by the developer. Annually the Township may
adjust the amount of the financial security by comparing the actual cost of the
improvements which have been completed and the estimated cost for the
completion of the remaining improvements as of the expiration of the ninetieth
day after either the original date scheduled for completion or a rescheduled
date of completion. Subsequent to said adjustment, the Township may require the
developer to post additional security in order to assure that the additional
security in order to assure that the financial security equals said 110
percent. Any additional security shall be posted by the developer in accordance
with this subsection.
            (c)   The obligation shall be in favor of, and enforceable by, the
Board of Supervisors of Clifton Township and the ultimate grantees, lessees, or
licensees of the developer.
            (d)   The guarantee shall be secured by the credit of any of the
following: a qualified corporate surety; the unconditional letter of credit of
a lending institution; a restrictive or escrow account in a lending
institution; or other financial security acceptable to the Board of Supervi
sors. The precise form of the security acceptable as a performance guarantee
will depend upon what improvements have not been completed; their anticipated
cost; whether they are required or promised improve ments; and the Supervisor’s
evaluation of the financial risk of nonperfor mance.
            (e)   The amount of financial security required shall be based upon
an estimate of the cost of completion of the required improvements, submit ted
by an applicant or developer and prepared by a professional engineer licensed
as such in this Commonwealth and certified by such engineer to be a fair and
reasonable estimate of such cost. The Township, upon the recommendation of the
Township Engineer, may refuse to accept such estimate for good cause shown if
the applicant or developer and the Township are unable to agree upon an
estimate, then the estimate shall be recalculated and recertified by another
professional engineer licensed as such in this Commonwealth and chosen mutually
by the Township Board and the applicant or developer. The estimate certified by
the third engineer shall be presumed fair and reasonable, and shall be final
estimate. In the event that a third engineer is so chosen, fees for the
services of said engineer shall be paid equally by the Township and the
applicant or developer.
            (f)   If the party posting the financial security requires more
than one year from the date of posting of the financial security to complete
the required improvements, the amount of financial security may be increased by
an additional 10 percent for each 1-year period beyond the first anniversary
date from posting of financial security or to an amount not exceeding 110
percent of the cost of completing the required improvements as reestablished on
or about the expiration of the preceding 1 year period by using the above
bidding procedure.
[Ord. 1-1991]
         (2)   Development Agreement.
            (a)   All applicants proposing any subdivision or land development
requiring the installation of improvements as required herein, or showing such
improvements upon the plot map, shall be required to enter into a legally
binding development agreement with the Township of Clifton guaranteeing the
installation of the improvements in accordance with all Township requirements
prior to final plan approval.
            (b)   The development agreement (a form of which is attached as
Appendix 22-E) shall be in a form suitable for execution by the Board of
Supervisors and it shall consist of the following where applicable:

               2)   Construction of streets with related curbs, street signs,
drainage facilities, and related improvements.
               3)   Installation of utility lines.
               4)   Dedication of streets, transfer of water and sewer lines
and easements. In the event public water or sewer lines are offered for
transfer to the Township or a municipal authority, there shall be no charge,
cost, or payment of any nature imposed upon the Township or municipal
authority. In the event streets are offered for dedication to the Township, the
developer shall bear all cost of the Township’s inspection before acceptance of
the offer of dedication and all costs of document preparation and recording.
               5)   Prevention of erosion, sedimentation, and water damage to
the subject and adjacent properties.
               6)   Developer’s responsibilities for damage to other property.

Supervisors, and the amount of the performance guarantee.
               9)   Security, in the form of a maintenance bond or escrow
deposit, for the repair or reconstruction of improvements which are found by
the Township Engineer to be defective within 1 year from the date on which the
engineer certified them to have been completed, shall be included together with
provisions for disbursement thereof.

Township with a certified statement prepared by a professional engineer to the
effect that the sanitary sewers, sewage treatment facilities, and water supply
and distribution facilities comply with the approved plans and have been
constructed in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations.
               15)   The developer shall be responsible for all reasonable
engineering and legal costs and expenses for inspections, consulta tions, and
preparation of agreements, to the extent that such costs and expenses exceed
the monies paid by the developer in accordance with the Clifton Township fee
schedule.
   The final plan shall not be approved by the Board of Supervisors prior to
the execution of the development agreement, and the delivery of the performance
guarantee.
         (3)   Method of Approving Required Improvements.
            (a)   The developer shall notify the Township Board of Supervisors,
with a copy thereof to the Township Engineer, by certified or registered mail,
that the required improvements have been made. Within 10 days of receiving this
notice, the Board of Supervisors shall direct the Engineer to inspect all of
the aforesaid improvements. The engineer shall make his inspection and file a

improvements. After the expiration of 1 year from the date of formal acceptance
of said improvements, the Township shall release said maintenance bond or
security to the subdivider or developer or party posting said maintenance bond
or security.
            (b)   Where the Township Supervisors accept dedication of any

process of selling or transferring shall not exempt the seller or transferor
from such penalties or from the remedies herein provided.
      B.   The Township may refuse to issue any permit or grant any approval
necessary to further improve or develop any real property which has resulted
from a subdivision of real property in violation of any ordinance adopted
pursuant to this Part. This authority to deny such a permit or approval shall
apply to any of the following applicants:
         (1)   The owner of record at the time of such violation.
         (2)   The vendee or lessee of the owner of record at the time of such
violation without regard as to whether such vendee or lessee had actual or
constructive knowledge of the violation.
         (3)   The current owner of record who acquired the property subsequent
to the time of violation without regard as to whether such current owner had
actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
         (4)   The vendee or lessee of the current owner of record who acquired
the property subsequent to the time of violation without regard as to whether
such vendee or lessee had actual knowledge or constructive knowledge of the
violation.

granting of an approval to any such owner, current owner, vendee or lessee for
the development of any such real property, the Township may require compliance
with the conditions that would have been applicable to the property at the time
the applicant acquired an interest in such real property.
   2.   Enforcement Remedies.
      A.   Magisterial district judges shall have initial jurisdiction in any
proceeding brought under this Section. Any person, partnership, or corporation
who or which has violated any of the provisions of this Chapter shall, upon
being found liable therefore in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the
Township, pay a judgment of not more than $500 plus all court costs, including
reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Township as a result thereof. No
judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or be payable until the date of
the determination of a violation by the magisterial district judge. If the
defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the Township may
enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each
day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless
the magisterial district judge determining that there has been a violation
further determines that there was a good faith basis for the person,
partnership or corporation violating the ordinance to have believed that there
was no such violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have been only
one such violation until the fifth day following the date of the determination
of a violation by the magisterial district judge and thereafter each day that a
violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. [Ord. 3-2008]
      B.   The court of common please, upon petition, may grant an order of

conformance with the Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27]. Such area shall have an average slope not greater than 10 percent
and shall be accessible from the existing or proposed street by means of
adequately and properly designed service drives having a maximum grade of 12
percent. In the case of lots utilizing an on-site sewage disposal system, in
addition to such area, there shall be sufficient area, separate and apart from
parking areas, for the sewage disposal field, and sufficient area for a
replacement field, in accordance with the Department of Environmental
Protection regulations. [Ord. 3-2008]
   2.   Natural and Historic Feature Preservation. The Planning Commission and
the Board of Supervisors shall, at their discretion, require that the design
and development of all subdivisions shall preserve insofar as possible, all
natural, scenic, and historic features, which will add attractiveness by
providing parks, adequate open space for recreation, light and air by proper
distribution of population thereby creating conditions favorable to the health,
safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens and for the harmonious
development of the Township. Some of these features are the natural terrain and
natural drainage, large trees or groves, water courses and falls, historic
areas and structures, exceptional scenic views and landmarks, and other
community assets. Land subject to hazardous conditions such as open quarries,
unconsolidated fill, floods, excessive erosion, precipices, and water supply
which does not meet adequacy requirements or U.S. Public Health Service
Standards, shall not be subdivided until the hazards have been eliminated or
overcome by the subdivision and proposed construc tion.
      A.   Uninhabitable Land. Land subject to flooding or subsidence and land
deemed by the Commission or the Board of Supervisors to be uninhabitable for
other reasons shall not be plotted for residential occupancy, nor for such
other uses as may increase danger to health, life, or property, or aggravate
the flood hazard; but such land within a plan shall be set aside for such uses
as will not be endangered by periodic or occasional inundation, or will not
produce unsatisfactory living conditions; such land my be incorporated as
additional areas in plotted lots.
      B.   Water and Wetland Areas.
         (1)   Bodies of surface water and wetland areas defined and designated
by Federal and State agencies shall not be utilized in the calculations of, or
used to meet required minimum lot sizes for any proposed residential or nonresi
dential use nor utilized to calculate or to meet the minimum total parcel areas
required for a residential unit or other nonresidential activity.

developer to accurately delineate the boundaries of any wetlands located on the
site on the submitted plans. Such delineation shall be performed by
professionals, trained and competent in the field. The delineation shall meet
all requirements and criteria of applicable State and Federal statutes. The
applicant shall secure the verification of the accurate boundaries of any
wetlands located on the site from the U.S. Corps of Engineers and/or
Pennsylvania DEP or their designated or authorized representatives as provided
for in state and federal statutes. Written evidence of such verification shall
be provided to the Township prior to approval of the final subdivision or land
development plan or the initiation of installation of any required improvements
on the affected plan. [Ord. 3-2008]
[Ord. 1-1991]
      C.   Areas within public or private street or road rights-of-way shall
not be included in the calculations of, or used to meet the minimum lot sizes
for any proposed residential or nonresidential use. Areas of drainage or
utility easements or rights-of-way or permanent drainage facilities which are
not located within the minimum required yards of the lot or parcel shall not be
used to meet the minimum lot size required for any proposed residential or
nonresidential use. [Ord. 1-1991]
      D.   The minimum required lot area shall generally be designed and
plotted as a contiguous area of land not separated or interrupted by permanent
drainage or utility rights-of-way. Separation or interruption of this required
minimum contiguous lot area by drainage or utility rights-of-way or street
rights-of-way shall be avoided wherever possible and shall be permitted in all
subdivisions and land developments only upon grant of a modification by the
Township Supervisors upon written request by the applicant.
   3.   Location of Site. The design of a proposed subdivision or land
development shall be viewed with regard to the following:
      A.   Comprehensive Plan and Official Map Requirements. The proposed
development should consider as guidance any applicable provision of a Township
comprehensive plan which is used as the basis for zoning or other related
regulations. It must also conform to any official Township map.
      B.   Zoning. The use of land in the subdivision must conform to any
Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27] adopted by the Township.
      C.   Nearby Development. A subdivision and its street pattern must be
coordinated with existing nearby developments or neighbor hoods so that the
area as a whole may be developed harmoniously.
   4.   Water Supply and Sewage Disposal Requirements.
      A.   All subdivision and land developments shall be served with an
adequate water supply and sewage system, whether on-lot, public or private
central systems. All such systems shall be acceptable to the Pennsylvania
Department of Environ mental Protection and to the Board of Supervisors. All
residential lots shall contain a suitable area for on-lot sewage disposal
system or be served by an approved community or central sewage disposal system.
[Ord. 3-2008]
      B.   For those subdivisions or land developments proposing water supply
to be provided by means other than by private wells owned and maintained by the
individual owners of lots, applicants shall present evidence to the Township
Supervisors and Planning Commission that the subdivision or development is to
be supplied by a certified public utility, a bona fide cooperative association
of lot owners, or by a municipal corporation, authority or utility. A copy of a
certificate of public convenience from the Pennsylvania Public Utility
Commission or an application for each certificate, a cooperative agreement or a
commitment or agreement to serve the area in question, whichever is
appropriate, shall be acceptable evidence.
      C.   All suppliers of non-municipally owned sewer services shall be
organized in such fashion as to fall within the jurisdiction of the
Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission or the developer shall provide for
operation and continuity of services in a manner which is acceptable to the
Board of Supervisors. One copy of all correspondence, supporting documentation,
applications for permits, and certificates for operation submitted to the
Department of Environmental Protection and/or Pennsylvania Public Utility
Commission for the right to provide such services shall be forwarded to the
Township as a part of the public record. One copy of the permit and/or
certificate of convenience issued by DEP and the PUC authorizing such services
shall be forwarded upon receipt to the Township as a part of the public record.
[Ord. 3-2008]
      D.   In the event that any such central water supply system and/or
central sewer system is transferred to the Township or to a municipal
authority, neither the developer nor the developer’s assignee shall be entitled
to receive compensa tion or payment therefore, and in no event shall the
Township or municipal authority accept such system by virtue of the terms of
this Chapter.
      E.   Plans and specifications for central or community water and/or
sewage systems (i.e., extension of an existing or new proposed utility) shall
be prepared by a registered professional engineer well versed in the design of
such systems and duly licensed to practice within the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. A minimum of four complete sets of preliminary plans for such
systems shall be submitted to the Planning Commission with the application for
review of preliminary plans. A minimum of four complete sets of approved plans
and specifications shall be submitted to the Planning Commission with the
application for review of the final plan.
      F.   Four copies of a completed planning module for land development
shall be submitted concurrent with the preliminary plan. Following preliminary
plan approval the Board of Supervisors will submit copies of the module and
necessary documentation to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection (DEP) for review. DEP approval of the module and any required
Township Official Sewage Facilities Plan revision or supplement will be
required prior to final plan approval. [Ord. 3-2008]
[Ord. 1-1991]

connections to a public sewer system if such sewer system is reasonably
available.
            (b)   If a County plan, regional plan, municipal plan, or
subdivision requirement indicates that construction of sanitary sewers will
serve the site within approximately 5 years, then capped sewers shall be
required. When public sanitary sewer systems may not be available within 10
years, then a central sewage treatment and disposal system (commonly called a
package treatment plant) or a central subsurface disposal system shall be
installed by the developer. Central sewers are required for all residential
lots and nonresidential developments where the Board of Supervisors determines
upon review of competent data and information that onsite soil conditions are
unsuitable for on-lot subsurface disposal systems.
            (c)   Design standards, materials, and specifications shall be as
outlined in the current Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection
Sewerage Manual, Publication No. 1, supplements thereto and all other
requirements either Federal or State necessary to secure the requisite permit

centralized water or sewer system is required, on-lot systems shall be
constructed in accordance with criteria set forth by the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection. The Township Sewage Enforcement
Officer’s site and soils investigation and favorable report is required prior
to unconditional preliminary plan approval. An adequate number of test pits and
soil percolation tests, as determined by the Sewage Enforce ment Officer, shall
be undertaken to determine the general suitability of soils throughout the
subdivision or development for on-lot subsurface sewage disposal. [Ord. 3-2008]
   6.   Stormwater Management Plans.
      A.   Applicants for subdivisions and land development projects located
within watershed areas included in adopted watershed stormwater management
plans and ordinances shall meet all requirements of those ordinances. [Ord. 2-

         (1)   Lots shall be laid out and graded to prevent cross lot drainage
and to provide positive drainage away from proposed building areas. Natural
drainage courses shall be maintained. The drainage easements may be
incorporated into lot or established separately and apart therefrom. To
minimize sheet flow of stormwater across lots located on the lower side of
roads or streets, and to divert flow away from building areas, the cross-
section of the street as constructed shall provide for parallel ditches or
swales or curbing on the lower side which shall discharge only at drainage
easements.
         (2)   The existing points of natural drainage discharge onto adjacent
property shall not be altered nor shall the rate of water runoff be increased
because of development without the written approval of all affected land
owners.
         (3)   No stormwater runoff or natural drainage water shall be so
diverted as to overload existing drainage systems, or create flooding or the
need for additional drainage structures on other private properties or public
lands, without complete approval of provisions being made by the developer for
properly handling such conditions, including water runoff impoundments, if
necessary.
         (4)   Storm drainage facilities should be designed not only to handle
the anticipated peak discharge from the property being subdivided, but also the
anticipated increase in runoff that will occur when all the property at a
higher elevation in the same watershed is fully developed.
         (5)   Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse there shall be
provided a drainage easement conforming substantially to the line of such
watercourse of such width as will be adequate to preserve the unimpeded flow of
natural drainage.
         (6)   Drainage structures that are located on State highway rights-of-
way shall be approved by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, and a
letter from that office indicating such approval shall be directed to the
Township Planning Commission prior to final approval.
         (7)   All streets shall be so designed as to provide for the discharge
of surface water from their right-of-way.
         (8)   All proposed surface drainage structures shall be indicated on
the preliminary drainage plan.
         (9)   Interceptors for stormwater runoff along streets shall be so
spaced and so designed to intercept 80 percent of the peak runoff from the
design storm.
         (10)   Drainage plans shall include all appropriate designs, details,
and dimensions necessary to clearly explain proposed construction materials and
elevations.
         (11)   Whenever storm drains are required by the Commission and Board
of Supervisors, such storm sewer system shall be separate from the sanitary
sewer system. Storm drains or storm sewer facilities may be required in any
development situation where the Township Planning Commission and Supervisors
determine that surface drainage facilities are inadequate to prevent excessive
erosion and lot or road maintenance problems.
   7.   Drainage Easements. Drainage easements shall be provided as follows:
      A.   Drainage easements shall be provided adjacent to street rights-of-
way as indicated and required by the drainage plans.
      B.   Drainage easements a minimum of 10 in width shall be provided along
side and rear lot lines. Such easements shall, to the fullest extent possible,
either immediately adjoin or be centered on such lot lines.
   8.   Streets.
      A.   Access to Proposed Subdivisions and Land Developments. All proposed
subdivisions and land developments shall have adequate access to the public
highway system. Existing private roads providing access to proposed
subdivisions and land developments shall have adequate right-of-way width and
be adequately designed and constructed to provide safe and convenient access to
the proposed subdivision or land development. The Board of Supervisors, upon
review and report of the Engineer and recommendations of the Planning
Commission, shall determine the adequacy of such existing private access roads
and may require such improvements as they find necessary to provide safe and
convenient access to the proposed subdivision or land development prior to
final plan approval, or may disapprove the submitted plans if such existing
private roads cannot be improved to provide safe and convenient access.
      B.   Streets and Topography. Proposed streets shall be adjusted to the
contour of the land so as to produce usable and accessible lots and streets of
reasonable gradient. Proposed streets serving subdivisions utilizing central
sewage facilities or in areas of the Township in which public sewerage systems
are proposed shall, to the greatest extent possible, be located such that
gravity sewers can be utilized and the necessity of pumping stations be
minimized.
      C.   Street Continuations. Right-of-way of proposed streets shall be
extended to exterior property lines to ultimately provide access to adjoining
lands; provided, however, that the Commission may not normally require more
than one such right- of-way to each adjoining tract. Wherever there exists a
dedicated or platted portion of a street or alley along a boundary of the tract
being subdivided or developed the remainder of said street or alley to the
prescribed width shall be platted within the proposed development where this
would not adversely affect the proposed subdivision or development. Where a
subdivision or development abuts or contains an existing municipal or private
street of inadequate right-of-way width, additional right-of-way width in
conformance with
Table 22-1, “Design Standards for Streets,” shall be required in the case of
land abutting a municipal street, or additional setback and easement for right-
of-way shall be provided in the case of land abutting private streets.
      D.   Alleys. Alleys shall not be provided in residential districts but
may be included in commercial or industrial areas where needed for loading and
unloading or access purposes.
      E.   Private Access Streets. Private access streets may be utilized to
provide access to residential lots in a subdivision which does not abut or have
frontage on a public or approved private road. Private access streets may serve
a maximum of one dwelling unit. Private access streets shall have a minimum
right-of-way width of 20 feet. A private access street shall not exceed 750
feet in length. Use of private access streets shall be avoided wherever
possible in major subdivisions and only upon grant of a waiver by the Township
upon written request by the applicant.
      F.   Intersections.
         (1)   The center-lines of streets shall intersect as nearly at right
angles as possible. Intersections of more than two streets at one point shall
be avoided. Where streets intersect other streets, offsets shall not be
created. The minimum offset or distance between center-lines of parallel or
approximately parallel streets intersecting a cross-street from opposite
directions shall be 150 feet for minor and local access streets, 400 feet for
collector and connector streets and 800 feet for arterial streets.
         (2)   At intersections of streets and/or alleys the property line
shall be rounded by arcs with radii of not less than 25 feet. For streets other
than minor and local access streets, the Township may require a larger radius.
      G.   Arterial and Connector Street Frontage. Where a subdivision abuts or
contains an existing or proposed major traffic street or a railroad, the
Commission and the Board of Supervisors may require marginal access streets,
rear service alleys, reverse frontage lots or such other treatment as will
provide protection for abutting properties, reduction in the number of
intersections with the major street, and separation of local and through
traffic. The required buffer strips may be provided by establishing an easement
on lots or may be established separately and apart therefrom.
      H.   Street Right-of-way and Travelway Widths. Minimum street right-of-
way widths, measured from the lot lines and minimum pavement widths shall be as
shown on
Table 22-1.

drainage swales shall be provided when they are needed to facilitate proper
drainage. Curbs and gutters shall be required throughout commercial and
industrial development.
      K.   Street Alignment.
         (1)   Whenever street lines are deflected in excess of 5 degrees,
within 100 feet, connection shall be made by horizontal curves.
         (2)   Streets shall be so laid out that there will be unobstructed
sight distances along the center-lines thereof. Minimum horizontal sight
distances shall be as set forth in
Table 22-1 measured from a point 3.75 feet above the road surface to a point 6
inches above the road surface.
         (3)   Between reversed curves on arterial streets, a tangent of not
less than 200 feet shall be provided, on connector and collector streets such a
tangent shall be not less than 100 feet.
      L.   Street Grades.
         (1)   Center-line grades shall not exceed the grades set forth in
Table 22-1.
         (2)   Crest vertical curves shall be used at changes of grade
exceeding 1 percent and shall be designed in relation to the design speed to
provide vertical sight distance consistent with the horizontal sight distances
specified above.
         (3)   Sag vertical curves shall be used at changes of grade exceeding
1 percent and shall be designed as follows:
            (a)   On minor streets and local access streets, sag vertical
curves shall have a minimum length of 15 feet for each 1 percent algebraic
difference in tangent grade with an absolute minimum length of 75 feet, (i.e.
1% to 5% - 75' v.c.; 5.1% to 6% - 90' v.c.; etc.).
            (b)   Except on minor streets and local access streets sag vertical
curves shall have a minimum length of 25 feet for each 1 percent algebraic
difference in tangent grade with an absolute minimum length of 100 feet. (i.e.
1% to 4% - 100' v.c.; 4.1% to 5% - 125' v.c.; etc.).
         (4)   A leveling area for all street interceptions shall be provided
as follows:
            (a)   The tangent grade of the through street at the point of
intersec tion of the centerlines of the two streets shall not exceed 8 percent.
Crest and sag vertical curves shall be provided in accordance with subparagraph
(3).
            (b)   The tangent grade of the connecting streets(s) shall not
exceed 4 percent within the right-of-way lines of the through street. Crest or
sag vertical curves shall be provided in accordance with subparagraph (3). The
point of vertical curvature or tangency shall not be within the through street
right-of-way.
         (5)   The maximum grade across the turnaround in a cul-de-sac shall
not exceed 8 percent.
         (6)   To provide for adequate drainage, the minimum grade of any paved
street gutter shall be not less than ½ percent and 1 percent being the
acceptable minimum centerline grade of any street.
      M.   Clear Sight Triangle. At an intersection, a triangle area shall be
graded and/or other sight obstructions removed in such a manner as not to
obscure vision between a height of from 2 to 10 feet above the center-line
grades of the intersect ing streets. Furthermore, by deed restriction, by lease
restriction, or by plan amendment, whichever method is applicable, vegetation
shall not be planted or allowed to grow in such a manner as to obscure vision
between a height of from 2 to 10 feet above the center-line grades of the
intersecting streets. Such triangular area shall be determined by the
intersecting street center-lines and a diagonal connecting two points, one at
each center-line, each of which point is:
         (1)   One hundred fifty feet from the intersection of such street
center- lines, if either street is an arterial street.
         (2)   One hundred feet from the intersection of such street center-
line of either street is a collector or connector street.
         (3)   Seventy-five feet from the intersection of the street center-
lines, if both street or minor or local access streets.
      N.   The Supervisors recognize that the preceding paragraphs of this
Section are not applicable in all circumstances because of unusual topography
or lot layout and will consider deviations or variations therefrom on an
individual basis (such as divided cartways or one-way loop streets) provided
the basic purpose and intent set forth in paragraph .A is complied with. In
granting a request for such variance the Supervisors may impose such
requirements and conditions as they deem fit and proper.

such work or as much thereof as may be completed from the available resources

approval by the Supervisors or their agents, servants, independent contractors
or employees, of the adequacy or fitness of purpose or intended use of the
improvements depicted upon the plans and supporting documentation submitted to

constitutes no more than their acknowledgment that minimum standards of Clifton

administrators, successors and assigns, have hereunto set their hands and seals

herein on a person or transfer shall not exceed the limitations prescribed in
the Local Tax Enabling Act, Act of December 31, 1965, P.L. 1257, 53 P.S. §6901
et seq., so that if any other political subdivision shall impose or hereafter
shall impose such tax on the same person or transfer then the tax levied by the
Township under the authority of that Act shall, during the time such
duplication of the tax exists, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, be ½
of the rate and such ½ rate shall become effective without any action on the
part of the Township; provided, however, that the Township and any other
political subdivision which imposes such tax on the same person or transfer may
agree that, instead of limiting their respective rates to one-half of the rate
here in provided, that they impose respectively different rates, the total of
which shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted under the “Local Tax Enabling
Act.”
   4.   If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate in
effect at the time the tax is due, shall be added and collected.
   5.   The tax imposed under subsection .1 above and all applicable interest
and penalties shall be administered, collected and enforced under the Act of
December 31, 1965, P.L. 1257, No. 511, as amended, known as the “Local Tax
Enabling Act”; provided, that if the correct amount of the tax is not paid by
the last date prescribed for timely payment, Township, pursuant to §1102-D of
the Tax Reform Code of 1971, 72 P.S. §8102-D, authorizes and directs the
Department of Revenue of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to determine, collect
and enforce the tax, interest and penalties.
   6.   Any tax imposed under subsection .1 that is not paid by the date tax is
due shall bear interest as prescribed for interest on delinquent municipal
claims under the Act of May 16, 1923, P.L. 207, No. 153, 53 P.S. §7101 et seq.,
as amended, known as the “Municipal Claims and Tax Liens Act.” The interest
rate shall be the lesser of the interest rate imposed upon delinquent
Commonwealth taxes as provided in §806 of the Act of April 9, 1929, P.L. 343,
No. 176, 72 P.S. §806, as amended, known as the “Fiscal Code,” or the maximum

Part 1
Wind Turbine Generator
§ 26-101.   Findings.
   The Clifton Township Supervisors make the following findings with respect to
the construction, operation and maintenance of wind turbine generators:
      A.   The construction, maintenance and operation of wind turbine
generators which fail to comply with all criteria and regulations set forth in
the attached Exhibit “26-A,” a copy of which is attached hereto and
incorporated herein by reference, present tangible and immediate dangers to the
public and neighboring landowners in the nature of ejection of projectiles (ice
or injured birds), continuous generation of noise during night time hours and
glare from sunlight continually flashing off of rotating blades.
      B.   The construction, maintenance and operation of wind turbine
generators presents a danger following the useful life of the wind turbine
generators from deteriorating structures if provisions for decommissioning are
not made as required by Exhibit “26-A.”
      C.   The construction, maintenance and operation of wind turbine
generators, which fail to comply with all criteria and regulations set forth in
the attached Exhibit “26-A,” unreasonably interferes with the reasonable use,
comfort and enjoyment of property in the vicinity and/or endangers the health,
safety and/or welfare of the occupants of the property in the vicinity and
prohibits or denies the property owners and taxpayers the legitimate enjoyment
of their reasonable rights and use of their property and rights.
      D.   The construction, maintenance and operation of wind turbine
generators, which fail to comply with all criteria and regulations set forth in
the attached Exhibit “26-A” including, but not limited to, the repetitive noise
and glare, visual impacts, flickering reflections, and/or shadows, constitute
an unreasonable use of property which causes injury, damage, harm,
inconvenience, annoyance, and discomfort to the property owners, and taxpayers
in the legitimate enjoyment of their reasonable rights and use of their
property and rights, and constitute a danger to migratory birds and the
watershed.
(Ord. 4-2007, 9/13/2007)
§ 26-102.   Establishment.
   The Clifton Township Supervisors hereby declare the construction and mainte
nance of wind turbine generators to constitute a nuisance and offensive

practices, methods and acts which, in the exercise of reasonable judgment in
light of the facts known at the time the decision was made, could have been
expected to accomplish the desired result at a reasonable cost consistent with
good business practices, reliability, safety and expedition. Good utility
practice is not intended to be limited to the optimum practice, method, or act
to the exclusion of all others, but rather to be acceptable practices, methods
or acts generally accepted in the region. Under no circumstances shall the
definition of “good utility practices” include any violation, regardless of
degree, of any local, State, and/or Federal law, ordinance, rule, and/or
regulation.

and liabilities whatsoever, including reasonable attorney’s fees (such
liabilities together known as “liability”) arising out of the selection,
construction, operation and removal of the wind turbine generators and
affiliated equipment including, without limitation, liability for property
damage or personal injury (including death), whether said liability is premised
on contract or on tort (including without limitation strict liability or
negligence). This general indemnification shall not be construed as limiting or
qualifying the Township's other indemnification rights available under law.
11.   Township Legal Authority
The Township represents and warrants that (i) the execution, delivery and
performance of this agreement is duly authorized; and (ii) it has all requisite
legal authority to execute, deliver and perform this agreement; and (iii) no
further approval or authorization or other action by any governmental authority
is required for the execution, delivery and performance of the agreement.

1.   Term and Renewal.
This agreement, shall continue for 30 years (the “term”) from the date of
approval of this agreement, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. The
term shall automatically extend for one additional 10-year period (“additional
term”), at the request of Developer/Permittee if no event of default permitting
the Township to revoke this agreement under paragraph .1.E above exists at the
time of such request.
The Township makes no representations to Developer/Permittee regarding the
renewal of the agreement at the expiration of the additional term, and the
Township reserves all rights available under law or in equity to any such
extension. Developer/Permittee is hereby informed that it has no property right

or any other regulatory entity with lawful jurisdiction over the wind energy
facility, the Township or such entity provides written notice that any of the
wind turbine generators fail to comply with good utility practice or
constitutes a danger to persons or property, then Developer/Permittee shall
immediately commence corrective action for any failure and/or danger, and shall
complete corrective action to bring the noncompliant wind turbine generator(s)
into compliance with such standards within 60 days of receipt of notice. If
Developer/Permittee is unable to bring the noncompliant wind turbine generator
(s) into compliance with such standards within 60 days of receipt of notice,
Developer/Permittee shall request an extension from the Township, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld and which may include reasonable conditions in
order for Developer/Permittee to receive and maintain such extension. Failure
to bring such noncompliant wind turbine generator(s) into compliance shall
constitute grounds for the Township to request removal of said wind turbine
generator(s) at Developer/Permittee's expense. The Township is authorized to
file an action for injunctive relief in the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna
County, Pennsylvania, to require Developer/Permittee to remove the noncompliant
wind turbine generator(s).
3.   Township Zoning Requirements.
All wind turbine generators and wind energy facilities shall comply with the

any, of any other agency of the State or Federal government with the authority
to regulate wind turbine generators. If such standards and regulations are
changed, then Developer/Permittee shall bring the wind turbine generators into
compliance with such applicable revised standards and regulations within 6
months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a
different compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling State or Federal
agency or approved by the Township. Failure to bring the wind turbine
generators into compliance with such applicable revised standards and
regulations shall constitute an event of default. The wind turbine generators
shall be marked as required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). A
determination of no hazard for each wind turbine generator must be obtained
from the FAA as a condition precedent for the installation of each turbine.
Developer/Permittee shall comply with any and all future State and/or Federal
regulations which are applicable to wind turbine generators or the wind energy
facility, unless grandfathered.
5.   Maintenance, Repair & Replacement.
Developer/Permittee shall repair, maintain and replace the wind turbine
generators and associated equipment during the term of this agreement in a
manner consistent with good utility practice as needed to keep the project in
good repair and operating condition.

throughout the life of the project, and the facility owner and operator shall
make reasonable efforts to respond to the public's inquiries and complaints.
10.   Decommissioning
      A.   The facility owner and operator shall, at its own expense, complete
decommis sioning of the wind energy facility, or individual wind turbines,
within 12 months after the end of the useful life of the facility or individual
wind turbines. The wind energy facility or individual wind turbines shall be
presumed to be at the end of its useful life if no electricity is generated for
a continuous period of 12 months.
      B.   Decommissioning shall include removal of wind turbines, buildings,
cabling, electrical components, roads, foundations to a depth of 36 inches, and
any other associated facilities.
      C.   Disturbed earth shall be graded and re-seeded, unless the landowner
requests in writing that the access roads or other land surface areas not be
restored.
      D.   An independent and certified professional engineer shall be retained
to estimate the total cost of decommissioning (decommissioning costs) without
regard to salvage value of the equipment, and the cost of decommissioning net
salvage value of the equipment (net decommissioning costs). Said estimates
shall be submitted to the Township after the first year of operation and every
fifth year thereafter.
      E.   The facility owner or operator shall post and maintain
decommissioning funds in an amount equal to net decommissioning costs. The
decommissioning funds shall be posted and maintained with a bonding company or
Federal or Commonwealth chartered lending institution chosen by the facility
owner or operator and participating landowner posting the financial security,
provided that the bonding company or lending institution is authorized to
conduct such business within the Commonwealth and is approved by the Township.
      F.   Decommissioning funds may be in the form of a performance bond,
surety bond, letter of credit, corporate guarantee or other form of financial
assurance as may be acceptable to the Township.
      G.   If the facility owner or operator fails to complete decommissioning
within the prescribed time period, then the landowner shall have 6 months to
complete decommissioning.
      H.   If neither the facility owner or operator, nor the landowner
complete decom missioning within the prescribed periods, then the Township may
take such measures as necessary to complete decommissioning. The entry into and
submission of evidence of a participating landowner agreement to the Township
shall constitute agreement and consent of the parties to the agreement, their
respective heirs, successors and assigns that the Township may take such action
as necessary to implement the decommissioning plan.
      I.   The escrow agent shall release the decommissioning funds when the
facility owner or operator has demonstrated and the Township concurs that
decommis sioning has been satisfactorily completed, or upon written approval of
the Township in order to implement the decommissioning plan.
11.   Defense of Land Use Decision.
In addition to the indemnification described above, Developer/Permittee shall
reimburse the Township its reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in defending any
legal actions brought by third parties challenging the legality or
enforceability of this agreement or any portion thereof, or the issuance of any
permits to Developer/Permittee by the Township for the project. Unless it
decides to refuse indemnification, the Township shall be entitled to
indemnification from Developer/Permittee. The Township shall notify Developer/
Permittee in writing promptly upon discovering any claim entitling it to a land
use defense reimbursement. In the event Township fails to notify Developer/
Permittee, within the aforementioned 30 days, Developer/Permittee shall not be
obligated to indemnify and defend the Township with respect to any such
liability, action or claim, only insofar as such knowing failure to notify
Developer/Permittee has actually resulted in prejudice or damage to Developer/
Permittee. With respect to any third party action, lawsuit, proceeding,
investigation or other claim which is subject to reimbursement under this
paragraph, Developer/Permittee shall be entitled to assume and control (with
counsel of its choice, which counsel must be approved by the Township, provided
however such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) the defense of such
action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim at Devel oper/
Permittee's expense; provided, however, that the Township shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice
for such purpose (the fees and expenses of such separate counsel to be borne by
the Township) and to assert against any third party any and all cross claims
and counterclaims the Township may have. If Developer/Permittee elects to
assume the defense of any such claim, it may settle such claim in its sole
discretion so long as either (i) such settlement provides an unconditional
release of the Township, or (ii) Developer/Permittee shall obtain the prior
written consent of the Township (which consent shall not unreasonably
withheld). If Developer/Permittee elects to assume the defense of any claim,
the Township shall fully cooperate with Developer/Permittee and its counsel in
such defense.
12.   Annual Inspection Fees.
The Developer/Permittee will pay to the Township initial inspection and annual
inspection fees as follows:
      A.   Developer/Permittee will pay to the Township $1,000 per proposed
wind turbine generator installed in the Township upon issuance of the building
permit by the Township or notice from the building code enforcement officer
that no building permit is required (the “issuance or notice date”).
      B.   Thereafter, Developer/Permittee will pay the Township $1,000 per
wind turbine generator actually installed in the Township (the “per generator
payment”). Such payments shall be on an annual basis payable on the anniversary
of the issuance or notice date. Under no circumstances shall the Township
receive less than $1,000 per generator from Developer/Permittee. However,
Developer/Permittee may receive a credit, which shall be set off against the
per generator payment. “Credit” is defined as the amount of any payments
related to the wind energy facility or wind turbine generators located in the
Township paid by Developer/Permittee to any other governmental entity, for
which such funds are actually (or are traceable to an amount) received by the
Township. If the credit is less than the per generator payment, then the per
generator payment will be reduced by the credit. If the credit is equal to or
greater than the per generator payment, no per generator payment is payable to
the Township. Pursuant to the above terms, Developer/Permittee specifically
agrees that the Commonwealth may not impair the right to this payment by the
passage of legislation, executive order or otherwise.
13.   Field Representative and Site Manager.
Developer/Permittee will be responsible for overseeing compliance with the
conditions of this agreement during the construction phase of the project. Upon
completion of construction, Developer/Permittee shall designate a contact
person for the Township who will be responsible for overseeing compliance with
the conditions of this agreement for the duration of the term of this
agreement. Developer/Permittee shall provide the names, addresses, daytime
telephone numbers and emergency telephone numbers of any other designated field
representative and site manager to the Township. The Township may make the
telephone numbers available to local residents and officials. Developer/
Permittee shall be entitled, upon prior written notice to the Township, to
change the field representative or site manager, or make other changes in the
contact information. In addition, Developer/Permittee will make contact
information available for the entity providing operation (monitoring) and
maintenance services.
14.   Inspections.
Representatives of the Township shall be allowed to inspect the wind turbine
generator sites after providing not less than 24 hours advance written notice
to Developer/Permittee through its site management as defined in paragraph 17,
and to the property owner. Provided however, during construction, Developer/
Permittee, may limit the access to the project to two designated
representatives of the Township, unless safety reasons mandate otherwise and/or
the inspection is required by law.
15.   Project Permit.
Upon execution by both parties to this agreement, this document shall also
constitute a permit for Developer/Permittee to proceed with the project,
subject to the require ments of this agreement and the requirement of
Developer/Permittee to obtain all other necessary permits as required by
Federal, State, and local law including, but not limited to, FAA permits,
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection permits, and building
permits.
16.   Governing Law and Venue.
This agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with and governed by the laws
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without regard to the conflicts of law
principles thereof . The Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County,
Pennsylvania, shall have jurisdiction/venue over any and all matters or
disagreement between the parties hereto arising out of interpretation of this
agreement or any matters herein set forth.
17.   Relationship of Parties.
The parties understand and agree that no party is an agent, employee,
contractor, vendor, representative or partner of the other party, that (except
as expressly set forth in writing) no party shall owe a fiduciary duty to any
other party and no party shall hold itself out as such to third parties and
that no party is capable of binding the other party to any obligation or
liability without the prior written consent of the other party. Neither the
execution nor delivery of this agreement, nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall create or constitute a partnership,
joint venture or any other form of business organization or arrangement between
the parties.
18.   Equality of Treatment.
Developer/Permittee hereby covenants to provide Township equal treatment as is
provided to all other municipalities within Lackawanna County having similar
arrangements with Developer/Permittee and any of its parent entities and/or
subsidiaries including all successors and assigns. During the term of this
agreement or any extension thereof, any section, clause or provisions which are
modified, added or renewed in any agreement with another municipal entity
presently or hereafter included in or part of the wind energy facility may be
incorporated into this agreement at the sole discretion of Township provided,
however, that incorporation of any section, clause or provisions perceived to
be more favorable to another entity shall also require incorporation of any
section, clause or provisions which caused Developer/Permittee to provide such
perceived favored status. Developer/Permittee shall forward information
pertinent to the above process and Township shall review same for purposes of
acceptance or rejection. Township shall give written notice of the decision to
accept or reject, which acceptance/rejection shall not be effective until
received by the Devel oper/Permittee.
19.   Attorney's Fees.
If either party shall at any time be in default under this agreement and if the
non- defaulting party shall institute a legal action or summary proceeding
against the defaulting party based upon such default, then the losing party
will reimburse the prevailing party for its reasonable attorney's fees and
disbursements.
20.   Immunity.
Neither party hereto waives any rights or immunities arising out of and/or
pursuant to any applicable governmental immunity, laws and/or statutes.
21.   Compliance with Laws.
Nothing contained in this agreement shall provide, apply/infer that either
party is authorized to engage, in any conduct which is not in compliance with
all Federal, State, and local laws, rules and regulations that presently exist
and/or are adopted/amended in the future.
22.   Nonexclusive Remedy.
No right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to either party is
intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and
remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to any other right or remedy given
by this agreement or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity. The failure
of either party to insist upon the strict performance of any obligations shall
not be deemed a waiver thereof.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have hereto caused this agreement to be duly
executed on the date set forth above.

map for official use.
   5.   If the Official Zoning Map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or
difficult to interpret because of changes and additions, the Board of
Supervisors may, by resolution, adopt a new Official Zoning Map which shall
supersede the prior Official Zoning Map. The new Official Zoning Map may
correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior Official Zoning Map,

support structure must go where it is proposed, in order to satisfy its
function in the company’s grid system. The number of CCD to be installed at a
site by an applicant may not exceed the current minimum necessary to ensure the
adequacy of current service required by the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) license held by that applicant. The applicant shall provide information
on the general location of other towers/sites planned for the region.
   2)   Collocation; New Tower. If the applicant proposes to build a tower (as
opposed to mounting the CCD on an existing structure), the Township may require
the applicant to demonstrate that it contacted, in writing, the owners of tall
structures within a 5 mile radius of the site proposed, asked for permission to
install the CCD on those structures, and was denied. This would include smoke
stacks, water towers, tall buildings, CCD support structures of other cellular
phone companies, other communications towers (fire, police, etc.) and other
tall structures. The Township may deny the application to construct a new tower
if the applicant has not made a good faith effort to mount the CCD on an
existing structure, thereby documenting that there exists no other support
structure which can reasonably serve the needs of the owner of the proposed
CCD. A good faith effort shall demonstrate that one or more of the following
reasons apply to a particular structure:
   a)   The proposed equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the
existing structure; and, its reinforcement cannot be accomplished at a
reasonable cost.
   b)   The proposed equipment would cause radio frequency interference with
other existing equipment for that existing structure; and, the interference
cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.
   c)   Such existing structures do not have adequate location, space, access
or height to accommodate the proposed equipment or to allow it to perform its
intended function.
   d)   Addition of the proposed equipment would result in electromagnetic
radiation from such structure exceeding applicable standards established by the
Federal Communications Commission governing human exposure to electromagnetic
radiation.
   e)   A commercially reasonable agreement could not be reached with the
owners of such structures.
   3)   CCD Height; Stackable; Arrays; Design.
   a)   The applicant shall demonstrate that the CCD is at the minimum height
required to function satisfactorily and provide adequate height for eight
service providers. The maximum height of any CCD shall be 150 feet.
   b)   The Township may require the tower to be designed and constructed to be
stackable (structurally capable of being increased in height) so that
additional antennas arrays can be accommodated in addition to the arrays on the
original tower to facilitate future collocation. However, in no case shall the
number of arrays on any one tower exceed six.
   c)   CCD equipment buildings shall comply with the accessory structure
height limitations of the applicable zoning district.
   d)   The Township shall require stealth design or specific colors to ensure
that the CCD is compatible with the surrounding landscape; and, such
determination shall be based on a balloon test for height conducted by the
applicant.
   4)   Subdivision Requirement; Lot Size; Setbacks. If a new CCD support
structure is constructed (as opposed to mounting the CCD on an existing
structure) or if the CCD height exceeds the height of the existing structure on
which it is mounted by more than 20 feet, the following minimum setbacks shall
apply:
   a)   Subdivision Requirement. If the CCD site is part of a larger parcel, a
minor subdivision shall be required if title to a CCD site is to be
transferred, or if a CCD site is leased.
   b)   Lot Size. The minimum required lot size, whether held in fee, lease,
license or easement, shall be 2 acres.
   c)   Setback. If the parcel on which the CCD and support structure are
located is a separate and distinct parcel, the distance between the base of the
support structure and any adjoining property line shall not be less than the
height of the CCD structure plus the normal setback for the district. The
setback for equipment containers, other accessory structures, and guy wire
anchors shall be a minimum of 30 feet. If the land on which the CCD and support
structure is leased, or is used by license or easement, the setback for any
part of the CCD, the support structure, equipment containers, other accessory
structures, and guy wire anchors shall be a minimum of 30 feet from the line of
lease, license or easement. In any case, the distance between the base of the
support structure and any adjoining property line (not lease, license or
easement line) shall not be less than the height of the CCD structure plus the
normal setback for the district.
   5)   CCD Support Structure Safety. The applicant shall demonstrate that the
proposed CCD and support structure are safe and the surrounding areas will not
be negatively affected by support structure failure, falling ice or other
debris, electromagnetic fields, or radio frequency interference. All support
structures shall be fitted with anti-climbing devices, as approved by
manufacturers. The applicant shall submit certification from a Pennsylvania
registered professional engineer that a proposed CCD and support structure will
be designed and constructed in accordance with the current Structural Standards
for Steel Antenna Towers and Antenna Supporting Structures, published by the
Electrical Industrial Association/Telecommunications Industry Association and
applicable requirements of any applicable building code. Within 45 days of

support structure as possible and any other ground level features (such as a
building); and, in general, buffer the CCD and support structure site from
neighboring properties. Any required vegetation shall be maintained in good
condition and shall be installed within the fenced area to protect vegetation
from being destroyed by wildlife. The Township may permit any combination of
existing vegetation, topography, walls, decorative fences or other features
instead of landscaping, if they achieve the same degree of screening as the
required landscaping. If the CCD is mounted on an existing structure and other
equipment is housed inside an existing structure, landscaping shall not be
required. In addition, existing vegetation on and around the site shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
   8)   Collocation; Other Uses. In order to reduce the number of CCD support
structures needed in the community in the future, the proposed support
structure shall be required to accommodate other users including, but not
limited to, other cellular phone companies, and local fire, police, and
ambulance companies. The applicant shall provide evidence of written contact
with all wireless service providers who supply service within the Township for
the purpose of assessing the feasibility of co-located facilities. The proposed
structure, as determined by the Township, shall be constructed to provide
available capacity for other providers if there is a future additional need for
such facilities.

inform the owner(s) of any safety problems, maintenance problems or any matter
relative to the CCD in accordance with the enforcement requirements of this
Chapter, sent to the posted address. If the problem outlined in the letter from
the Zoning Officer is not resolved within 30 days of receipt of notice, or
within such other period as allowed in writing by the Zoning Officer, this
shall constitute a violation of this Chapter. An unresolved violation shall
constitute grounds for revoking the conditional use permit.
   15)   Water and Sewer. Water, other than for facility cooling and fire
suppression purposes, and sewage facilities shall not be permitted at CCD sites
to preclude person(s) from living or staying on the site. Should an existing

§ 27-603.   Accessory Use Requirements.
   The following accessory uses are permitted uses on any lot developed to a
residential principal use. These uses are customarily incidental to the
principal use. The term “accessory use” shall include the following and similar
uses or structures which shall comply with the provisions listed below and
shall require a building and/or zoning permit. [Ord. 2-2003]
   A.   Home Occupations. It is the intent of this paragraph to regulate the
operation of home occupations so that the average neighbor, under normal
circumstances, will not be aware of the existence of the home occupation. The
burden of proof shall be on the applicant to demonstrate that the standards
will be met. Based upon the potential nuisances of a proposed home occupation
not specifically permitted by this Section, the Board of Supervisors may
determine that a particular type or intensity of use is unsuitable to be a home
occupation or that the proposed lot area or setbacks are not adequate. The
following standards shall apply:
      (1)   The home occupation must be conducted entirely inside a building
and shall be clearly incidental and secondary to the use of the dwelling as a
residence.
      (2)   In the R-1 District the total area used by all home occupations on
the premises does not exceed 25 percent of the gross floor area of the dwelling
unit, including basement, and accessory structures as existed at the effective
date of this Chapter. In all other districts the total area shall not exceed 50
percent.
      (3)   No outdoor display or display visible from outdoors, or outdoor
storage of materials, goods, products, supplies, or equipment used in the home
occupation(s) shall be permitted.
      (4)   There shall be no evidence visible from outside the dwelling (show
windows, business displays, advertising, etc.) that the residence is being
operated as a home occupation except for a sign, if permitted, and required
parking area.
      (5)   In the R-1 District the home occupation shall be conducted only by
members of the family residing in the dwelling and not more than one person
other than residents of the dwelling shall be employed on the premises. In all
other districts, the number of nonresident employees shall not exceed three.
      (6)   Off-street parking shall be provided on the premises as required by
this Chapter to prevent parking on any public or private street right-of-way.
      (7)   No home occupation use shall generate nuisances such as traffic,
noise, vibration, glare, odors, fumes, electrical interference, or hazards to
any greater extent than what is usually experienced in the residential
neighborhood.
         (8)   No goods or items for retail or wholesale sale shall be
permitted except for items handcrafted on the premises or goods and items
incidental to the operation of an approved home occupation with the total
display and/or storage area limited to 200 square feet.
      (9)   The use shall not involve the parking of more than one truck of any
type on the lot or on adjacent streets at any period of time. The use shall not
require servicing by, deliveries by or parking of tractor-trailer trucks. In
the R District, the use shall not require the parking or servicing by a vehicle
with more than 26,000 pounds registered gross vehicle weight, except for
deliveries of a maximum of two times per day.
      (10)   One home occupation sign not exceeding 2 square feet in size shall
be permitted.
      (11)   The following uses shall not be permitted as home occupations:
commercial stables, veterinarians, commercial kennels or motor vehicle or small
engine repair shops, retail or wholesale sales, restaurant, funeral parlors or
other uses not meeting the requirements of this paragraph .A.
      (12)   The following types of uses shall be permitted as accessory uses
in all districts:
         (a)   Professional offices for individual practitioners.
         (b)   Rooming and/or housing of not more than two persons.
         (c)   Custom dressmaking or tailoring.
         (d)   Day care that provides care for six or fewer children at any one
time who are not relatives of the care giver.
         (e)   Tutoring for not more than four children simultaneously.
         (f)   Mail order or sales businesses not involving customer contact on
the premises or wholesale brokering not involving stock on the
         (g)   Businesses involving the use of personal computers for sales or
services and which do not involve customer contact on the premises.
         (h)   Single practitioner beauty shops and barbershops.
         (i)   No-impact home-based businesses as defined in §
27-302. [Ord. 2-2011]
      (13)   All applications for home occupations not specifically enumerated
as permitted in subpargraph (9) or excluded by subpargraph (11) shall be
considered conditional uses.
[Ord. 2-2003]
   B.   Residential Accessory Building, Structure or Use. Permitted residential
accessory buildings, structures or uses include:
      (1)   Parking Spaces. Parking spaces for the parking of passenger
automobiles shall be located no closer than 15 feet of a side lot line or 20

accessory to residential buildings and which are not attached to a principal
structure shall not be higher than 18 feet. [Ord. 2-2003]
      (4)   Storage Sheds. Storage sheds are allowed in side and rear yard
areas, provided they are no closer than 15 feet to a side lot line or 20 feet
to a rear lot line. No building or zoning permit is required if the storage
shed is less than 120 square feet in floor area less than 10 feet in height and
not on a permanent foundation. [Ord. 2-2003]
   C.   Home Gardening, Nurseries and Greenhouses. Home gardening and accessory
structures used for nurseries or as greenhouses are permitted in residential
districts provided that they shall not include the outdoor storage of equipment
and supplies.
   D.   Solar Energy Systems. Solar energy systems including solar collectors,
storage facilities, and distribution components for space heating and cooling
and for water heating are permitted. Maximum height and minimum yard setback
requirements of the lot shall be met.
   E.   Keeping Animals and Fowl. A reasonable number of customary household
pets or domestic animals may be kept on residential lots without zoning
permits. However, the keeping of larger animals such as cattle, horses, goats
and pigs as pets shall require a minimum lot area of 2 acres plus an additional
½ acre of land for each large animal more than the first animal, and stables,
runways or animal exercise pens shall be located more than 50 feet from lot
lines or road right-of-way lines. The keeping of animals or flocks of fowl for
commercial breeding or commercial raising or uses shall be defined as animal
husbandry and shall meet the requirements stated within this Chapter for that
activity.
   F.   Noncommercial Swimming Pool. A noncommercial swimming pool designed to
contain a water depth of 24 inches or more shall not be located, constructed,
or maintained on any lot or land area except in conformity with the following
requirements:
      (1)   Permit. A permit shall be required to locate, construct or maintain
a noncommercial swimming pool.
      (2)   Location. Such pool shall be located in a rear or side yard only.
In no case shall an above or in-ground pool be located within 15 feet of a side
or rear property line or under any electrical lines.
      (3)   Fence. Every ingrown noncommercial swimming pool shall be entirely
enclosed with a good quality chain link, wooden, or other equivalent fence of
not less than 4 feet in height. Above ground pools on any lot shall not require
a fence, except that ladders or steps into the above ground pool shall be of a
type that can be secured or closed.
      (4)   Water. If the water for such pool is supplied from a private well,
there shall be no cross-connection with the public water supply system. If the
water for such pool is supplied from the public water supply system, the inlet
shall be above the overflow level of said pool.
   G.   Tennis Court.
      (1)   A tennis court shall be located in either a rear or side yard and
shall not be closer to a property line than 20 feet. Tennis court fences shall
be permitted, but they shall not be closer than 10 feet to a property line.

permitted by this Chapter for use as an accessory structure shall be all
setback and other requirements applicable to such structure. [Ord. 2-2007]
   K.   Windmills, Accessory. An accessory windmill is a wind energy conversion
system that converts wind energy into electricity through the use of a wind
turbine generator, and includes the nacelle, rotor, tower, and pad transformer,
if any, and which is sized and intended to be used to generate electricity for
the principal structure to which it is accessory. Accessory wind mills are
permitted in all districts only in compliance with the following and all other
applicable standards: (See §
27-704 for height requirements.)
      (1)   No part of the wind turbine generator structure shall be located
closer to any property line or road-right-of-way than the height of the

27-706.B. The level, however, may be exceeded during short-term events such as
utility outages and/or severe wind storms.
      (4)   The windmill shall be sited to minimize to the greatest extent
possible shadow flicker on adjoining properties.
      (5)   Applications for accessory wind turbine generators shall be
accompanied by standard drawings of the wind turbine structure, including the

(Ord. 1-1989, 11/18/1989, §7.4; as amended by Ord. 3-2004, 9/11/2004, §4)
§ 27-705.   Lot and Yard Requirements.
   1.   Lot Area and Yard Requirements. The lot or yard requirements for any
new building or use shall not include any part of a lot that is required by any
other building or use to comply with requirements of this Chapter. No required
lot area or yard shall include any property, the ownership of which has been
transferred subsequent to the effective date of this Chapter, if such property
was a part of the area required for compliance with the dimensional
requirements applicable to the lot from which such transfer was made. No
required lot area or area or yard shall include any road or street right-of-way
either public or private.
   2.   Minimum Lot Area and Lot Area Per Dwelling Unit. Where a minimum lot
area is specified, no principal building or use shall be erected or established
on any lot of lesser area, except as may be permitted in subsection .4, of this
Section. Minimum lot area shall not include public or private street or road
rights-of-way.
   3.   Minimum Lot Width. Where a minimum lot width is specified, no principal
building shall be erected on any part of a lot which has a width of less than
is specified in
Schedule 27-2 and §§
27-601 and 27-602 of this Chapter for the appropriate zoning district except as
may be permitted in subsection .4 of this Section.
   4.   Exceptions to Minimum Lot Areas and Lot Widths.
      A.   Nonconforming Lots.
         (1)   A single principal permitted nonresidential use may be erected
on any existing lot of record, providing the owner does not possess adjoining
parcel or parcels; that all district regulations are met excepting minimum lot
size requirements.
         (2)   Within districts where permitted, a single family dwelling
structure and accessory structure may be erected on any existing lot of record,
providing the owner does not own any adjoining parcel or parcels; that all
district regulations are met excepting minimum lot size requirements; and that
side and rear yards are not reduced more than 50 percent of the required
distance or to the extent necessary, whichever is lesser.
         (3)   In the case of a nonconforming lot which is also a corner lot,
an exception to the rule that front yard setbacks be observed from both streets
which border the property may apply. If the nonconforming lot is of substandard
size and the property owner does not own an adjoining lot, then the Zoning
Officer shall determine which area shall be the front yard. This determination
shall be done by establishing which portion of the lot fronts on the street
with the actual or potential higher traffic volume and such determination shall
be in the sole discretion of the Zoning Officer. Once this has been determined,
the “side yard” which abuts the second street shall have a reduced setback of
40 feet. In the case of lots having a width of less than 125 feet, as measured
from the side abutting the second street to the other side of said lot, the
setback for the side abutting the second street may be further reduced in the
discretion of the Zoning Officer, but in no event shall said setback be less
than 20 feet. [Ord. 1-1992]
         (4)   A nonconforming lot which was improved or developed prior to the
effective date of this Chapter shall not have existing structures or new
additional structures constructed, enlarged or intended to encroach further
into any required yard set forth in
Schedule 27-2 and Part 6 of this Chapter. [Ord. 2-2003]
         (5)   Projections of accessory or principal structures or buildings
into required yards shall be permitted as follows:
            (a)   Fire escapes, uncovered stairs and landings, canopies, eaves,
or other architectural features not required for structural support may project
into the required side, front, or rear yard not more than a total of 4 feet.
            (b)   Uncovered patios and walkways at ground level elevations may
be located in the required side and rear yards not closer than 10 feet to any
adjacent property line, and may project into front yards up to 15 feet.
[Ord. 2-2003]
      B.   Irregularly Shaped Lots. In the case of irregularly shaped lots, the
minimum lot width specified in the district shall be measured at the rear line
of the required front yard, provided that in no case shall the lot frontage
measured at the street right-of-way line be less than 70 percent of the minimum
lot width except in the following situations: on cut- de-sacs or courts or
street centerline curves of less than 300 feet radius where the lot frontage
measured at the street right-of-way line shall not be less than 40 percent of
the minimum lot width.
      C.   Steep Slopes.
         (1)   Residential Development. Each lot or an area plotted for
residential use shall provide, inside of the required yards, an area containing
not less than 1,000 square feet for each dwelling unit. Such area shall have an
average slope no greater than 15 percent and shall be accessible from the
existing or proposed street by means of a driveway or private access street
having a maximum grade of 12 percent. In the case of lots utilizing an onsite
sewage disposal system, in addition to such area, there shall be sufficient
area for the sewage disposal field, in accordance with the Department of
Environmental Protection’s regulations. Steep slope areas greater than 30
percent shall not be utilized in the calculations of minimum required lot sizes
or minimum total parcel areas required for, any proposed residential use. [Ord.
3-2008]
         (2)   Nonresidential Development. Each lot plotted for industrial,
commercial or other nonresidential use shall provide, inside of the required
yards, an area at least equal to the projected horizontal area of the proposed
building, plus the additional area required for parking in conformance with
this Chapter. This area shall have an average slope no greater than 10 percent
and shall be accessible from the existing or proposed street by means of
adequately and properly designed service drives having a maximum grade of 8
percent. In the case of lots utilizing an on-site sewage disposal system, in
addition to such area, there shall be sufficient area for the sewage disposal
field and sufficient area for a replacement field in accordance with the
Department of Environmental Protection regulations. [Ord. 3-2008]
      D.   Water and Wetland Areas. Bodies of surface water and wetland areas
defined and designated by Federal and State agencies shall not be utilized in
the calculation of, or used to meet required minimum lot sizes for any proposed
residential or nonresidential use nor utilized to calculate or to meet the
minimum total parcel areas required for a residential unit or other
nonresidential activity. All buildings or structures shall be located not less
than 50 feet from any wetland.
   5.   Spacing of Nonresidential Buildings on the Same Lot. Where two or more
nonresidential principal buildings are proposed to be built on a lot in one
ownership, each such building shall be separated from another such building by
at least twice the minimum side yard requirement for each respective building
in the zoning district.
   6.   Through Lots. In the case of through lots, unless the prevailing front
yard pattern on adjoining lots indicates otherwise, front yards shall be
provided on all frontages. Where one of the front yards that would normally be
required on a through lot is not in keeping with the prevailing yard pattern,
the Board of Supervisors may waive the requirements for the normal front yard
and substitute therefore a special yard requirement which shall not exceed the
average of the yards provided on adjacent lots.
   7.   Front and Side Yards of Corner Lots. On a corner lot, the street side
yard shall equal the required front yard for lots facing that street.
   8.   Front Yard Regulations. Where a minimum depth of front yard is
specified in a district, an open space of at least the specified depth shall be
provided between the street line or lines and the nearest point of any building
or structure except as may be permitted elsewhere in this Chapter.
   9.   Exception to Required Front Yard for Certain Accessory Uses. Subject to
subsection .11, the district’s front yard requirements shall not apply to
accessory signs and off-street parking facilities.
   10.   Side and Rear Yard Requirements. Where a minimum width of side yard is
specified, no building or structure shall be erected within the specified
distance from either side lot line, except for permitted accessory buildings,
structures and uses in each of the respective zoning districts. Where a
nonresidential use is contiguous to an existing residential use or any
Residential District boundary the minimum side and rear abutting yards of the
nonresidential use shall be increased by 50 percent and a buffer consisting of
a solid fence of wood and/or a dense evergreen planting not less than 6 feet
high shall be established and maintained. Storage of equipment, supplies,
products or any other materials shall not be permitted in any front yard or
side yard.
   11.   Traffic Visibility Across Corners.
      A.   Sightlines at Public Street Intersections. At an intersection, a
triangle area shall be graded and sight obstructions shall be removed so that
vision between a height of from 2 - 10 feet above the centerline grades of the
intersecting streets is not obscured Furthermore, by deed restriction, by lease
restriction, or by plan amendment, whichever method is applicable, vegetation
shall not be planted or allowed to grow in such a manner as to obscure vision
between a height of from 2 - 10 feet above the centerline grades of the
intersecting streets. Such triangular area shall be determined by the
intersecting street centerlines and a diagonal connecting two points, one at
each street centerline (as shown below) each of which point is:
         (1)   One hundred feet from the intersection of such street
centerlines, if either street is an arterial street.
         (2)   Seventy-five feet from the intersection of such street
centerline if either street is a collector or connector street.
         (3)   Fifty feet from the intersection of such street centerlines, if
both streets are minor or local access streets.
      B.   Sightlines at Private Accessway and Public Street Intersections. At
each point where a private accessway intersects a public street or road, a
clear-sight triangle of 10 feet measured from the point of intersection of the
street line and the edge of the accessway, shall be maintained, within which
vegetation and other visual obstructions shall be limited to a height of not
more than 2 feet above the centerline grade.
   12.   Buffer Yards, Increased Setbacks and Fences.
      A.   The intent of the buffer and increased setback is to assure the
protection of adjoining uses by providing visual barriers that block the glare
of lights; reduce noise; serve as a protective barrier by blocking physical
passage to dangerous areas; and reduce air pollution, dust and litter; and, to
otherwise maintain and protect the character of the neighborhood.
      B.   Where a nonresidential use adjoins a R-l District or a public or
private school, a public park or playground or state game lands or state
forest, the required setback shall be increased by 50 percent and a buffer
shall be provided.
      C.   Buffer yards shall comply with §
22-612 (Landscaping) of
Chapter 22 (Subdivision and Land Development).
      D.   In the case of conditional use increased buffer intensity and width
may be required.
   13.   Landscaping. Any disturbed or cleared part or portion of a site which
is not used for building, other structures, loading or parking spaces and
aisles, sidewalks and other paved areas shall be provided with an all-season
ground cover and shall be landscaped in accord with with §
22-612 (Landscaping) of
Chapter 22 (Subdivision and Land Development).
(Ord. 1-1989, 11/18/1989, §7.5; as amended by Ord. 1-1992, 2/8/1992, §IV; by
Ord. 2-2003, 10/11/2003, §17; by Ord. 3-2008, 11/13/2008; and by Ord. 1-2018,
10/18/2018, Items 1 and 2)
§ 27-706.   General Performance Standards.
   No land or structure in any zoning district shall be used or occupied in any
manner that creates any dangerous, injurious, noxious, or otherwise
objectionable fire, explosive, or other hazards; noise, or vibration; smoke,
dust, odor or other form of air pollution; heat, electromagnetic or other
radiation, or other condition in such manner or in such amount as to affect
adversely the reasonable use of the surrounding area or adjoining premises.
      A.   Performance Standards Procedure.
         (1)   With the exception of residential uses, the applicant for a
zoning permit for any other principal or accessory use shall include with such
application an affidavit acknowledging his understanding of the performance
standards specified herein and applicable to such use, and affirming his
agreement to conduct or operate such use at all times in conformance with such
standards. Where there is reason to believe that the nature of the proposed use
would make it difficult to comply with applicable standards, the Zoning Officer
may require the applicant to submit plans of the proposed construction. Also, a
description of the proposed machinery, operations and products, and
specifications for the mechanisms and techniques to be used in restricting the
emission of any dangerous and objectionable elements listed in this Section;
provided, however, that no applicant shall be required to reveal the secret
details of industrial or trade data and may specify that the plans or other
information submitted pursuant to this Section shall be treated as a
confidential matter.
         (2)   Regardless of whether or not a use is required to comply with
the procedure specified in this paragraph .A, every use shall comply with the
performance standards themselves.
      B.   Noise Control.
         (1)   Definitions. The following definitions shall apply to this
paragraph:
   A-weighted noise level - a single number measurement of a noise level that
approximates the human ear’s response to an equal-loudness contour of 40 phons.
(A “phon” is a unit of apparent loudness, equal in number to the intensity in
decibels of a 1,000-hertz tone judged to be as loud as the sound being
measured.)
   Background environmental noise level - the environmental noise level without
the suspected offending noise source.
   Environmental noise level - the equivalent continuous noise level measured
at any specified point which is representative of the noise level of that
environment.
   Equivalent continuous noise level (ECNL) - the constant A-weighted noise
level that would produce the same energy density exposure as a continuously
varying noise level. ECNL is calculated from a series of measurements by the
following formula:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/0a02454980a9de5438dabbfdc44e58c739f9f418/
IMAGES/0-0-0-26.png]
   where Li is an A-weighted noise level, and ti is the time over which that
level occurs, or, for measurements taken over an equal, fixed time interval:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/0a02454980a9de5438dabbfdc44e58c739f9f418/
IMAGES/0-0-0-28.png]
   Intentional radiator - a source of sound, or noise source, which is designed
or operated to produce sound, as its primary function. For example, sirens, air
horns, and loud speaker systems are all intentional radiators.
   Noise source - a single piece of equipment, or a collection of equipment
under the control and operation of a single entity, that produces noise as a
consequence of its operation. A collection of equipment may not necessarily be
connected or related, if they may be operated simultaneously.
   Radiated noise level - the noise produced by a single radiator, measured
under controlled conditions, at a fixed distance from the radiator. Radiated
noise level measurements characterize the acoustic performance of that
radiator. Radiated noise levels are the subject of State and Federal
regulations. For example, radiated noise levels from boats are regulated by the
Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission using SAE Standards J2005 and J34.
   Suspect source - a noise source that may be in violation of this Chapter,
identified by the nature of sound or a correlation with the times of operation
and the alleged violation.
   Unintentional radiator - a source of sound, or noise source, which is not
designed or operated as its primary function to produce sound, but produces
sound as an unintentional byproduct of its operation. For example, chain saws,
rock crushers, wood chippers, vacuum cleaners, and lawn mowers are all
unintentional radiators.
         (2)   Legislative Intent. Most rural communities are noted for their
low levels of environmental noise. Environmental noise is part of the character
of a community, and as such is a legitimate object for municipalities to
regulate under a zoning ordinance. Previous standards were based on EPA
guidelines designed to protect against adverse impact on human health and
activities. However, those environmental noise level limits greatly exceed the
typical rural noise levels, and those limits would allow land use activities
that would destroy the quiet, rural character of the community. This standard
is designed to prevent the noise produced from any single property from
dominating the environmental noise at any point in the Township, thereby
preserving the character of the community.
         (3)   Limits.
            (a)   Between the hours of 1 p.m. and 7 a.m. (local time), no
intentional or unintentional radiator shall raise the ECNL at any point in the
Township outside the boundaries of the property on which it is located by more
than 3 dB.
            (b)   Between the hours of 7 p.m. and 1 p.m. (local time), no
intentional or unintentional radiator shall raise the ECNL at any point in the
Township outside the boundaries of the property on which it is located by more
than 5 dB.
            (c)   Between the hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. (local time), no
intentional or unintentional radiator shall raise the ECNL at any point in the
township outside the boundaries of the property on which it is located by more
than 10 dB.
         (4)   Measurement Equipment. All noise level measurements shall be
made using a sound level meter meeting American National Standard Specification
for Sound Level Meters (ANSI S1.4-1983 (R2001)/ANSI S 1.4A-1985 or the current
revision of that standard) for Type 1 or Type 2 instruments. The instrument
shall have been field calibrated according to the manufacturer’s directions
within the periodicity required by the manufacturer prior to the measurements.
All measurements shall be taken using the FAST response time and A-weighting.
For automatic recording instruments, a calibration mark shall be recorded
before the start of any measurements, and reported with the other data.
         (5)   Investigation of Complaints.
            (a)   The Zoning Officer shall first determine that the complaint
is valid by visiting the site of the complaint and the site of the suspect
source. If the nature of the sound at the site of the complaint is not similar
to the nature of the sound produced by the suspect source, and if the
subjective noise levels do not correlate with the operation of the suspect
source, then the Zoning Officer shall file a report noting those observations,
and shall notify the complainant and the operator of the suspect source that
the complaint has not been validated.
            (b)   If, by the nature of the sound, or correlation with the
operation of the suspect noise source, the Zoning Officer determines a
complaint to be valid, the Zoning Officer shall arrange a date and time with
the complainant and the owner/operator of the suspect source to conduct a test.
The test should be close to the time of day and day of week of the complaint,
but shall not represent an unreasonable burden on the complainant or the owner/
operator of the suspect source.
            (c)   The Zoning Officer shall conduct a background noise level
measurement before and after the operation of the suspect source. At the
direction of the Zoning Officer, the owner/operator of the suspect source shall
operate the equipment according to normal operating procedures according to
design limits, or the maximum approved limits of the conditional use approval,
whichever is lower, for the duration of the test.
The owner/operator may be required to operate the equipment in any mode or for
any use that the equipment is normally or occasionally used. The owner/operator
shall not be required to operate the equipment in any manner inconsistent with
the design or normal use, nor in any unsafe manner.
   The background noise level shall be the power weighted average of the two
background level measurements, calculated using the formula:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/0a02454980a9de5438dabbfdc44e58c739f9f418/
IMAGES/0-0-0-30.png]
         (6)   Measurement of Background Environmental Noise Levels. The
background environmental noise level shall be measured without the suspect
source in operation. The weather conditions at the time of measurement shall be
as near the weather conditions reported at the time of the complaint (wind
direction and speed, temperature, temperature gradient, etc.). Background
activities shall be representative of those expected in the neighborhood for
the time of day and day of the week.
   Measurements of the background environmental noise level shall be made for
the length of time the suspected offending source will be in operation, but
need not be any longer than 15 minutes. If manual measurements are being taken,
the measurements shall be recorded every 15 seconds. If an automatic recording
device is being used, the recording interval shall be one second, or the
closest fixed or variable interval allowed by the meter and recording
equipment.
         (7)   Operation of Intentional Radiators for Test. The environmental
noise level with an intentional radiator shall be measured with the suspect
source in operation according to the following options:
            (a)   Mechanical or pneumatic sources shall be operated at the
design speed, amplitude or pressure, and with all units in operation (depending
on the equipment specification), or the approved speed, amplitude or pressure,
and with the maximum number of units allowed from the conditional use approval.
            (b)   Electrical powered sources shall be operated from the normal
power supply at the design voltage, or the approved supply voltage from the
conditional use approval.
            (c)   Electronic sources shall be operated from the normal power
supply, at the design power output, into the design load, with all normally
connected speakers in operation. If the system is subject to a conditional use
approval, the system shall be operated at the approved power output, not the
design power output. If the program is selectable, a 1000 Hz tone or the
closest available constant level signal shall be selected for the test.
         (8)   Measurement of Intentional Radiators. The weather conditions at
the time of measurement should be as near as possible to the weather conditions
reported at the time of the complaint (wind direction and speed, temperature,
emperature gradient, etc.). Background activities should be representative of
those expected in the neighborhood for the time of day and day of the week.
These measurements should be conducted within a few minutes of obtaining the
background noise level measurements.
   Measurements of the equivalent continuous noise level with the suspect
source in operation shall be made for the length of time the suspect source
will normally be in operation, but in any case shall not be less than 2
minutes, and need not be longer than 10 minutes. If manual measurements are
being taken, the measurements shall be recorded every 10 seconds. If an
automatic recording device is being used, the recording interval shall be one
second, or the closest fixed or variable interval allowed by the meter and
recording equipment.
         (9)   Operation of Unintentional Radiators for Test. The environmental
noise level with an unintentional radiator shall be measured with the suspect
source in operation at its design or approved conditional use capacity (tons
per hour, cubic feet per minute, etc.), with design supply conditions (voltage,
current, pressure, speed, etc.).
         (10)   Measurement of Unintentional Radiators. The weather conditions
at the time of measurement should be as near as possible to the weather
conditions reported at the time of the complaint (wind direction and speed,
temperature, temperature gradient, etc.). Background activities should be
representative of those expected in the neighborhood for the time of day and
day of the week. These measurements should be conducted within a few minutes of
obtaining the background noise level measurements.
   Measurements of the equivalent continuous noise level with the suspect
source in operation shall be made for the length of time the source will
normally be in operation, but in any case shall not be less than 5 minutes, and
need not be any longer than 15 minutes. If manual measurements are being taken,
the measurements shall be recorded every 15 seconds. If an automatic recording
device is being used, the recording interval shall be one second, or the
closest fixed or variable interval allowed by the meter and recording
equipment.
         (11)   Report. The Zoning Officer’s report shall include:
            (a)   The instrument type, serial number, field calibration date,
time, background noise level, calibration level and any adjustments made during
the most recent field calibration of the sound level meter.
            (b)   The type and serial number of the field calibrator used at
the last field calibration of the sound level meter.
            (c)   The location of the environmental noise level measurements,
by latitude and longitude or by other descriptive terms that would allow
someone unfamiliar with the complaint to locate, unambiguously, the measurement
point on the ground, or on a map.
            (d)   The location of the suspect source, by latitude and longitude
or by other descriptive terms that would allow someone unfamiliar with the
complaint to locate, unambiguously, the measurement point on the ground, or on
a map.
            (e)   A description of the suspect source in operation, sufficient
to allow someone to recreate the conditions of the test.
            (f)   The weather conditions at the time of measurement, including
temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, cloud cover, and an
impression of the temperature gradient.
            (g)   The time at which background environmental noise level
measurements were started and stopped.
            (h)   The time at which the operation of the suspect source was
started and stopped, and when measurements were started and stopped.
            (i)   For manual measurements:
               1)   A table of times and sound levels as reported on the meter.
               2)   The calculated ECNL for each set of measurements.
            (j)   For automatic measurements:
               1)   A notation of the time the instrument was started and the
time stopped.
               2)   The reported ECNL.
               3)   If the instrument can report each data point, an electronic
form of the data, including each measurement time and level, and a description
of the data format shall be retained as a supplement to the report.
               4)   A calibration mark using the field calibrator.
            (k)   A list of witnesses or other persons present during the
measurements.
            (l)   Any additional comments from the complainant, witnesses or
the operator/owner of the suspect equipment or sources.
         (12)   Studies for Proposed Use. Applicants for a specific proposed
use shall be required to demonstrate that the proposed use will not violate the
standards in this paragraph .B by providing documentary evidence as follows:
            (a)   Engineering studies which estimate the environmental noise
levels from the proposed equipment operations and the impact of mitigation
measures applied to the equipment and/or site.
            (b)   Environmental noise measurements from similar operations and
sites (same number and types of equipment, comparable topography and prevailing
weather conditions).
   Given the inherent vagaries of acoustic predictions and the variability of
acoustic measurements, the Board of Supervisors may apply conditions which are
more conservative than would be indicated by the studies. In any case, the
acceptance of proposed control or mitigation measures does not relieve the
applicant from complying with the standards provided in this chapter and/or a
conditional use approval.
         (13)   Exceptions. These standards do not apply to:
            (a)   Radiated noise levels for vehicles or other operations
subject to State or Federal preemption, however, the operators of violating
sources may offer modifications to radiated noise levels of equipment as a
curative means.
            (b)   The operation of lawn mowers, leaf blowers, string trimmers,
chain saws, and other small yard maintenance equipment between 8 a.m. and 6
p.m. local time.
            (c)   Emergency equipment and signals.
            (d)   Emergency operations of any kind, including, but not limited
to, road repairs, utility repairs, response to accidents, injuries, fires,
flooding, or hazardous material spills.
            (e)   Short duration activities such as construction or repair of
facilities or infrastructure.
[Ord. 2-2010]
      C.   Vibration Control. Operating or permitting the operations of any
device that creates vibration which is above the vibration perception threshold
of an individual at or beyond the property boundary of the source if on private
property or at 50 feet from the source if on a public space or public right-of-
way shall be prohibited. For the purposes of this Section, “vibration
perception threshold” means the minimum ground or structure borne vibrational
motion necessary to cause a normal person to be aware of the vibration by such
direct means as, but not limited to, sensation by touch or visual observation
of moving objects.
      D.   Outdoor Storage Control.
         (1)   No flammable or explosive Liquids, solids, or gases shall be
stored in bulk above the ground except for tanks or drums of fuel directly
connecting with energy devices, heating devices, or appliances located and
operated on the same lot as the tanks or drums of fuel.
         (2)   All outdoor storage facilities for fuel, raw materials, and
products stored outdoors, including those permitted in subparagraph (1) above,
shall be enclosed by a fence of a type, construction and size as shall be
adequate to protect and conceal the facilities from any adjacent properties.
Fencing shall not only encompass the question of safety but also of screening
and the screening shall preferably be evergreens. All National Office of Safety
and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations shall be met.
         (3)   No materials or wastes shall be deposited upon a lot in such
form or manner that they may be transported off by natural causes or forces,
nor shall any substance which can contaminate a stream or watercourse or
otherwise render such stream or watercourse undesirable as a source of water
supply or recreation, or which will destroy aquatic life, be allowed to enter
any stream or watercourse. Applicable Department of Environmental Protection
regulations shall apply. [Ord. 3-2008]
         (4)   All materials or wastes which might cause fumes or dust, or
which constitute a fire hazard, or which may be edible or otherwise attractive
to rodents or insects, shall be stored outdoors only if enclosed in containers
adequate to eliminate such hazards. Applicable Pennsylvania regulations and
National OSHA regulations shall apply.
      E.   Sewage Waste Treatment and Disposal Control. All methods of sewage
and waste treatment and disposal shall be approved by the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection and in accordance with the sewage plan
for the Township. The standards of such regulations, or the following,
whichever is more restrictive, shall apply. [Ord. 3-2008]
         (1)   There shall be no discharge of any toxic substance, gasoline,
benzene, naphtha, fuel, oil, or other flammable or explosive liquid, solid or

apply:
      A.   Off-Street Parking. All areas for off-street parking, off-street
loading and unloading, and the storage or movement of motor vehicles shall be
physically separated from the highway or street by a raised curb, planting
strip, wall, or other suitable barrier against unchanneled motor vehicle
entrance or exit, except for necessary accessways or access roads which supply
entrance to and egress from such parking, loading or storage area. All parking
areas or lots shall be designed to prohibit vehicles from backing out on the
street, and the capacity of each lot shall provide adequate storage area and
distribution facilities upon the lot to prevent back-up of vehicles on a public
street while awaiting entry to the lot.
      B.   Access. Each use with less than 100 feet of frontage on a public
street shall have not more than one accessway to each such street, and no
business or other use with 100 feet or more of frontage on a public street
shall have more than two accessways to any one street for each 300 feet of
frontage. Where practicable, access to parking areas shall be provided by a
common service driveway or minor street in order to avoid direct access to a
major street.
      C.   Large Developments. In the case of a shopping center, office
complex, group of multiple family dwellings or similar grouping or buildings on
a lot, and in any other case where practicable:
         (1)   All buildings shall front upon a marginal access street, service
road, common parking lot or similar area and not directly upon a public street.
         (2)   All points of vehicular access to and from a public street shall
be located not less than 200 feet from the intersection of any public street
lines with each other, provided, however, that such a point of vehicular
access, which in effect converts a “T” intersection into an intersection of two
streets which cross one another, shall be permitted.
         (3)   Provision shall be made for safe and efficient ingress and
egress to and from public streets and highways serving the unified development,
without undue congestion to, or interference with normal traffic flow within
the Township.
         (4)   All streets and accessways shall conform to the specifications
determined by the Township Engineer and the requirements of the Township
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance [
Chapter 22]. Provision shall be made for adequate signalization, turn, standby
and declaration lanes, and similar facilities where desirable.
      D.   Nighttime Illumination. All driveways, aisles, maneuvering spaces,
vehicular service areas or spaces between or about buildings, designed for use
by more than three cars after dusk, other than those related to an individual
dwelling, shall be illuminated during night hours in accordance with the
recommendations of the Society of Illuminating Engineers, at no cost to the
Township. All lighting shall be arranged to prevent glare into adjoining
properties and streets.

of §
27-705.4.A.
         (2)   Contiguous nonconforming lots under the same ownership shall not
be separated or subdivided if a lot or parcel area or dimension nonconformance

integral parcel or lot at time of sale or transfer of such parcels or at the
time of application for a zoning or building permit.
      C.   Nonconforming Uses. Nonconforming uses shall not be altered,
reconstructed, extended or enlarged, except in accordance with the following

         (3)   Any increase in volume or area of any building structure or lot
area used by a nonconforming use shall not exceed an aggregate of more than 50
percent of volume or floor area or lot area in use at the time of enactment of
this Chapter during the life of the nonconformity. [Ord. 1-1996]
         (4)   Any nonconforming use which increases its activity through
occupancy, business volume, clientele, traffic or otherwise, more than an
aggregate of 20 percent from the date of adoption of this Chapter shall be
required to submit plans and other required supplemental information to the
Zoning Officer indicating that the nonconforming use will meet all applicable
parking, signage, general performance standards and other applicable
regulations to the greatest extent possible. [Ord. 2-2003]
      D.   Restoration. A nonconforming building or any building containing a
nonconforming use wholly or partially destroyed by fire, explosion, flood or
other phenomenon, or legally condemned, may be reconstructed and used for the
same nonconforming use, provided that reconstruction of the building shall be
commenced within 1 year from the date the building was destroyed or condemned
and shall be carried on without interruption or else the nonconforming building
or use shall be deemed to be abandoned.
      E.   Ownership. Whenever a lot is sold to a new owner, a previously
lawful nonconforming use may be continued by the new owner. However, the new
owner shall re-register the nonconforming use within 60 days after final
settlement.
      F.   Abandonment. If a nonconforming use of a building or land is
discontinued or abandoned for 12 consecutive months, subsequent use of such
building or land shall conform with the regulations of the district in which it
is located, unless another nonconforming use is approved by the Zoning Hearing

changed to another nonconforming use only if permitted as a special exception
by the Zoning Hearing Board and subject to the following conditions:
         (1)   The applicant shall show that a nonconforming use cannot
reasonably be changed to a conforming use.
         (2)   The applicant shall show that the proposed change will be
equally less objectionable in external effects than the existing nonconforming
use, with respect to or more appropriate than the existing nonconforming use
with regard to:
            (a)   Traffic generation and congestion including truck, passenger
car, bicycle and pedestrian traffic.
            (b)   Noise, smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, gases, heat, odor, glare

Note: SFGFA means "square feet of gross floor area" which is the total area of a building
calculated by taking the outside dimensions of the building at each floor level intended for
occupancy or storage and summing the areas.
 
      B.   Land Use Category. The parking provided for the proposed use shall
be based on the most similar use listed as determined by the Zoning Officer.
      C.   Residential. The number of parking spaces provided for residential
uses shall equal the number required by the Parking Space Table.
      D.   Nonresidential.
         (1)   85% Provided. The number of parking spaces provided shall be 85%
of the spaces required by the Parking Space Table.
         (2)   Space Reserved. Space shall be reserved to allow for expansion
to the total number of spaces required by the Parking Space Table.
   2.   Township Required Reduction. In the case of parking for new uses, if
the Township determines that the number of parking spaces required by this Part
8 is not necessarily required to meet the immediate needs of the proposed use,
the Township may require the number of spaces provided to be reduced by a
maximum of 25 percent. The developer shall dedicate sufficient and suitable
area to future parking to meet the normal standards in this Part 8.
   3.   Reserved Parking Disturbance and Stormwater. The reserve parking areas
shall remain undisturbed or shall be landscaped, but shall be included in the
calculations of lot coverage area and for stormwater management. The stormwater
facilities shall be constructed in accord with the approved sequencing design
as parking areas are constructed.
   4.   Form of Reservation. Each parking reservation shall be in a form
acceptable to the Township Solicitor that legally binds current and future
owners of the land to keep the reserved parking area in open space and, if the
Township determines it is necessary, to provide the additional parking in the
time and manner as stipulated in the reservation document. Proof of recording
of the agreement shall also be provided to the Township before the issuance of
a zoning permit for the project.
   5.   Multiple Uses (See also §
27-812.). For projects involving more than one use and/or structure the total
number of parking spaces required shall be determined by summing the number of
spaces for each individual use.
   6.   Handicapped Parking. Parking for the handicapped shall be provided in
accord with the Americans With Disabilities Act and shall count as part of the
spaces required for the use by this Part 8.
   7.   Applicant Proposed Reduction. The required number of parking spaces may
be reduced subject to conditional use approval by the Board of Supervisors. The
applicant shall provide evidence justifying the proposed reduced number of
spaces, such as studies of similar developments during peak hours. The
applicant shall also provide relevant data, such as number of employees and
peak expected number of customers/visitors. Any conditional use approval to
permit such decrease shall be subject to the following:
      A.   Ordinance and Plan Consistency. The project design and parking space
decrease shall be consistent with the purposes contained in this Chapter and
the goals and objectives of the Township Comprehensive Plan.
      B.   Quality of Design. The applicant shall demonstrate to the Board of
Supervisors that the proposed decrease will result in an adequate number of
parking spaces for the use based on a specific study of the parking demands for
the proposed use or empirical data reported by a generally accepted source such
as the Institute of Transportation Engineers, the Urban Land Institute, the
American Planning Association, or similar entity.
      C.   Local Conditions. In making its determination the Board of
Supervisors shall also consider, among others, the demographics and character
of the neighborhood, demographics of targeted customers and employees,
availability of mass transit, existing on-street parking conditions, and any
employer instituted transportation demand management programs.
      D.   Burden; Conditions. If the Board of Supervisors, in its sole
discretion, determines that the applicant has met the burden of proof, it may
grant a conditional use for the decrease. The Board of Supervisors may impose
such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure the objectives and purposes of
this Chapter, including, but not limited to, reserving parking.

§ 27-807.   Loading and Unloading Areas.
   1.   Type and Size. In addition to the required off-street parking spaces
all uses shall provide adequate off-street areas for loading and unloading of
vehicles where necessary. The applicant shall provide details on the type and
frequency of vehicles operating in connection with the proposed use to justify
any necessary loading and unloading areas. Each required space shall meet the
following dimensions:
 
Largest Type of Truck Service Minimum Width (feet) Minimum Length (feet)
Tractor trailer               12                   50 with 14 ft clear height
Trucks other than tractor     10                   25
trailers, pick-ups or vans
Pick-up truck or van          9                    18
 
   2.   Interior Travelways. The applicant shall demonstrate that travelways
within the property are adequate to safely and efficiently serve vehicles which
are reasonably expected to visit the property. Turning radius templates
developed by the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials
(AASHTO) shall serve as the design standard.
(Ord. 2-2011, 11/10/2011, Item 3)
§ 27-808.   Access To Off-Street Parking and Loading Areas.
   There shall be adequate provisions for ingress and egress to all parking and
loading spaces designed for use by employees, customers, delivery services,
sales people and/or the general public. Access to and from all off-street
parking, loading and vehicle service areas along public rights-of-way shall
consist of well-defined separate or common entrances and exits and shall comply
with the following provisions:
   1.   Width. Unless otherwise required by Penn DOT for access to a state
road, the width of the driveway/access way onto a public street at the right-
of-way shall be as follows:
 
WIDTH*  1-Way Use 2-Way Use
Minimum 12 feet   20 feet
Maximum 35 feet   50 feet
*exclusive of the turning radius
 
   2.   Controlled Access. Each entrance and exit shall be clearly defined with
curbing, fencing, landscaping or vegetative screening so as to prevent access
to the area from other than the defined entrance and exit.
   3.   Highway Occupancy Permit. All new uses shall be required to obtain a
highway occupancy permit from the Township or PA DOT, as the case may be. In
the case of a change in use or the expansion of an existing use, the Township
shall require the applicant to obtain a highway occupancy permit or a revised
highway occupancy permit. Where a use accesses the public right-of-way via a
private road, the highway occupancy permit requirement and criteria shall be
applied at the public right-of-way intersection.
(Ord. 2-2011, 11/10/2011, Item 3)
§ 27-809.   Parking and Loading Area Setbacks.
   1.   Roads and Property Lines. All parking and loading areas (not including
parking decks) and parallel circulation and service lanes serving any
commercial, industrial, institutional or multi-family use shall be separated
from any public road right-of-way or adjoining property lines by a landscaped
buffer area not less than 20 feet in width unless adjoining uses share parking
in accord with §
27-812.
      A.   Measurement. The width of the buffer shall be measured from property
lines and from the curb line or from the legal right-of-way line after
development if no curbs will be provided.
      B.   Uses Prohibited. The buffer area shall be maintained in natural
vegetative ground cover and shall not include:
         (1)   Paving except for approved driveway/access way crossings
         (2)   Fences unless integral to landscaping
         (3)   Parking, storage or display of vehicles
         (4)   Items for sale or rent
      C.   Uses Permitted. The buffer area may include the following:
         (1)   Permitted freestanding signs
         (2)   Pervious storm water facilities
         (3)   Approved driveway/access way crossings
      D.   Sidewalks. Sidewalks, existing or proposed, may be included in the
buffer area.
   2.   Buildings. Parking spaces serving principal nonresidential buildings
and multi-family dwellings shall be located a minimum of 10 feet from any
building wall, unless a larger distance is required by another ordinance
provision. This distance does not apply at vehicle entrances into or under a
building.
(Ord. 2-2011, 11/10/2011, Item 3)
§ 27-810.   Grading and Drainage; Paving.
   1.   Parking and loading facilities, including driveways, shall be graded
and adequately drained to prevent erosion or excessive water flow across
streets or adjoining properties.
   2.   Except for landscaped areas, all portions of required parking, loading
facilities and access ways shall be surfaced with a durable surface of crushed
stone, gravel, asphalt, concrete, paving block or porous pavement or pavers.
(Ord. 2-2011, 11/10/2011, Item 3)
§ 27-811.   Off-Lot Parking.
   Required parking may be provided on a different lot than on the lot on which
the principal use is located, provided the parking is not more than 400 feet
from the principal use lot. Off-lot parking areas shall be permitted only in a
district where the principal use is permitted. Both parcels shall be under the
same control, either by deed or long-term lease, as the property occupied by
such principal use, and the owner shall be bound by covenants of record filed
in the office of the County Recorder of Deeds requiring the owner and his or
her heirs and assigns to maintain the required number of off-street parking
spaces during the existence of said principal use.
(Ord. 2-2011, 11/10/2011, Item 3)
§ 27-812.   Joint Use Parking.
   In the case of multiple use on the same premises or where more than one
principal uses share a common property line, shared parking facilities may be
approved by the Zoning Officer.
   1.   Documentation. The applicant shall provide information to establish
that the shared spaces will be used at different times of the day, week, month,
and/or year.
   2.   Reduction. Parking provided may be credited to both uses based on the
extent that the uses operate at different times. However, the required parking
shall not be reduced by more than 50 percent of the combined parking required
for each use. (Example: If a church parking lot is generally occupied only to
10 percent of capacity on days other than a Sunday, another development not
operating on a Sunday could make use of the unused church lot spaces on
weekdays.)
   3.   Agreement. Joint use parking shall be secured in a form acceptable to
the Township Solicitor that legally binds current and future owners of the land
to maintain the parking. An attested copy of the agreement between the owners
of record shall be provided to the Township. Proof of recording of the
agreement shall also be provided to the Township before the issuance of a
zoning permit for the project.
   4.   Common Property Line. The joint-use parking area may span a common
property line thereby eliminating the setback required in §
27-809.
(Ord. 2-2011, 11/10/2011, Item 3)
Part 9
Signs
§ 27-901.   Administration.
   1.   Administration. The purpose of this Part 9 is to establish standards
for the regulation of signs in order to safeguard the public interest and:
      A.   to preserve the beauty and the unique character of the Township;
      B.   to promote and aid in the tourist industry of the Township;
      C.   to protect the general public from damage and injury which may be
caused by the faulty construction of signs;
      D.   to protect pedestrians and motorists from damage of injury caused,
or partially attributable to the distractions and obstructions caused by
improperly situated signs;
      E.   to promote the public safety, welfare, convenience and enjoyment of
travel and the free flow of traffic;
      F.   to assure that signs are clear and provide the essential identity or
direction to facilities in the community; and,
      G.   to enable the fair and consistent enforcement of the sign
restrictions throughout the Township.
   2.   Applicability - Effect. A sign may be erected, placed, established,
painted, created or maintained in the Township only in conformance with the
standards, procedures, exceptions, and other requirements of this Chapter. The
effect of this Chapter as more specifically set forth herein is:
      A.   to establish a permit system to allow a variety of types of signs in
the various zones, subject to the standards and the permit procedures of this
Chapter;
      B.   to allow certain signs that are small, unobtrusive, and incidental
to the principal use of the respective lots on which they are located, subject
to the substantive requirements of this Chapter, but without a requirement for
permits;
      C.   to provide for temporary signs without commercial messages in
limited circumstances in the public right-of-way; and,
      D.   to prohibit all signs not expressly permitted by this Chapter.
   3.   Requirement of Conformity. No sign, for which a permit is issued after
the effective date of this Chapter, may be placed or maintained in the Township
except as provided herein. All signs maintained contrary to the provisions of
this Chapter are declared to be nuisances, and as such may be abated as
provided by law.
   4.   Recommended Types of Signs. It is recommended that signs be:
      A.   Wood or simulated wood relief. (See §
27-904.15.)
      B.   Designed as an integral architectural element of the building and
component of the site.
      C.   Comprised of restrained colors, materials, and lighting and
compatible with the building and site, and rural character of the Township.
      D.   Not more than a height of 15 feet.

the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on
the zone lot, whichever is lower.

§ 27-1009.   Zoning Hearing Board Functions.
   The Zoning Hearing Board shall be responsible for the following:
      A.   Appeals from Zoning Officer Action. The Board shall hear and decide
appeals where it is alleged by the appellant that the Zoning Officer has failed
to follow prescribed procedures, or has misinterpreted or misapplied any valid
provision of this Chapter or any valid rule or regulation governing the action
of the Zoning Officer. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to deny the
appellant the right to proceed directly in court, pursuant to Pa. R.C.P. 1091
relating to action in mandamus.
      B.   Appeals from a Determination by the Township Engineer. The Board
shall hear and decide appeals from a determination by the Township Engineer
with reference to the administration of floodplain or flood hazard provisions
and sedimentation and erosion control and storm management provisions of this
Chapter as they relate to development not involving applications under the
Township Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance [
Chapter 22] or Planned Residential Development Ordinance provisions.
      C.   Challenge to the Validity of any Ordinance or Map. The Board shall
hear challenges to the validity of this Chapter. At the conclusion of the
hearing, the Board shall decide all contested questions and shall make findings
on all relevant issues of fact which shall become part of the record on appeal
to the court.
      D.   Variances. The Board shall hear requests for variances, which allege
that the provisions of this Chapter inflict unnecessary hardship upon the
applicant. The Board may grant a variance if all of the following findings,
where relevant, are made:
         (1)   There are unique physical circumstances or conditions (including
irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property)
and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of this Chapter
in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
         (2)   Because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of this Chapter, and a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
         (3)   Such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant.
         (4)   The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
         (5)   The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance
that will afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of
the regulation in issue.
   In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions
and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this
Chapter.
      E.   Special Exceptions. The Board shall hear and decide requests for all
special exceptions as provided in this Chapter and in accordance with such
standards and criteria contained in this Chapter. In granting a special
exception, the Zoning Hearing Board may attach such reasonable conditions and
safeguards, in addition to those expressed in this Chapter, as it may deem
necessary to implement the purposes and intent of this Chapter.
      F.   Records and Reports. The Board shall keep full public records of its
business and shall submit an annual report of its activities to the Board of
Supervisors.
      G.   Zoning Hearing Board; Hearings and Decisions. The Zoning Hearing
Board shall conduct hearings and make decisions in accordance with §908 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §10908, as amended, and the
provisions of this paragraph .G. The hearings shall be conducted by the Board
or the Board may appoint any member or an independent attorney as a hearing
officer. The decision, or, where no decision is called for, the findings shall
be made by the Board; however, the appellant or the applicant, as the case may
be, in addition to the Township, may, prior to the decision of the hearing,
waive decision or findings by the Board and accept the decision or findings of
the hearing officer as final. (For the purposes of this Section “Board” shall
mean “Board or Hearing Officer,” if a hearing officer is appointed.)
         (1)   Notice of Hearings. Notice of all hearings of the Board shall be
given as follows:
            (a)   Advertisement. Public notice shall be published, as defined
by §107 of the Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §10107. The notice shall

the applicant or his/her representative listed on an official application form.
               2)   Notice may be delivered or mailed to the chairperson of the
Planning Commission or Township Secretary, and the last known address of owners
of record of property abutting or directly across the street from the
boundaries of the subject property. The applicant shall provide the Township
with a list of such property owners. Failure of the Township to notify all such
persons shall not invalidate any action by the Board.
               3)   Also, such notice shall be mailed or delivered to the
address of any other person or group (including civic or community
organizations)who has made a written timely request (including an address) for
such notice.
                  d)   Adjacent Municipalities. In any matter which relates to
a lot which lies within 250 feet of the boundary of another municipality, and
where the Zoning Officer determines the proposed activity may have significant
impact on that municipality, the Township staff may transmit to the a copy of
the official notice of the public hearing on such matter prior to the hearing
date. Representatives of such adjacent municipality shall have the right to
appear and be heard at the public hearing. Failure of the Township to notify
such municipality shall not invalidate any action by the Board.
                  e)   Fees. The Board of Supervisors may, by resolution,
establish a reasonable fee schedule, based on cost, to be paid by: 1) the

Part 11
Conservation Subdivision Design Development
(DEVELOPER'S OPTION)
§ 27-1101.   Concept.
   A key concept associated with conservation subdivision design is to focus on
residential density instead of minimum lot size. In a standard subdivision the
land is simply cut into as many lots as possible while meeting the minimum lot
size requirement. Under conservation subdivision design, which is based on unit
density instead of minimum lot size, the size of individual lots sold can vary
in size, provided the total number of lots does not exceed the density which is
based on the underlying minimum lot size. In conservation subdivision design,
the maximum lot size is the critical element, as it really defines the minimum
open space that must be conserved.
(Ord. 2-2011, 11/10/2011, Item 2)
§ 27-1102.   Conservation Subdivision Design Development (DEVELOPER'S OPTION).
   Conservation design development may be used in accord with this Part 11 at
the developer's option in all zoning districts where single-family dwellings
are permitted.
(Ord. 2-2011, 11/10/2011, Item 2)
§ 27-1103.   Purpose, Development Options, Applicability and Design Process.
   1.   Purpose. In addition to the general community development objectives in
§
27-201 and the intents for individual zoning districts, it is the purpose of
Conservation Subdivision Design Development to:
      A.   Conserve undeveloped land for the purpose of protecting Primary and
Secondary Conservation Areas in contiguous, un-fragmented, commonly managed
landscapes to:
         (1)   Protect large, intact wildlife habitat areas and connect patches
of wildlife habitat to support greater biodiversity, maintain ecosystem
processes and allow larger, healthier populations to persist; and
         (2)   Minimize edge conditions and associated colonization by invasive
plant species.
      B.   Contribute to the creation of a community-wide Conservation Open
Space system for the benefit of present and future residents;
      C.   Protect productive agricultural and silvicultural soils for
continued or future use by conserving blocks of land large enough to allow for
efficient production operations;
      D.   Conserve existing landscape character by minimizing views of new
development from existing roads, thereby reducing perceived density;
      E.   Encourage innovation and promote flexibility, economy and ingenuity
in development;
      F.   Provide multiple development options for landowners to reflect their
varying circumstances and the individual characteristics of their properties;
      G.   Provide for a diversity of lot sizes, building densities, and
housing choices to accommodate a variety of age and income groups, and
residential preferences;
      H.   Provide homes with direct views of Conservation Open Space,
organized around common greens;
      I.   Provide for the conservation and maintenance of Conservation Open
Space and for active or passive recreational use by residents;
      J.   Provide greater efficiency in the siting of services and
infrastructure, including the opportunity to reduce length of roads, utility
runs, and the impervious cover required for residential development;
      K.   Provide a wider range of feasible locations for stormwater and
wastewater facilities in order to comply with prevailing state-of-the-art
designs and best management practices;
      L.   Protect water quality and reduce erosion and sedimentation by
retaining existing vegetation and minimizing development on steep slopes;
      M.   Implement land use, natural resource conservation, open space, and
community policies set forth in the Township's Comprehensive plan.
   2.   Conservation Subdivision Design Development Options.  In order to
achieve the purposes in §
27-1103.1, this §
27-1103.2 provides for flexibility in designing new residential subdivisions by
permitting the following by right (permitted use) development options:
      A.   Option 1 - Basic Density and Basic Conservation providing for
residential lots/units at the density permitted by the Density and Conservation
Open Space Table in §
27-1106 with not less than 40 percent of the tract comprised of conservation
open space.
      B.   Option 2 - Increased Density with Increased Conservation providing
residential lots/units at the density permitted by the Density Standards Table
in §
27-1106 with not less than 50 percent of the tract comprised of conservation
open space.
      C.   Option 3 - Greater Density with Greater Conservation providing
residential lots/units at the density permitted by the Density Standards Table
in §
27-1106 with not less than 55 percent of the tract comprised of conservation
open space.
   3.   Conservation Design Process - All Conservation Subdivision Design
Developments shall be designed using the Four-Step Conservation Design Process
in accord with
Chapter 22 (Subdivision and Land Development).
(Ord. 2-2011, 11/10/2011, Item 2)
§ 27-1104.   General Regulations.
   The design of all new Conservation Subdivision Design Developments shall be
governed by the following minimum standards:
   1.   Tract Size and Ownership - The development tract shall be a minimum of
10 acres and shall be held in single ownership.
   2.   Primary Conservation Areas - The proposed design shall conserve the
Primary Conservation Areas. Demonstration by the applicant that these features
are conserved by the proposed design shall be prerequisite to all preliminary
and final plan approvals under
Chapter 22 (Subdivision and Land Development). Primary Conservation Areas
include:
      A.   Delineated wetlands.
      B.   Floodplain (including the floodway) as shown on the Township Flood
Insurance Rate Map.
      C.   Slopes of 25 percent or more.
   3.   Secondary Conservation Areas - The protection of Secondary Conservation
Areas shall be addressed through the Four-Step Design Process detailed in
Chapter 22 (Subdivision and Land Development).
(Ord. 2-2011, 11/10/2011, Item 2)
§ 27-1105.   Use Regulations.
   The following uses shall be permitted in Option 1, Option 2 and Option 3
Conservation Subdivision Design Developments:
   1.   Single-family detached dwellings.
   2.   Two-family dwelling units or townhouses.
   3.   Conservation Open Space with the uses permitted by §
27-1109.
   4.   Home occupations in accord with this
Chapter 27.
   5.   Accessory uses on the same lot with and in accord with applicable
district regulations.
(Ord. 2-2011, 11/10/2011, Item 2)
§ 27-1106.   Maximum Dwelling Units and Minimum Conservation Open Space.
   1.   Dwelling Units. The maximum number of dwelling units shall be
determined by using one of two approaches: a calculation using the density
factor in the Density and Conservation Open Space Table and the formulas in §
27-1106.4, or by a Yield Plan detailed in §
27-1106.5. The applicant shall determine which approach is most suitable.
   2.   Conservation Open Space.  The minimum Conservation Open Space shall be
as set forth in the Density and Conservation Open Space Table, regardless of
which method is used to determine the maximum number of dwelling units.
      A.   Delineation. Conservation Open Space shall be delineated to include
all Primary Conservation Areas and, in addition, sufficient Secondary
Conservation Areas that, when added to the Primary Conservation Areas, shall
not be less than the minimum required Conservation Open Space.
      B.   Common Greens. Part of the required (or provided, if not required)
Conservation Open Space may be in the form of common greens. If provided, the
percentage of open space in common greens shall be as follows:
         (1)   A minimum of 2 percent of the required Conservation Open Space
when the average lot size is 15,000 square feet or more.
         (2)   A minimum of 3 percent of the required Conservation Open Space
when the average lot size is less than 15,000 square feet.
         (3)   A maximum of 5 percent of the required Conservation Open Space.
   3.   Reserved
   4.   Adjusted Tract Area Approach. Determination of the maximum number of
dwelling units shall be based upon the following calculations:
      A.   Determine Gross Tract Area. Gross tract area shall equal the acreage
within the legally described parcel minus existing public or private road
rights-of-way.
      B.   Determine Constrained Land. Constrained land consists of the
resources listed in the Constrained Land Table multiplied by a protection
factor and totalled. If 2 or more resources overlap, only the resource with the
highest protection factor shall be used.

   5.   Yield Plan Approach (applicable to Options 1, 2 and 3)
      A.   Number of Units Permitted
         (1)   Option 1 - For Option 1, the maximum number of dwelling units
shall be determined by a layout with conventional lotting using the standards
in
Schedule 27-2. The number of units permitted in the Conservation Subdivision
Design Development shall equal the number of units on the Yield Plan, provided
it meets the requirements of this section and
Chapter 22 (Subdivision and Land Development) applicable to conventional
subdivisions.
         (2)   Option 2 - For Option 2, the maximum number of units permitted
shall equal the number of units on an Option 1 Yield Plan, multiplied by a
factor of 1.25 1.
         (3)   Option 3 - For Option 3, the maximum number of units permitted
shall equal the number of units on an Option 1 Yield Plan, multiplied by a
factor of 1.43 2.
      B.   Constrained Lands - For the purposes of meeting the minimum lot size
requirement in the Option 1 Yield Plan the constrained land as calculated in
the Constrained Land Table in §
27-1106.4 shall not be included.
      C.   Plan Requirements.
         (1)   SALDO Requirements - Yield Plans must be prepared in accord with
the standards of
Chapter 22 (Subdivision and Land Development), containing proposed lots,
streets, rights-of-way, and other pertinent features. Although it must be drawn
to scale, it need not be based on a field survey. However, it must be a
realistic layout reflecting a development pattern that could reasonably be
expected to be implemented, taking into account the presence of wetlands,
floodplain, steep slopes, existing easements or encumbrances and, if un-
sewered, the suitability of soils for subsurface sewage disposal.
         (2)   Resource Identification - The Yield Plan must identify the
site's primary and secondary conservation areas, as identified in the Existing
Resources/Site Analysis, and demonstrate that the primary conservation areas
could be successfully absorbed in the development process without disturbance,
by allocating this area to proposed single-family dwelling lots which conform
to the required dimensional standards. The Yield Plan shall be based upon
accurate mapping of wetlands, 100 year floodplain and land with slopes greater
than 15 percent.
         (3)   Individual Sewage Disposal Systems - On sites not served by
central sewage disposal, density shall be further determined by evaluating the
number of homes that could be supported by soils-based individual on-lot sewage
disposal systems. For the purposes of determining density under this Section,
this standard shall exclude holding tanks, individual stream discharge systems
and evapotranspiration systems.
   Based on the Existing Resources/Site Analysis and observations made during
an on-site visit of the property, the Township shall select a 10 percent sample
of the lots considered to be marginal for on-lot sewage disposal. The applicant
shall provide evidence that these lots meet the standards for an individual on-
lot sewage disposal system and system replacement area before the applicant
shall be granted the full density determined by the Yield Plan. Should any of
the lots in a sample fail to meet the standard for individual septic system,
those lots shall be deducted from the yield plan and a second 10 percent sample
shall be selected by the Township and tested for compliance. This process shall
be repeated until all lots in a given sample meet the standard for an
individual soils-based on-lot sewage disposal system.
   6.   Total Number of Dwelling Units - The total number of dwelling units
permitted on a development site equals the maximum number of dwelling units
permitted in §
27-1106.4 (Adjusted Tract Acreage) or §
27-1106.5 (Yield Plan), as selected by the applicant.
   7.   Preservation of Historic Dwellings - To encourage the preservation of
historic dwellings, such preserved dwellings shall not count toward the
permitted maximum number of dwelling units, provided:
      A.   Such dwellings are at least 75 years old;
      B.   The dwelling is preserved in accord with the National Park Service
historic preservation standards; and
      C.   The dwelling is placed in a landscape context that respects its
historical status and appearance, as determined by the Board of Supervisors.
(Ord. 2-2011, 11/10/2011, Item 2)
__________
1   The 1.25 multiplication factor was determined by dividing the Option 1
density factor by the Option 2 density factor (21,780 ÷ 17,425 = 1.25).
2   The 1.43 multiplication factor was determined by dividing the Option 1
density factor by the Option 3 density factor (21,780 ÷ 15,245 = 1.43).

Appendix
   The following ordinances and resolutions are no longer of general interest,
primarily because their provisions were carried out directly after their
enactment. Since they are mainly of historical or administrative interest, it
has not been considered necessary to include their entire text. Instead, they
are arranged in groups, according to subject matter, and within each group
listed by title in chronological order. The content of the ordinances and
resolutions is indexed, in all necessary detail, in the general index at the
end of this volume. The annual budget and tax ordinances have been listed only
in the "Key to the Disposition of Ordinances." Any person who desires to read
the full text of any of the ordinances or resolutions may do so by consulting
