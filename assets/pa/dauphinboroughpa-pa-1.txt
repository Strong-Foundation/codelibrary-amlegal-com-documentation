FOREWORD
History
   This comprises the codification of the ordinances of the Borough of Dauphin.
The Borough of Dauphin was originally settled in the mid 1700's and laid out by
Judge Innis Green in 1826. It was, at that time, known as Port Lyon. The
streets were named after Pennsylvania rivers and creeks. Dauphin was
incorporated as a Borough by an Act of Assembly in 1845.
   The Code of Ordinances of the Borough of Dauphin was prepared by Keystate
Publishers, Inc., and adopted by the Borough of Dauphin Borough Council on
December 4, 2012, by Ord. 2012-03.
Organization
   The Code contains four parts which are (1) the valid current ordinances of
the Borough of Dauphin contained in Chapters 1 through 27, (2) the Appendix,
which lists by abstracted title all ordinances of a temporary or “one time”
nature, (3) the Table of the disposition of each ordinance ever enacted by the
Borough of Dauphin, and (4) the Index, which is an alphabetical arrangement of
subjects.
   In the Code each Chapter is separated by a divider tab, and specific
ordinances can be located by subject on the contents page at the beginning of
each Chapter. The Index may also be used to search for a subject when one is
looking for general information on a particular subject, or if it is not known
in which Chapter the subject might be found. The Appendix consists of several
general categories containing a chronological listing of short subject
descriptions along with a reference to the original ordinance and its date of
enactment, if known.
   The Table of disposition indicates what action has been taken by the Borough
of Dauphin Borough Council with regard to every ordinance ever enacted. An
ordinance has either been (1) specifically repealed, (2) superseded by another
ordinance, (3) is located in a Chapter of the Code book, or (4) is located in
the Appendix. Annual tax rate and budget ordinances are located only in the
Table of Disposition. The Table of Disposition is a cross reference to the
original ordinance books of the Borough of Dauphin, and to the location within
the Code of each ordinance by number.

§ 1-104.   Headings.
   Chapter, Subchapter, Part, Subpart, Section, Subsection, Paragraph, Subpara
graph, Clause, and Subclause headings contained in the Code may not be deemed
to govern, limit, modify or affect the scope, meaning or intent of the Code.
The headings of Sections, Subsections or other divisions of this Code are
intended as mere captions to indicate the contents of the Section, Subsection
or other division and shall not be deemed to be taken as titles of such
Section, Subsection or other division, nor as any part of said Section,
Subsection or other division unless expressly so provided.
(Ord. 2012-03, 12/4/2012)
§ 1-105.   Tenses, Gender and Number.
   Except as may be otherwise stated in any provision of this Code, the present
tense includes the past and future tenses, and the future the present; the
masculine gender includes the feminine and neuter, the feminine includes the
masculine and neuter, and the neuter includes the masculine and feminine; and
the singular includes the plural, and the plural the singular.
(Ord. 2012-03, 12/4/2012)
§ 1-106.   Construction.
   1.   Except as may be otherwise specifically provided by any provision of
this Code, the Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S.A. §1501 et seq.,
shall be applied in construing this Code.
   2.   Effect of Repeal or Expiration of Code Section.
   A.   The repeal of a Code Section or ordinance, or its expiration by virtue
of any provision contained therein, shall not affect any right accrued or any
offense committed, any penalty or punishment incurred, or any proceeding
commenced before the repeal took effect or the ordinance expired.
   B.   When any ordinance repealing a former Code Section, ordinance, clause
or provision shall itself be repealed, such repeal shall not be construed to
revive such former Code Section, ordinance, clause or provision, unless it
shall be expressly so provided.
   3.   Saving Clause. The provisions of this Code, so far as they are the same
as those ordinances and regulations in force immediately prior to the adoption
of this Code, are intended as a continuation of such ordinances, resolutions
and regulations and not as a new enactment. The provisions of this Code shall
not affect any suit or prosecution pending or to be instituted to enforce any
of the prior ordinances or regulations. Except as specifically stated in this
Code or in the ordinance adopting this consolidation, codification and revision
of the ordinances and regulations, it is the intention of the Borough Council
that no ordinance or regulation of the Borough be amended, revised or repealed
by implication.
   4.   Resolutions. The provisions of this Code of Ordinances may contain
resolutions, that is, actions of the Borough Council (in written form and
designated "resolution”) which did not require prior public notice in
accordance with the provisions of the Borough Code, 53 P.S. §45101 et seq., at
the time of their passage by the Borough Council. Such "resolutions” are
included herein for ease of reference and the Borough Council does not intend
by their inclusion herein to require prior public notice before amending,
revising or repealing such resolution or resolutions as may have been included
herein in the future. It is the intention of the Borough Council that such
actions of the Borough Council that may be included in this Code and
specifically cited and designated as a resolution shall not become an ordinance
(requiring prior public notice before amendment, revision or repeal) by the
simple fact of inclusion in this Code.
(Ord. 2012-03, 12/4/2012)
§ 1-107.   Normal Numbering.
   1.   Chapters. Chapters are numbered sequentially in Arabic throughout this
Code.
   2.   Parts. Parts are numbered sequentially in Arabic throughout this Code.
   3.   Whenever other divisions are necessary, Chapters shall be divided into
Subchapters, Parts into Subparts and designated with the Chapter or Part number
followed by a capital letter. For instance, Chapter 1 may be divided into
Subchapters 1A and 1B.
   4.   Sections. Sections are numbered sequentially throughout a Chapter and a
Part such that the first number or numbers is the Chapter number, followed by a
hyphen, followed by the Part number, followed by the Section number within the
Part. For example, "§1-101” designates Chapter 1, Part 1, Section 1. Similarly,
“§27-305” designates Chapter 27, Part 3, Section 5.
   5.   Internal Divisions of Sections. Whenever internal divisions are
necessary, Sections shall be divided into Subsections, Subsections into
Paragraphs, Paragraphs into Subparagraphs, Subparagraphs into Clauses, and
Clauses into Subclauses, and Subclauses into Items, designated as follows:

(Ord. 2012-03, 12/4/2012)
§ 1-108.   Special Numbering Problems.
   1.   Addition of New Units Between Existing Units. If it becomes necessary
to introduce a new Chapter, Part or Section between existing Chapters, Parts or
Sections, the new Chapter, Part or Section shall be designated by the addition
of a capital letter suffix to the preceding Chapter, Part or Section number.
Thus, a Chapter introduced between Chapters 5 and 6 would be Chapter 5A and
Sections in that Chapter would be numbered, for instance, “§5A-101.” If it
becomes necessary to introduce a Part between existing Parts 5 and 6 the new
Part would be Part 5A and Sections in that Part would be numbered, for
instance, “§5-5A01.” A new Section introduced between existing Sections 5 and 6
would be “§5-105A.” When a number of new Parts or Sections have been introduced
the Chapter or Part shall be renumbered.
   2.   If it becomes necessary to introduce a Subsection between Subsections,
for instance, Subsections .5 and .6, the new Subsection would be numbered
Subsection .5-A.
   3.   If it becomes necessary to introduce a unit smaller than a Subsection
between existing units, the entire Subsection shall be revised and renumbered.
   4.   Vacated Numbers. Whenever a number is vacated by a revocation or
repeal, the remaining elements in the overall unit shall retain their old
numbers until the overall unit is completely revised. Prior to revision, the
vacated number may be marked: “[Reserved].”
(Ord. 2012-03, 12/4/2012)
§ 1-109.   Amending Code.
   1.   All ordinances passed subsequent to the adoption of this Code which
amend, repeal or in any way affect this Code shall be numbered in accordance
with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion herein. In the
case of repealed Chapters, Parts, Sections, Paragraphs, Clauses or other part
or provision hereof, by subsequent ordinance, such repealed portions may be
excluded from this Code by omission from reprinted pages affected thereby. The
subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed, or omitted in the case of
repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such
time as this Code and subsequent ordinances omitted are readopted as a new Code
by the Borough Council.
   2.   Amendment to any provision of this Code shall be made by specific
reference to the Chapter, Part, Section and/or Subsection number of this Code
in the following language:
      A.   Amendment or Revision. "Chapter        , Part        , Section
       , Subsection        , is hereby amended (revised) to read as follows . .
. .” The amended or revised provisions may then be set out in full as desired.
      B.   Addition. "Chapter        , Part        , Section        ,
Subsection        , is hereby amended by the addition of the following . . . .”
The new provision shall then be set out in full as desired.
      C.   Repeal. "Chapter        , Part       , Section        , Subsection
       , is hereby repealed in its entirety.”
   3.   It is the intention of the Borough Council that the numbering scheme of
this Code be adhered to in enacting future ordinances. In the event that any
ordinance or other enactment be adopted which does not conform to the numbering
system of this Code, it is the intention of the Borough Council that such
enactment be renumbered in the process of supplementing, revising or updating
this Code to conform to the numbering scheme of this Code. The Borough Council
hereby acknowledges and confirms that the numbering scheme herein is for ease
of reference and that the renumbering of any enactment when added to this Code
shall not in any manner affect the validity of said enactment.
(Ord. 2012-03, 12/4/2012)
§ 1-110. Altering Code.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to change or amend by addition or
deletion any part or portion of this Code, or to insert or delete pages or
portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner
whatsoever, except by ordinance or resolution or other official act of the
Borough Council.
(Ord. 2012-03, 12/4/2012)
§ 1-111.   Penalties.
   1.   Penalty Where No Penalty Provided. Whenever in this Code or in any
ordinance of the Borough any act is prohibited or is declared to be unlawful,
or whenever in this Code or other ordinance the doing of any act is declared to
be unlawful, and no specific penalty is provided therefor:

of ordinances adopting building, housing, property maintenance, health, fire or
public safety codes; and for ordinances regulating water services, water
pollution, air pollution and noise, the following penalty shall be provided:
         (1)   Any person, firm or corporation who shall violate any provision
of this Part, upon conviction thereof in an action brought before a magisterial
district judge in the manner provided for the enforcement of summary offenses
under the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, shall be sentenced to pay a
fine of not more than $1,000 plus costs and, in default of payment of said fine
and costs, to a term of imprisonment not to exceed 90 days. Each day that a
violation of this Part continues or each Section of this Part which shall be
found to have been violated shall constitute a separate offense.
      B.   Other Violations. All other penalties, except for penalties in
Chapter 15, “Motor Vehicles and Traffic” (based on the Vehicle Code, 75
Pa.C.S.A. §101 et seq.), penalties and ordinances adopted under the authority
of the Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §10101 et seq., earned income tax
ordinances adopted under the Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. §6913, and

violated or permitted the violation of the provisions of this Part, upon being
found liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the
Borough, shall pay a judgment of not more than $600 plus all court costs and
reasonable attorney fees. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or
payable until the date of the determination of a violation by a magisterial
district judge. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment,
the Borough may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil
procedure. Each day that a violation continues or each Section of this Part
which shall be found to have been violated shall constitute a separate
violation.
   2.   The imposition of a penalty under the provisions of this Code shall not
prevent the revocation of any permit or license or the taking of other punitive
or remedial action where called for or permitted under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the United States of America. In addition, the
Borough may institute injunctive, mandamus or any other appropriate action or
proceeding at law or in equity for the enforcement of this Code. Any court of
competent jurisdiction shall have the right to issue restraining orders,
temporary or permanent injunctions, mandamus, or other appropriate forms of
remedy or relief.

Part 1
Nighttime Curfew for Minors
§ 6-101.   Short Title.
   This Part shall be known and may be cited as “Curfew Ordinance.”
(Ord. 79-6, 10/23/1979, §1)
§ 6-102.   Purposes and Findings.
   This is an updating of the Borough Curfew Ordinance prescribing, in
accordance with prevailing community standard, regulations for the conduct of
minors on streets at night, effectively enforced, taught in the homes,
internalized and adhered to for generations, all for the good of minors, for
the furtherance of family responsibility, and for the public good, safety and
welfare.
   A.   Council finds that the curfew meets a very real local need, has been
over the years a significant factor in minimizing juvenile delinquency and
should be updated and amplified in light of Dauphin’s geography and facts.
Dauphin is one of the oldest municipalities in Dauphin County, which is bounded
on the west by the Susquehanna River and otherwise entirely by Middle Paxton
Township. Dauphin has a compact densely built up residential area in the older
section of the Borough and a suburban residential development in the Forest
Hills section of the Borough, together with several parks and commercial
establishments. This community sense of the proper time for cessation of
outdoor activities by minors on the streets is reflected in the curfew hours
declared by this Part which takes into consideration also the danger hours for
nocturnal crime and for accumulations of minors with potential risks incident
to immaturity.
   B.   Council finds that Dauphin is approaching full development, but is not
overcrowded. Population density, as reflected in the Borough Comprehensive
Plan, varies from neighborhood to neighborhood. Residential land use
predominates and single-family dwellings occupy the largest portion of the
residential area. Public park facilities are established for future use, and
are currently in the developmen tal phases. Adequate indoor living space
permits minors in Dauphin to healthfully occupy their time. Commercial
recreational facilities are nonexistent and there is little or nothing for
minors to do outdoors, but roam the streets, after the curfew hours which this
Part declares.
   C.   Council further finds that the Dauphin population is slightly in excess
of 1,200. Dauphin is a stable family community. Parental responsibility for the
whereabouts of children is the norm, legal sanctions to enforce such
responsibility have had a demonstrated effectiveness over the years, as
parental control increases likelihood of juvenile delinquency decreases and
there is a continuing need for the nocturnal curfew for minors which has
achieved and will continue to achieve under local conditions the purposes
hereinbefore stated.
(Ord. 79-6, 10/23/1979, §2)
§ 6-103.   Definitions.
   For the purposes of this Part the following terms, phrases, words, and their
derivations shall have the meaning given herein. When not inconsistent with the
context, words used in the present tense include the future, words in the
plural number include the singular and words in the singular number include the
plural. The word “shall” is always mandatory and not merely directory:
   Borough–the Borough of Dauphin, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania.
   Minor–any person under the age of 18, or, in equivalent phrasing often
herein employed, any person 17 or less years of age.
   Parent–any person having legal custody of a minor (1) as a natural or
adoptive parent, (2) as a legal guardian, (3) as a person who stands in loco
parentis or (4) as a person to whom legal custody has been given by order of
court.
   Remain–to stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily upon the streets,
including the congregating of groups (or of interacting minors) totaling four
or more persons in which any minor involved would not be using the streets for
ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or going home. To implement
that thought with additional precision and precaution, numerous exceptions are
expressly defined in §6-105 so that this is not a mere prohibitory or presence
type curfew ordinance.
   Street–a way or place, of whatsoever nature, open to the use of the public
as a matter of right for purposes of vehicular travel or in the case of a
sidewalk thereof for pedestrian travel. The term “street” includes the legal
right-of-way, including, but not limited to, the cartway or traffic lanes, the
curb, the sidewalks whether paved or unpaved, and any grass plots or other
grounds found within the legal right-of-way of a street. The term “street”
applies irrespective of what it be called or formally named, whether alley,
avenue, court, road or otherwise.
   Time of night–referred to herein is based upon the prevailing standard of
time, whether Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Saving Time, generally
observed at that hour by the public in the Borough, prima facie the time then
observed in the Borough Police Department offices.
   Year of age–continues from one birthday, such as the seventeenth to (but not
including the day of) the next, such as the eighteenth birthday, making it
clear that 17 or less years of age is herein treated as equivalent to the
phrase “under 18 years of age.”
(Ord. 79-6, 10/23/1979, §3)
§ 6-104.   Curfew for Minors.
   It shall be unlawful for any person 17 or less years of age (under 18) to be
or remain in or upon the streets within the Borough of Dauphin at night during
the period ending at 6 a.m. and beginning:
   A.   At 10 p.m. for minors 11 or less years of age.
   B.   At 10:30 p.m. for minors 12 or 13 years of age.
   C.   At 11 p.m. for minors 14 or more years of age.
(Ord. 79-6, 10/23/1979, §4)
§ 6-105.   Exceptions.
   In the following exceptional cases a minor on a Borough street during the
nocturnal hours for which §6-104 is intended to provide the maximum limits of
regulation (and a clear general guide for minors, their parents and their
fellow-citizens) shall not, however be considered in violation of this Part.
   A.   When accompanied by a parent of such minor.
   B.   When accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor to
take said parent’s place in accompanying said minor for a designated period of
time and purpose within a specified area.
   C.   When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United States
Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and the
right of assembly, such minor shall evidence the bona fides of such exercise by
first delivering, to the Chief of Police or officer in charge of the Dauphin
Borough Building at Allegheny and Church Streets, where and by whom high
priority messages to the Mayor are regularly received, a written communication,
signed by such minor and countersigned if practicable by a parent of such minor
with their home address and telephone number, addressed to the Mayor of the
Borough, specifying when, where and in what manner said minor will be on the
streets at night (during hours when this Part is otherwise applicable to said
minor) in the exercise of a First Amendment rights specified in such
communication.
   D.   In case of reasonable necessity but only after such minor’s parent has
communicated to the Borough Police Department’s office personnel the facts
establishing such reasonable necessity relating to specified streets at a
designated time for a described purpose including points or origin and
destination. A copy of such communication, or of the police record thereof,
duly certified by the Chief of Police to be correct, with an appropriate
notation of the time it was received and of the names and address of such
parent and minor, shall be admissible evidence.
   E.   When the minor is on the sidewalk of the place where such minor
resides, or on the sidewalk of either next door neighbor not communicating an
objection to the police officer.
   F.   When returning home, by a direct route from (and within 30 minutes of
the termination of) a school activity, or an activity of a religious or other
voluntary association, of which prior notice, indicating the place and probable
time of termination, has been given in writing to, and duly filed for immediate
reference by, the Chief of Police or the officer assigned by him on duty at the
police station, thus encouraging (here as in other exceptional situations)
conduct on the part of minors involved in such activities and striking a fair
balance for any somewhat conflicting interests.
   G.   When authorized, by special permit from the Mayor, carried on the
person of the minor thus authorized, as follows. When necessary nighttime
activities of a minor may be inadequately provided for by other provisions of
this Part, then recourse may be had to the Mayor of the Borough, either for a
regulation as provided in paragraph .H or for a special permit as the
circumstances warrant. Upon the Mayor’s finding of necessity for the use of the
streets to the extent warranted by a written application signed by a minor and
by a parent of such minor if feasible stating (1) the name, age and address of
such minor, (2) the name, address and telephone number of a parent thereof, (3)
the height, weight, sex, color of eyes and hair and other physical
characteristics of such minor, (4) the necessity which requires such minor to
remain upon the streets during the curfew hours otherwise applicable, and (5)
the street or route and the beginning and ending of the period of time involved
by date and hour, the Mayor may grant a permit in writing for the use by such
minor of such streets at such hours as in the Mayor’s opinion may reasonably be
necessary. In an emergency this may be handled by telephone, or other effective
communication, with a corresponding record being made contemporaneously, either
to the Mayor or, if unavailable, to the police officer authorized by the Mayor
to act on his behalf in an emergency at the Police Department offices.
   H.   When authorized, by regulation issued by the Mayor, in other similar
cases of reasonable necessity, similarly handled but adapted to necessary
night-time activities of more minors than can readily be dealt with on an
individual special permit basis. Normally such regulation by the Mayor
permitting use of the streets should be issued sufficiently in advance to
permit appropriate publicity through news media and through other agencies such
as the schools, and shall define the activity, the scope of the use of the
streets permitted, the period of time involved not to extend more than 30
minutes beyond the time for termination of such activity, and the reason for
finding that such regulation is reasonably necessary to further the purposes of
this Part.
   I.   When the minor carries a certified card of employment, renewable each
calendar month when the current facts so warrant, dated or re-issued not more
than 45 days previously, signed by the Chief of Police and briefly identifying
the minor, the addresses of his home and of his place of employment, and his
hours of employment.
   J.   When the minor is, with parental consent, in a motor vehicle. This
contemplates normal travel. From excess of caution, this clearly exempts bona
fide interstate movement through Dauphin, particularly on normal routes such as
Route 22-322 (Allegheny Street) or Peters Mountain Road. This also exempts
interstate travel beginning or ending in Dauphin.
   K.   When the minor is 17 years of age, if and when the Mayor shall have
determined, by formal rule first reported to Borough Council, spread upon its
minutes and so reported in the press, finding the facts as to the extent
(minimal) of juvenile delinquency in such age group permitting such rule,
currently, in the best interests of said minors and of the Borough, then the
Mayor by such formal rule, covering a period of time designated therein or
until rescission thereof not exceeding 1 year from the date thereof, may take
appropriate action excepting designated minors, minors in a defined group or
area, or all minors (as the current facts may warrant) 17 years of age at that
date or attaining 17 years of age during the period that such formal rule is
and remains in effect.
   L.   Each of the foregoing exceptions and their several limitations such as
provisions for notification, are severable, as hereinafter provided but here
reemphasized; and additional, also severable, exceptions, broadening with the
progress toward maturity of minors enrolled respectively in elementary, junior
high and high schools, will be considered by Council as warranted by future
experience illuminated by the views of student government associations, school
personnel, citizens, associations, ward, precinct and neighborhood spokesmen,
parents, officers and persons in authority concerned positively with minors as
well as with juvenile delinquency.
(Ord. 79-6, 10/23/1979, §5)
§ 6-106.   Parental Responsibility.
   It shall be unlawful for a parent having legal custody of a minor knowingly
to permit or by inefficient control to allow, such minor to be or remain upon
any Borough street under circumstances not constituting an exception to, or
otherwise beyond the scope of, this Part. The term “knowingly” includes
knowledge which a parent should reasonably be expected to have concerning the
whereabouts of a minor in that parent’s legal custody. It is intended to
continue to keep neglectful or careless parents up to a reasonable community
standard of parental responsibility through an objective test. It shall, a
fortiori, be no defense that a parent was completely indifferent to the
activities or conduct or whereabouts of such minor.
(Ord. 79-6, 10/23/1979, §6)
§ 6-107.   Police Procedures.
   A policeman of the Borough, upon finding or having attention called to any
minor on the streets in prima facie violation of this Part, normally shall take
the minor to the Borough Police Department office, where a parent shall
immediately be notified to come for such minor, whereupon they shall be
interrogated. This is intended to permit ascertainment, under constitutional
safeguards, of relevant facts, and to centralize responsibility in the officer-
in-charge and then on duty for accurate, effective, fair, impartial and uniform
enforcement, and recording, thus making available the best of facilities and
access to information and records. In the absence of convincing evidence such
as a birth certificate, a policeman on the street shall in the first instance
use his best judgment in determining age.
   A.   Police procedures shall constantly be refined in the light of
experience and may provide, inter alia, that the policeman may deliver to a
parent thereof a minor under appropriate circumstances, for example a minor of
tender age near home whose identity and address may readily be ascertained or
are known.
   B.   In any event such policeman shall within 24 hours file a written report
with the Chief of Police, or shall participate to the extent of the information
for which he is responsible in the preparation by himself involved in such
case, and in the filing of such report within 24 hours.
   C.   When a parent, immediately called, has come to take charge of the
minor, and the appropriate information has been recorded, the minor shall be
released to the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be located, or
fails to take charge of the minor, then the minor shall be released to the
juvenile authorities, except to the extent that in accordance with police
regulations, approved in advance by juvenile authorities, the minor may
temporarily be entrusted to a relative, neighbor or other person who will on
behalf of a parent assume the responsibility of caring for the minor pending
the availability or arrival of a parent.
   D.   In the case of a first violation by a minor the Chief of Police shall
be certified mail, send to a parent written notice of said violation with a
warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the
Curfew Ordinance, including enforcement of parental responsibility and of
applicable penalties.
(Ord. 79-6, 10/23/1979, §7)
§ 6-108.   Penalties.
   Prevailing community standards, and the real internalization thereof or
interpersonal sanctions therefore that in practice count for much, as to when
minors should be off the streets, reflected in this Part, are hereby
undergirded with the following legal sanctions:
   A.   If, after the warning notice pursuant to §6-107 of a first violation by
a minor, a parent violates §6-106 (in connection with a second violation by
said minor), this shall be treated as a first offense by the parent. For such
first parental offense a parent shall be fined not less than $25 nor more than
$1,000 plus costs, and for each subsequent offense by a parent the minimum fine
shall be increased by an additional $25, e.g., $50 for the second, $75 for the
third offense. The magisterial district judge, upon finding a parent guilty,
shall sentence the parent to pay such fine plus costs of prosecution, and upon
refusal to pay such fine and costs, to be imprisoned for a period not exceeding
90 days. Each day that a violation of this Part continues or each Section of
this Part which shall be found to have been violated shall constitute a
separate offense. [Ord. 2012-03]
   B.   Any minor who shall violate any of the provisions of this Part more
than three times shall be reported by the Mayor to a society or organization
whose purpose it is to take charge of incorrigibles and delinquents and
proceedings shall then be taken, under the Juvenile Act, 42 Pa.C.S.A. §6301 et
seq., or other appropriate statute, before the Juvenile Court for the
treatment, supervision and rehabilitation of such minor.
   C.   A like procedure, before the juvenile authorities, shall be followed in
any case where the imposing of a fine or fines upon a parent shall not be
effective, or where for any other reason the provisions of this Part cannot be
made effective by the imposing of penalties under this Section.
(Ord. 79-6, 10/23/1979, §8; as amended by Ord. 2012-03, 12/4/2012)
§ 6-109.   Construction.
   Severability is intended throughout and within the provisions of this Part.
If any provision, including, inter alia, any exception, part, phrase or term,
or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the
application to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby and
the validity of this Part in any and all other respects shall not be affected
thereby. From excess of caution, the Mayor is authorized to give advisory
opinions, in writing or immediately reduced to writing, which shall be binding,
and shall be adhered to by the police, until this Part is amended in such
respect, interpreting terms, phrases, parts or any provisions. Normally such
advisory opinions shall be in response to good faith, signed letters addressed
to him at the Borough Police Department office, questioning as (A) ambiguous,
(B) as having a potentially chilling effect on constitutional rights
specifically invoked, or (C) as otherwise invalid, in all three categories with
respect to proposed conduct definitely described. This administrative remedy
must be exhausted prior to presenting to any court a question in any of said
three categories. Borough Council does not intend a result that is absurd,
impossible of execution or unreasonable. It is intended that this Part be held
inapplicable in such cases, if any, where its application would be
unconstitutional. A constitutional construction is intended and shall be given.
Council does not intend to violate the Constitution of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania or the Constitution of the United States of America.
(Ord. 79-6, 10/23/1979, §9)
§ 6-110.   Continuing Evaluation.
   The Borough Council will continue its evaluation and updating of this Part.
   A.   Accordingly, there shall be compiled and informally reported to Borough
Council through effective channels all exceptional cases hereunder of
reasonable necessity, the notices of school and other activities, the Mayor’s
special permits and the Mayor’s regulations hereinbefore authorized, and the
Mayor’s advisory opinions, for consideration by the appropriate committee and
by Borough Council in further updating and continuing evaluation of this Part.
   B.   For the same reasons, as well as for the implementation beyond these
legal aspects of the basic purposes hereof, the Mayor and relevant committees
of Borough Council through their respective chairmen in coordinated efforts
shall work with existing, and may organize, voluntary groups, and shall
stimulate volunteer leadership, in programs of research and of action dealing
constructively on neighborhood and local bases, with juvenile delinquency, and
the prevention, control or containment thereof, in all its ramifications and
with practicable steps toward the good life, and a better life, for minors 17
or less years of age.

B.   Schedule of Fees, Rents, and Surcharges
§ 18-121.   Permitted Fees.
   1.   The Borough may charge the following fees as authorized by Act 203:
   A.   Tapping Fee. Each owner of a single-family dwelling, commercial,
industrial or institutional property required by this Part to connect to the
sewer system shall pay to the Borough a tapping fee of $4,000. This fee is
based on the capacity, distribution/collection components and replacement costs
defined in §18-102 of this Part. The Borough is also authorized under certain
circumstances to include special purpose and reimbursement components in the
tapping fee. These components are also described in §18-102 of this Part. Each
owner of a residential, commercial, industrial or institutional building,
required by this Part to connect to the sewer system, shall pay to the Borough
a tapping fee of $4,000 plus a monthly user fee which from time to time may be
adjusted by the Borough to accommodate costs arising from the operation,
maintenance and replacement of the collection and treatment system. The monthly
user fee is based upon an equivalent dwelling unit (EDU). An equivalent
dwelling unit has been determined to be 263 gallons per day. In lieu of payment
of the tapping fee, the Borough may require the construction and dedication of
capacity, distribution/collection, or special purpose facilities necessary to
provide services. [Ord. 05-03]
   2.   Connection Fee. In the event that the Borough provides the connection
facilities between the Borough’s main and the property line or curb stop of the
property that will use the service, the Borough may impose a connection fee as
defined in §18-102 of this Part. In lieu of this fee, the Borough may require
the property owner to construct and dedicate the connection facilities.
   3.   Customer Facilities Fee. In the event that the Borough provides the
facilities connecting the property line or curb stop to the building to be
served a fee may be charged as defined in §18-102 of this Part. In lieu of this
fee the Borough may require the property owner to construct the facilities.
(Ord. 91-4, 10/8/1991, §2.01; as amended by Ord. 05-03, 5/3/2005, §1 1 )
 
Notes
     Editor’s Note: Section 2.0, “Exemption,” provides:
     “Section 2.0. Exemption. All owners of existing residential structures in the
  Hillside Heights and Lower Erie Street, also known as the Hillside Sewage
  Management Area, shall be exempt from the increased tap on fee. The Borough
  Council recognizes that owners of existing residential buildings within this
1 designated area will be the subject of a public works project to deploy sanitary
  sewerage facilities to their homes. Further, that said project had been initiated
  in 1999 and therefore, exemption of the Hillside Sewage Management Area to the
  increased tap on fee would be appropriate. An increased tap on fee will be
  assessed to any owners of buildings that are constructed after the effective date
  herein.”
§ 18-122.   Sewer Rentals (User Fees).
   [Reserved.] 2
(Ord. 91-4, 10/8/1991, §2.02; as amended by Ord. 92-2, 10/6/1992, §2; by Ord.
93-12, 12/7/1993, §1; by Ord. 96-1, –/–/1996; by Ord. 02-03, 1/7/2002, §1; by
Ord. 05-01, 3/8/2005; by Ord. 07-02, 2/6/2007, §§1 and 2; and by Ord. 07-04, 6/
5/2007)
 
Notes
     Editor’s Note: Ord. 07-04 provides, with regard to sewer rentals:
     “Repealing Ordinance No. 05-01.
2    Sewer Rates: The Borough of Dauphin, having delegated rate setting
  authority to the Borough Authority hereby repeals Ordinance 05-01 requiring
  and establishing Sewer Rates Regardless of Usage.”
§ 18-123.   Surcharges for Certain Industrial/Commercial Wastes.
   1.   Although the sewage treatment works will be capable of treating certain
industrial wastes, the actual treatment of such wastes may increase the cost of
operating and maintaining the public sanitary sewage system. Therefore, there
will be imposed upon each person discharging such industrial waste into public
sanitary sewage system a surcharge, or surcharges which are intended to cover
such additional costs. Such surcharges shall be in addition to regular sewage
service surcharges and shall be payable as herein provided.
   2.   Determination of Surcharges. The strength of any industrial/commercial
waste discharge which is to be subject to surcharge as determined by subsection
.3 of this Section, shall be determined quarterly, or more frequently as the
Borough shall determine, from samples taken either at the manhole or metering
chamber referred to in this Part, or at any other sampling point mutually
agreed upon by the Borough and the producer of such waste. The frequency and
duration of the sampling period shall be such as, in the opinion of the
Borough, will permit a reasonably reliable determination of the average
composition of such waste, exclusive of stormwater runoff. Samples shall be
collected by the Borough, or their collection supervised by the Borough and
shall reasonably reflect the characteristics of the waste over a 24-hour
period, exclusive of stormwater runoff. Except as hereinafter provided, the
strength of the waste so found by analysis shall be used for establishing the
surcharge or surcharges. However, the Borough may, if it so elects, accept the
results of routine sampling and analyses by the producer of such wastes in lieu
of making its own sampling and analyses.
   3.   Calculation of Surcharges. In the event that, after sampling and
analysis as prescribed in subsection .2 hereof, any industrial waste is found
by the Borough to have pollutants of BOD concentration in excess of 204
milligrams per liter and/or non-filterable residue concentration in excess of
240 milligrams per liter, the producer of said waste shall pay a strength of
waste surcharge in addition to the regular sewage service charge, which
surcharge shall be computed by using the following industrial waste surcharge
formula:
      SQ = 0.00834QI[(BODI - 204)TA + (SSI - 204)TB]
   A.   Where:
   (1)   SQ is the quarterly surcharge to be added to the basic user charge.
   (2)   0.00834 is a constant to convert waste concentrations expressed in
million gallons.
   (3)   QI is the quarterly industrial/commercial waste flow expressed in
million gallons.
   (4)   BODI and SSI are the respective concentrations of BOD5 and suspended
solids of the industrial waste expressed in mg/l.
   (5)   204 is a constant which expresses the waste load concentrations of BOD
and suspended solids for normal domestic wastes in mg/l.
   (6)   TA and TB are actual treatment costs incurred by the Borough per 1,000
pounds of BOD and suspended solids, respectively. These costs are determined
annually by the Borough based upon actual costs of operation and maintenance.
   When a value of BOD and/or suspended solids is less than the maximum
allowable concentration set forth in the industrial waste surcharge formula,
then the maximum allowable concentration shall be used in the calculation of
the industrial waste surcharge.
   5.   Sampling Fees and Schedules. All industrial users requiring an
industrial/commercial waste discharge permit will be assessed a fee or service
charge for each scheduled sampling to be performed by the Borough. The charge
to the industrial/commercial user for each scheduled sampling will be set by
the Borough. This fee will be in addition to the costs of analysis for which
the indus trial/commercial user will reimburse the Borough.
(Ord. 91-4, 10/8/1991, §2.03)
C.   Enforcement of User Obligations
§ 18-131.   Termination and Violations.
   1.   Notice of Service Termination–Written. Any user with an unpaid balance
beyond 60 days of its due date will be notified pursuant to §§

after said notice unless: [Ord. 07-07]
   A.   The ratepayer makes payment or settlement of the outstanding balance.
   B.   The user files a timely notice of dispute with the Borough asserting a
good faith defense, or in the event that the defense is denied, filing a timely
appeal with the Borough pursuant to the rules and regulations of this Part.
   2.   Notice of Ordinance Violation–Written. Any user who shall violate any
Section of this Part will be notified pursuant to §18-153 of this Part that
legal enforcement pursuant to §
18-141 will commence 60 days after said notice unless:
   A.   The user commences action to correct or remove the violation within 10
business days of the date of the violation notification.
   B.   The user completely corrects or removes the violations within 60 days
of the date of the violation notification.
   C.   A detailed, written statement by the user describing the causes of the
violation and measures taken to prevent future occurrence shall be submitted to
the Borough no later than 60 days after the date of the violation notification.
   D.   The user files a timely notice of dispute with the Borough asserting a
good faith defense, or in the event that the defense is denied, filing a timely
appeal with the Borough pursuant to the rules and regulations of this Part.
(Ord. 91-4, 10/8/1991, §3.01; as amended by Ord. 07-07, 9/4/2007, §§1, 2, and
3)
 
§ 18-132.   Posting of Service Termination Notice.
   If the outstanding balance remains unpaid 60 days after its due date, and no
timely good faith notice of dispute, or notice of appeal of a dispute decision,
has been filed, then the water utility, or its duly authorized designee, shall
conspicuously post a notice of termination upon the affected premises stating
that the water service will be disconnected 10 days after said notice. If the
subject property shall be a multi- family dwelling, then said notice shall be
placed conspicuously in the common areas. Notice for disconnection of water
service shall state the date of termination, name and address of the
disconnecting authority, and requirements for the user to reestablish service
or settle the account, and the reason for termination of service.
(Ord. 91-4, 10/8/1991, §3.02)
 
§ 18-133.   Notice of Termination;Telephone.
   Three days prior to termination of service, the water utility, or its duly
authorized designee, shall attempt to contact in person or by phone a
responsible adult or other designated individual residing at the subject
premises. Immediately prior to termination of water service, the water utility,
or its duly authorized designee, shall attempt to contact in person or by phone
the responsible adult or other designated individual to notify them that their
water service is being terminated.
(Ord. 91-4, 10/8/1991, §3.03)
 
§ 18-134.   Stay of Termination.
   Water service shall not be terminated on any Friday, Saturday or Sunday;
bank holiday or day preceding; Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission holiday
or day preceding; or when any occupant therein is certified by a physician to
be seriously ill or affected with a medical condition which will be aggravated
by a cessation of service or failure to restore service.
(Ord. 91-4, 10/8/1991, §3.04)
 
§ 18-135.   Temporary Service Interruption.
   The water utility authority may temporarily interrupt service where
necessary to effect repairs or maintenance; to eliminate an eminent threat to
life, health, safety or substantial property damage; or for reasons of local,
State or National emergency. Where water service must be interrupted due to
unforeseen circumstances, notice of the cause and expected duration of the
interruption shall be given as soon as possible to ratepayers and occupants who
may be affected.
(Ord. 91-4, 10/8/1991, §3.05)
 
§ 18-136.   Notice of Termination–Landlord/User.
   The water service of a landlord/user shall be terminated according to the
general procedures outlined in this Part except that: after the landlord/user
receives notice that water service will be terminated pursuant to §18-131 of
this Part, the landlord/user must either file a notice of dispute within 7 days
of said notice, or provide the names and addresses of each tenant of the
subject premises. Filing a notice of dispute or settling the account will stay
any notice to the tenants. Anytime before or after service has been terminated,
the affected tenants may apply to the Borough to have water service continued
or resumed in their individual capacity.
(Ord. 91-4, 10/8/1991, §3.06)
 
§ 18-137.   Tenant and Borough Payment Agreement and Notification.
   1.   The Borough shall not have terminated the water service or shall
promptly resume service previously terminated if it receives from the tenants
an amount equal to the bill of the landlord/user for the 30 days preceding the
notice to the tenants. Thereafter, the tenants and the Borough shall make
arrangements for payment of utility service.
   2.   All termination notices issued under this provision shall be
individually mailed to each affected tenant by first-class mail or individually
hand delivered to the address of each affected tenant by unit number if
possible.
(Ord. 91-4, 10/8/1991, §3.07)
 
§ 18-138.   Rules and Regulations Governing Service Termination.
   1.   In the event that a user disputes all or part of his bill, he shall
file a written notice of such with the Borough within 10 days of the
termination of service notice but no later than 24 hours before service is
scheduled for termination. A user whose account is delinquent may settle the
account with the Borough before or after termination of service by payment to
the Borough collection agent. The user must request settlement in person. If
service is terminated, service may be restored pursuant to the general
procedures of this Part; provided, however, that prior to the restoration of
service, the user must pay all amounts then due and owing under this Part,
including without limitation any amounts which are not yet delinquent. In
addition, any user determined by Borough Council to be an habitual offender, as
hereinafter defined, shall be required to deposit with the Borough, prior to
the restoration of service, a sum (the “security deposit”) equal to that amount
of sewer rentals under this Part, plus that amount of refuse collection fees
under the General Trash Collection Ordinance (Ord. 74-2, as amended) [Chapter
20, Part 1], which would, as reasonably determined by the Borough Treasurer, be
payable by the user during a typical 6-month period. The security deposit may,
at any time, be used by the Borough to pay any amounts due from the habitual
offender under this Part, or under the General Trash Collection Ordinance
[Chapter 20, Part 1], which remain unpaid 30 days beyond their due date(s). The
Borough shall be under no obligation, however, to so apply the security
deposit. Immediately upon any such application of the security deposit by the
Borough, the habitual offender shall be required to restore the security
deposit to the original required amount. If the habitual offender fails to
restore the security deposit to the required level within 5 days of receipt of
notice from the Borough, the Borough may institute service termination
proceedings against the habitual offender. Except as set forth above, the
security deposit shall be held by the Borough in an escrow account, and
interest shall be paid thereon to the extent required by law. The Borough shall
return the remaining balance of the security deposit, less any handling fee
allowed by law, to the habitual offender at such time as the habitual offender
no longer requires water service at the location for which the security deposit
was required, or, if earlier, such time as Borough Council, in its sole
discretion, determines that the retention of the security deposit is no longer
required to ensure the timely payment by the habitual offender of sewer rentals
and refuse collection fees. An “habitual offender” is any user who has been
designated as such by Borough Council. Borough Council shall designate a user
an habitual offender only after (A) the Borough Treasurer shall have notified
Borough Council that a user has been delinquent in the payment of sewer rentals
and/or refuse collection fees four times or more during a 2-year period, (B)
the delinquent user has received at least 15 days written notice that Borough
Council will consider, at its next regularly scheduled meeting, whether to
designate the user an habitual offender, and (C) the Borough Council
determines, at that next regularly scheduled meeting, that designation of the
user as an habitual offender is appropriate under the circumstances. In
determining whether designation as an habitual offender is appropriate, Borough
Council may properly consider, among other things, the delinquent user’s
payment history, the amount of arrearages likely to accrue, and any explanation
offered by the user. For the purposes of this Section, a user shall be deemed
“delinquent” for any month in which a penalty is imposed pursuant to §18- 122
of this Part or pursuant to §20-106 of the General Trash Collection Ordinance
[Chapter 20, Part 1]. [Ord. 2012-03]
   2.   The water utility shall contact the Borough immediately prior to
terminating a user’s service to ensure that the outstanding bill remains
unpaid, or was otherwise settled.
   3.   Where a user has notified the Borough that an occupant of a dwelling
subject to service termination is seriously ill, certification as required by
§18-134 of this Part may be written or oral, subject to the right of the
Borough to verify the certification by contacting the physician or require
written confirmation within 7 days.
   4.   Users shall be responsible for all costs and charges imposed by the

§ 18-139.   Penalties for Late Payment of Sewer Bills.
   1.   The penalties provided herein shall be cumulative to any remedies
provided to the Borough in any other Sections of this Part.
   2.   Payments of sewer rental fee (user fee) and trash collection fee (trash
fee) are due upon the user’s receipt of the statement. Receipt shall be
presumed on the third day after the Borough’s date of issuance.
   3.   In the event that payment is not received by the Borough prior to the
end of the calendar month in which the statement is used, a penalty, as
established from time to time by resolution of Borough Council shall be added
to the user’s account. This penalty shall be calculated as follows: [Ord. 2012-
03]
   A.   The user’s balance at month’s end multiplied by .00833 equals the
penalty. For example, $30 (balance at the end of the first month) times .00833
equals $0.2499. This amount is added to the $30 for a new balance of $30.25.
The .00833 penalty is not subject to compounding. The new balance due will be
carried over to the following month on the user’s account and shall be due
immediately.
   4.   The penalty will be assessed each month, as described above, on
original amounts remaining unpaid (not including any penalty amounts) until the
account is fully paid; provided, however, that the total accrued penalty
hereunder, together with the total accrued penalty under the General Trash
Collection Ordinance [Chapter 20, Part 1], shall not exceed (A) $500 per
dwelling unit with respect to residential accounts, and (B) $3,000 per account
with respect to commercial, industrial and school accounts.

   F.   An average daily flow greater than 5,000 gallons per day.
   G.   Any quantity of substances possessing characteristics described in this
Part.
   2.   Prior to discharging such waste to the sewer system after the effective
date of this Part, the owner of the property from which such discharge is
proposed to be made shall apply to the Borough in writing for a permit to make
such a discharge (and shall not discharge such waste prior to receiving a
permit); provided, however, that any owner of a property from which such waste
is being discharged pursuant to a permit in effect on the effective date of the
effective date of this Part shall, within 30 days of this Part, apply to the
Borough in writing for a new permit to make such a discharge (and commencing 90
days after the effective date of this Part, and shall not continue discharging
such waste unless a new permit has been reissued).
   3.   The application for an industrial waste discharge permit shall be made
on a form provided for that purpose by the Borough, and shall be fully
completed under oath by the property owner, user, or a duly authorized and
knowledgeable officer, agent or representative thereof, and acknowledged. The
person making the application shall also submit such scientific or testing
data, or other information, as may be required by the Borough and shall pay an
application fee and shall reimburse the Borough for all expenses incurred as a
result of the processing of the application. The Borough shall also have, at
its discretion, the right to inspect the premises, equipment and material, and
laboratory testing facilities of the applicant.
   4.   No discharge permit shall be issued by the Borough to any person whose
discharge of material to sewers, whether shown upon the application or
determined after inspection and testing conducted by the Borough, is not in
conformance with Federal, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or Borough statutes,
ordinances, or rules and regulations. The Borough shall state in writing the
reason or reasons for denial, and said written communication shall be mailed or
personally delivered to the applicant.
   5.   If the application for a permit is denied by the Borough, or if the
discharge indicated from the permit application or inspection is not in
accordance with the requirements of this Part, the user may have the Borough
review the denial, provided the user shall give written notice of his request
within 30 days after receiving the denial. The Borough shall review the permit
application, the written denial, and such other evidence and matters as the
applicant shall present at a public hearing following receipt of request for
its review, and the decision of the Borough rendered publicly shall be final.
   6.   In the event that any discharge of material to a sewer shall materially
and substantially differ in type and volume from that shown in the application
and permit, the person and user shall immediately, upon order of the Borough,
cease and desist from such discharge.
   7.   As EPA adds or amends specific pretreatment and effluent guidelines, or
as the Borough deems necessary, the restrictions or conditions of a permit may
require amendment. The Borough reserves the right to make such amendments as
necessary in the judgement of the Borough. Within 9 months of the promulgation
of a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, the industrial waste permit of
industrial users subject to such standards shall be deemed to have been revised
to require compliance with such standard.
   8.   The Borough may suspend a permit when such suspension is necessary, in
the judgement of the Borough, in order to stop the discharge which presents a
hazard to the public hazard, safety, or welfare, to the environment or
operations at the Borough’s treatment works or upon a finding that the
discharger has violated any provision of this Part. Any discharger notified in
such a suspension shall immediately stop the discharge of all wastewaters into
the system. The Borough may reinstate the permit upon proof of satisfactory
compliance with all discharge requirements of this Part and all other
requirements of the Borough. Any person notified of a suspension of the
wastewater treatment service and/or the industrial waste discharge permit shall
immediately stop or eliminate the discharge. In the event of a failure of the
person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Borough may take
such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer
connection to prevent or minimize damage to the system or endangerment to any
individuals. The Borough may reinstate the industrial waste discharge permit
and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the
noncomplying discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the user
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the Borough within 15 days
of the date of occurrence.
   9.   Permits shall be issued for a specified time period not to exceed 5
years.
   10.   A permit may be revoked by the Borough for any of the following
causes:
   A.   Failure of a permittee to accurately report his wastewater
characteristics.
   B.   Failure of a permittee to report significant changes in operations
which affect wastewater characteristics.
   C.   Refusal of access to the permittee’s premises for the purpose of
inspection or monitoring.
   D.   Any violation of any condition of the permit or of this Part.
   11.   Industrial waste permits shall remain in effect only so long as the
type and volume of wastewater discharged remains unchanged. Any person
discharging wastes covered by an industrial waste discharge permit who
contemplates a change in the method of operation or other factor which will
alter the type or change in volume of waste then being discharged into the
sewer system shall apply for a new industrial waste discharge permit at least
60 days prior to such a change and shall make such change prior to receiving
from the Borough a new industrial waste discharge permit.
   12.   If additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance procedures
are required for a permittee to meet all applicable regulations contained
herein, the shortest schedule by which the permittee can provide. Such
additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance procedures shall be
submitted to the Borough. The completion date for this schedule shall not be
later than the compliance date established for applicable pretreatment
standards. The following conditions shall apply to this schedule:
   A.   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the permittee to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completion
preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major
components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc.).
   B.   No increment shall exceed 9 months.
   C.   Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the
final date for compliance, the permittee shall submit a progress report to the
Borough including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment
of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to
comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps
being taken by the permittee to return the construction to the schedule
established. In no event shall more than 9 months elapse between such progress
reports to the Borough.
   13.   The permittee shall maintain and retain records relating to wastewater
discharged for a period of not less than 3 years and shall afford the Borough
access thereto at all reasonable times.

§ 18-172.   Industrial/Commercial Agreements.
   As a condition precedent to the issuance of an industrial/commercial waste
discharge permit, the Borough shall require industrial/commercial users to
enter into agreements with the Borough containing such provisions as the
Borough deems appropriate in furtherance of its effort to comply with
regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in
40 CFR §403. Industrial users shall comply with Federal, State and local
statutes, ordinance rules and regulations, and with the provisions of such
agreements; and in the event of conflict between provisions, shall comply with

(Ord. 91-4, 10/8/1991, §5.12; as amended by Ord. 92-2, 10/6/1992, §2)
§ 18-173.   Preliminary Treatment and Handling of Industrial/Commercial Wastes.
   1.   The Borough may require the owner of an improved property to construct,
operate and maintain at his expense a preliminary treatment facility when, in
the opinion of the Borough, such facility is necessary to reduce quantities
and/or concentrations of pollutants to:
   A.   Come within maximum limits specified in this Part.
   B.   Prevent excessive quantities of flow or concentrations of pollutants
from disrupting operation of the Borough’s treatment system.
   2.   No preliminary treatment plant and facility shall be constructed or
operated unless all plans, specifications, technical operating data, and other
information pertinent to its proposed operation and maintenance are reviewed by
the Borough and found by the Borough to conform to all Borough regulations;
and, unless written approval of the plans, specifications, technical operating
data and sludge disposal method has been obtained from U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and any other local, State, or
Federal agency having regulatory authority with respect thereto. Such approvals
shall not relieve the discharger from meeting any of the provisions of this
Part.
   3.   All such preliminary treatment facilities as required by this Part
shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operating
condition by the user or person operating and maintaining the facility served
thereby, and at the user’s expense. The Borough shall have access to such
facilities at all reasonable times for purpose of inspection and testing.
   4.   No provision contained in this Part shall be construed to prevent or
prohibit a separate or special contract or agreement between the Borough and
any industrial/commercial user whereby industrial waste and wastewater of
unusual strength, character or composition may be accepted by the Borough for
treatment, subject to additional payment by the industrial/commercial user;
provided, however, that such contract or agreement shall have the prior
approval of the Borough and provided such industrial/commercial waste is in
compliance with categorical pretreatment standards and all applicable local,
State and Federal regulations.
   5.   The Borough reserves the right to reject admission to the system of any
waste harmful to the treatment or collection facilities or to receiving stream,
to compel discontinuance of use of the treatment discharges deemed harmful to
or having a deleterious effect upon any portion of the treatment works or
receiving stream.
   6.   Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to
comply with this Part and shall achieve compliance with all Federal Categorical
Pretreatment Standards within the time limitations as specified by the Federal
Pretreatment Regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a
level acceptable to the Borough shall be provided, operated, and maintained at
the user’s expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and
operating procedures shall be submitted to the Borough for review, and shall be
acceptable to the Borough before construction of the facility. The review of
such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the
responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent
acceptable to the Borough under the provisions of this Part. Any subsequent
changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported
to and be acceptable to the Borough prior to the user’s initiation of the
changes.
   7.   The Borough shall annually publish in the local newspaper a list of the
users which were not in compliance with any pretreatment requirements or
standards at least once during the 12 previous months. The notification shall
also summarize any enforcement actions taken against the user(s) during the
same 12 months.
   8.   All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be
made available to officials of the EPA and Borough upon request.
(Ord. 91-4, 10/8/1991, §5.13; as amended by Ord. 92-2, 10/6/1992, §2)
§ 18-174.   Grease and Sand Interceptors.
   1.   Grease, oil and sand interceptors or retainers shall be installed by
the user at his own expense when, in the opinion of the Borough, such are
necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease, oil or
sand in excessive amounts, of any flammable wastes, and of such other harmful
ingredients. Such interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the
Borough and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for
cleaning by the user and for inspection by the Borough.
   2.   Where installed, all grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be
maintained by the user, at his own expense, and shall be kept in continuous and
efficient operation at all times.
(Ord. 91-4, 10/8/1991, §5.14; as amended by Ord. 92-2, 10/6/1992, §2)
§ 18-175.   Sampling Procedures and Reporting Criteria for Industrial/
Commercial Users.
   1.   All industrial/commercial users shall submit at lease quarterly to the
Borough a certified statement of the characteristics of its wastewater
discharged into the sewers and treatment works of the Borough or into any
sewers connected to its treatment works. This statement shall be filed with the
Borough no later than the tenth day of the month following the quarter for
which the report is required.
   2.   The waste characteristics to be measured and certified by the user
shall be determined by the Borough and specified in the industrial/commercial
waste permit.
   3.   Whenever required by the Borough, the owner of any property served by a
building sewer carrying wastewater and material shall install a large manhole
or sampling chamber in the building sewer in accordance with plants and
specifications approved by the Borough and install and maintain it at all times
at the user’s expense. There shall be ample room in each sampling chamber to
accurately sample and composite samples for analysis. The chamber shall be
safely, easily and independently (of other premises and buildings of user)
accessible to authorized representatives of the Borough at all times. Where
construction of a sampling chamber is not economically or otherwise feasible in
the opinion of the Borough, alternative arrangements for sampling may be made
at the discretion of the Borough.
   4.   Each sampling chamber shall contain a Parshall flume, weir or similar
device with a recording and totalizing register for measuring liquid quantity;
or the metered water supply to the industrial plant may be used as a measure of
liquid quantity where it is substantiated by the Borough that the metered water
supply and waste quantities are approximately the same or where a measurable
adjustment agreed to by the Borough is made in the metered water supply to
determine the liquid waste quantity.
   5.   Samples shall be taken as deemed appropriate by the Borough. Such
sampling shall be done as prescribed by the Borough to insure representative
quantities for the entire reporting period.
   6.   The sampling frequency, sampling chamber, metering device, sampling
methods, and analyses of samples shall be subject, at any time to inspection
and verification by the Borough.
   7.   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this Section shall be determined in
accordance with the standard methods specified by this Part or with any other
method approved by the Borough.
   8.   The Borough shall consider all information regarding an industrial
user’s effluent characteristics as being nonconfidential and may make all such
information available to the public without restriction, unless the user
specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Borough that the release of such information would divulge information
processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of
the user.
   9.   In the event that the Borough deems it necessary to conduct its own
tests of wastewaters discharged by any user, the Borough may take or have made
any such tests and the user shall reimburse the Borough for the full cost
thereof.
   10.   Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source, following commencement
of the introduction of wastewater into the sanitary sewer system, any user
subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the Borough
a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the
discharge from the regulated process which are limited by pretreatment
standards and requirements and the average and maximum daily flow for these
process units in the user facility which are limited by such pretreatment
standards or requirements. This report shall state whether the applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and,
if not, what additional operation and maintenance and/or pretreatment is
necessary to bring the user into compliance with all no applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized
representative of the industrial/commercial user, and certified to by a
qualified professional.
   11.   Any user subject to a pretreatment standard, after the compliance date
of such pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new source, after
commencement of the discharge into the sanitary sewer system, shall submit to
the Borough during the months of June and December, unless required more
frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the Borough, a report indicating
the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by
such pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of
all daily flows which during the reporting period exceeded the average daily
flow. At the discretion of the Borough and in consideration of such factors as
local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the Borough may
agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted.
   12.   The Borough may impose mass limitations on users which are using
dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other
cases where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases,
the report required by subsection .10 of this Section shall include the mass of
pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user.
These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the
discharge, including the flow and the nature of concentration, or production
and mass where requested by the Borough, of pollutants contained therein which
are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of
monitoring shall be prescribed in accordance with procedures established by the
administrator pursuant to §304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR, Part 136,
and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the
administrator. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
approved by the administrator.
(Ord. 91-4, 10/8/1991, §5.15; as amended by Ord. 92-2, 10/6/1992, §2)
§ 18-176.   Accidental Discharges.
   1. All industrial/commercial users shall provide and maintain at their own
expense facilities adequate, in the judgement of the Borough, to prevent
accidental discharge of prohibited and/or regulated substances and to protect
the sewer system from damages caused by such substances. No industrial user
which commences discharge to the treatment plant after the effective date of
this Part shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the treatment plant
until the Borough has reviewed and approved that user’s accidental discharge
prevention procedures.
   2.   In the case of an accidental discharge to the treatment plant of any
prohibited or regulated substance, the owner shall immediately telephone and
notify the Borough of the incident. The notification shall include information
regarding the location of the discharge, the type of pollutants involved, the
concentration and volume of the discharge, and corrective actions taken and/or
contemplated.
   3.   Within 5 days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit
to the Borough a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge
and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences.
Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or
other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the treatment
plant, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such
notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability
which may be imposed by this Part or other applicable law.
   4.   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a
dangerous discharge. Employers shall insure that all employees who may cause or
suffer a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification
procedure.
(Ord. 91-4, 10/8/1991, §5.16; as amended by Ord. 92-2, 10/6/1992, §2)
§ 18-177.   Injunction Relief.
   The Borough reserves the right to seek injunctive relief from discharges to
the sewer system of substances which it deems harmful or which violate any
provision of this Part or of the Federal Categorical Standards.

Exhibit 18-1-E-C
Industrial/Commercial Waste Acceptance Agreement
   THIS AGREEMENT made this _________________ day of ___________ 19_____, by
and between the Borough of Dauphin, (hereinafter called “Borough”) and
_________________________, (hereinafter called “industrial/commercial user” or
“I/C user”).
 
   WITNESSETH:
 
   WHEREAS, wastewater discharged from the Borough facility in Dauphin Borough,
Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, will be treated at a treatment plant operated by
the Borough; and
   WHEREAS, an agreement between the Borough, I/C user, and others, provide,
inter alia, that no industrial user shall be permitted to discharge into a
sewer collection system any waste other than sanitary waste without the
approval of Borough; and
   WHEREAS, said agreement provides that the Borough may establish
acceptability standards for industrial waste that the Borough deems appropriate
in furtherance of its efforts to comply with regulations promulgated by the
United States Environmental Protection Agency in 40 CFR 403, and regulations of
other governmental bodies having jurisdiction.
   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained,
the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:
   1.   Borough shall issue an industrial/commercial waste discharge permit
subject to conditions set forth therein. The other parties hereto, by executing
this agreement, have approved issuance of said permit. I/C user agrees to
comply with all provisions of said permit, a copy of which is attached hereto
and made a part hereof by reference thereto. I/C user agrees that the Borough,
by issuing such permit, shall not be deemed to have assumed any responsibility
or liability, but that I/C user shall continue to be responsible for compliance
with all applicable statutes, rules and regulations.
   2.   I/C user, at its expense, shall cause all wastewater discharged into
the Borough to comply with all provisions of the rules and regulations
governing connection to the sewer system and the acceptance of residential,
commercial, and industrial wastes, as they may be amended from time to time,
and appropriate municipal ordinances, as they may be amended from time to time,
and with all provisions of said industrial/commercial waste discharge permit.
In the event of any conflict between any of such provisions, the Township shall
comply with the more stringent provisions.
   3.   I/C User agrees, at its expense, to comply with all rules and
regulations presently and subsequently adopted by the Borough, including
without limitation, those presently and subsequently adopted in an effort to
comply with any present, future or anticipated rule, regulation, or order of
any governmental body, agency, department, etc.
   4.   The right to discharge wastewater which will be treated at the
treatment plant operated by the Borough is contingent upon such pretreatment,
if required by the Borough, at the expense of I/C user as will cause the
wastewater discharged from the I/C user at all times to be of a quality
satisfactory to the Borough. If, (A) in the opinion of the Borough, the
wastewater from the Township (1) may be injurious to any personal property
operated by the Borough or (2) may interfere with any treatment process or (3)
in any way may cause the Borough to violate its NPDES permit, or (B) if because
of any statute, rule, regulation, order or provision the wastewater discharged
from the Township becomes unsatisfactory to the Borough, or (C) if the I/C user
falls to comply with any condition, rule, or regulation presently or
hereinafter adopted by the Borough, then upon notice from the Borough the right
to discharge wastewater shall cease and become null and void unless within the
time specified by the Borough, the I/C user at its expense shall put into
effect such remedial measures as will produce wastewater, which in the opinion
of the Borough, will be satisfactory for discharge into a collection system for
treatment at the treatment plant operated by the Borough, will be satisfactory
for discharge into a collection system for treatment at the treatment plant
operated by the Borough (or unless, in the case of failure to comply with any
condition, rule or regulation, I/C user complies therewith with the time
specified by the Borough within the time set forth in a written notice mailed
to the I/C User, or delivered to any adult believed to be an employee at the I/
C User, which notice shall state that the wastewater from the Township is not
satisfactory to the Borough for a reason falling within clause (A) or (B) of
the preceding sentence hereof, then in the event of such failure the Borough
shall have the right without liability to cause the discontinuance of discharge
of wastewater from the I/C user or seek other remedies that may be available
under the law. Means of effecting such discontinuance shall be provided by I/
C user at its expense and shall be satisfactory to the Borough.
   5.   I/C user at its expense shall provide an appropriate sampling location.
I/C user at its expense shall do such monitoring and reporting as may be
required by the Borough from time to time. The Borough and its employees and
agents are hereby authorized to have access to I/C user’s premises at any and
all times without prior notice for the purpose of monitoring and complying with
this agreement and to exercise any remedies provided by this agreement. I/
C user agrees to make arrangements satisfactory to the Borough to permit
monitoring, inspection, and spot checks at any and all times. I/C user shall
have its security personnel provide access for Borough’s employees and agents
or shall make other arrangements satisfactory to the Borough for providing
access upon short notice.
   6.   Failure to enforce any provision of this agreement shall not be deemed
a waiver of the Borough’s right to enforce any or all provisions hereof. The
Borough assumes no responsibility for enforcement of this agreement. No duty or
responsibility of I/C user shall be deemed to have been shifted in whole or in
part to the Borough by this agreement, but I/C user shall remain as fully
responsible as it would have been if this agreement had never been executed. I/
C user agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Borough, its engineer and
their agents, and employees from any against all claims, damages, losses,
fines, penalties and expenses, including, without limitation, attorney fees,
arising out of, or resulting from discharge of effluent from the I/C user. In
addition, in the event of breach of any provision of this agreement, I/C user
agrees to reimburse the Borough for all expenses incurred by the Borough as
calculated by the Borough as a result of such breach.
   7.   I/C user shall promptly reimburse the Borough for the Borough’s expense
in monitoring, inspecting, sampling, and testing, (including, without
limitation, laboratory work) in an effort to determine whether the Township is
complying with this agreement and with permits granted.
   8.   If a substance is believed by the Borough to be endangering the
Borough’s plant or treatment process, and if in searching for the source of
such substance the Borough samples at other industrial facilities, which the
Borough would otherwise not have done, I/C user agrees that if its facility is
determined by the Borough to have been the source of such substance, a I/C user
shall reimburse the Borough for Borough’s costs of tracing such substance to I/
C user, as such costs may be calculated by the Borough. Obviously, if the
source of such substance is not found by the Borough, I/C user shall pay for
sampling at its manhole and tests done on its effluent only.
   9.   I/C user agrees to pay to the Borough within 30 days of invoice all
fees, surcharges, etc. that are levied in connection with the industrial
pretreatment program. Interest on late payments shall be computed at the
current prime rate.
   10.   This agreement may not be assigned by I/C user but shall be binding
upon I/C user’s successors and assigns until such time as it is replaced by a
new agreement. This agreement shall inure to the benefit of the Borough, its
successors and assigns.
   11.   Should any one or more of the provisions of this agreement for any
reason be held illegal or invalid, such illegality or invalidity shall not
affect any other provision of this agreement; and this agreement shall, in such
circumstances, be construed and enforced as if such illegal or invalid
provision had not been contained herein.
   12.   This agreement shall be effective until terminated by mutual agreement
of the parties or until modified by the Borough upon notice to I/C user,
whichever shall first occur.
   13.   I/C user agrees to make no change which might cause its effluent to be
in violation of this agreement without first obtaining Borough’s concurrence.
   14.   I/C user agrees immediately to notify the Borough in the event of any
accident or other occurrence which results or may result in discharge into a
sanitary sewage system of effluent which is not in accordance with each and
every provision of this agreement. In the event I/C user’s facilities include a
method of retaining effluent upon I/C user’s property, and in the event that
there is an accident or other occurrence which causes the effluent from I/
C user’s premises to be in violation of this agreement in any respect, I/
C user’s agrees to attempt to retain such effluent upon its premises and
consult with the Borough concerning the best means of bringing the effluent
within the limitations permitted by this agreement before permitting the
effluent to leave the I/C user’s premises.
   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound
hereby, have caused this agreement to be duly executed as of the day and year
first above written.

Part 2
On-Lot Subsurface Sewage Disposal Facilities
§ 18-201.   Title; Introduction; Purpose.
   1.   This Part may be cited as the “OLDS (On-Lot Disposal System) Management
Program for Dauphin Borough.”
   2.   As mandated by the municipal codes, the Clean Streams Law, 35 P.S.
§691.1 et seq., and the Pennsylvania Sewage Facilities Act, Act of January 24,
1996. P.L. 1535 as amended, 35 P.S. §750.1 et seq., known as Act 537,
municipalities have the power and the duty to provide for adequate sewage
treatment facilities and for the protection of the public health by preventing
the discharge of untreated or inadequately treated sewage. The Official Sewage
Facilities Plan for Dauphin Borough indicates that it is necessary to formulate
and implement a sewage management program to effectively prevent and abate
water pollution and hazards to the public health caused by improper treatment
and disposal of sewage.

Borough approve a planning module for land development or amend its official
plan, or a request for an exception to the revision of the official plan, the
location of each initial individual on-lot sewage system and each replacement
area shall be noted upon the plans. If the application is for subdivision or
land development approval, a note constituting a permanent easement shall be
added to the plans stating that no improvements shall be constructed upon the
replacement area, and the deed to be recorded for each lot created as part of
the subdivision or land development shall contain language reflecting this
limitation.

temporary improvements of any character, other than shallow- rooted plant
matter, shall be constructed upon the replacement area.
   B.   This provision shall be enforced by the Borough unless the person who
desires to construct such improvements shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of
the SEO that an alternate replacement area which complies with all applicable
regulations of the DEP, this Part and all other applicable Borough ordinances,
exists upon the lot. If such an alternate replacement area shall be identified,
the alternate replacement area may be considered to be the replacement area.
The newly designated replacement area shall thereafter be considered the
replacement area for the purposes of this Part.
   4.   Relief from Replacement Area Requirement.
   A.   If any lot held in single and separate ownership as of the effective
date of this Part does not contain land suitable for a replacement area, the
applicant submitting a land development plan or a planning module for land
development or desiring to install an individual on-lot sewage system may
request that the Council grant an exception to the requirements of providing a
replacement area. The applicant for such an exception shall present credible
evidence to the Council demonstrating (1) that the lot was held in single and
separate ownership on the effective date of this Part; (2) the size of the lot;
(3) inability of the applicant to acquire adjacent land or the unsuitability of

is malfunctioning, the Borough shall take action to require the correction of
the malfunction. If total correction is not technically or financially feasible
in the opinion of the Borough and a representative of the DEP, action by the
owner to mitigate the malfunction shall be required.
   6.   There may arise geographic areas within the Borough where numerous on-
lot sewage disposal systems are malfunctioning. A resolution of these area wide
problems may necessitate detailed planning and a Borough sponsored revision to
that area’s Act 537 Official Sewage Facilities Plan. When a DEP authorized
Official Sewage Facilities Plan Revision has been undertaken by the Borough,
pending the outcome of the plan revision process. However, the Borough may
compel immediate corrective action whenever a malfunction, as determined by
Borough officials and the Pennsylvania DEP, represents a serious public health
or environmental threat.

   Garbage shall be collected in accordance with the agreement of Borough
Council and the garbage collector and at such other times as Borough Council
may provide.
(Ord. 74-2, 1/8/1974, §1)
§ 20-102.   Garbage Collection by Contractor, Disposal Outside of Borough.
   1.   All garbage of this Borough shall be collected and removed by a
responsible person under contract with the Borough and shall be disposed of by
such person by feeding outside the limits of the Borough or as provided in such
contract.
   2.   Garbage collections may be made by other persons other than the
Borough’s contractor or collector for all garbage in excess of the amount
required to be collected by the Borough Collector.
(Ord. 74-2, 1/8/1974, §2)
§ 20-103.   Garbage Collection Vehicles; Conduct of Collections by Contractor.
   The contractor shall be required to collect and remove garbage from within
the Borough in vehicles which shall be equipped with watertight beds
constructed of an impervious material, and to so conduct the collection,
removal and transportation of the garbage under such contract as to insure
general sanitation throughout the entire process and operation thereof.
(Ord. 74-2, 1/8/1974, §3)
§ 20-104.   Preparation of Garbage for Collection; Placement of Containers.
   All residents of the Borough shall place the garbage accumulated upon the

(Ord. 74-2, 1/8/1974, §4)
§ 20-105.   Fees.
   Fees for the collection of trash and garbage shall be assessed against each
residential unit at the rate as established, from time to time, by resolution
of the Borough Council. All accounts will be billed to the owner at the place
of collection.
(Ord. 74-2, 1/8/1974, §5; as amended by Ord. 79-4, 5/8/1979; by Ord. 81-4, 10/
6/1981; by Ord. 87-4, 12/8/1987, §1; by Ord. 88-5, 12/6/1988, §1; by Ord. 89-2,
11/6/1989, §1; by Ord. 05-02, 3/8/2005, §1; by Ord. 07-04, 6/5/2007, §2; and by
Ord. 2012-03, 12/4/2012)
§ 20-106.   Delinquent Accounts.
   1.   The refuse collection fee will be billed monthly, and shall be due and
payable upon the user’s receipt of the statement. Receipt shall be presumed on
the third day after the Borough’s day of issuance.
   2.   In the event that payment is not received by the Borough prior to the
end of the calendar month in which the statement is issued, a penalty of 10
percent shall be added to the user’s account. This penalty shall be calculated
as follows:
   A.   The user’s balance at month’s end multiplied by .10 equals the penalty.
For example, $10.20 (balance at the end of the first month) times .10 equals
$1.02. This amount is added to the $10.20 for a new balance of $11.22. The new
balance due shall be the sum of the prior balance plus the penalty. The new
balance due will be carried over to the following month on the user’s account
and shall be due immediately.
   3.   The 10 percent cumulative penalty will be assessed each month, as
described above, on amounts remaining unpaid (including any penalty amounts)
until the account is fully paid; provided, however, that the total accrued
penalty hereunder, together with the total accrued penalty under the Borough’s
General Sewer Ordinance (the “Sewer Ordinance”) [Chapter 18], shall not exceed
(A) $500 per dwelling unit with respect to residential accounts, and (B) $3,000
per account with respect to commercial, industrial and school accounts.
   4.   Every claim of the Borough for refuse collection fees, together with
all charges, penalties, expenses and fees added thereto for failure to pay
promptly, shall, in the manner required by law, become a lien upon the
properties served, and may be collected by the Borough by an action in
assumpsit against the owner of the property or enforced against the property by
filing a municipal claim.
   5.   All delinquent accounts are subject to stoppage of service without
notice. If service is terminated, service shall be restored only after the user
shall have paid all amounts then due and owing under this Part, including
without limitation any amounts which are not yet delinquent. In addition, any
user determined by Borough Council to be an habitual offender, as defined in
subsection .1 of §
18-138 of the Sewer Ordinance [Chapter 18], shall be required to deposit with
the Borough, prior to the restoration of service, the Security Deposit required
under subsection .1 of §
18-138 of the Sewer Ordinance [Chapter 18]. Said security deposit shall be
governed by, and returned in accordance with, subsection .1 of §
18-138 of the Sewer Ordinance [Chapter 18].
   6.   The stoppage of service and penalties hereinbefore authorized for
nonpayment or late payment of the refuse collection fee shall be in addition to
the right of the Borough to proceed under §
20-107 of this Part.
(Ord. 74-2, 1/8/1974, §6; as amended by Ord. 86-3, 12/2/1986, §1; and by Ord.

§ 20-108.   Requirements for Multi-family Residential Dwellings.
   The requirement of this Part is that multi-family residential dwelling
structures within the Borough having six or more units use the municipal trash
collection services may be waived by action of the Borough Council, provided
that evidence is produced that satisfactory trash collection services have been
obtained by the property owners using commercial trash collection services.
Such evidence shall include the stipulation for the use of commercial grade
sanitary dumpsters, complete with covering and for the use of such other
protections to avoid the scattering of trash or the attraction of vermin or the
creation of other nuisances.

Part 4
Design Standards
§ 22-401.   General Standards.
   1.   Standards Applicable to All Areas.
   A.   A subdivision must be coordinated with existing development in the
neighborhood so the entire area will be developed harmoniously.
   B.   In all subdivisions, every precaution shall be taken to preserve all
natural and historic features determined to be worthy of preservation by the
Borough. Examples of such features would include, but not be limited to, large
trees or stands of trees, watercourses, historic areas and structures, and
scenic views. To insure the protection of such features, the Borough may
require the following additional information to be submitted:
   (1)   A grading plan showing the existing and proposed ground elevations
relative to the features.
   (2)   The accurate location of the features to be protected.
   (3)   An explanation of the precautions to be taken by the developer to
protect such features.
   C.   Where any excavation or grading is proposed or where any existing
trees, shrubs or other vegetative cover will be removed, the developer shall
consult the County Conservation District representative concerning plans for
erosion and sediment control and to also obtain a report on the soil
characteristics of the site so that a determination can be made as to the type
of development the site may accommodate.
   D.   In areas of a subdivision where the average slope exceeds 15 percent,
the Borough may recommend modifications to these regulations.
   E.   Where the lots in a subdivision are large enough for resubdivision or
where a portion of the tract is not subdivided, suitable access to these areas
shall be provided.
   2.   Additional Standards for Flood-Prone Areas.
   A.   Where not prohibited by this or any other laws or ordinances, land
located in floodprone area(s) may be platted for development with the provision
that the developer construct all buildings and structures to preclude flood
damage in accordance with this and any other laws and ordinances regulating
such development.
   B.   No subdivision and/or land development, or part thereof, shall be
approved if the proposed development and/or improvements will, individually or
collectively, increase the regulatory flood elevation more than 1 foot at any
point.
   C.   Building sites for residences or any other type of dwelling or
accommoda tion shall not be permitted in any floodway area. Sites for these
uses may be permitted outside the floodway area if the sites or dwelling units
are elevated to a height at least 1½ feet above the elevation of the regulatory
flood. If fill is used to raise the elevation of a site, the fill area shall
extend out laterally for a distance of at least 10 feet beyond the limits of
the proposed structures.
   D.   Building sites for structures or buildings other than for residential
uses are not permitted in any floodway area. Such sites for structures or
buildings outside the floodway shall be protected as provided for in paragraph
.B above. However, the governing body may allow the subdivision and/or
development of areas or sites for commercial and industrial uses at an
elevation less than 1½ feet above the regulatory flood if the developer
otherwise protects the area to that height or assures that the buildings or
structures will be floodproofed at least up to that height.
   E.   If the Borough Council determines that only a part of a proposed plat
can be safely developed, it shall limit development to that part and shall
require that development proceed consistent with this determination.
   F.   When a developer does not intend to develop the plat himself and the
Borough Council determines that additional controls are required to insure safe
development, it may require the developer to impose appropriate deed
restrictions on the land. Such deed restrictions shall be inserted in every
deed and noted on every recorded plat.
(Ord. 6/6/1977, §401)
§ 22-402.   Street Design.
   1.   General.
   A.   The location and width of all streets shall conform to any official map
or comprehensive plan or to, such parts thereof as may have been adopted by the
Borough and/or County.
   B.   The proposed street system shall extend existing or recorded streets at
the same width but in no case at less than the required minimum width.
   C.   Where, in the opinion of the Borough Council, it is desirable to,
provide for street access to adjoining property, streets shall be extended by
dedication to the boundary of such property.
   D.   New minor streets shall be designed so as to discourage through
traffic, but the developer shall give adequate consideration to providing for
the extension and continuation of major and collector streets into and from
adjoining properties.
   E.   Where a subdivision abuts an existing street of improper width or
alignment, the Borough Council may require the dedication of land sufficient to
widen the street or correct the alignment.
   F.   Private streets (streets not offered for dedication) shall meet the
design standards of these regulations.
   2.   Streets in Flood-Prone Areas. The finished elevation of proposed
streets shall be no more than 2 feet below the regulatory flood elevation. The
Borough Council may require, where necessary, profiles and elevations of
streets to determine compliance with this requirement. Drainage openings shall
be sufficient to discharge flood flows without unduly increasing flood heights.
   3.   Alleys. Alleys shall be prohibited except where found to be necessary.
   4.   Intersections.
   A.   Number of Streets. No intersection shall involve the junction of more
than two streets.
   B.   Angle of Intersection. Right-angle intersections shall be used wherever
possible. In no instance, however, shall streets intersect at an angle of less
than 75 degrees.
   C.   Intersection Grades. Maximum grade within any intersection shall not
exceed 1 percent in any direction and approaches shall follow a straight line
for a distance of at least 100 feet from the intersection with maximum grades
not to exceed 5 percent.
   D.   Intersection Sight Distance. Proper sight lines shall be provided and
maintained at all intersections. Measured along the street centerline, there
must be a clear sight triangle of 75 feet. Where either of the two streets is a
collector street a clear sight triangle of 100 feet shall be required and where
either of the two streets is an arterial a clear sight triangle of 150 feet
shall be required. No building, structure or other visual obstruction shall be
located within this triangular area.
   E.   Intersection Curve Radii. Design of curb or edge of pavement must take
into account such factors as types of turning vehicles, likely speeds of
traffic, angle of turn, etc., but in no instance shall the radius of the curb
or edge of pavement be less than the following:
 
Intersection             Curve Radius
Minor with minor street  15 feet
Minor with collector     25 feet
Collector with collector 35 feet
 
   F.   Distance Between Intersections. Minor and collector streets shall not
intersect arterial streets on the same side at less than 800-foot intervals and
shall be in alignment with any existing or proposed streets intersecting from
the opposite side. If two streets that intersect another from opposite sides
cannot be aligned, then a distance of at least 150 feet shall be provided
between the two intersecting centerlines.
   5.   Streets Not in Alignment. If streets are not in alignment, the distance
between the centerlines of streets opening on opposite sides of an existing or
proposed street shall be no less than 150 feet.
   6.   Sight Distance. Sight distance must be provided with respect to both
horizontal and vertical, alignment. Measured along, the centerline, 4½ feet
above grade, this sight distance must be as follows:
   A.   Collector street equals 200 feet.
   B.   Minor street equals 100 feet.
   7.   Curves. Where connecting street lines deflect from each other at any
one point by more than 10 degrees, the line must be connected with a true,
circular curve. The minimum radius of the centerline for the curve must be as
follows:
   A.   Collector street equals 300 feet.
   B.   Minor street equals 150 feet.
   Straight portions of the street must be tangent to the beginning or end of
curves. Except for minor streets, there must be a tangent of at least 100 feet
between reverse curves.
   8.   Street Widths.
   A.   Minimum street right-of-way and cartway widths shall be as follows:
 
                       Right-of-Way                                   Cartway
                       as determined by the Borough Council after
Arterial streets       consul tation with the Pennsylvania Department
                       of Transportation

   B.   Provision for additional street width (right-of-way, cartway or both)
may be required when determined to be necessary by the Borough Council in
specific cases for:
   (1)   Public safety and convenience.
   (2)   On-Street Parking. An additional 8 feet shall be required for each
lane of on-street parking; i.e., two lanes of on-street parking is 16 feet.
   (3)   Widening of existing streets where the width does not meet the
requirements of the preceding paragraphs.
   9.   Cul-de-Sac Streets. Cul-de-sac streets designed to be so permanently
shall not exceed 500 feet in length and shall be provided with a paved
turnaround having a minimum diameter of 70 feet and a legal right-of-way of 100
feet in diameter, except in nonresidential areas where cul-de-sac streets may
exceed 500 feet in length when, under special circumstances, the Borough
Council deems such additional length necessary. In residential areas, cul-de-
sacs may not serve more than 20 single-family dwelling units:
   10.   Street Grades.
   A.   The minimum grade of all streets shall not be less than 0.5 percent.
The maximum grade shall be as follows:
   (1)   Arterial Streets. As determined by the Borough Council after
consultation with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.

   (3)   Minor Streets. Ten percent.
   (4)   Alleys. Ten percent.
   B.   Vertical curves shall be used in changes of grade when the difference
exceeds 1 percent and shall be designed for maximum visibility. Intersections
shall be approached on all sides by leveling areas. Where the grades exceed 7
percent, such leveling areas shall have a minimum length of 60 feet (measured
from the intersection of the centerlines) within which, no grade shall exceed a
maximum of 4 percent.
   11.   Slope of Banks Along Streets. The slope of banks along streets
measured perpendicular to the street centerline shall be no steeper than the
following:
   A.   One foot of vertical measurement for 3 feet of horizontal measurement
for fills.
   B.   One foot of vertical measurement for 2 feet of horizontal measurement
for cuts.
   12.   Partial and Half-Streets. The dedication of half-streets at the
perimeter of new subdivisions is prohibited.
   13.   Names of Streets. Names of new streets shall not duplicate or
approximate existing or platted street names, or approximate such names by the
use of suffixes such as “lane,” “way,” “drive,” “court,” or “avenue.” In
approving the names of streets, consideration should be given to existing or
platted street names within the postal delivery district served by the local
post office. New streets shall bear the same name or number of any continuation
or alignment with an existing or platted street.
   14.   Reserve Strips. Controlling access to streets by reserve strips is
prohibited except where their control is definitely placed in the Borough under
conditions approved by the Borough. A reserve strip is a parcel of ground in
separate ownership separating a street from other adjacent properties or from
another street.
(Ord. 6/6/1977, §402)

larger, less frequent floods. Drainage plans shall be consistent with local and
regional drainage plans.
   A.   Accommodation for Upstream Drainage Areas.
   (1)   Design. Storm drainage facilities must be designed not only to handle
the anticipated peak discharge from the property being developed but also from
the anticipated increase in runoff that may occur when all the property at a
higher elevation in the same drainage basin is fully developed.
   (2)   Construction.
   (a)   If any property at a higher elevation is the property of the
developer, or if the developer has any interest in such property, drainage
facilities shall be constructed to handle the anticipated peak discharge from
such property.
   (b)   If the developer neither owns nor has any interest in any property at
a higher elevation, the Borough may, at its option, participate finan cially in
the construction of drainage facilities to upgrade any portion or portions of
such facility necessary to meet design specifications in excess of those
required of the developer, but necessary to handle the anticipated peak
discharge from property at a higher elevation.
   B.   Downstream Drainage Areas.
   (1)   Adequate Existing Facilities. Where adequate existing storm sewers are
readily accessible, the developer must connect his storm facilities to these
existing storm sewers.
   (2)   Inadequate Existing Facilities. Where existing storm sewers at a lower
elevation are inadequate to handle the peak discharge from a proposed
development, the developer shall bear the cost of upgrading the drainage
facilities at the lower elevation.
   C.   Abutting Properties.
   (1)   In the design of storm drainage facilities, special consideration must
be given to preventing excess runoff on to adjacent developed or undeveloped
properties. In no case may a change be made in the existing topography which
would:
   (a)   Result in increasing any portion of the slope steeper than 1 foot of
vertical measurement for 3 feet of horizontal measurement for fills, or 1 foot
of vertical measurement for 2 feet of horizontal measurement for cuts within a
distance of 20 feet from the property line unless an adequate retaining wall or
other structure is provided.
   (b)   Result in a slope which exceeds the normal angle of slippage of the
material involved.
   (2)   All slopes must be protected against erosion.
   D.   Drainage Upon and On Streets.
   (1)   Upon Streets. In order to give proper surface water drainage upon
streets, a structure on a lot must be at a grade in satisfactory relationship:
   (a)   With established street grade.
   (b)   With the existing street grade where none is established.
   (2)   On Streets. A street must be designed so as to provide for the
discharge of surface water from its right-of-way. The slope of a crown on a
street shall not be less than of an inch per foot and not more than of an inch
per foot. Adequate facilities must be provided at low points along the street
and other points necessary to intercept runoff.
(Ord. 6/6/1977, §504)
§ 22-505.   Curbs and Gutters.
   1.   Wherever a proposed subdivision or land development shall average three
or more lots per gross acre included in the subdivision, or where any
subdivision is immediately adjacent to or within 1,000 feet of any existing or
recorded development having curbs, curbs shall be installed on each side of the
street. The type of curbing
(rolled or vertical) to be installed shall be determined by the Borough
Council.
   2.   All curbing shall be constructed in accordance with Borough
specifications.
   3.   In areas where curbing is not required, suitable gutters or swales
shall be installed to avoid erosion.
   4.   Curb cut ramps for handicapped persons shall be installed at all
crosswalks, where feasible.
(Ord. 6/6/1977, §505)
§ 22-506.   Sidewalks.
   Wherever a proposed development shall average three or more lots per gross
acre included in the immediate development, or where any development is
immediately adjacent to or within 1,000 feet of any existing or recorded
development having sidewalks, sidewalks shall be installed on each side of the
street in accordance with the Borough’s specifications. The Borough Council may
require installation of sidewalks in any development where the evidence
indicates that sidewalks are necessary for the public safety.
   A.   Sidewalks shall be within the right-of-way of the street and shall
extend in width from the right-of-way line toward the curb line.
   B.   Sidewalks must be at least 4 feet wide. In the vicinity of shopping
centers, schools, recreation areas and other such facilities, sidewalks must be
at least 5 feet wide and located within the street right-of-way.

§ 22-511.   Installation and Completion of Improvements.
   1.   Before starting any construction or installation of improvements, the
developer shall notify the Borough of his intention to initiate such work. The
Borough shall authorize the Borough Engineer to monitor and inspect the
installation of improve ments during their construction. When the developer has
completed all of the necessary and appropriate improvements, he shall notify
Borough Council, in writing, by certified or registered mail, of the completion
of the aforesaid improvements and shall send a copy thereof to the Borough
Engineer. Borough Council shall within 10 days after receipt of such notice,
direct and authorize the Borough Engineer to inspect all of the aforesaid
improvements. The Borough Engineer shall, thereupon, file a report, in writing,
with Borough Council, and shall promptly mail a copy of the same to the
developer by certified or registered mail. The report shall be made and mailed
within 30 days after receipt by the Borough Engineer of the aforesaid
authorization from Borough Council; said report shall be detailed and shall
indicate approval or rejection of said improvements, either in whole or in
part, and if said improvements or any portions thereof shall not be approved or
shall be rejected by the Borough Engineer, said report shall contain a
statement of reasons for such nonapproval or rejection.
   2.   Borough Council shall notify the developer, in writing, by certified or
registered mail, of the action of said Borough Council with relation thereto.
   3.   If Borough Council or the Borough Engineer fails to comply with the

have been approved and the developer shall be released from all liability
pursuant to its performance guaranty bond or other security agreement.
   4.   If any portion of the said improvements shall not be approved or shall
be rejected by Borough Council, the developer shall proceed to complete the
same and, upon completion, the same procedure of notification, as outlined

   In the event that any improvements which may be required have not been
installed in accord with the approved final plan, Borough Council is hereby
granted the power to enforce any corporate bond or other security by
appropriate legal and equitable remedies. If proceeds of such bond or other
security are insufficient to pay the cost of installing or making repairs or
corrections to all the improvements covered by said security, Borough Council
may, at its option, install part of such improvements in all or part of the
development and may institute appropriate legal or equitable action to recover
the monies necessary to complete the remainder of the improvements. All of the
proceeds, whether resulting either from the security or from any legal or
equitable action brought against the developer or both, shall be used solely
for the installation of the improvements covered by such security, and not for

   Upon installation by the developer and subsequent inspection by the Borough
Engineer, the developer shall take final steps to dedicate the improvements and
have them accepted by the Borough. The recording of the final plan, following
approval by Borough Council has the effect of an irrevocable offer to dedicate
all streets and other public ways and areas to public use. The offer, however,
does not impose any duty on the Borough concerning maintenance or improvement
until the proper authorities of the Borough have made actual acceptance, either
by ordinance or by resolution.
(Ord. 6/6/1977, §513)
§ 22-514.   Private Streets.
   Wherever a developer proposes to establish a street which is not offered for
dedication, he shall submit a copy of a statement signed by the Borough
Solicitor that he has made an agreement on behalf of his heirs and assigns with
the Borough. Said agreement shall be subject to the Borough Solicitor’s
approval and shall be filed with the development plan. Said agreement shall
establish the conditions under which the street or streets may later be offered
for dedication and shall stipulate among other things:
   A.   That the street shall be in a good state of repair as certified by the
Borough Engineer, or that the owners of the lots along it agree to include with
the offer of dedication sufficient money, as estimated by the Borough Engineer,
to restore the street to a good state of repair.
   B.   That an offer to dedicate the street shall be made only for the street
as a whole.
   C.   The method of assessing repair costs.

General Provisions
§ 23-101.   Short Title.
   This Chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Dauphin Borough
Stormwater Management Ordinance.”
(Ord. 11-01, 2/8/2011, §101)
§ 23-102.   Statement of Findings.
   The governing body of Dauphin Borough finds that:
   A.   Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from
development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities,
contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of
existing streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public
facilities to convey and manage stormwater, undermines floodplain management
and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities, reduces
groundwater recharge, threatens public health and safety, and increases non-
point source pollution of water resources.
   B.   A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including reasonable
regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff, is
fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare, and the protection of the
people of Dauphin Borough and all the people of the Commonwealth, their
resources, and the environment.
   C.   Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from
land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface
water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns; accelerating
stream flows (which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and stream banks
thereby elevating sedimentation); destroying aquatic habitat; and elevating
aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients,
heavy metals, and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted through
loss of recharge.
   D.   Stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater
recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams, which also protects and
maintains surface water quality.
   E.   Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater issues.
   F.   Federal and State regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are required
to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer
systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).
   G.   Non-stormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems can
contribute to pollution of Waters of the Commonwealth.
(Ord. 11-01, 2/8/2011, §102)
§ 23-103.   Purpose.
   The purpose of this Chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
Dauphin Borough, Dauphin County, by minimizing the harms and maximizing the
benefits described in §23-102 of this Chapter through provisions intended to:
   A.   Meet legal water quality requirements under State law, including
regulations at 25 Pa.Code, Chapter 93, to protect, maintain, reclaim, and
restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of the Commonwealth.
   B.   Manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems close
to their source, by regulating activities that cause these problems.
   C.   Preserve the natural drainage systems to the maximum extent
practicable.
   D.   Maintain groundwater recharge, to prevent degradation of surface and
groundwater quality, and to otherwise protect water resources.
   E.   Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses.
   F.   Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams and prevent
scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
   G.   Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, with a minimum of
structures and a maximum use of natural processes.
   H.   Provide procedures, performance standards, and design criteria for
stormwater planning and management.
   I.   Provide proper operations and maintenance of all temporary and
permanent stormwater management facilities and best management practices (BMPs)
that are constructed and implemented.
   J.   Provide standards to meet the NPDES permit requirements.

   C.   For projects that add impervious area to a developed parcel, the new
impervious area is subject to the requirements of this Chapter; and any
existing impervious area that is within the new proposed limit of disturbance
is also subject to the requirements of this Chapter.
   7.   If diffused flow is proposed to be concentrated and discharged onto
adjacent property, the applicant must document that adequate downstream
conveyance facilities exist to safely transport the concentrated discharge, or
otherwise prove that no erosion, sedimentation, flooding, or other harm will
result from the concentrated discharge.
   A.   Applicant must provide an executed easement for newly concentrated flow
across adjacent properties.
   8.   Stormwater drainage systems shall be provided in order to permit
unimpeded flow along natural watercourses, except as modified by stormwater
management facilities or open channels consistent with this Chapter.
   9.   Where watercourses traverse a development site, drainage easements
(with a minimum width of 20 feet) shall be provided conforming to the line of
such watercourses. The terms of the easement shall prohibit excavation, the
placing of fill or structures, and any alterations that may adversely affect
the flow of stormwater within any portion of the easement. Also, maintenance,
including mowing of vegetation within the easement may be required, except as
approved by the appropriate governing authority.
   10.   When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural
drainageways on the site cannot adequately provide for drainage, open channels
may be constructed conforming substantially to the line and grade of such
natural drainageways. Work within natural drainage ways shall be subject to
approval by PADEP under regulations at 25 Pa.Code, Chapter 105, through the
joint permit application process, or, where deemed appropriate by PADEP,
through the general permit process.
   11.   Any stormwater management facilities or any facilities that constitute
water obstructions (e.g., culverts, bridges, outfalls, or stream enclosures,
etc.) that are regulated by this Chapter, that will be located in or adjacent
to waters of the Commonwealth (including wetlands), shall be subject to
approval by PADEP under regulations at 25 Pa.Code, Chapter 105, through the
joint permit application process, or, where deemed appropriate by PADEP, the
general permit process. When there is a question whether wetlands may be
involved, it is the responsibility of the applicant or his agent to show that
the land in question cannot be classified as wetlands; otherwise, approval to
work in the area must be obtained from PADEP.
   12.   Should any stormwater management facility require a dam safety permit
under 25 Pa.Code, Chapter 105, the facility shall be designed in accordance
with Chapter 105 and meet the regulations of Chapter 105 concerning dam safety
which may be required to pass storms larger than 100-year event.
   13.   Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this Chapter that
will be located on, or discharged onto State highway rights-of-ways shall be
subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT).
   14.   When stormwater management facilities are proposed within 1,000 feet
of a downstream municipality, the stormwater analysis shall be submitted to the
downstream municipality's engineer for review and comment.
   15.   Minimization of impervious surfaces and infiltration of runoff through
seepage beds, infiltration trenches, etc., are encouraged, where soil
conditions and geology permit, to reduce the size or eliminate the need for
detention facilities.
   16.   Infiltration BMPs should be dispersed throughout the site, made as
shallow as practicable, and located to maximize use of natural on-site
infiltration features while still meeting the other requirements of this
Chapter.
   17.   The design of facilities over karst shall include an evaluation and
implementation of measures to minimize adverse effects.
   18.   Roof drains shall not be connected to streets, sanitary or storm
sewers, or roadside ditches in order to promote overland flow and infiltration/
percolation of stormwater where it is advantageous to do so. When it is more
advantageous to connect directly to streets or storm sewers, then the
Municipality shall permit it on a case-by- case basis.
(Ord. 11-01, 2/8/2011, §301)

   5.   The purpose of this Section is to ensure consistency of stormwater
management planning between local ordinances and NPDES permitting (when
required) and to ensure that the applicant has a single and clear set of
stormwater management standards to which the applicant is subject. The
Municipality may accept alternative stormwater management controls provided
that:
   A.   The applicant, in consultation with the Municipality, PADEP and/or
DCED, states that meeting the requirements of the volume controls or rate
controls of this Chapter is not possible or creates an undue hardship.
   B.   The alternative stormwater management controls, proposed by the
applicant, are documented to be acceptable to the Municipality, PADEP and/or
DCCD for NPDES requirements pertaining to post construction stormwater
management requirements.
   C.   The alternative stormwater management controls are in compliance with
all other sections of this Chapter, including but not limited to §§23-301.4,
23-302.1, 23-302.2 and 23-302.3.
   6.   Forest management and timber operations are exempt from rate and volume
control requirements and SWM site plan preparation requirement of this Chapter
provided the activities are performed according to the requirements of 25
Pa.Code, Chapter 102. It should be noted that temporary roadways are not
exempt.
   7.   Agricultural activities are exempt from the requirements of this
Chapter provided the activities are performed according to the requirements of
25 Pa.Code, Chapter 102.
   8.   Linear roadway improvement projects that create additional impervious
area are not exempt from the requirements of this Chapter. However, alternative
stormwater management strategies may be applied at the joint approval of the
Municipality and the Dauphin County Conservation District (if an NPDES permit
is required) when site limitations (such as limited right-of-way) and
constraints (as shown and provided by the applicant), preclude the ability of
the applicant to meet the enforcement of the stormwater management standards in
this Chapter. All strategies must be consistent with PADEP's regulations,
including NPDES requirements.
   9.   The Municipality may, after an applicant has demonstrated compliance
with §§23-302.1, 23-302.2, and 23-302.3, grant a modification of the
requirements of one or more provisions of this Chapter if the literal
enforcement will exact undue hardship because of peculiar conditions pertaining
to the land in question, provided that such modification will not be contrary
to the public interest and that the purpose and intent of this Chapter is
observed.
   A.   All requests for a modification shall be in writing and shall state in
full the grounds and facts of unreasonableness or hardship on which the request
is based, the provision or provisions of the Ordinance involved, and the
minimum modification necessary.
(Ord. 11-01, 2/8/2011, §302)
 
 
Notes
1    Gravel in the existing condition shall be considered pervious and proposed
  gravel shall be considered impervious.
§ 23-303.   Volume Controls.
   1.   The low impact development practices provided in the BMP Manual and in
Appendix 23-B of this Chapter shall be utilized for all regulated activities to
the maximum extent practicable.
   2.   Stormwater runoff volume controls shall be implemented using the design
storm method or the simplified method. For regulated activities equal to or
less than 1 acre, this Chapter establishes no preference for either method;
therefore, the applicant may select either method on the basis of economic
considerations, the intrinsic limitations on applicability of the analytical
procedures associated with each methodology, and other factors.
   A.   The design storm method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) is applicable to any
sized regulated activity. This method requires detailed modeling based on site
conditions.
   (1)   Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume when compared
to the pre-development total runoff volume for the 2-year/24-hour storm event.
   (2)   For hydrologic modeling purposes:
   (a)   Existing non-forested pervious areas must be considered meadow (good
condition) for pre-development hydrologic calculations.
   (b)   Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present on the
proposed project site, and contained within the new proposed limit of
disturbance, shall be considered meadow (good condition) for pre- development
hydrologic calculations for re-development.
   B.   The simplified method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual) is independent of site
conditions and should be used if the design storm method is not followed. This
method is not applicable to regulated activities greater than 1 acre. For new
impervious surfaces:
   (1)   Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first 2 inches of
runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
   (2)   At least the first 1 inch of runoff from new impervious surfaces shall
be permanently removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it shall not be released
into surface waters of the Commonwealth. Removal options include reuse,
evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration.
   (3)   Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed runoff; however, in
all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the permanently removed runoff should
be infiltrated.
   3.   All applicable worksheets from Chapter 8 of the BMP Manual must be used
when establishing volume controls.
   4.   Actual field infiltration tests at the location of the proposed
elevation of the stormwater BMPs are required when 5,000 square feet or greater
of new impervious surface is added. Infiltration test shall be conducted in
accordance with BMP Manual. The Municipality shall be notified 24-hours prior
to infiltration tests being conducted as to provide an opportunity for the
Municipality to witness the tests.
(Ord. 11-01, 2/8/2011, §303)
 
§ 23-304.   Rate Controls.
   1.   Lands contained within Dauphin County that have not had release rates
established under an approved Act 167 Stormwater Management Plan: (This
includes portions of Dauphin Borough within the Susquehanna River Watershed,
but located outside of the Stony Creek Watershed.).
   A.   Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the pre-development
discharge rates for the 1-year, 2-year, 10-year, 25-year, 50-year, and 100-year
storms.
   2.   Lands contained within Dauphin County that have had release rates
established under an approved Act 167 Stormwater Management Plan: (This
includes portions of Dauphin Borough located within the Stony Creek Watershed.)
   A.   Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the pre-development
discharge rates for the 1-year, 50-year, and 100-year storms.
   B.   For the 2-year, 10-year, and 25-year storms, the post-development peak
discharge rates shall be in accordance with the approved release rate map for
the individual watershed. (For Stony Creek Watershed; 2-year: 30 percent
release rate, 10- and 25-year: 100 percent release rate.)
   (Note: The release rates indicated, represent a percent such that the post-
development peak flow must not exceed the release rate (as a decimal value)
times the pre-development peak flow, with flows calculated at the mouth of a
subarea.)

Design Criteria
§ 23-701.   Design Criteria for Stormwater Management and Drainage Facilities.
   1.   General Design Guidelines.
   A.   Stormwater shall not be transferred from one watershed to another,
unless (1) the watersheds are sub-watersheds of a common watershed which join
together within the perimeter of the property; (2) the effect of the transfer
does not alter the peak rate discharge onto adjacent lands; or (3) easements
from the affected landowner(s) are provided.
   B.   Consideration shall be given to the relationship of the subject
property to the drainage pattern of the watershed. A concentrated discharge of
stormwater to an adjacent property shall be within an existing watercourse or
confined in an easement or returned to a pre-development flow type condition.
   C.   Stormwater BMPs and recharge facilities are encouraged (e.g., rooftop
storage, drywells, cisterns, recreation area ponding, diversion structures,
porous pavements, holding tanks, infiltration systems, stream channel storage,
in-line storage in storm sewers, and grading patterns). They shall be located,
designed, and constructed in accordance with the latest technical guidance
published by PADEP, provided they are accompanied by detailed engineering plans
and performance capabilities and supporting site specific soils, geology,
runoff and groundwater and infiltration rate data to verify proposed designs.
Additional guidance from other sources may be accepted at the discretion of the
Municipal Engineer (a pre-application meeting is suggested).
   D.   All existing and natural watercourses, channels, drainage systems and
areas of surface water concentration shall be maintained in their existing
condition unless an alteration is approved by the appropriate regulatory
agency.
   E.   No outlet structure from a stormwater management facility, or swale,
shall discharge directly onto a Municipal or State roadway.
   F.   The invert of all stormwater management facilities and underground
infiltration/storage facilities shall be located a minimum of 2 feet above the
seasonal high groundwater table or other soil limiting zone. The invert of
stormwater facilities may be lowered if adequate sub-surface drainage, which
does not alter the existing water table level, is provided.
   G.   Any stormwater management facility may be required to be fenced with a
minimum 4-foot high fence of material acceptable to the Municipality. Gates
with a minimum opening of 10 feet shall be provided for access.
   H.   Stormwater management facilities excavated to carbonate rock must
either be fitted with an impervious clay liner, or over-excavated 4 feet and
refilled with a suitable material mix. Suitable backfill material is subject to
the approval of the Municipal Engineer.
   9.   The type, location, and number of landscaping and planting
specification shall be provided for all stormwater management facilities and be
specific for each type of facility.
   2.   Stormwater management facilities (with a depth of water equal to or
greater then 3 feet measured from the lowest point inside a facility to the
crest of the emergency spillway):
   A   Any stormwater management facility designed to store runoff and
requiring a berm or earthen embankment, shall be designed to provide an
emergency spillway to handle peak rate of stormwater runoff up to and including
the 100-year post-development flow, with a blocked primary outlet structure.
The height of embankment must be set as to provide a minimum 1 foot of
freeboard through the spillway, above the maximum water surface elevation,
computed when the spillway functions for the 100-year post-development inflow,
with a blocked outlet structure. The primary outflow structure must be designed
to pass all design storms (up to and including the 100-year event) without
discharging through the emergency spillway. The maximum water depth within any
stormwater management facility shall be no greater than 8 feet when functioning
through the primary outlet structure.
   B.   Emergency spillways shall be armored to prevent erosion during the 100-
year post-development flow, with blocked primary outlet structure. Synthetic
liners or rip-rap may be used, and calculations sufficient to support proposed
armor must be provided. An earthen plug must be used to accurately control the
spillway invert if rip-rap is the proposed armoring material. Emergency
spillway armor must extend up the sides of the spillway, and continue at full
width to a minimum of 10 feet past the toe of slope.
   C.   A stormwater management facility berm cross sections must be at least 5
feet wide at the top, and 8 feet wide through the emergency spillway.
Embankment side slopes shall be no steeper than 3:1 (horizontal:vertical).
   D.   A cutoff and key trench of impervious material shall be provided under
all embankments 4 feet or greater in height.
   E.   Soils used for the construction of stormwater management facilities
shall have low-erodibility factors (“K” factors) (refer to E&S Manual) and be
identified on the SWM site plan.
   F. Trash racks must be provided to prevent clogging of primary outflow
structure stages for all orifices equivalent to 12 inches or smaller in
diameter.
   G.   Anti-seep collars must be provided on all outflow culverts in
accordance with the methodology contained in the latest edition of the E&S
Manual. An increase in seepage length of 15 percent must be used in accordance
with the requirements for permanent anti-seep collars.
   H.   Conventional, non-BMP stormwater management facilities (i.e., dry
detention basins) must empty over a period of time not less than 24 hours and
not more than 72 hours from the end of the facility's inflow hydrograph.
Infiltration tests performed at the facility locations and proposed basin
bottom depths, in accordance with the BMP Manual, must support time-to-empty
calculations if infiltration is a factor is the sizing of the stormwater
management facility.
   I.   Impervious low-flow channels are not permitted within stormwater
management facilities to promote water quality and groundwater recharge for
frequent storm events. Facilities designed as water quality / infiltration BMPs
may have a bottom slope of zero. Minimal maintenance, saturation tolerant
vegetation must be provided in basins designed as water quality/infiltration
BMPs. Conventional, non-BMP stormwater management facilities must have a
minimum slope of 1 percent extending radially out from the primary outlet
structure. Water storage below the lowest outlet structure stage (i.e., dead
storage) is permitted in stormwater management facilities designed as water
quality / infiltration BMPs.
   J.   Stormwater management facilities bottom elevations must be greater than
adjacent floodplain elevations (FEMA or HEC-RAS analysis). If no floodplain is
defined, bottom elevations must be higher than existing ground elevations 50
feet from top of stream bank in the facilities vicinity.
   K.   Basin outflow culverts discharging into floodplains must account for
tailwater. Tailwater corresponding to the 100-year floodplain elevation may be
used for all design storms, or the applicant may elect to determine flood
elevations of the 50 feet from top of stream bank in areas where a floodplain
is not designated, or where no other evidence is provided.
   L.   Exceptions to these requirements may be made at the discretion of the
Municipality for BMPs that retain or detain water, but are of a much smaller
scale than traditional stormwater management facilities.
   3.   Storm Sewer Facilities.
   A.   Storm sewers must be able to convey post-development runoff from a 10-
year design storm without surcharging inlets where appropriate. When connecting
to an existing storm sewer system, the applicant must demonstrate that the
proposed system will not exacerbate any existing stormwater problems and that
adequate downstream capacity exists.
   B.    A minimum pipe size of 15 inches in diameter shall be used in all
roadway systems (public or private) proposed for construction. Pipes shall be
designed to provide a minimum velocity of 2½ feet per second when flowing full,
but in all cases, the slope shall be no less then 0.5 percent. Arch pipe of
equivalent cross- sectional area may be substituted in lieu of circular pipe
where cover or utility conflict conditions exist.
   C.   In proposed curbed roadway sections, the maximum encroachment of water
on the roadway pavement shall not exceed half of a through travel lane or 1
inch less than the depth of curb during the 10-year design storm of 5-minute
duration. Gutter depth shall be verified by inlet capture/capacity calculations
that account for road slope and opening area. The maximum distance between
inlets in curbed roadway sections shall be no more then 600 feet, however
access to underground pipes shall be provided every 300 feet.
   D.   Standard type “C” inlets with 8-inch hoods shall be used along vertical
concrete curbs roadway networks. Type “C” inlets with 10-inch hoods that
provide a 2-inch sump condition may be used with approval of the Municipal
Engineer when roadway longitudinal slopes are 1.0 percent or less.
   E.   For inlets containing a change in pipe size, the elevation for the
crown of the pipes shall be the same or the smaller pipe’s crown shall be at a
higher elevation.
   F.   All inlets shall provide a minimum 2-inch drop between the lowest inlet
pipe invert elevation and the outlet pipe invert elevation.
   G.   On curbed sections, a double inlet shall be placed at the low point of
sag on vertical curves, or an inlet shall be placed at the low point and on
each side of the low point at a distance not to exceed 100 feet, or at an
elevation not to exceed 0.2 feet above the low point.
   H.   At all roadway low points, swales and easements shall be provided
behind the curb or swale and through adjacent properties to channelize and
direct any overflow of stormwater runoff away from dwellings and structures.
   I.   Inlets shall be placed so drainage cannot cross intersections or street
centerlines.
   J.   All inlets in paved areas shall have heavy duty bicycle safe grating
consistent with PennDOT Publication 72M. A note to this effect shall be added
to the SWM site plan or inlet details therein.
   K.   Inlets must be sized to accept the specified pipe sizes without
knocking out any of the inlet corners. All pipes entering or exiting inlets
shall be cut flush with the inlet wall. A note to this effect shall be added to
the SWM site plan or inlet details therein.
   L.   Inlets shall have weep holes covered with geotextile fabric placed at
appropriate elevations to completely drain the sub grade prior to placing the
base and surface course on roadways.
   M.   Inlets, junction boxes, or manholes greater then 5 feet in depth shall
be equipped with ladder rungs and shall be detailed on the SWM site plan.
   N.   Inlets shall not have a sump condition in the bottom (unless designed
as a water quality BMP). Pipes shall be flush with the bottom of the box or
concrete channels shall be poured.
   O.   Inlets, manholes, pipes, and culverts shall be constructed in
accordance with the specifications set forth in PennDOT's Publication 408,
latest edition, and as detailed in the PennDOT's Publication 72M, “Standards
for Roadway Construction (RC),” latest edition, or as approved by the Municipal
Engineer. All material and construction details (inlets, manholes, pipe
trenches, etc.), must be shown on the SWM site plan, and a note added that all
construction must be in accordance with PennDOT's Publication 408 and PennDOT's
Publication 72M, latest edition. A note shall be added to the plan stating that
all frames, concrete top units, and grade adjustment rings shall be set in a
bed of full mortar according to Publication 408.
   P.   Accessible drainage structures shall be located on continuous storm
sewer system at all vertical dislocations, at all locations where a transition
in storm sewer pipe sizing is required, at all vertical and horizontal angle
points exceeding 5 degrees, and at all points of convergence of two or more
storm sewer pipes.
   Q.   All storm drainage piping (equal to or greater then 12") discharging to
the ground surface shall be provided with either reinforced concrete headwalls
and end sections or plastic and metal pipe end sections compatible with the
pipe size involved in accordance with PennDOT Publication 408 and Publication
72M.
   R.   Outlet protection shall be provided at all surface discharge points
with storm drainage piping (equal to or greater then 12 inches) in order to
minimize erosion consistent with the E&S Manual.
   S.   Pavement base drain shall be provided at all low point in cut areas,
toe of slope areas, and other areas as dictated by proven engineering
principles and design judgment. All base drain shall be in accordance with
PennDOT Publication 408.
   4.   Swale Conveyance Facilities:
   A.   Swales must be able to convey post-development runoff from a 10-year
design storm with 6 inches of freeboard to top of the swale.
   B.   Swales shall have side slopes no steeper than 3:1.

criteria. Velocity criteria may be used for channels with less than 10 percent
slope. Shear criteria may be used for all swales. Documentation must be
provided to support velocity and/or shear limitations used in calculations.
   E.   Where swale bends occur, the computed velocities or shear stresses
shall be multiplied by the following factor for the purpose of designing swale
erosion protection:
   (1)   1.75–when swale bend is 30 to 60 degrees.
   (2)   2.00–when swale bend is 60 to 90 degrees.
   (3)   2.50–when swale bend is 90 degrees or greater.
   F.   Swales must be designed for both temporary and permanent conditions in
accordance with the latest E&S Manual.
(Ord. 11-01, 2/8/2011, §701)
 
§ 23-702.   Calculation Methodology.
   1.   All calculations shall be consistent with the guidelines set forth in
the BMP Manual.
   2.   Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using
either the Rational Method or a Soil Cover Complex methodology. Methods shall
be selected by the qualified professional based on the individual limitations
and suitability of each
method for a particular site.
   3.   Rainfall Values:
   A.   Rational Method. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Drainage
Manual, Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curves, Publication 584, Chapter 7A,
latest edition, shall be used in conjunction with the appropriate time of
concentration and return period.
   B.   Soil Cover Complex Method. The Soil Conservation Service Type II, 24-
hour rainfall distribution shall be used in conjunction with rainfall depths
from NOAA Atlas 14 or consistent with the following table.
Return Interval 24-hour Rainfall Total
(Year)       (Inches)
1            2.40
2            2.90
10           4.36
25           5.43
50           6.38
100          7.48
 
   4.   Peak Flow Rates:
   A.   Rational Method. May be used for drainage areas up to 20 acres. Extreme
caution should be used by the qualified professional if the watershed has more
then one main drainage channel, if the watershed is divided so that hydrologic
properties are significantly different in one verses the other, if the time of
concentration exceeds 60 minutes, or if stormwater runoff volume is an
important factor. The combination of Rational Method hydrographs based on
timing shall be prohibited.
   (1)   The use of the Modified Rational Method to design stormwater
management facilities must be approved by the Municipal Engineer.
   B.   Soil Cover Complex Method. May be used for drainage areas greater then
20 acres. This method is recommended for design of stormwater management
facilities and where stormwater runoff volume must be taken into consideration.
   C.   For comparison of peak flow rates, flows shall be rounded to no more
than the nearest tenth of a cubic foot per second (cfs).
   5.   Runoff Coefficients:
   A.   Rational Method. Use Table 23-C-1 (Appendix 23-C).
   B.   Soil Cover Complex Method. Use Table 23-C-2 (Appendix 23-C).
   C.   For the purposes of pre-development peak flow rate and volume
determination, existing non-forested pervious areas conditions shall be
considered as meadow (good condition).
   D.   For the purposes of pre-development peak flow rate and volume
determination, 20 percent of existing impervious area, when present on the
project site, and contained within the new proposed limit of disturbance, shall
be considered meadow (good condition) for pre-development hydrologic
calculations for re-development.
   6.   Design Storm.
   A.   All drainage facilities (inlets, pipes, and swales) shall be designed
to safely convey the 10-year storm.
   B.   The stormwater management and drainage system shall be designed to
safely convey the post-development 100-year storm event to stormwater detention
facilities, for the purpose of meeting peak rate control.
   C.   All stormwater management facilities shall be verified by routing the
proposed 1-year, 2-year, 10-year, 25-year, 50-year, and 100-year hydrographs
through the facility using the storage indication (Modified Puls) method. The
design storm hydrograph shall be computed using a calculation method that
produces a full hydrograph.
   D.   All structures (culvert or bridges) proposed to convey runoff under a
Municipal road shall be designed to pass the 50-year design storm with a
minimum 1 foot of freeboard measured below the lowest point along the top of
the roadway.
   E.   All design within State or Federal right-of-ways or that falls under
the design criteria of any higher authority must meet the requirements of that
agency in addition to meeting the minimum requirements of this Chapter.
   7.   Time of Concentration.
   A.   Time of concentration shall be computed using the NRCS Segmental Method
as described in TR-55 (SCS 1986 or most current update). The length of sheet
flow shall be limited to 100-feet. The Manning's “n” Roughness Coefficient for
TR-55 sheet flow can be found in Table 23-C-4 (Appendix 23-C). Time of
concentration for channel and pipe flow shall be computed using Manning's
equation.
   B   For sites with insignificant channelized flow and less than 20 percent
imperviousness coverage, the time of concentration may be computed using the
NRCS equation for lag time:
Time of Concentration = Tc = [(Tlag/.6) * 60] (minutes)
 
[IMAGE]
 
 
Where:
Tlag = Lag time (hours)
L = Hydraulic length of watershed (feet)
[IMAGE]Y = Average overland slope of watershed (percent)
S = Maximum retention in watershed as defined by:
 
CN = NRCS Curve Number for watershed as defined by the NRCS Loss Method
 
   C.   Additionally, the following provisions shall apply to calculations for
time of concentration:
   (1)   The post-development time of concentration shall never be greater than
the pre-development time of concentration for any watershed or subwatershed.
   (2)   The minimum time of concentration for any watershed shall be 5
minutes.
   (3)   The designer may choose to assume a 5-minute time of concentration for
any post-development watershed or subwatershed without providing any
computations.
   (4)    The designer must provide computations for all pre-development time
of concentration paths. A 5-minute time of concentration cannot be assumed for
pre-development.
   (5)   Undetained fringe areas (areas that are not tributary to a stormwater
facility but where a reasonable effort has been made to convey runoff from all
new impervious coverage to best management practices) may be assumed to
represent the pre-development conditions for purpose of time of concentration
calculations.
   8.   Drainage areas tributary to sinkholes or closed depressions in areas
underlain by limestone or carbonate geologic features shall be excluded from
the modeled point of analysis defining pre-development flows. If left
undisturbed during construction activities, areas draining to closed
depressions may also be removed from peak runoff rates in the post-development
analysis. New, additional contributing runoff shall not be directed to existing
sinkholes or closed depressions.
   9.   Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning's equation shall be used
for hydraulic computations and to determine the capacity of open channels,
pipes, and storm sewers. The Manning's equation should not be used for analysis
of pipes under pressure flow or for analysis of culverts. Manning's “n” values
shall be obtained from Table 23-C-3 (Appendix 23-C). Inlet control shall be
checked at all inlet boxes to ensure the headwater depth during the 10-year
design event is contained below the top of grate for each inlet box.
   10.   The Municipality may approve the use of any generally accepted full
hydrograph approximation technique that shall use a total runoff volume that is
consistent with the volume from a method that produces a full hydrograph.
   11.   The Municipality has the authority to require that computed existing
runoff rates be reconciled with field observations, conditions and site
history. If the designer can substantiate, through actual physical calibration,
that more appropriate runoff and time of concentration values should be
utilized at a particular site, then appropriate variations may be made upon
review and approval of the Municipality.

are to be dedicated to the Municipality, stormwater control facilities/BMPs may
also be dedicated to and maintained by the Municipality.
   B.   If a development site is to be maintained in a single ownership or if
sewers and other public improvements are to be privately owned and maintained,
then the ownership and maintenance of stormwater control facilities/BMPs shall
be the responsibility of the owner or private management entity.

enumerated as permanent real estate appurtenances and recorded as deed
restrictions or easements that run with the land.
   D.   The SWM site plan and Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Agreement shall
be recorded as a restrictive deed covenant that runs with the land.
   E.   The Municipality may take enforcement actions against an applicant for
failure to satisfy any provision of this Chapter.
   3.   The Municipality, upon recommendation of the Municipal Engineer, shall
make the final determination on the continuing maintenance responsibilities
prior to final approval of the SWM site plan and report. The Municipality may
require a dedication of such facilities as part of the requirements for
approval of the SWM site plan. Such a requirement is not an indication that the
Municipality will accept the facilities. The Municipality reserves the right to
accept or reject the ownership and operating responsibility for any portion of
the stormwater management controls.
   4.   If the Municipality accepts ownership of stormwater BMPs, the
Municipality may, at its discretion, require a fee from the applicant to the
Municipality to offset the future cost of inspections, operations, and
maintenance.
   5.   It shall be unlawful to alter or remove any permanent stormwater BMP
required by an approved SWM site plan, or to allow the property to remain in a
condition, which does not conform to an approved SWM site plan, unless the

Appendix 23-B - Low Impact Development Practices
Low Impact Development Practices Alternative Approaches
for Managing Stormwater Runoff
Natural hydrologic conditions may be altered radically by poorly planned
development practices, such as introducing unneeded impervious surfaces,
destroying existing drainage swales, constructing unnecessary storm sewers, and
changing local topography. A traditional drainage approach of development has
been to remove runoff from a site as quickly as possible and capture it in a
detention basin. This approach leads ultimately to the degradation of water
quality, as well as expenditure of additional resources for detaining and
managing concentrated runoff at some downstream location.
The recommended alternative approach is to promote practices that will minimize
post- development runoff rates and volumes, which will minimize needs for
artificial conveyance and storage facilities. To simulate pre-development
hydrologic conditions, forced infiltration is often necessary to offset the
loss of infiltration by creation of impervious surfaces. The ability of the
ground to infiltrate runoff depends upon the soil types and its conditions.
Preserving natural hydrologic conditions requires careful alternative site
design considerations. Site design practices include preserving natural
drainage features, minimizing impervious surface area, reducing the hydraulic
connectivity of impervious surfaces, and protecting natural depression storage.
A well-designed site will contain a mix of all those features. The following
describes various techniques to achieve the alternative approaches:
   Preserving Natural Drainage Features. Protecting natural drainage features,
particularly vegetated drainage swales and channels, is desirable because of
their ability to infiltrate and attenuate flows and to filter pollutants.
However, this objective is often not accomplished in land development. In fact,
commonly held drainage philosophy encourages just the opposite pattern–streets
and adjacent storm sewers typically are located in the natural headwater
valleys and swales, thereby replacing natural drainage functions with a
completely impervious system. As a result, runoff and pollutants generated from
impervious surfaces flow directly into storm sewers with no opportunity for
attenuation, infiltration, or filtration. Developments designed to fit site
topography also minimize the amount of grading on site.
   Protecting Natural Depression Storage Areas. Depressional storage areas have
no surface outlet, or drain very slowly following a storm event. They can be
commonly seen as ponded areas in farm fields during the wet season or after
large runoff events. Traditional development practices eliminate these
depressions by filling or draining, thereby obliterating their ability to
reduce surface runoff volumes and trap pollutants. The volume and release-rate
characteristics of depressions should be protected in the design of the
development site. The depressions can be protected by simply avoiding the
depression or by incorporating its storage as additional capacity in required
detention facilities.
   Avoiding Introduction of Impervious Areas. Careful site planning should
consider reducing impervious coverage to the maximum extent possible. Building
footprints, sidewalks, driveways, and other features producing impervious
surfaces should be evaluated to minimize impacts on runoff.
   Reducing the Hydraulic Connectivity of Impervious Surfaces. Impervious
surfaces are significantly less of a problem if they are not directly connected
to an impervious conveyance system (such as storm sewer). Two basic ways to
reduce hydraulic connectivity are: routing of roof runoff over lawns; and
reducing the use of storm sewers. Site grading should promote increasing travel
time of stormwater runoff and should help reduce concentration of runoff to a
single point in the development.
   Routing Roof Runoff Over Lawns. Roof runoff can be easily routed over lawns
in most site designs. The practice discourages direct connections of downspouts
to storm sewers or parking lots. The practice also discourages sloping
driveways and parking lots to the street. The routing of roof drains and
crowning the driveway to allow runoff to discharge to pervious areas is
desirable as the pervious area essentially acts as a filter strip.
   Reducing the Use of Storm Sewers. By reducing the use of storm sewers for
draining streets, parking lots, and backyards, the potential for accelerating
runoff from the development can be greatly reduced. The practice requires
greater use of swales and may not be practical for some development sites,
especially if there are concerns for areas that do not drain in a “reasonable”
time. The practice requires educating local citizens and public works
officials, who expect runoff to disappear shortly after a rainfall event.
   Reducing Street Widths. Street widths can be reduced by either eliminating
on- street parking or by reducing cartway widths. Municipal planners and
traffic designers should encourage narrower neighborhood streets, which
ultimately could lower maintenance and maintenance related costs.
   Limiting Sidewalks to One Side of the Street. A sidewalk on one side of the
street may suffice in low-traffic neighborhoods. The lost sidewalk could be
replaced with bicycle/recreational trails that follow back-of-lot lines. Where
appropriate, backyard trails should be constructed using pervious materials.
   Using Permeable Paving Materials. These materials include permeable
interlocking concrete paving blocks or porous bituminous concrete. Such
materials should be considered as alternatives to conventional pavement
surfaces, especially for low use surfaces such as driveways, overflow parking
lots, and emergency access roads.
   Reducing Building Setbacks. Reducing building setbacks reduces driveway and
entry walks and is most readily accomplished along low-traffic streets where
traffic noise is not a problem.
   Constructing Cluster Developments. Cluster developments can also reduce the
amount of impervious area for a given number of lots. The biggest savings is in
street length, which also will reduce costs of the development. Cluster
development “clusters” the construction activity onto less-sensitive areas
without substantially affecting the gross density of development.
In summary, careful consideration of the existing topography and implementation
of a combination of the above mentioned techniques may avoid construction of
costly stormwater control measures. Other benefits include: reduced potential
of downstream

   E.   Location, Design and Layout.
   (1)   Common open space shall be designed and located as areas easily

   (2)   The use, type of maintenance to be provided, and planting plan or

as required by the Dauphin Borough Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance
[Chapter 22]. In designating use and maintenance, the following classes may be

   (1)   In the event that the organization established to own and maintain a
common open space, or any successor organization, shall at any time after
establishment of the development fail to maintain the common open space in
reasonable order and condition, the Borough may serve written notice upon such
organization or, if no such organization exists then upon the residents and
owners of the development, setting forth the manner in which the organization
has failed to maintain the common open space in reasonable condition, and said
notice shall include a demand that such deficiencies of maintenance be cured
within 30 days thereof, and shall state the date and place of a hearing thereon
which shall be held within 14 days of the notice. At such hearing the Borough
may modify the terms of the original notice as to the deficiencies and may give
an extension of time within which they shall be corrected. If the deficiencies
set forth in the original notice or in the modifications thereof shall not be
corrected within said 30 days or any granted extension thereof, the Borough, in
order to prevent the common open space from becoming a public nuisance, may
enter upon said common open space and maintain the same for a period of 1 year.
Said entry and maintenance shall not constitute a taking of said common open
space, and shall not vest in the public any rights to use the common open space
except when the same is voluntarily dedicated to the public by the residents
and owners and such dedication is accepted by the Borough. Before the
expiration of said year, the Borough shall, upon its initiative or upon the
request of the organization theretofore responsible for the maintenance of the
common open space, call a public hearing upon notice to such organization, or
to the residents and owners of the development, to be held by the Borough, at
which hearing such organization or the residents and owners of the development
shall show cause why such maintenance by the Borough shall not, at the election
of the Borough, continue for a succeeding year. If the Borough shall determine
that such organization is ready and able to maintain said common open space in
reasonable condition, the Borough shall cease to maintain said common open
space at the end of said year. If the Borough determines that such organization
is not ready and able to maintain said open space in a reasonable condition,
the Borough may at its option, continue to maintain said common open space
during the next succeeding year and subject to a similar hearing and
determination in each year thereafter. The decision of the Borough in any case
shall constitute a final administrative decision subject to judicial review. In
the event that the Borough enters said common open space for maintenance
purposes, the homeowners association shall assume all liabilities incurred in
the performance of any such maintenance.
   (2)   The cost of such maintenance and enforcement proceedings by the
Borough shall be assessed ratably against the properties within the development
and shall become a lien on said properties. Said assessments of charges shall
be subordinate in lien to the lien of any prior mortgage or mortgages on the
property which is subject to such assessments or charges. The Borough, at the
time of entering upon said common open space for the purpose of maintenance,
shall file a notice of such lien, in the office of the Prothonotary of the
County, upon the properties affected by such lien within the development.
   G.   Coordination with Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.
   (1)   It is the intent of this subsection that subdivision review under the
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance [Chapter 22] be carried out
simultaneously with the review of a development using the density bonus
provisions authorized under Part 6 of this Chapter.
   (2)   Development plans must be submitted in a form which will satisfy the
requirements of the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance [Chapter 22] for
preliminary and final plans.
   (3)   The requirements for both this subsection of this Chapter and those of
the Dauphin Borough Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance [Chapter 22]
shall apply to all developments using the density bonus provisions.

the requirements of this Part including, but not limited to, permitting,
inspection and enforcement.

§ 27-1004.   Identification of Floodplain Areas.
   1.   Identification.
   A.   The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of Borough of
Dauphin, classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs)
dated August 2, 2012, and issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof, including all digital data
developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study.
   B.   The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and
amendments are hereby adopted by Borough of Dauphin and declared to be a part
of this Part.
   C.   The floodway or floodplain areas shall be overlays to the existing
underlying districts as shown on the Official Zoning Map of the Borough of
Dauphin, and as such, the provisions the floodway or floodplain ordinance shall
serve as a supplement to the underlying district provisions.
   D.   Where there happens to be any conflict between the provisions or
requirements of either the floodway or floodplain ordinance and those of any
underlying district, the more restrictive provisions and/or those pertaining to
the floodway or floodplain ordinance shall apply.
   2.   Description and Special Requirements of Identified Floodplain Areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
   A.   The Floodway Area/District identified as floodway in the FIS which
represents the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must
be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively
increasing the water surface elevation by more than 1 foot at any point. This
term shall also include floodway areas which have been identified in other
available studies or sources of information for those special flood hazard
areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS.
   (1)   Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall not be
permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   (2)   No new construction or development shall be allowed, unless a permit
is obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection Regional Office.
   B.   The AE Area/District without floodway shall be those areas identified
as an AE zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which
base flood elevations have been provided in the FIS but no floodway has been
delineated.
   (1)   No permit shall be granted for any construction, development, use, or
activity within any AE Area/District without floodway unless it is demonstrated
that the cumulative effect of the proposed development would not, together with
all other existing and anticipated development, increase the BFE more than 1
foot at any point.
   (2)   No new construction or development shall be located within the area
measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse, unless a
permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection Regional
Office.
   C.   The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no 1 percent annual
chance flood elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and
floodway information from other Federal, State, or other acceptable sources
shall be used when available. Where other acceptable information is not
available, the base flood elevation shall be determined by using the elevation
of a point on the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest
the construction site.
   In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional
engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the
technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the municipality.
   D.   The Shallow Flooding Area/District shall be those areas identified as
zones AO and AH on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject to
inundation by 1 percent annual chance shallow flooding where average depths are
between 1 and 3 feet. In zones AO and AH, drainage paths shall be established
to guide floodwaters around and away from structures on slopes.
   3.   Changes in Identification of Area. The identified floodplain area may
be revised or modified by the Borough Council where studies or information
provided by a qualified agency or person documents the need for such revision.
However, prior to any such change, approval must be obtained from the FEMA.
Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than 6 months after the
date such information becomes available; a community shall notify the FEMA of
the changes by submitting technical or scientific data.
   4.   Boundary Disputes. Should a dispute concerning any identified
floodplain boundary arise, an initial determination shall be made by the
Floodplain Administrator and any party aggrieved by this decision or
determination may appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board. The burden of proof shall
be on the appellant.

such action have been notified by the municipality, and until all required
permits or approvals have been first obtained from the Department of
Environmental Protection Regional Office.
   (2)   No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be made
to any watercourse unless it can be shown that the activity will not reduce or
impede the flood carrying capacity of the watercourse in any way.
   (3)   In addition, the FEMA and Pennsylvania Department of Community and
Economic Development, shall be notified prior to any alteration or relocation
of any watercourse.
   B.   Technical or scientific data shall be submitted by the applicant to
FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR) as soon as practicable but within 6

   Repetitive loss–flood related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a 10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the
time of each such flood event, on average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the
market value of the structure before the damages occurred.
   Special exception–a special approval which is required for hospitals,
nursing homes, jails, and new manufactured home parks and subdivisions and
substantial improvements to such existing parks, when such development is
located in all, or a designated portion of, a floodplain.
   Special flood hazard area (SFHA)–an area in the floodplain subject to a 1
percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on the
FIRM as zone A, AO, A130, AE, A99, or, AH.
   Start of construction–includes substantial improvement and other proposed
new development and means the date the permit was issued, provided the actual
start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days after the date of the
permit and shall be completed within 12 months after the date of issuance of
the permit unless a time extension is granted, in writing, by the Floodplain
Administrator. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds

devisees, transfer of ownership or building or lot development; provided,
however, that the subdivision by lease of land for agricultural purposes into
parcels of more than 10 acres, not involving any new street or easement of
access or any residential dwelling, shall be exempted.
   Substantial damage–damage from any cause sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal
or exceeds 50 percent or more of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
   Substantial improvement–any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, of which the cost equals or exceeds 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction”
of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred
“substantial damage” or “repetitive loss” regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a
structure to correct existing violations of State or local health, sanitary, or
safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living
conditions.
   Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would
constitute a substantial improvement as defined in this Part, must comply with
all ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific ordinance
requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of
Historic Places or the State inventory of historic places must be obtained from
the Secretary of the Interior or the State historic preservation officer. Any
exemption from ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
   Uniform Construction Code (UCC)–the Statewide building code adopted by the
Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1999 applicable to new construction in all
municipalities whether administered by the municipality, a third party or the
Department of Labor and Industry. Applicable to residential and commercial
buildings, the Code adopted the International Residential Code (IRC) and the
International Building Code (IBC), by reference, as the construction standard
applicable with the State floodplain construction. For coordination purposes,
references to the above are made specifically to various sections of the IRC
and the IBC.
   Violation–the failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR §60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)
(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until
such time as that documentation is provided.

   (a)   Ground-mounted communications ancillary equipment compounds may be
established as part of the communications antenna. The equipment and structures
within the compound shall comply with the yard area requirements of the
underlying zoning district in which the equipment compound is to be located.
Where yard areas have been established for a detached accessory use, the
equipment structures shall comply with these requirements so long as the
equipment is to be freestanding or attached to another accessory use structure.
Where no setbacks have been established for a detached accessory use, or if the
equipment structures are attached to a principal use structure, the setbacks
shall comply with the underlying zoning district for a principal use. A
communications tower is to be considered a principal use structure.
   (b)   A fence shall be required around the entire communications ancillary
equipment compound and shall be a minimum height of 8 feet. The fence shall be

intent to cease operations. If the facility remains unused for a period of 6
consecutive months, the owner or operator of the antenna and communications
ancillary equipment facilities shall, within a maximum of 90 days after the end
of the 6-month period, remove the communications antenna, its support
structure, and all accessory uses and equipment. In the case of multiple
operations sharing the use of a single communications tower, this provision
shall not become effective until all users cease operations.
   (13)   All communications antennas and supporting structures that are
located within a Borough street right-of-way are subject to the Borough's right
to annually fix a fair and reasonable compensation to be paid for use and
occupancy of the street right-of-way. Such compensation for street right-of-
way use shall be directly related to the Borough's actual management costs
including, but not limited to, the costs of the administration and performance
of all reviewing, inspecting, permitting, supervising, and other management
activities by the Borough. The owner of each communications tower; and when co-
located, each communications antenna, shall pay an annual fee to compensate the
Borough for the costs incurred in connection with the activities described
above. The annual street right-of-way management fee for communications towers
shall be determined by the Borough and authorized by resolution of the Borough
Council.
   (14)   All proposed supporting structures for a communications antennas
shall be designed in all respects to accommodate both the applicant's
communications antenna and future co-location of additional comparable antenna,
so that the co-location of a future communications antenna will not create a
violation of any applicable requirement of this Chapter.
   (15)   Stealth design methods shall be required for all communications
antennas, communications ancillary equipment and supporting structures.
Acceptable methods shall include, but not be limited to, visual screening,
concealment in existing, proposed or mock buildings, structures or facades,
blending the design of the facilities through use of materials and colors of
the existing supporting structure or to the visual character of structures or
landscape located in close proximity to the proposed facilities. Where it can
be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Zoning Officer that stealth design
is technologically or commercially impracticable or infeasible, a
communications antenna supporting structure shall be a low gloss light blue,
light green or light gray color unless other colors will blend better with the
building's façade walls and are approved by the Borough, or are otherwise
required by Federal Communications Commission or Federal Aviation
Administration regulations.
   (16)   Each person that owns or operates a communications antenna, tower,
communications ancillary equipment, or portion thereof, shall, as its sole cost
and expense, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Borough, its elected and
appointed officials, employees and agents, at all times against any and all
claims for personal injury, including death, and property damage arising in
whole or in part from, caused by or connected with any act or omission of the
person, its officers, agents, employees or contractors arising out of, but not
limited to, the construction, installation, operation, maintenance, or removal
of the communications antenna, tower or ancillary equipment, or portion
thereof. Each person that owns or operates a communications antenna, tower,
ancillary equipment, or portion thereof, shall defend any actions or
proceedings against the Borough in which is claimed that personal injury,
including death, or property damage was caused by the construction,
installation, operation, maintenance or removal of a communications antenna,
tower, ancillary equipment or portion thereof. The obligation to indemnify,
hold harmless and defend shall include, but not be limited to, the obligation
to pay judgments, injuries, liabilities, damages, reasonable attorneys' fees,
reasonable expert fees, court costs and all other costs of indemnification.
   (17)   Each person that owns or operates a communication antenna, tower,
ancillary equipment, or portion thereof, shall sign a statement of
acknowledgment of their obligation to meet the requirements of this Chapter,
including, but not necessarily limited to, the maintenance and construction of
new communications antenna, towers and ancillary equipment, and the removal of
said unused facilities, as well as the indemnification of the Borough in the
construction, installation, operation, maintenance, or removal of said
facilities, prior to the issuance of a zoning and/or building permit.

time taken by the applicant to provide any additional information to the
Borough shall not be counted toward the 90-calendar-day review period. This
review period may be extended, if agreed to in writing by both parties.
   (c)   This administrative review shall include a determination as to whether

antenna shall be measured from the actual building height, not from the height
of any existing communications antennas.
   (b)   Applicant shall submit detailed construction drawings indicating how
the communications antenna will be mounted on the supporting structure, or
portion thereof, as well as documents certifying that the communications
antenna is designed to withstand the effects of wind and structural loading
requirements of applicable technical, safety, and safety-related codes,
including, but not limited to, the Borough's Code of Ordinances, the American
National Standards Institute (ANSI) Code, as amended, the National Electrical
Safety Code, as amended, and the National Electrical Code, as amended. Where
conflict may occur between the codes, the most stringent requirement shall
apply.
   (c)   A site plan shall be submitted to show property and lease lines,
existing and proposed access drives, communications ancillary equipment

magisterial district judge. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals
the judgment, the Borough may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable
rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute
a separate violation, unless the magisterial district judge determining that
there has been a violation further determines that there was a good faith basis
for the person, partnership or corporation violating this Chapter to have
believed that there was no such violation, in which event there shall be deemed
to have been only one such violation until the fifth day following the date of
the determination of a violation by the magisterial district judge and
thereafter each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate
violation.
   2.   The court of common pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of stay,
upon cause shown, tolling the per diem judgment pending a final adjudication of
the violation and judgment.

§ 27-1507.   Preventive Remedies.
   1.   In addition to other remedies, the Borough may institute and maintain
appropriate actions by law or in equity to restrain, correct or abate
violations, to prevent unlawful construction, to recover damages and to prevent
illegal occupancy of a building, structure or premises. The description by
metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other documents used in the
process of selling or transferring shall not exempt the seller or transferor
from such penalties or from the remedies herein provided.
   2.   The Borough may refuse to issue any permit or grant any approval
necessary to further improve or develop any real property which has been
developed or which has resulted from a subdivision of real property in
violation of this Chapter. This authority to deny such a permit or approval
shall apply to any of the following applicants:
   A.   The owner of record at the time of such violation.
   B.   The vendee or lessee of the owner of record at the time of such
violation without regard as to whether such vendee or lessee had actual or
constructive knowledge of the violation.
   C.   The current owner of record who acquired the property subsequent to the
time of violation without regard as to whether such current owner had actual or
constructive knowledge of the violation.
   D.   The vendee or lessee of the current owner of record who acquired the
property subsequent to the time of violation without regard as to whether such
vendee or lessee had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
   3.   As an additional condition for issuance of a permit or the granting of
an approval to any such owner, current owner, vendee or lessee for the
development of any such real property, the Borough may require compliance with
the conditions that would have been applicable to the property at the time the
applicant acquired an interest in such real property.

§ 27-1508.   Conditional Use Regulations.
   It is the intent of this Section to provide special controls and regulations
for particular uses which may, under certain conditions, be conducted within
the various zoning districts established in Part 3 of this Chapter. Each
subsection of this Section has particular controls and/or requirements which
must be satisfied before the use by right or by conditional use is permitted.
It is the intent of this Part that these particular controls and requirements
are in addition to those imposed by the district use regulations and the
general regulations contained in Part 11 of this Chapter.
   A.   Applicability, Limitations, Compliance.
   (1)   Applicability. The controls imposed by Parts 4 through 10 are
applicable where cited specifically as a conditional use and where cited for
permitted uses.
   (2)   Limitations. Conditional uses shall be permitted only where
specifically cited in the district use regulations in Parts 4 through 10 of
this Chapter.
   (3)   Compliance. Nothing in this Section shall relieve the owner, agent,
developer, or applicant for approval of a conditional use from obtaining
subdivision and /or land development approval in accordance with the Dauphin
Borough Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance [Chapter 22].
   B.   Procedure for Conditional Use.
   (1)   Application. Each application for a conditional use shall be
accompanied by a proposed plan showing the size and location of the lot, the
location of all buildings and proposed facilities, including access drives,
parking areas, and all streets within 200 feet of the lot. The plan shall
indicate each adjacent use and land owner. Each application is subject to a
fee, as established by resolution, by the Dauphin Borough Council, and is
payable to Dauphin Borough.
   (2)   Review by Dauphin Borough Council.
   (a)   In its review the Council members shall take into consideration the
public health, safety, welfare, comfort and convenience of the public in
general, and of the residents of the immediate neighborhood in particular, and
existing landscape or viewshed. As a result, the Council may recommend
appropriate conditions and safeguards as may be required in order that the
result of its action may, to the maximum extent possible, further the expressed
intent of the Chapter and the accomplishment of the following objectives in
particular.
   (b)   All proposed structures, equipment, or materials shall be readily
accessible for fire and police protection.
   (c)   The proposed use shall be of such location, size and character that,
in general, it will be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly development
of the district in which it is proposed to be situated and will not be
detrimental to the orderly development of adjacent properties in accordance
with the zoning classification of such properties.
   (d)   In addition to the above, in the case of any use located in, or
directly adjacent to, a residential district.
   1)   The location and size of such use, the nature and intensity of
operations involved in or conducted in connection therewith, its site layout
and its relation to access streets shall be such that both pedestrian and
vehicular traffic to and from the use and the assembly of persons in connection
therewith will not be hazardous or inconvenient to, or incongruous with, said
residential district of conflict with the normal traffic or the local roadways.
   2)   The location and height of buildings, the location, nature and extent
of landscaping on the site shall be such that use will not hinder or discourage
the appropriate development and use of adjacent land and buildings.
      (3)   Council.
   (a)   Within 45 days from receipt of a completed conditional use application
and payment of the required fee, the Council shall hold a duly advertised
public hearing on the matter of the conditional use application.
   (b)   Within 30 days from the date of the final public hearing on the
conditional use application, the Council will render its decision. Written
notice of said hearing shall be conspicuously posted on the affected tract of
at least 1 week prior to the hearing.
   (c)   Each decision shall be accompanied by findings of fact and
conclusions. The conclusions shall contain a reference to the provisions relied
upon and the reasons why the conclusion is deemed appropriate.
   C.   Effect of Conditional Use. Any use for which a conditional use approved
may be granted shall be deemed to be a conforming use in the district in which
such use is located, provided that such permit shall be deemed to affect only
the lot or portion thereof for which such approval shall have been granted.

hearing, the decision shall be deemed to have been rendered in favor of the
applicant.

§ 27-1603.   Powers and Duties.
   The Zoning Hearing Board shall have the following powers and duties:
   A.   Appeals from the Zoning Officer. The Board shall hear and decide
appeals where it is alleged by the appellant that the Zoning Officer has failed
to follow prescribed procedures or has misinterpreted or misapplied any
provision of a valid ordinance or map or any valid rule or regulation governing
the action of the Zoning Officer. Nothing contained herein shall be construed
to deny to the appellant the right to proceed directly in court where
appropriate pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 1091 to 1098, relating to mandamus.
   B.   Variances. The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is
alleged that the provisions of this Chapter inflict unnecessary hardship upon
the applicant. The Board may, by rule, prescribe the form of application and
may require preliminary application to the Zoning Officer. In granting any
variance, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards as it
may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this Chapter. All requests for
variances will first be sent by the Board to the Planning Commission for an
advisory review and recommendation of the consistency of the request with the
comprehensive plan.
   C.   Special Exceptions. Where Borough Council, in this Chapter, has stated
special exceptions to be granted or denied by the Board pursuant to express
standards and criteria, the Board shall hear and decide requests for such
special exceptions in accordance with such standards and criteria. In granting
a special exception, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and
safeguards, in addition to those expressed in this Chapter, as it may deem
necessary to implement the purposes of this Chapter. All requests for special
exception will first be sent by the Board to the Planning Commission for an
advisory review and recommendation of the consistency of the request with the
comprehensive plan.
(Ord. 77-5, 2/28/1977, §1602)
§ 27-1604.   Standards for Zoning Hearing Board Action.
   In any instance where the Zoning Hearing Board is required to consider a
special exception or variance in accordance with the provisions of this
Chapter, the Board shall, among other things, consider the following standards:
   A.   For Variances.
   (1)   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including
irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property
and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions generally created
by the provisions of this Chapter in the neighborhood or district in which the
property is located.
   (2)   That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no
possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of this Chapter and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
   (3)   That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant.
   (4)   That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
   (5)   That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance
that will afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of
the regulation in issue.
   (6)   In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of
this Chapter and the comprehensive plan.
   B.   For Special Exceptions.
   (1)   Consider the suitability of the property for the use desired. Assure
itself that the proposed request is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and
intent of this Chapter and the comprehensive plan.
   (2)   Determine that the proposed special exception will not substantially
injure or detract from the use of neighboring property or from the character of
the neighborhood and that the use of property adjacent to the area included in
the proposed change or plan is adequately safeguarded.
   (3)   Determine that all yard, open space and height limitations for the
district have been met.
   (4)   The provision of off-street parking.
   (5)   The number and location of vehicular access points to the site.
   (6)   The suitability of the proposal with respect to probable effects upon
traffic in order to protect streets and highways from undue congestion.
   (7)   Pedestrian access to the site.
   (8)   The effect upon and/or availability of public facilities and utilities
such as water, sewer, police and fire protection, schools, etc.
   (9)   The provision of a planting screen and/or additional yard or open
space area to reduce the effect of the proposed use upon adjacent properties.
   (10)   Additional reasonable conditions as deemed necessary to assure
compliance with the intent of this Chapter.
   C.   For Variances and Special Exceptions within the Floodway and Flood-
Fringe Districts. In passing upon applications for variances and special
exceptions the Zoning Hearing Board shall consider all relevant factors
specified in other Sections of this Chapter and:
   (1)   The danger of life and property is due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments. The Zoning Hearing Board shall not grant a
variance for any use or development within the Floodway District if the use or
development would result in any increase in the 100-year flood elevation. [Ord.
79-3]
   (2)    The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or downstream
to the injury of others.
   (3)   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.
   (4)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owners.
   (5)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
   (6)   The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location.
   (7)   The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for
the proposed use.
   (8)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
   (9)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
flood-plain management program for the area.
   (10)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
   (11)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the floodwaters expected at the site.
   (12)   Such other factors which are relevant to the purposes of this
Chapter.
(Ord. 77-5, 2/28/1977, §1603; as amended by Ord. 79-3, 4/3/1979, §4)

Regulations.
   1.   Notice to Applicant. Whenever a variance from the provisions of Part 10
of this Chapter is granted, the Zoning Hearing Board shall notify the applicant

   A.   The granting of the variance may result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance.
   B.   Such variance may increase the risks to life and property.
   2.   Recordkeeping; Report to Federal Insurance Administration. A complete

§27-1705.   Short-Term Rental Permit Required.
   1.   Any person wishing to operate a short-term rental shall obtain a short-
term rental permit from the Borough prior to operating any short-term rental.
The short-term rental permit application form shall be established by the
Borough Council and may be amended from time to time. If the Borough Council or
its designee determines that the short-term rental permit application is
administratively complete, the Borough Council or its designee will issue a
conditional approval of the short-term rental permit application. After the
applicant receives conditional approval, the applicant must notify the Borough
that the desired unit(s) are ready for inspection. If, upon inspection, the
Borough’s Code Enforcement Officer determines that the unit(s) are in
compliance with the requirements of this Part 17, as well as the Dauphin
Borough Rental Properties Maintenance and Housing Occupancy Ordinance, a final
short-term rental permit shall be issued to the applicant.
   2.   Fees and Charges. All fees and charges for inspections of short-term
rentals shall be assessed in accordance with the fees and charges of
inspections assessed under the Dauphin Borough Rental Properties Maintenance
and Housing Occupancy Ordinance.
   3.   Short-term rental permits shall only be valid for 2 years after the
date of issuance. A permittee who wishes to continue operating a short-term
rental shall apply for a new permit on or before the expiration date of the
previous short-term rental permit. Applications for a new permit shall be
reviewed in accordance with the procedures and requirements that are applicable
at the time the person applies for a new permit. An inspection by the Borough
will be required prior to a permit renewal, to ensure compliance with the
provisions of this Part, which inspection is a condition precedent to the
issuance of a new short-term rental permit.
   4.   Notwithstanding the issuance of a short-term rental permit by the
Borough, private restrictions on the use of land/property shall remain
enforceable as provided by law, and the Borough’s issuance of a short-term
rental permit does not remove or supersede private restrictions in effect. No
person shall make application for a short-term rental permit who knows, or has
reason to know, that private restrictions prohibit the operation of a short-
term rental. Private restrictions include, but are not limited to: rental
contracts, deed restrictions, condominium master deed restrictions,
neighborhood associations’ bylaws, and covenant deeds. A short-term rental
permit issued to a person whose property is subject to private restrictions
that prohibit the operation of short-term rentals is void. The interpretation
and enforcement of the private restriction is the sole responsibility of the
private parties involved.
(Ord. 2023-02, 3/7/2023, §1)
§27-1706.   Enforcement.
   1.   The Borough of Dauphin codes enforcement officers, police officers,
community service officers, and any special officers appointed by the Borough
Council shall enforce and administer the provisions of this Part 17.
   2.   Violations and Penalties. Any owner, occupant, or other person in
charge of a short-term rental who has received notice of a violation of this
Part and fails to take the necessary corrective action, upon conviction thereof
in an action brought before a magisterial district judge in the manner provided
for the enforcement of summary offenses under the Pennsylvania Rules of
Criminal Procedure, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not less than $50 nor
more than $1,000 plus costs and, in default of payment of said fine and costs,
to a term of imprisonment not to exceed 90 days. Each day that a violation of
this Part continues or each Section of this Part which shall be found to have
been violated shall constitute a separate offense.
(Ord. 2023-02, 3/7/2023, §1)
§27-1707.   Appeals.
   If any applicant or permittee is aggrieved by the determination of the
Borough Council and/or its designee or the Code Enforcement Officer, such
aggrieved person may appeal the determination to the Dauphin Borough Council.
The appeal shall be in writing and must be received at the Borough Office no
later than 20 days from the date of determination of which such person(s) are
aggrieved. The written appeal must describe in detail the reason for the
appeal. The Borough Council may make a determination after considering the
written appeal or may notify the aggrieved person of when the matter may be
considered by Borough Council at a public meeting. Any decision of Borough
Council shall be final and binding.
