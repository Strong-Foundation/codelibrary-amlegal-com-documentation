STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION
§ 8-101. Statutory Authorization.
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage of the
Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978, delegated the responsibility
to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations to
promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its citizenry.
Therefore, the Board of Supervisors does hereby order as follows.
(Ord. 6-6-2016, 6/6/2016, § 8-101)
PART 2
GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 8-201. Intent.
The intent of this Chapter is to:
   A.   Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the Township.
   B.   Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in
order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
   C.   Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and natural
drainage.
   D.   Reduce financial burdens imposed on the Township, its governmental
units, and its residents, by preventing excessive development in areas subject
to flooding.
   E.   Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
(Ord. 6-6-2016, 6/6/2016, § 8-201)
§ 8-202. Applicability.
It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or corporation to
undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or development anywhere
within the Township unless a floodplain development compliance certificate has
been obtained from the Floodplain Administrator.
(Ord. 6-6-2016, 6/6/2016, § 8-202)
§ 8-203. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.
This Chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in effect
in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance provisions shall
remain in full force and effect to the extent that those provisions are more
restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of this
Chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
(Ord. 6-6-2016, 6/6/2016, § 8-203)
§ 8-204. Severability.
If any Section, Subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this
Chapter shall be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such a decision
shall not affect the remaining portions of this Chapter, which shall remain in
full force and effect, and for this purpose the provisions of this Chapter are
hereby declared to be severable.
(Ord. 6-6-2016, 6/6/2016, § 8-204)
§ 8-205. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
   1.   The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this Chapter
is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on accepted
engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be
increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings
restricted by debris. This Chapter does not imply that areas outside any
identified floodplain areas, or that land uses permitted within such areas will
be free from flooding or flood damages.
   2.   This Chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Township or
any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance
on this Chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 6-6-2016, 6/6/2016, § 8-205)
PART 3
ADMINISTRATION
§ 8-301. Designation of the Floodplain Administrator.

compliance certificate only after it has been determined that the proposed work
to be undertaken will be in conformance with the requirements of this Chapter,
and all other applicable codes and ordinances.

35 P.S. § 750.1); the Pennsylvania Dam Safety and Encroachments Act (Act 1978-
325, as amended, 32 P.S. §§ 693.1-693.27); the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Act
(Act 1937-394, as amended, 35 P.S. § 691.1); and the U.S. Clean Water Act,
Section 404, 33, U.S.C. 1344. No Floodplain Development Compliance Certificate
shall be issued until this determination has been made.
   5.   In the case of existing structures, prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development compliance certificate, the Floodplain Administrator
shall review the history of repairs to the existing structure, so that any
cumulative substantial damage concerns can be addressed before the floodplain
development compliance certificate is issued.
   6.   In the discharge of his/her duties, the Floodplain Administrator shall
have the authority to enter any building, structure, premises or development in
the identified floodplain area, upon presentation of proper credentials, at any

   9.   The responsibility, authority, and means to implement the commitments
of the Floodplain Administrator can be delegated from the individual
identified. However, the ultimate responsibility lies with the individual
appointed by the Township as the Floodplain Administrator.
   10.   The Floodplain Administrator shall consider the requirements of the 34
PA Code and the 2009 IBC and the 2009 IRC or the latest edition thereof adopted
by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

and/or individuals (e.g. Township Planning Commission, Township Engineer, etc.)
for review and comment.
(Ord. 6-6-2016, 6/6/2016, § 8-305)
§ 8-306. Changes.
After the issuance of a floodplain development compliance certificate by the
Floodplain Administrator, no changes of any kind shall be made to the
floodplain development permit application; floodplain development compliance
certificate; or any of the plans, specifications, or other documents submitted
with the floodplain development permit application without the written consent
or approval of the Floodplain Administrator. Requests for any such change shall
be in writing, and shall be submitted by the applicant to Floodplain
Administrator for consideration.
(Ord. 6-6-2016, 6/6/2016, § 3-306)
§ 8-307. Placards.
In addition to the floodplain development compliance certificate, the
Floodplain Administrator shall issue a placard, or similar document, which
shall be displayed at the construction and/or development project site during
the time construction is in progress. This placard shall include a brief
description of the project, the location of the project, the date of its
issuance, the floodplain development compliance certificate number, and the
signature of the Floodplain Administrator.

   1.   Work on the proposed construction and/or development shall begin within
180 days after the date of issuance of the floodplain development compliance
certificate. Work shall also be completed within 12 months after the date of
issuance of the floodplain development compliance certificate or the floodplain
development compliance certificate shall expire unless a time extension is
granted, in writing, by the floodplain administrator. A floodplain development
compliance certificate holder shall notify the Floodplain Administrator of the
date for commencement of construction and/or development at least 7 days prior
thereto. The issuance of the floodplain development compliance certificate does
not refer to any zoning approval.
   2.   The actual start of construction means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory structures, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first,
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   3.   Time extensions shall be granted only if a written request is submitted
by the applicant, who sets forth sufficient and reasonable cause for the
Floodplain Administrator to approve such a request and the original floodplain
development compliance certificate is compliant with the ordinance and FIRM/FIS
in effect at the time the extension is granted.
(Ord. 6-6-2016, 6/6/2016, § 8-308)
§ 8-309. INSPECTION AND REVOCATION.

completion of the work as are necessary.
   2.   In the event that the Floodplain Administrator discovers that the work
does not comply with the floodplain development permit application, or any
applicable laws and ordinances, or that there has been a false statement or
misrepresentation by any applicant, the Floodplain Administrator shall revoke
the floodplain development compliance certificate and report such fact to
Township for whatever action it considers necessary.
   3.   A record of all such inspections and violations of this Chapter shall
be maintained.
   4.   The requirements of 34 PA Code, Chapters 401-405 (as amended); the IBC
(Sections 109.3.3, 1612.5.1, 104.7, and 103.8, or latest revisions thereof);

(Ord. 6-6-2016, 6/6/2016, § 8-310)
§ 8-311. Enforcement.
   1.   Notices. Whenever the Floodplain Administrator or other authorized
municipal representative determines that there are reasonable grounds to
believe that there has been a violation of any provisions of this Chapter or of
any regulations adopted pursuant thereto, the Floodplain Administrator shall
give notice of such alleged violation as hereinafter provided. Such notice
shall:
      A.   Be in writing; and
      B.   Include a statement of the reasons for its issuance; and
      C.   Allow a reasonable time not to exceed a period of 30 days for the
performance of any act it requires; and
      D.   Be served upon the property owner or his agent as the case may
require; provided, however, that such notice or order shall be deemed to have
been properly served upon such owner or agent when a copy thereof has been
served with such notice by any other method authorized or required by the laws
of this Commonwealth; and
      E.   Contain an outline of remedial actions which, if taken, will effect
compliance with the provisions of this Chapter; and
      F.   The penalties/court proceedings which may be imposed should the

and upon conviction shall pay a fine to the Township, of not less than $100 nor
more than $600 plus costs of prosecution, including, but not limited to
attorney's fees, expert witness fees, filing fees, costs of service, and the
like. In default of such payment, such person shall be imprisoned in county
prison for a period not to exceed 10 days. Each day during which any violation
of this Chapter continues shall constitute a separate offense. In addition to
the above penalties all other actions are hereby reserved including an action
in equity for the proper enforcement of this Chapter. The imposition of a fine
or penalty for any violation of, or noncompliance with this Chapter shall not
excuse the violation or noncompliance or permit it to continue. All such
persons shall be required to correct or remedy such violations and
noncompliance within a reasonable time. Any development initiated or any
structure or building constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered, or
relocated, in noncompliance with this Chapter may be declared by the Board of
Supervisors to be a public nuisance and abatable as such.

PART 4
IDENTIFICATION OF FLOODPLAIN AREAS
§ 8-401. Identification.
   1.   The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of Township,
classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the flood insurance study
(FIS) and the accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) dated September
26, 2008 and June 16, 2016 and issued by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof, including all digital data
developed as part of the flood insurance study (FIS).
   2.   The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and
amendments are hereby adopted by Township and declared to be a part of this
Chapter.
(Ord. 6-6-2016, 6/6/2016, § 8-401)
§ 8-402. Description and Special Requirement of Identified Floodplain Areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
   A.   The floodway area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without increasing the water surface elevation by more than one foot at any
point. This term shall also include floodway areas which have been identified
in other available studies or sources of information for those special flood
hazard areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
      (1)   Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted
unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed
encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
Township during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      (2)   Within any floodway area, no new construction or development shall
be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the Department of
Environmental Protection Regional Office.
   B.   The AE area/district shall be those areas identified as an AE zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations
have been provided.
      (1)   The AE area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for
which base flood elevations have been provided and a floodway has been
delineated.
      (2)   AE area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE
zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided but no floodway has been determined.
         (a)   No floodplain development compliance certificate shall be
granted for any construction, development, use, or activity within any AE area/
district without floodway unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect
of the proposed development would not, together with all other existing and
anticipated development, increase the base flood elevation more than one foot
at any point.
         (b)   No new construction or development shall be located within the
area measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse, unless
the appropriate permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection Regional Office.
   C.   The A area/district shall be those areas identified as an A zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base flood
elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and floodway
information from other federal, state, or other acceptable sources shall be
used when available. Where other acceptable information is not available, the
following procedures shall be used To determine the base flood elevation:
      (1)   For all non-accessory structures (including residential,
commercial, industrial, and institutional structures), the applicant shall be
required to submit a letter of map amendment (LOMA) to FEMA to either remove
the non-accessory structure from the A zone, or obtain a base flood elevation
for a non-accessory structure that cannot be removed from the A zone.
      (2)   For all accessory structures:
         (a)   The base flood elevation may be determined by using the
elevation of a point on the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is
nearest the construction site; or
         (b)   The Township may require the applicant to determine the
elevation using hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others
of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods
used correctly reflect currently accepted technical standards. Studies,
analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow
for a thorough technical review by the Township.
         For all accessory structures and all non-accessory structures, no new
construction or development shall be located within the area measured 50 feet
landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse, unless the appropriate permit
is obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection Regional Office.
   D.   The AO and AH area/district shall be those areas identified as zones AO
and AH on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject to inundation by 1%-
annual-chance shallow flooding where average depths are between one and 3 feet.
In zones AO and AH, drainage paths shall be established to guide flood waters
around and away from structures on slopes.
(Ord. 6-6-2016, 6/6/2016, § 8-402)
§ 8-403. Changes in Identification of Area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Board of
Supervisors where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or
individual documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such
change to the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from FEMA.
Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than 6 months after the
date such information becomes available, the Township shall notify FEMA of the
changes to the special flood hazard area by submitting technical or scientific
data. See Part 5, §
8-501.B of this Chapter for situations where FEMA notification is required.
(Ord. 6-6-2016, 6/6/2016, § 8-403)
§ 8-404. Boundary Disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator in
consultation with the Township Engineer, and any party aggrieved by this
decision or determination may appeal to the Lamar Township Zoning Hearing
Board. The Lamar Township Zoning Hearing Board shall set a time and place,
within not less than 10 nor more than 45 days, for the purpose of considering
the appeal. Notice of the time and place at which the appeal will be considered
shall be given to all parties. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
(Ord. 6-6-2016, 6/6/2016, § 8-404)
§ 8-405. Jurisdictional Boundary Changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other corporate
boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the Township shall review flood
hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary changes. The Township shall
adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in areas subject to annexation or
corporate boundary changes that meet or exceed those in CFR 44 60.3.

(Ord.12/10/2001)
§ 15-409. Residential Permit Parking.
   1.   Findings and Purpose. The Township finds that:
      A.   Certain residential areas in the Township are subjected to commuter
vehicle parking, therefore, depriving the residents of those areas of spaces in
which to park their own vehicles;
      B.   Those residential streets are also subjected to a high degree of
commuter traffic which substantially reduces the quality of the ambient air
level; and,
      C.   The establishment of a parking permit program for certain affected
areas should facilitate efficient movement of traffic by providing for parking
preference during certain hours of the day and days of the week. Therefore, the
Township considers it to be in the interest of the people of the Township to
provide for the establishment of a residential permit parking program to insure
primary access to available parking spaces by neighborhood residents and also
to provide a cleaner ambient air level.
   2.   Definitions. For the purpose of this Section, words and terms listed in
this subsection, as follows, shall have the following meanings:
      COMMUTER VEHICLE - a motor vehicle parked in a residential area by a
person not a resident of that residential area;
      PROPRIETOR - a person who owns or leases real estate within a residential
area of which he is not a resident, but who owns or manages a business
enterprise or professional office maintained at that address; for the purpose
of this Section, a proprietor shall be entitled to one parking permit for that
business or professional office address;
      RESIDENT - a person who owns or leases real property within a residential
area and who maintains either a voting residence, or bona fide occupancy, or
both, at that address;
      RESIDENTIAL AREA - a contiguous area containing public highways or parts
of public highways primarily abutted by residential property or residential and
non-business property (such as schools, parks, places of worship, hospitals and
nursing homes).
   3.   Criteria. The residential areas designated in subsection (4) of this
Section are those deemed impacted and hence eligible for residential parking on
the basis of the following criteria:
      A.   During any period between the hours of 7 a.m. and 6:30 p.m., Monday
through Saturday, except legal holidays, the number of vehicles parked (or
standing), legally or illegally, on the streets in the area is equal to 70% or
more of the legal, on-street parking capacity of the area. For the purpose of
this criterion, a legal parking space shall be 20 linear feet.
      B.   During the same period as specified in subsection (A), directly
above, 10% or more of the vehicles parked (or standing) on the streets in the
area are not registered in the name of a person residing in the area. For the
purpose of this criterion, the latest available information from the Bureau of
Motor Vehicles and Licensing of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
regarding registration of motor vehicles shall be used.
Provided, in determining that a specific area identified as impacted and
eligible for residential permit parking is designated as a residential permit
parking area, the following factors are taken into consideration:
         (1)   The local and metropolitan needs with respect to clean air and
environment;
         (2)   The possibility of a reduction in total vehicle miles driven in
the Township;
         (3)   The likelihood of alleviating traffic congestion, illegal
parking and related health and safety hazards;
         (4)   The proximity of public transportation to the residential area;
         (5)   The desire and need of the residents for residential permit
parking and their willingness to bear the administrative costs in connection
with it; and,
         (6)   The need for parking in excess of the residential permit parking
program in proximity to establishments located in the residential permit
parking area and used by the general public for religious, health or
educational purposes.
   4.   Designation of Residential Permit Parking Areas.. The following are
designated as residential permit parking areas:
 
Area       Bounded By And Including
(Reserved)
 
Signs shall be erected along the streets in each residential permit parking
area, indicating the days, hours, locations and conditions under which parking
shall be by permit only.
   5.   Application for Permit. Application for a residential parking permit
shall be made to the Chief of Police by the person desiring the permit, who
shall be only the owner or the driver of a motor vehicle who resides on or is a
proprietor of property immediately adjacent to a street or other location
within a residential parking permit area. A separate application shall be
required for each motor vehicle, and each application shall be accompanied by a
permit fee, set pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Supervisors, which
shall be for the use of the Township, to be applied to the cost of
administering the residential permit parking program. Each application shall
contain the following information: the name of the owner or the driver, as the
case may be, of the motor vehicle; the address of the resident or the
proprietor, as the case may be; the make, model and registration number of the
motor vehicle; and the driver number as taken from the applicant's current
driver's license. At the discretion of the Chief of Police, the applicant shall
be required, at the time of making application, to present his driver's license
and the vehicle registration card.
   6.   Issuance of Permit. Upon receipt of the application and the permit fee,
and determination by him that the information upon the application shows that
the applicant is entitled to a residential parking permit, the Chief of Police
shall issue to the applicant a residential parking permit, which shall be valid
for the remainder of the calendar year. The permit shall display the serial and
registration numbers of the motor vehicles, the residential parking area
number, and the expiration date. The permit shall be renewable annually before
the expiration date, upon making application for renewal and payment of the
permit fee. It shall be unlawful and a violation of this Section for any person
to display other than the current and valid permit while standing or parking in
a residential permit parking area at any time when those permits are to be
displayed.
   7.   Temporary and Exemption Parking Permits. Temporary parking permits may
be issued by the Chief of Police, upon payment of a fee established pursuant to
a resolution, to bona fide visitors of residents of a designated residential
permit parking area, and exemption parking permits may be issued, without
payment of a fee, to handicapped persons.
   8.   Responsibility of Permit Holder.
      A.   Notwithstanding any provision of this Section to the contrary, the
holder of a residential parking permit shall be permitted to stand or park a
motor vehicle operated by him in any designated residential parking area
duringthose times when parking of motor vehicles is permitted in that area.
While a vehicle for which a residential parking permit has been issued is so
parked, that permit shall be displayed so as to be clearly visible through the
windshield of the vehicle. A residential parking permit shall not guarantee or
reserve to the holder a parking space within a designated residential permit
parking area.
      B.   A residential parking permit shall not authorize its holder to stand
or park a motor vehicle in any place where or at any time when stopping,
standing or parking of motor vehicles is prohibited or set aside for other
specified types of vehicles, nor shall the permit exempt its holder from the
observance of any traffic or parking regulation other than residential permit
parking regulation or restriction.
      C.   No person other than the permit holder whose name appears on the
permit shall use a residential parking permit or display it on a vehicle
operated; any such use or display by a person other than the permit holder
shall constitute a violation of this Section by the permit holder and by the
person who so used or displayed the parking permit.
      D.   It shall constitute a violation of this Section for any person
falsely to represent himself as eligible for a residential parking permit or to
furnish false information in an application to the Chief of Police in order to
obtain a residential parking permit.
         (1)   Revocation of Permits. The Chief of Police shall have authority
to revoke the residential parking permit of any permit holder found to be in
violation of any provision of this Section. Upon written notification to him of
the revocation, the permit holder shall surrender the permit to the Chief of
Police. Failure to do so, when so requested, shall constitute a violation of
this Section. Provided: any person receiving such a notice may, within 10 days
after the date of the notice, appeal to the Board of Supervisors for a hearing
on the revocation, and the decision of the Board of Supervisors shall be final.
(Ord.12/10/2001)
§ 15-410. Penalties.
Any person who violates any provision of this Part shall, upon conviction, be
sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $15 and costs. Provided: it shall be
the duty of the police officers and of parking enforcement personnel of the
Township to report to the appropriate official all violations of any provision
of this Part, indicating, in each case: the Section violated; the license
number of the vehicle involved in the violation; the location where the
violation took place; and any other facts that might be necessary in order to
secure a clear understanding of the circumstances attending the violation. The
police officer or other person making the report shall also attach to or place
upon every such vehicle a notice stating that the vehicle was parked in
violation of this Part. The notice shall contain instructions to the owner or
driver of the vehicle that if he will report to the office of the Chief of
Police and pay the sum of $              within              hours after the
time of the notice, or if he will place the sum of $            enclosed within
the envelope provided, in any of the special parking fine boxes installed at
various locations within the Township that act will save the violator from
prosecution and from payment of the fine and costs prescribed in the first
sentence of this Section.

or any other product of the sewage plant such as residues, sludges, or scums to
be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse, or to interfere with the reclamation
process. In no case shall a substance discharge to the sewer system cause the
sewage treatment plant to be in non compliance with sludge use or disposal
criteria, guidelines or regulations affecting sludge use or disposal developed
pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic
Substance Control Act or State criteria applicable to the sludge management
method being used.
      M.   Any medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by the City in
an individual wastewater discharge permit.
      N.   Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity,
either singly or by interaction with other constituents of the wastewater, to

State water quality management permit or applicable receiving water quality
standards. Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this Section
shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged
to the POTW.
   4.   Unauthorized Discharges. Discharge of any prohibited substance listed
under subsection .3 of this Section shall be considered an unauthorized
discharge and the City may take whatever steps are necessary to halt such a
discharge, as set forth in §
18-518 of this Part.
   5.   National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. If the categorical
standards for a particular industrial user are more stringent than local limits
or other requirements imposed under this Part, then the users must comply with
the categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR, Chapter I, Subchapter
N, Parts 405-471. The City shall notify in writing all affected industrial
users of the applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR § 403.12. The
national categorical pretreatment standards are hereby incorporated into the
industrial pretreatment program as Program requirements for those industrial
users subject to such categorical standards.
      A.   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the City
may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with
subsections 5.D and .4.E of this Section (See 40 CFR 403.6(c)).
      B.   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed
only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the City may convert
the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant
discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating
effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users (See 40 CFR
403.6(c)(2)).
      C.   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the City shall impose
an alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e).
      D.   The City may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment
standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to concentration limits for
purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users.
The conversion is at the discretion of the City.
      E.   Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with
the equivalent limitations developed in this Section in lieu of the promulgated
categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived (See
40 CFR 403.6(c)(7)). Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit
for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum monthly average, or 4-day average, limitations. Where such
standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be used
in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation (See 40
CFR 403.6(c) (8)).
      G.   Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating
equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based
standard shall notify the Superintendent within 2 business days after the user
has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly
change within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the
Superintendent of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or
concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of
the long term average production rate (See 40 CFR 403.6(c)(9)).
   6.   Removal Credits. Where the sewage treatment plant achieves consistent
removal of pollutants limited by categorical standards, the City may apply to
the approval authority for modifications of specific limits in the categorical
standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR § 403.7 are fulfilled and
prior approval from the approval authority is obtained. Any such action shall
be at the sole discretion of the City.
   7.   State Pretreatment Standards. State requirements and limitations on
discharge shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than national
requirements and limitations or those established under this Part.
   8.   Local Limits. The City Council shall establish, and review and amend
from time to time, local limits which control or limit the discharge or
specific pollutants by industrial users.
      A.   The City is authorized to establish local limits pursuant to 40 CFR
403.5(c).
      B.   Local limits may be established for any substance which is
discharged, or likely to be discharged, to the sewer system to protect against
pass through and interference; the discharge of toxic materials in toxic
amounts; threats to worker health and safety; and physical, chemical or
biological damage to the sewer system.
      C.   Local limits may limit concentration, mass or a combination of the
two.
      D.   Local limits shall be applied to all significant industrial users
and shall be included in all wastewater discharge permits. Local limits may be
applied to other industrial users if deemed appropriate by the City.
      E.   Discharging any pollutant in excess of a local limit established for
that pollutant shall constitute an unauthorized discharge. Such discharge is
subject to the actions and penalties set forth herein. The City has developed
technology based local limits which are specifically set forth in each
wastewater discharge permit. These local limits are incorporated herein by
reference, as if set forth at length.
   9.   The City's Right of Revision. The City reserves the right to establish,
by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits, more stringent
standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose
of this Part.
   10.   Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process wastewater,
or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete
substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge
limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard
or requirement. The City may impose mass limitations on users who are using
dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other
cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
   11.   Slug Loads and Spills. Each industrial user shall provide protection
from spills resulting in prohibited discharges and slug load discharges.
Facilities to prevent spills and slug loads shall be provided and maintained at
the owner or industrial user's own cost and expense. The City shall evaluate
whether each SIU needs an accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan or
other action to control slug discharges. The City may require any user to
develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan or take such other
action that may be necessary to control slug discharges. Alternatively, the
Superintendent may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/
slug discharge control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
      A.   SPCC Plans. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating
procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the City for review
and shall be approved by the City before construction of the facility. All
existing industrial users shall complete a spill prevention control and
countermeasures (SPCC) plan or provide evidence that such a plan is not
necessary for their facility. No industrial user who commences discharge to the
sewer system after the effective date of this Part shall be permitted to
introduce pollutants into the sewer system until this requirement has been
fulfilled. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not
relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify its facility as
necessary to meet the requirements of the industrial pretreatment program. In
the case of a spill, it is the responsibility of the industrial user to
immediately telephone and notify the City of the incident. The notification
shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume,
corrective actions being taken or planned and expected duration.
      B.   Written Notice. Within 5 days following a spill, slug load or other
accidental discharge, the industrial user shall submit to the City a detailed
written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be
taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such
notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage
or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the sewer
system, fish kill, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such
notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil penalties or other
liability which may be imposed by this Part or applicable law.
      C.   Notice to Employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the
industrial user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees
whom to call in the event of a spill or other accidental discharge. Employers
shall insure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a discharge to
occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
      D.   Description of Stored Chemicals.
      E.   Procedures to Prevent Adverse Impact from Any Accidental or Slug
Discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/ or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
      F.   SIU Immediate Notification to the City. Significant industrial users
are required to notify the City/Superintendent immediately of any changes at
its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge.
   12.   Notification Requirements; Hazardous Wastes and Hazardous Substances.
      A.   All industrial users shall notify the City, the EPA Regional Waste
Management Division Director and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if
otherwise disposed of, would be hazardous waste under 40 CFR, Part 261. Such
notification shall include the name of the hazardous waste, as set forth in 40
CFR, Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number and the type of discharge
(continuous, batch or other). If the industrial user discharges more than 100
kilograms of such waste per calendar month, the notification shall also include
the following information, to the extent that it is known and readily available
to the industrial user:
         (1)   An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
waste.
         (2)   An estimate of the mass and concentration in the wastewater of
all such constituents discharged in the most recent month.
         (3)   An estimate of the mass and concentration of such constituents
expected to be discharged during the following 12 months.
      B.   Industrial users that commence discharge after the effective date of
this Part shall submit the report within 180 days of first discharge of the
hazardous waste, except as provided in paragraph .D.
      C.   The required report need be submitted only once for each hazardous
waste discharge. Industrial users regulated under categorical standards which
have already submitted such information in baseline monitoring reports or
periodic compliance reports do not have to report this information again.
      D.   Industrial users that discharge less than 15 kilograms of hazardous
wastes in a calendar month do not have to comply with these reporting
requirements. This exemption does not apply to acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e).
      E.   An industrial user shall notify the City within 5 days of becoming
aware of any discharges of reportable quantities of listed or unlisted
hazardous substances, as defined at 40 CFR § 302.4 (CERCLA hazardous
substances). This notification shall include the time of release; the name of
the substance; the identifying CAS number, if known; and the approximate
quantity discharge. If the discharge constitutes a spill, change in wastewater
constituents or slug load, other reporting requirements of the industrial
pretreatment program may also apply.
      F.   Each notification required by this Section shall include a statement
certifying that the industrial user has a program in place to reduce the volume
and /or toxicity of the discharge wastes to the extent that it is economically
practical. This statement shall be designed by the authorized representative of
the industrial user.
   13.   Drainage of Water Filtration Systems. Discharge of filter backwash to
the sewer system shall be regulated as follows:
      A.   Granular media filter backwash water may be discharged to the sewer
system, subject to all of the applicable provisions of this Part.
      B.   Diatomaceous earth filter backwash, if discharged to the sewer
system, shall be connected to the sewer system through tanks with no less than
3 months storage capacity of spent diatomaceous earth, which tanks shall be
accessible for removing solid waste for disposal.
   14.   Trucked and Hauled Wastes.
      A.   Trucked or hauled waste may be introduced into the POTW only at
locations designated by the City, and at such times as are established by the
Superintendent. Such waste shall not violate subsections .1 through .12 of this
Part or any other requirements established by the City.
      B.   The City may require haulers of industrial waste to obtain
individual wastewater discharge permits. The City may require generators of
hauled industrial waste to obtain individual wastewater discharge permits. The
City also may prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. The discharge
of hauled industrial waste is subject to all other requirements of this Part.
      C.   Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations
designated by the City or Superintendent. No load may be discharged without
prior consent of the Superintendent. The Superintendent may collect samples of
each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable Standards. The City may
require the industrial waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load
prior to discharge.
      D.   Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for
every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the
industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and
addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. The
form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste
constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes.
   15.   Regulation of Waste Received from Other Jurisdictions.
      A.   If another municipality, or user located within another
municipality, contributes wastewater to the POTW, the City shall enter into an
inter-municipal agreement with the contributing municipality.
      B.   Prior to entering into an agreement required by paragraph .A, above,
the City shall request the following information from the contributing
municipality:

§ 18-514. Pretreatment of Wastewater.
   1.   Pretreatment Facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as
necessary to comply with this Part and shall achieve compliance with all
categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out
in §
18-513 of this Part within the time limitations specified by EPA, the State, or
the City, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance
shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed
plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to
the City for review, and shall be acceptable to the Superintendent before such
facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures
shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such
facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the City under the
provisions of this Part.
   2.   Additional Pretreatment Measures.
      A.   Whenever deemed necessary, the City may require users to restrict
their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be
discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/ or consolidate points of
discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams, and
such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the
user's compliance with the requirements of this Part.
      B.   The City may require any person discharging into the POTW to install
and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and
flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. An individual wastewater
discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
   3.   Grease and Sand Traps. Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be
provided when, in the opinion of the City, they are necessary for the proper
handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand;
except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All
interception units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the City, and
shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such
interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired, if deemed necessary by
the City, by the user at their expense.
   4.   Garbage Grinders. The use of mechanical garbage grinders producing a
finely divided mass, properly flushed with an ample amount of water, shall be
permitted, upon the condition that no such mechanical grinder used for
commercial business purposes shall be installed until permission for such use

§ 18-516. Permits and Reports for Industrial Waste Discharges.
   1.   Wastewater Analysis. When requested by the Superintendent, a user must
submit information on the nature and characteristics of its wastewater within 5
days of the request. The Superintendent is authorized to prepare a form for
this purpose and may periodically require users to update this information.
   2.   Individual Wastewater Discharge Permit Requirement. Discharge of any
industrial waste to the sewer system without a wastewater discharge permit,
except as authorized by the City in accordance with the provisions of this
Part, is an unauthorized discharge and subject to the penalties provided
herein. Each industrial user has an obligation to make reasonable efforts to
determine if it is a significant industrial user and therefore subject to the
permitting requirements of subsection .3 of this Section.
   3.   Significant Industrial User. All significant industrial users proposing
to discharge wastewater into the POTW shall first obtaining an individual
wastewater discharge permit from the City, except that a significant industrial
user that has filed a timely application pursuant to subsection .6 of this
Section may continue to discharge for the time period specified therein.
   4.   Other Industrial Users. Industrial users which are not significant
industrial users do not require a wastewater discharge permit, but are required
to comply with all other provisions of this Part. If an industrial user makes
changes to processes, flow, wastewater concentration, wastewater
characteristics or other changes which result in the industrial user meeting
the definition of significant industrial user, the industrial user shall,
immediately upon becoming aware that such a change has occurred, or 90 days
prior to such change if it is planned, notify the City and apply for a
wastewater discharge permit. The City may require other users to obtain
individual wastewater discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes
of this Part.
   5.   Permit Violations. Any violation of the terms and conditions of an
individual wastewater discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this Part
and subjects the wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in §
18-518 of this Part. Obtaining an individual wastewater discharge permit does
not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with all Federal and State
pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other requirements of
Federal, State, and local law.
   6.   Individual Wastewater Discharge Permitting Existing Connections. Any
user required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit who was

      H.   To correct typographical or other errors in the individual
wastewater discharge permit. To reflect a transfer of the facility ownership or
operation to a new owner or operator where requested in accordance with
subsection .16 of this Section.
   18.   Change in Operations. Each user must notify the City of any
significant changes to the user's operations or system including manufacturing
processes, raw materials, auxiliary processes, pretreatment processes, or other
changes which might alter the nature, quality, volume or flow rate of its
wastewater at least 30 days before the change, or if unplanned, immediately
upon making the change. The report shall include all information necessary to
determine the effect on the wastewater of the change.
      A.   The City may require the user to submit such information as may be
deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of
a wastewater discharge permit application under §
18-514.8 of this Part.

(Ord. 7-6-2010, 7/6/2010, § 3.6)
§ 18-517. Monitoring and Inspection Requirements.
   1.   Baseline Monitoring Reports.
      A.   As soon as possible following the promulgation of a categorical
standard, the wastewater discharge permit of industrial users subject to such
standards shall be revised, if necessary, to require compliance with such
categorical standards within the time frame prescribed by the categorical
standard.
      B.   Where an industrial user, subject to newly promulgated categorical
standard, has not previously submitted an application for a wastewater
discharge permit as required by §
18-515.8, the industrial user shall, within 180 days after the promulgation of
the applicable categorical standard:
         (1)   Apply for a wastewater discharge permit.
         (2)   Provide the baseline monitoring information required by 40 CFR §
403.12(b). This information may be incorporated into the application for a
wastewater discharge permit.
      C.   Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical
pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category
determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a) (4), whichever is later, existing
categorical industrial users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge
to the POTW shall submit to the City a report which contains the information
listed in paragraph .D, below. At least 90 days prior to commencement of their
discharge, new sources, and sources that become categorical industrial users
subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall
submit to the City a report which contains the information listed in paragraph
.D, below. A new source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to
use to meet applicable categorical standards. A new source also shall give
estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged.
      D.   Users described above shall submit the information set forth below:
         (1)   All information required in subsection .8 of this Section. (See
40 CFR 403.12(b) (1)).
         (2)   Measurement of Pollutants.
            (a)   The user shall provide the information required in subsection
.8.G, .N, .P and .Q of this Section.
            (b)   The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph.
            (c)   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from
pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the
regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed
with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the
flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream
formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e) to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment
standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated
in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting
data shall be submitted to the control authority.
            (d)   Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with
subsections .6 and .7 of this Section.
            (e)   The City may allow the submission of a baseline report which
utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information
sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures.
            (f)   The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place
of sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges to the POTW.
         (3)   Compliance Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's
authorized representative as defined in §
18-513.2 and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not,
whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
         (4)   Compliance Schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will
be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which
the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M must be provided.
The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance
date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance
schedule pursuant to this Section must meet the requirements set out in
subsection .2 of this Section.
   2.   Compliance Schedule Progress Reports. The following conditions shall
apply to the compliance schedule required by subsection .1.D.(4) of this Part.
      A.   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to,
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts
for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation).
      B.   No increment referred to above shall exceed 9 months.
      C.   The user shall submit a progress report to the City no later than 14
days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance
including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of
progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken
by the user to return to the established schedule.
      D.   In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress
reports to the City.
   3.   Signature and Report Certification.
      A.   Certification of Permit Applications, User Reports and Initial
Monitoring Waiver. The following certification statement is required to be
signed and submitted by users submitting permit applications in accordance with
§
18-516.7 and .8; users submitting baseline monitoring reports under subsection
.1 of this Section (See 40 CFR 403.12 (1)); users submitting reports on
compliance with the categorical pretreatment standard deadlines under
subsection .4 of this Section (See 40 CFR 403.12(d)); users submitting periodic
compliance reports required by subsection .5 of this Section (See 40 CFR 403.12
(e) and (h)). The following certification statement must be signed by an
authorized representative as defined in §
18-512.
“I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were
prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed
to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system,
or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the
information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true,
accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and
imprisonment for knowing violations.”
   4.   Categorical Compliance Report. Within 90 days following the date for
final compliance with applicable categorical standards or, in the case of a new
source, following commencement of the discharge of industrial waste from
processes regulated by categorical standards shall submit to the City a report
indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from
the regulated process which are limited by categorical standards and the
average and maximum daily flow for those process units in the industrial user's
facility which are limited by such categorical standards. The report shall
certify that the information contained therein concerning wastewater
constituents and flows is representative of discharges during normal work
cycles. The report shall also state whether the applicable categorical
standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional
operation and management practices and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring
the industrial user into compliance with the applicable categorical standards,
and including a schedule for completion of the required actions in the form
described in subsection .2 of this Section.
   5.   Periodic Compliance Reports.
      A.   All significant industrial users must, at a frequency determined by
the City but no less than twice per year (June and December) submit reports
indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which
are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and
maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment
standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution
prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the City
or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of
the user.
      B.   For significant industrial users subject to categorical standards,
if discharge limits are based on mass units per production unit, then
production information regarding the regulated processes during the reporting
period shall be included in the report, along with flow and concentration
values, so that a determination of compliance or noncompliance with categorical
standards can be made.
      C.   All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with subsection .3 of this Section.
      D.   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
      E.   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this Section
monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more
frequently than required by the City, using the procedures prescribed in
subsection .6 of this Section, the results of this monitoring shall be included
in the report. (See 40 CFR 403.12(g) (6)).
   6.   Reporting and Re-Sampling of Discharge Limit Violations.
      A.   If, upon receipt of valid sampling and testing results, a
significant industrial user becomes aware that a violation of discharge limits
has occurred, the significant industrial user shall, within 24 hours of
becoming aware of the violation, notify the City of this fact. Within 30 days
of becoming aware of the violation, the significant industrial user shall also
sample and analyze its discharge(s) for each parameter found to be in violation
and report the results of the re-sampling and analysis to the City.
      B.   Each significant industrial user shall have a duty, on receipt of
validly obtained sampling and analysis results, of inspecting the results and
determining if any wastewater discharge permit condition has been violated.
Failure to examine and compare testing results with wastewater discharge permit
conditions shall not be a valid defense for failure to comply with these
reporting conditions.
   7.   Sampling and Analysis.
      A.   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be
submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall
be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136
and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical
pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or
analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA
determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are
inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be
performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable
sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the City
or other parties approved by EPA.
      B.   Monitoring results submitted to satisfy reporting requirements must
be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed
during the period covered by the report that is representative of conditions
occurring during the reporting period.
      C.   Except as indicated in paragraph .D and .E below, the user must
collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling
techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the City. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the City, the samples must be representative of the
discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40
CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected
during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for
cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the
laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the
samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other
parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved
EPA methodologies may be authorized by the City, as appropriate. In addition,
grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
      D.   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
      E.   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports required in §
18-517.1 and .2 [40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four grab samples must
be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile
organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not
exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the
City may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by paragraphs in §
18-517 (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the industrial user is required to
collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by
with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
   8.   Monitoring Facilities.
      A.   The City may require an industrial user to provide and operate, at
the industrial user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection,
sampling and flow measurement of the wastewater or industrial waste discharge.
The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the industrial user's
premises, but the City may, when such a location would be impractical or cause
undue hardship on the industrial user, allow the facility to be constructed in
the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be
obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
      B.   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or
facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis.
The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times
in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the industrial user.
      C.   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the City's
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following
written notification by the City.
   9.   Individual Wastewater Discharge Permit Reissuance. A user with an
expiring individual wastewater discharge permit shall apply for individual
wastewater discharge permit reissuance by submitting a complete permit
application, in accordance with §
18-516.8 of this Part, a minimum of 180 days prior to the expiration of the
user's existing individual wastewater discharge permit.
   10.   Inspections. The City shall have the right to enter the premises of
any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of
this Part and any individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder. Users shall allow the City ready access to all parts of the premises
for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and
the performance of any additional duties.
      A.   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, The Superintendent or Pretreatment Coordinator
shall be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing
specific responsibilities.
      B.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
user at the written or verbal request of the Superintendent or Pretreatment
Coordinator and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall
be borne by the user.
      C.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the City access to the user's
premises shall be a violation of this Part.
   11.   Reports from Unpermitted Users. All users not required to obtain an
individual wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the
Superintendent as the City may require.
   12.   Date of Receipt of Reports. Written reports will be deemed to have
been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed,
postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal
Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
   13.   Recordkeeping.
      A.   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this Part shall
retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of
information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this
Part, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring
activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records
shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name
of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who
performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the
results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of
at least 3 years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration
of any litigation concerning the user or the City, or where the user has been
specifically notified of a longer retention period by the City.
      B.   The City shall keep and maintain all records relating to the
administration and enforcement of the industrial pretreatment program
including, but not limited to, wastewater discharge permit applications,
investigations and calculations, wastewater discharge permits, inspection
reports, industrial user reports, sampling results and enforcement activities
for a minimum of 3 years. In case of ongoing litigation, records shall be
maintained as long as they may be required.
   14.   Confidentiality.
      A.   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys,
wastewater discharge permit applications, individual wastewater discharge
permits, and monitoring programs, and from the Superintendent's inspection and
sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction,
unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the City, that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as
trade secrets under applicable State law. Any such request must be asserted at
the time of submission of the information or data.
      B.   When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that
such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which
might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available
for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon
request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or
pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person
furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other
effluent data, as defined at 40 CFR 2.302 shall not be recognized as
confidential information and shall be available to the public without
restriction.
      C.   The City shall maintain a secure place to store records containing
confidential information and shall insure that all records marked as
confidential are kept secure from casual or public scrutiny.
      D.   When information accepted by the City as confidential is transmitted
to any government agency, a notification to the industrial user shall be
provided listing the confidential information transmitted and the governmental
entity requesting it.
(Ord. 7-6-2010, 7/6/2010, § 3.7)
§ 18-518. Enforcement.
   1.   Right to Refuse. The City reserves the right to refuse to accept
wastewater, or combinations of wastewater, which are discharged in violation of
the terms or conditions of the industrial pretreatment program or any written
directions issued by the City pursuant to the conditions of the industrial
pretreatment program. The City may take such steps as it deems necessary, as
outlined in this Part, to compel discontinuance of use of the sewer system or
pretreatment of industrial wastes in order to comply with the provisions of the
industrial pretreatment program.
   2.   Individual Wastewater Discharge Permit Revocation.
      A.   The City may revoke an individual wastewater discharge permit for
good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons:
         (1)   Failure to notify the City of significant changes to the
wastewater or the operations prior to the changed discharge.
         (2)   Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant
facts in the wastewater discharge permit application.
         (3)   Falsifying self-monitoring reports and certification statements.
         (4)   Tampering with monitoring equipment.
         (5)   Refusing to allow the City timely access to the facility
premises and records.
         (6)   Failure to meet effluent limitations.
         (7)   Failure to pay fines.
         (8)   Failure to pay sewer charges.
         (9)   Failure to meet compliance schedules.
         (10)   Failure to complete a wastewater survey or the wastewater
discharge permit application.
         (11)   Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of business
ownership of a permitted facility.
         (12)   Violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement, or any
terms of the wastewater discharge permit or this Part.
      B.   Discharge of any industrial waste to the sewer system by a
significant industrial user without a wastewater discharge permit is an
unauthorized discharge, as provided in, and is subject to the penalties
provided herein.
      C.   Any industrial user notified of a revocation of its wastewater
discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the discharge. In the
event of a failure of the industrial user to comply voluntarily with the notice
of revocation, the discharge shall be considered an unauthorized discharge and
the City shall take such steps as deemed necessary, which may include immediate
severance of the connection between the building sewer and the sewage
collection system, to prevent or minimize damage to the sewer system or
endangerment to the environment or any property or person.
      D.   Individual wastewater discharge permits shall be voidable upon
cessation of operations or transfer of business ownership. All individual
wastewater discharge permits issued to a user are void upon the issuance of a
new individual wastewater discharge permit that user.
   3.   Suspension of Permit.
      A.   The City may suspend the wastewater discharge permit when such
suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the City, in order to stop an actual
or threatened discharge which presents an imminent or substantial endangerment
to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes interference or
pass through or causes the City to violate any condition of its NPDES permit or
any other national or State law, rule, regulation or permit condition.
      B.   Any industrial user notified of a suspension of its wastewater
discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the discharge. In the
event of a failure of the industrial user to comply voluntarily with the notice
of suspension, the discharge shall be considered an unauthorized discharge and
the City shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the connection between the building sewer and the sewage
collection system, to prevent or minimize damage to the sewer system or
endangerment to the environment or any property or person.
      C.   If a permit has been suspended as a result of an unauthorized
discharge, which discharge resulted in or contributed to damages to the sewer
system or to any person or property, the permit shall not be reinstated until
such time as all such damages have been satisfied.
      D.   The City shall reinstate the wastewater discharge permit upon
submission of proof by the industrial user of the elimination of the
unauthorized discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the
industrial user describing the causes of the unauthorized discharge and the
measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the City
within 15 days of the date of occurrence.
   4.   Notice of Violation. Whenever the City finds that any industrial user
has violated or is violating this Part, its wastewater discharge permit or any
prohibition, limitation or requirements contained herein, the City may serve
upon such industrial user a written notice stating the nature of the violation
and requiring a response within a specified time. Within 5 days of the receipt
of such notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall
be submitted by the user to the City. Responses required of industrial users
may include, but are not limited to, actions, plans, compliance schedules or
written explanations. Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the user of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of
violation. Nothing in this Section shall limit the authority of the
Superintendent to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
   5.   Show Cause Hearing.
      A.   Any industrial user who causes or allows an unauthorized discharge
to enter the sewer system, or who violates any condition or requirement of the
industrial pretreatment program or its wastewater discharge permit, may request
to show cause before the City Manager why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. A written notice shall be served on the industrial user
specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the City Manager
regarding the violation, the reasons why the action is to be taken, the
proposed enforcement action and directing the industrial user to show cause
before the City Manager why the proposed enforcement action should be taken.
The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or
certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 10 days before the hearing.
Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation if the industrial
user is a corporation.
      B.   The City Council may designate any of its members or any
representative to:
         (1)   Issue in the name of the City notices of hearings requesting the
attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant
to any matter involved in such hearing.
         (2)   Conduct the hearing.
         (3)   Take the evidence.
         (4)   Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including
transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations for action
thereon.
      C.   At any hearing held pursuant to this Part, testimony taken must be
under oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript, so recorded, will be
made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon
payment of the usual charges thereof.
      D.   After the City Manager has reviewed the evidence, he shall, in
writing, direct the industrial user to take certain actions to correct the
unauthorized discharge or to achieve compliance. The actions which may be
directed include, but are not limited to:
         (1)   Installation of pretreatment facilities or equipment.
         (2)   Modification or additions to existing pretreatment facilities or
equipment.
         (3)   Initiation of management practices which are required to alter
the nature of the industrial waste being discharged.
         (4)   Development or implementation of SPCC plans or other measures.
         (5)   Other measures found to be necessary to correct the unauthorized
discharge or other noncompliance.
         (6)   The direction may be in form of a schedule for compliance,
setting dates by which certain actions shall be taken.
      E.   Failure of an industrial user to comply with written directions
issued pursuant to a hearing constitutes a violation of this Part.
   6.   Administrative Orders. The City shall issue written directions as
described in subsection .5.D, above, without a show cause hearing if the City
determines that such directions are necessary to correct or remedy continuing
violations of this Part or any wastewater discharge permit or other
requirements of the industrial pretreatment program, the City or Federal or
State regulations.
   7.   Compliance Orders. When the City finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this Part, an individual wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the City may issue an order to the user responsible for the
discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time.
If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer
service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or
other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance
orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance,
including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to
minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order
may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment
standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of
liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a
compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user.
   8.   Cease and Desist Orders. When the City finds that a user has violated,
or continues to violate, any provision of this Part, an individual wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the
City shall issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such
violations and directing the user to:
      A.   Immediately comply with all requirements.
      B.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/ or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist
order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
   9.   Consent Orders. The City may enter into consent orders, assurances of
compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user
responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to
be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period
specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect
as the administrative orders issued pursuant to subsections .7 and .8 of this
Section and shall be judicially enforceable.
   10.   Right of Appeal.
      A.   An industrial user may appeal the enforcement actions enumerated
above in subsections .2, .3, .5., and .6 of this Section; or wastewater
discharge permit conditions, in whole or in part. An appeal is subject to the
following requirements:
         (1)   The appeal must be made in writing to City Council.
         (2)   The appeal must be made within 30 calendar days from the date of
receipt of the wastewater discharge permit, written directions or notice of
denial, suspension, modification or revocation of a wastewater discharge permit
being appealed by the industrial user.
         (3)   The appeal must state the specific provision(s) of a wastewater
discharge permit or the specific directions of the City which are being
contested.
         (4)   The appeal must state the reason for the appeal of each
provision.
         (5)   The appeal may suggest alternate or revised provisions to
replace those appealed.
      B.   Provisions mandated by Federal or State regulations (e.g.,
compliance with categorical standards) shall not be appealed.
      C.   The appeal shall be reviewed by the City Manager.
      D.   Within 30 days of receipt, the City Manager shall report, in
writing, to City Council the results of the review. The report shall contain,
at a minimum:
         (1)   A summary of each item appealed the appellant's reasons for
appeal and the appellant's proposed remedies, if any.
         (2)   The finding of merit for each point and the reason(s) for
finding.
         (3)   For each point found to be with merit, a proposed remedy and a
finding that the remedy is allowable under this Part and all applicable
Federal, State and local rules, regulations and laws.
      E.   City Council shall review the report and, at one or more regular or
special public meetings, take any additional testimony offered by the
appellant, reviewer, pretreatment program coordinator or other interested
party. City Council shall, within 45 days of the conclusion of testimony,
decide to:
         (1)   Grant the appeal or portions of the appeal, applying such
remedies as it deems proper.
         (2)   Deny the appeal.
Such decision of City Council constitutes final administrative action.
   11.   Publication of Users in Significant Noncompliance. The City shall
publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that provides
meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by the POTW, a list of
the users which, at any time during the previous 12 months, were in significant
noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term
significant noncompliance shall be applicable to all significant industrial
users (or any other industrial user that violates paragraphs .C and .D of this
Section) and shall mean:
      A.   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66 percent or more of all the measurements taken for the same
pollutant parameter taken during a 6-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a
numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits as
defined in § 3.2.
      B.   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant
parameter during a 6-month period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric
pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits, as defined
by § 3.2 multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils
and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH).
      C.   Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as
defined by § 3.2 (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or
narrative standard) that the Superintendent determines has caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including
endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public.
      D.   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment
to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the Superintendent's
exercise of his emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge.
      E.   Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in an individual wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or
attaining final compliance.
      F.   Failure to provide within 45 days after the due date, any required
reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with
categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports,
and reports on compliance with compliance schedules.
      G.   Failure to accurately report noncompliance.
   12.   Records. The City shall maintain records of all enforcement actions
taken, the reasons for those actions and the results of those actions. These
records shall be made available to the public during normal City business
hours.
   13.   Civil Actions. If any person violates the provisions of the industrial
pretreatment program, including local, national or State pretreatment
requirements, categorical standards or any wastewater discharge permit or
written directions issued by the City, the City may commence an action for
appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the Court of Common Pleas of
Clinton County or any other appropriate forum.
      A.   When the City finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this Part, an individual wastewater discharge permit,
or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
the City may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $1,000 and costs. Such
fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per-day basis. In the case of
monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed
for each day during the period of violation. In default of payment of said
fines and costs, user will be subject to a term of imprisonment not to exceed
30 days.
      B.   In addition to the penalties provided herein, the City may recover
reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, court reporters fees and other
expenses of litigation by appropriate suit at law against the person found to
have violated this Part or the rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder.
      C.   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the City to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount
within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the
City may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is
successful, the payment shall be returned to the user. The City may add the
costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and
orders, to the fine.
      D.   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   14.   Injunctive Relief. When the City finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this Part, an individual wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the City may petition the Clinton County Court of Common Pleas
through the City's attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent
injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance
of the individual wastewater discharge permit, or other requirement imposed by
this Part on activities of the user. The City may also seek such other action
as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement
for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive
relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against a user.
   15.   Remedies Nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this Part are not
exclusive. The City may take any, all, or any combination of these actions
against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will
generally be in accordance with the City's enforcement response plan. However,
the City may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant.
Further, the City is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against
any noncompliant user.
(Ord. 7-6-2010, 7/6/2010, § 3.8)
§ 18-519. Supplemental Enforcement Action.
   1.   Enforcement Response Plan. The City shall develop an enforcement
response plan to guide the pretreatment coordinator in the administration of
the industrial pretreatment program. The enforcement response plan shall meet
the requirements of 40 CFR § 403.8(f) (5) regarding the contents of enforcement
response plans. The pretreatment coordinator shall be guided by the enforcement
response plan when reviewing industrial user reports, inspection results and
other compliance information, and when recommending to the City enforcement
action in response to noncompliance.
   2.   Payment of Outstanding Fees and Penalties. The City may decline to
issue or reissue an individual wastewater discharge permit to any user who has
failed to pay any outstanding fees, fines or penalties incurred as a result of
any provision of this Part, a previous individual wastewater discharge permit,
or order issued hereunder.
   3.   Water Supply Severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this Part, an individual wastewater discharge permit,
or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
water service to the user may be severed. Service will recommence, at the
user's expense, only after the user has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability
to comply.
   4.   Affirmative Defenses to Discharge Violations.
      A.   Upset.
         (1)   For the purposes of this Section, upset means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
         (2)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of subparagraph (3), below, are met.
         (3)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or
other relevant evidence that:
            (a)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of
the upset.
            (b)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures.
            (c)   The user has submitted the following information to the City
within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset [if this information is provided
orally, a written submission must be provided within 5 days]:
               1)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance.
               2)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and
times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected
to continue.
               3)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
         (4)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
         (5)   Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on
any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
         (6)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
      B.   Prohibited Discharge Standards.
         (1)   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement
action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in §
18-513.1 of this Part or the specific prohibitions in §
18-513.3.A through .3.S of this Part if it can prove that it did not know, or
have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and
that either:
            (a)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the
user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass
through or interference.
            (b)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when
the City was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
      C.   Bypass.
         (1)   For the purposes of this Section:
            (a)   Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from
any portion of a user's treatment facility.
            (b)   Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
         (2)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provision of paragraphs .C(4) and .C(5) of this Section.
         (3)   Bypass Notifications.
            (a)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the City, at least 10 days before the date of the
bypass, if possible.
            (b)   A user shall submit oral notice to the City of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within 5 days of the time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The City may waive the written report on a case-by-
case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
         (4)   Bypass is prohibited, and the City may take an enforcement
action against a user for a bypass, unless:
            (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage.
            (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as
the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance.
            (c)   The user submitted notices as required under paragraph .C(3)
of this Section.
         (5)   The City may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering
its adverse effects, if the City determines that it will meet the three
conditions listed in paragraph .C(4) of this Section.

(Ord. 44-8-92, 8/10/1992, § 11)
§ 20-103. Registration.
   1.   No person shall engage in any conduct requiring a permit from the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania under the Municipal Waste Planning, Recycling and
Waste Reduction Act of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Act of July 28, 1988,
P.L. 556, No. 101, 53 P.S. § 4000.101 et seq., and the Solid Waste Management
Act of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Act of July 7, 1980, P.L. 380, No. 97,
35 P.S., § 6018.101, et seq., and the Act of July 13, 1988, P.L. 525, No. 93,
dealing with Infectious and Chemotherapeutic Waste Disposal, 35 P.S. § 6019.1
et seq.; and the Hazardous Sites Cleanup Act of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, Act of October 18, 1988, P.L. 756, No. 108, 35 P.S. § 6020.101 et
seq., and the Air Pollution Control Act of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
Act of January 8, 1960, P.L. (1959) No. 2119, as amended, 35 P.S. § 4001 et
seq., within the corporate limits of this Township without first obtaining the
requisite permit ordinance, and obtaining a registration certificate from the
Township. If, at the time this Part becomes effective, a person already has a
permit from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, then that person shall have a
period not greater than 3 months within which to obtain a registration
certificate from the Township in accordance with this Part and may operate
without registration during that period. If such person is proceeding with due
diligence to obtain a registration certificate from the Township, the Township
Supervisors may, by motion, for good cause shown, extend the time during which
the person may operate without a registration certificate.
   2.   Registration Certificates.
      A.   A registration certificate shall be applied for by any person
seeking a permit from the Commonwealth simultaneously with the filing of said
permit application with the Commonwealth by filing a true, complete and correct
copy fo the State application with the Supervisors of the Township. If a person
already holds a permit from the Commonwealth, or has already filed an
application, a true, complete and correct copy thereof shall be filed forthwith
upon the effective date of this Part.
      B.   Registration certificates shall only be obtainable by persons who
are municipalities or municipal authorities, except by the grant of a petition
for any exemption which shall be filed concurrently with the application for
registration certificate and shall include such documentation to demonstrate
such financial and other resources so as to provide economic and other
stability with respect to the waste management activity.
      C.   The Township Supervisors will evaluate the petition as well as the
application for a certificate in light of the goal to achieve continued
operational stability and financial stability of the applicant to satisfy all
obligations under this Part and the prevention of abatement of a public
nuisance that may be created by the waste activity.
   3.   All applicants for a registration certificate and all persons who hold
a registration certificate shall submit to the Township true, complete and
correct copies of all materials submitted to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
in connection with the project or facility for which a registration certificate
is sought including, but not limited to applications, supporting papers and
documents, maps, test results, statements and responses to inquiries by the
Commonwealth. Such material shall be submitted simultaneously with its
submission to the Commonwealth or, if already submitted to the Commonwealth,
promptly upon the effective date of this Part. Any information which is
designated as "confidential" and is permitted to be so designated by the
Commonwealth, shall be disclosed only to the Supervisors, engineers, Solicitor
or other professionals needing such information for purposes of enforcement of
this Part or applicable law, and shall be disclosed by them only as necessary
in the performance of their duties. Said application shall certify that no
waste activity shall be undertaken within 500 feet of any habitable building
with said distance being measured horizontally from the habitable building,
unless the current owner of the dwelling has provided a written waiver
consenting to the facility being closer than 500 feet. For facilities permitted
prior to April 9, 1988, no waste activity shall be undertaken within 300 feet
of any habitable building with said distance being measured horizontally from
the habitable building, unless the current owner of the dwelling has provided a
written waiver consenting to the facility being closer than 300 feet. A waiver
shall be knowingly made and separate from a lease or deed unless the lease or
deed contains an explicit waiver from the current owner. Waste management
activity when used herein shall encompass a permitted or proposed area to be
permitted by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. [Ord. 12/
10/2001]
   4.   Every person applying for a registration certificate from the Township
shall give public notice by advertisements one time in the Lock Haven Express,
the Clinton County Legal Journal and in such other or substitute newspapers as
the Supervisors of the Township may hereafter by motion designate, of their
application for a registration certificate and of the type of permit obtained
or being sought from the Commonwealth, the type of activity intended to be
engaged in, the location thereof, and setting forth the complete name and
address of the applicant, and also setting forth a location within the Township
where any interested citizen may examine a copy of the application, and setting
forth reasonable hours during which the same may be examined. Said notice shall
specify that if any person has any objection to the granting of a registration
certificate by the Supervisors of the Township pursuant to this Part, such
person should make known the same within 30 days from the date of said
advertisement, in writing, addressed to Lamar Township Supervisors, R. D. 1,
Box 135-Al, Mill Hall, PA 17751, or at such other address or designation as the
Township Supervisors may by motion hereafter fix. The Supervisors may accept
comments or objections received after said 30 day period. In all respects, the
applicant must comply with the provisions of Title 25, Pa. Code, Chapter 271,
§§ 271.141 - 271.144 but compliance will not be limited to only those sections
set forth above.
   5.   The Supervisors shall review the application and supporting data,
together with any comments or objections received from citizens, and may, if
they deem it appropriate in the exercise of their discretion, hold a public
hearing on the application for a registration certificate. A registration
certificate shall be issued if the applicant complies with all of the terms and
conditions of this Part and makes appropriate provision for future compliance
with the terms and provisions of this Part, including the posting of such
bonds, letters of credit or the like as may be required by the terms hereof. A
registration certificate may be issued at any time but shall not be effective
until applicant receives a permit from the Commonwealth. The Supervisors shall
act on the request for registration within 90 days of receipt of the
application and supporting data and notification by the applicant that the
Department of Environmental Protection has deemed the permit application to be
administratively complete unless they notify the applicant that additional time
is required (not to exceed an additional 3 months), explain the reasons
therefor and afford applicant an opportunity for a hearing on the question of
need for additional time. The granting of a registration certificate shall not
be deemed approval of the application for a permit from the Commonwealth. [Ord.
12/10/2001]
   6.   If the Supervisors do not grant a registration certificate, they shall
give notice of that decision to the applicant, in writing, stating the reasons
why a registration certificate has been refused and the applicant shall be
afforded an opportunity for a prompt hearing before the Supervisors at a public
meeting after which the Supervisors shall make a final decision. If a State
permit has already been granted, then a hearing shall at least be offered
within 10 days of the Supervisors' notice to the applicant that it will not
approve registration and stating the reasons therefor and, unless waived by the
applicant, the Supervisors shall make their decision within 10 days after the
hearing. If this process takes place prior to the grant of the permit by the
Commonwealth, the 10 day time limit shall not apply; instead, the hearing shall
be scheduled within 30 days and the decision shall be rendered within 30 days
after the hearing.
   7.   If a hearing is held under subsections (5) or (6) of this Section,
notice of same shall be given by regular mail or other appropriate means to any
person who made written objection to the granting of registration within the
Township under subsection (4) of this Section and those other persons who
specifically requested notice of any hearing under subsections (5) or (6) of
this Section. Notice shall be mailed at least 3 days before the hearing. Public
notice meeting the requirements of law for meetings of the Supervisors shall
also be given. These provisions apply only to notice of a hearing held under
subsections (5) or (6) of this Section. These provisions do not apply to other
public hearings that may be held.
(Ord. 44-8-92, 8/10/1992, § 111; as amended by Ord. 12/10/2001)
§ 20-104. Protection of Water Supplies.
   1.   Protection of Water Supplies.
      A.   Public Water Supply.
         (1)   The Supervisors hereby determine that the providing of safe,
potable and aesthetically acceptable drinking water to houses, buildings and
dwellings of the Township is important to the health, safety and welfare of the
residents of the Township.
         (2)   The Supervisors also determine that because of the sinkhole
problems in the Township, and the lack of complete and comprehensive records
thereof, and because of the dangers of underground limestone vaults and the
infiltration of water supplies through underground limestone vaults, and
because of the difficulties inherent in trying to trace water or water
contamination underground, and because of changes in strata and water flow that
may result from blasting in connection with limestone and other mining
operations, any applicant for a registration certificate shall certify and bear
the burden of proving by clear, precise, competent and convincing evidence that
the applicant's proposed activity will not affect any public water supply,
which, for purposes of this Part, shall be any water supply serving ten or more
households.
         (3)   If the proposed facility is to be located in any area higher in
elevation than any public water supply and if said water supply (a) is
groundwater dependent and is within 3 miles of such facility, or (b) is
surfacewater dependent and the proposed facility or part thereof (measured by
the boundaries of the area permitted or to be permitted by the Commonwealth) is
within the watershed of said public water supply, then it shall be presumed
that such facility could affect said water supply unless the applicant shall
rebut said presumption by competent proof meeting the clear, precise and
convincing standard set forth above.
         (4)   If, at any hearing under subsections (5) or (6) of §
20-103, the effect of the project on a private water supply (a private water
supply for this purpose is one which is within 2,500 feet of the boundary of
the project area to be permitted by the Commonwealth and which does not meet
the foregoing definition of a public water supply) is at issue, applicant shall
bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the
applicant's proposed activity will not adversely affect the private water
supply.
         (5)   As to private water supplies as defined in subsection (4) but
not within the 2,500 foot area required by the definition in subsection (4),
the owner or user shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the
evidence that the proposed activity will affect his or her private water
supply.
      B.   Whether under this Section or any other provision hereof, the
decision of the Supervisors on all questions of fact shall be subject to the
highest degree of finality allowed by law and the scope of review of any such
decisions shall be the narrowest scope of review which legally may be imposed.
This Section is not intended to deny any person any right of review or appeal
which is provided for by law.
      C.   If the applicant is unable to produce evidence to the Supervisors
meeting the standards set forth above, or if the applicant chooses not to
attempt to meet such requirements of proof, then the applicant can still
qualify for a registration certificate by entering into an agreement with the
Supervisors to adequately protect or replace or treat the water supply involved
at no cost to the Township or to those affected or potentially affected and by
furnishing security as follows:
         (1)   The initial amount of security to be provided shall be 150% of
the cost of performing the obligations under the agreement determined as
follows: cost estimates and projections prepared by competent professionals and
adequately explained and documented and not inherently unreasonable will be
accepted in making determinations under this subsection unless the Supervisors
obtain contrary advice from other competent professionals. In such event, the
conflicting professionals shall select an independent professional whose
decision on cost estimates and projections shall be final. Applicant shall pay
the costs incurred for such independent professional. Cost estimates shall be
calculated to project costs 5 years ahead (as if the facilities were
constructed 5 years after the time the estimates are actually prepared). The
initial security shall be posted prior to the granting of a registration
certificate, or, if applicant elects to defer posting of initial security, the
Township's grant of a registration certificate shall be conditioned upon the
posting of the security prior to commencement of construction or operation. In
such a case, applicant shall have no authority or right under said registration
certificate to construct or operate a facility until such security is in fact
posted.
         (2)   Said cost estimates shall be revised in the same manner every 3
years and additional security shall be provided if necessary to cover 150% of
the revised cost estimates. Such additional security shall be provided within
30 days of a request therefor from the Supervisors.
         (3)   Security shall be provided by:
            (a)   Cash deposits or assignments of certificates of deposit or
similar instruments equivalent to cash.
            (b)   Irrevocable or renewable letters of credit on terms and with
obligors satisfactory to the Supervisors exercising reasonable business
judgment.
            (c)   Irrevocable or renewable guarantees on terms and with
guarantors acceptable to the Supervisors exercising reasonable business
judgment.
            (d)   Surety bonds on terms satisfactory to the Supervisors and
with responsible surety or sureties satisfactory to the Supervisors exercising
reasonable business judgment. Whenever the Supervisors have reasonable doubt
about the solvency or continued solvency or a surety or reasonable doubt about
the ability of the surety to meet its obligation at all times when it might be
required to do so, the Supervisors may require a substitute surety meeting the
foregoing standards of other equivalent security.
            (e)   A combination of the foregoing acceptable to the Supervisors.
            (f)   Some other form of security acceptable to the Supervisors.
         (4)   If revisions of cost estimates are not made when required, or if
additional or substitute security is not provided when required, or if security
in whatever form is not renewed and maintained in effect at least 60 days prior
to the end of any expiring term (and evidence thereof furnished to the
Supervisors), and if applicant shall not cure said deficiency within 10 days of
notice thereof, except where notice was already given, such as with respect to
providing additional security within 30 days of request therefrom, or if
applicant shall fail to meet all of applicant's obligations under the agreement
with the Township and shall not cure said breach within 10 days of notice
thereof, the Township may forthwith declare the security forfeited and
forthwith receive or collect same on or upon the affidavit of at least two of
the Supervisors that one or more of the circumstances entitling the Township to
forfeit of the funds has occurred. Any funds thus forfeited to the Township
shall be held and used for the purposes for which the security was posted and
for all costs and expenses, including legal services and expenses, associated
with enforcement of the collection of the security, maintenance thereof, and
performance of obligations under the aforementioned agreement; provided,
however, that:
            (a)   If the reason for forfeiture is the failure to revise cost
estimates when required, or failure to post additional or substitute security,
or failure to renew or maintain security as required, then the funds shall be
held by the Township (except for expenditures to reimburse itself for costs and
expenses as aforesaid, excluding costs and expenses of providing a substitute
water supply) and if the reason for the forfeiture is cured within 9 months,
the funds, less said costs and expenses, shall be repaid to the original payor
or at the original payor's direction.
            (b)   Notwithstanding subsection (a) above, if, during the 9 month
period referred to in subsection (a) it is necessary under the terms hereof or
under the terms of the agreement with the Township that a substitute water
supply be provided, then the Township may expend said funds for that purpose.
            (c)   The Township may allow applicant to proceed to provide any
substitute water supply and if applicant does so in accordance with the terms
of this Part, the agreement above referred to, and applicable law, any
forfeited amount in excess of the Township's costs, expenses and legal fees and
expenses as aforesaid shall be returned to the provider of the security or such
provider's designee.
            (d)   If, as permitted in subsection (b), above, the Township
expends such funds to provide such substitute water supply, it shall refund to
the provider of such security any excess over the amount expended therefor and
the amount of the aforementioned costs, expenses and legal fees and expenses,
and an administrative fee of 15% of the Township's project costs and other
costs, expenses and legal fees and expenses as aforesaid.
            (e)   If the Township's project costs and other costs, expenses and
legal fees and expenses shall exceed the amount of the security, applicant
shall pay the excess to the Township within 10 days of demand therefor.
            (f)   If the defects referred to in subsection (a) above are not
cured within 9 months, the Township may also proceed to provide such substitute
water supply or allow applicant to do so, and subsections (c), (d) and (e)
above shall be applicable.
         (5)   When necessary, in lieu of forfeiture of the security or any
portion thereof, applicant may provide an immediate suitable substitute water
supply or any portion of such substitute system as needed and means of
implementation and use thereof.
         (6)   The duration of the security shall be (a) 10 years after closing
of the facility, or (b) until no leachate is produced of a quality inferior to
or lesser than the quality of the naturally occurring water prior to
construction of the project, whichever period is greater.
      D.   All public water supplies shall be available to an applicant for
background and periodic testing at reasonable times during reasonable business
hours provided applicant complies with reasonable requirements of the owner or
operator of such water supplies as to safety and accompaniment by a
representative of the owner or operator. The Township hereby requires. the
owner and operator of such water supplies to permit such testing. As to private
water supplies, if the owner refuses upon reasonable request of applicant to
permit such testing in the same manner as herein required for public water
supplies, the owner and all persons served by such water supply shall waive all
protection under this Part and no requirements of this Part shall apply to such
water supply.
      E.   Water Quality.
         (1)   With respect to any public water supply referred to in
subsection (A)(2) of this Section, it shall be presumed that any significant
and material deterioration or degradation in the quality or quantity of water
after operation of the facility commences (as compared to quantity and quality
of water during a period immediately preceding commencement of operation of the
facility) is caused by the facility. This presumption shall not preclude
appropriate proof of causation under other circumstances.
         (2)   If such deterioration or degradation causes said water to fail
to meet Federal safe drinking water standards in some respect that did not
exist prior to operation of the facility as aforesaid, then a substitute water
supply and appropriate interim remedial action shall be furnished by the
applicant forthwith upon the concurrence of such deterioration or degradation,
unless applicant notifies the Township that it believes there exists clear,
precise and convincing evidence that the deterioration or degradation in water
quality or quantity is not caused by the facility. In such a case, the Township
shall grant a prompt hearing on the issue at applicant's request and applicant
shall not be required to take interim remedial action until the Township
renders a decision after said hearing.
         (3)   If the Township determines that applicant has failed to rebut
the presumption or causation by clear, precise, competent and convincing
evidence, then temporary or interim remedial action shall be taken pending
final adjudication unless a supersedeas is obtained from a court of competent
jurisdiction. Test results from applicant's monitoring wells shall be
admissible, but not necessarily conclusive, evidence on the causation issue.
Also, if the problem is a deterioration or degradation in quantity of water,
evidence that the area experienced a severe drought shall be admissible, but
not necessarily conclusive, on the causation issue.
         (4)   If temporary or interim remedial action is required, the
temporary or interim replacement water need only meet federal safe drinking
water standards or the quality and quantity standards existing prior to
operation of the facility, whichever standard is least severe.
         (5)   Upon final adjudication of applicant's responsibility as
aforesaid, a permanent substitute water supply shall be provided as soon as
possible. The permanent substitute water supply or treatment facility shall be
such as to provide water at least equal to the quantity and quality of the
water prior to operation of the waste facility.
         (6)   If the applicant's project as submitted to and permitted by the
Department of Environmental Protection provides for monitoring wells between
the waste facility and a public water supply as herein defined, and if the test
results from said monitoring wells indicate a significant and material
degradation of water quality (or quantity if the loss of quantity is due to
operation of the facility rather than natural drought or other unrelated
cause), then applicant shall undertake prompt action to either (1) prevent said
water in its degraded state from percolating or moving further toward the water
supply (such as by pumping and treating or otherwise intercepting said water),
or (2) proceed with implementing the substitute water supply plan or treatment
plan so that the replacement or treated water will be available before the
degradation found in the monitoring wells shall reach the water supply.
[Ord. 12/10/2001]
   2.   Additional Requirements.
      A.   The applicant shall, in the materials submitted, or by separate
submission if necessary to comply herewith, furnish evidence that the proposed
activity will not create or contribute to a rodent or odor problem or mosquito
problem or other similar problems that could affect the health, safety, and
welfare of the citizens of the Township by virtue of objectionable, hazardous
or offensive odor from the project being noticeable outside the property line
of the property dedicated to the project or by virtue of the possibility of
mosquitos, rodents or other health danger originating on the property affecting
other property, persons or things outside the boundary line of the property
dedicated to the project. If such off-premises effects occur during operation
of the project, applicant shall take prompt remedial action.
      B.   The applicant shall, as part of the application and by such separate
submissions before or after registration as may be required, describe in such
detail as is reasonably practical the chemical, physical and biological
characteristics of the waste to be involved in the project and identify the
source of such waste. This information shall be supplemented from time to time
as necessary, and such information shall, if properly designated as
confidential, be-subject to the confidentiality provisions of §
20-103(3), hereof. The application shall indicate the methods of transportation
expected to be . used. The application and such subsequent submissions as may
be required shall set forth in reasonable detail the dangers that could be
presented from a motor vehicle accident involving a truck or other vehicle
carrying waste and the steps which would have to be immediately taken to
protect the welfare and safety of the citizens of the Township so that by
reference thereto the Township police and Supervisors and fire officials could
act promptly in the event of such an occurrence so as to minimize damage and
danger to residents of the Township and their property pending the time when
expert officials from the State or elsewhere could be called in to deal with
the problem. In order to cover situations where composition of the waste may
change before additional information is made available or where the Township is
unable to determine the characteristics of a particular load of waste that may
be involved in an accident, the applicant shall have available to the Township
a qualified individual 24 hours a day to deal with any such accidents or
problems, which individual shall have reasonable familiarity with all of the
substances thereof which will be handled by the project, and of emergency
procedures to be undertaken with respect to any such substance or who shall
have access to persons who have such information and expertise. The purpose of
this provision is to provide as much immediate, local, onsite expertise as
possible, with easy access to more detailed information, so as to minimize any
danger or damages resulting from an accident or spill. The applicant shall
designate a contact person or persons who can be reached for emergency
information at any time. The Supervisors shall designate a person with whom the
applicant can communicate on emergency matters at any time.
(Ord. 44-8-92, 8/10/1992, §IV; as amended by Ord. 12/10/2001)
§ 20-105. Restrictions on Use of Certain Roads.
   1.   Any applicant shall conduct the project in such a way and impose such
requirements on anyone from whom it accepts any waste as may be necessary such
that no vehicles hauling waste to or in connection with the project or empty
vehicles which had hauled waste to or in connection with the project shall pass
within 900 feet of any existing public or private school within the Township.
The Supervisors determine that this provision is necessary to protect children
because of the greater risk of a catastrophic accident if a vehicle hauling
waste were to be involved in an accident in the vicinity of a school or if
spillage or leakage from vehicles should occur in the vicinity of a school.
   2.   The route of transportation shall be specified in the application and
the Supervisors shall be notified in advance of any change in the route.
   3.   Because of the customary heavy-weight vehicles engaged in the hauling
of waste, because of the possibility of accidents, spillage or leakage, because
of the possibility of the contents damaging township roads, and because of the
greater risk of such damage coming from the frequency of use that would exist
from the location of a waste facility within the Township as distinguished from
an occasional use of a township road by general traffic, the Supervisors hereby
determine that no township road or any portion of any township road shall be
used as a way of ingress to or from any waste disposal or storage site from a
State highway, except with permission of the Supervisors, which permission
shall be granted only if there is no other reasonably practical means of access
from a State highway and then only upon the applicant making satisfactory
arrangements with the Supervisors for bearing the expense of the additional
risk and danger to the road because of the weight, content, and frequency of
travel associated with the operation of a waste facility within the Township.
Reasonable bonds, payment of wheelage or other assurances of ability to meet
maintenance and improvement obligations agreed to may be required. The Township
official designated as emergency contact person under §
20-104(2)(G) is hereby authorized to grant permission for use of township roads
during emergency situations. Permission shall be presumed for a period not to
exceed 4 hours for situations where traffic must be diverted because of an
accident or similar situation temporarily blocking the designated route. The
emergency contact person shall, however, be promptly notified by applicant as
soon as applicant becomes aware of the problem. The Township may revoke the
"presumed" permission at any time by appropriate barricades, signs or other
traffic control measures. Crossing of a township road shall also be considered
use of a road and shall require an appropriate agreement between the applicant
and the Township whereby applicant agrees to properly maintain the
intersection, including the township road portion thereof. In intersection
situations, a bond or other security shall be required only under exceptional
circumstances. If applicant shall fail to perform any road maintenance
obligation, applicant may be denied the use of the road, or the Township may
perform the work and applicant shall promptly reimburse the Township for the
costs thereof.
   4.   To ease cleanup in the event of spills or accidents, to keep down dust
or otherwise protect public safety and welfare, and to provide a good road
surface to make less likely the occurrence of tire failure or blowouts, and the
dangers of spillage or leakage associated therewith, it is hereby required that
any private road used to provide access to a waste facility from a State
highway or a Township road shall be paved or surfaced with asphalt, gravel,
cinders or other equivalent materials approved by the Pennsylvania Department
of Transportation and maintained in such manner as to at all times provide a
smooth hard surface thereon from said State highway or Township road to the
property line of the property designated for the project.
   5.   In order to protect the citizens, inhabitants and traveling public of
Lamar Township, applicant shall conduct the project in such a way and impose
contractual requirements on anyone from whom it accepts waste such that all
vehicles transporting said waste to the applicant's facility shall be covered
by or included in a policy or policies of public liability insurance kept in
force with good and reliable insurance companies authorized to do business in
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The liability limits shall be not less than
$1 million bodily injury liability per person; $1 million aggregate per
occurrence, and $1 million property damage liability. Should the material
transported or handled be hazardous waste, applicant shall require a minimum of
$5 million liability insurance coverage for personal injury and $5 million for
property damage.
   6.   It is hereby declared to be unlawful for any transporter of waste to
applicant's facility to fail to follow the designated route (except as
hereinabove provided in the case of emergencies) or to otherwise fail to comply
with the provisions and requirements of this section. Applicant shall not be
responsible for an independent transporter's violation of this Section if
applicant has fulfilled its direct obligations hereunder and has taken
reasonable steps to inform such independent transporter of the requirements of
this section. Applicant shall not accept waste from any person who has
transported such waste in violation of the provisions of this Part if applicant
knew or should have known in the exercise of reasonable business practice of
such violation, unless applicant has been furnished-evidence satisfactory to a
reasonably prudent businessman that the violation will not likely be repeated
and that any harmful effects of the violation have been corrected.
(Ord. 44-8-92, 8/10/1992, §V)
§ 20-106. Restrictions on Hours and Days.
   1.   It is hereby declared that the continuous transportation by vehicles of
waste creates an increased danger to the health, safety and welfare of the
residents of Lamar Township, their property and environment. Any applicant who
has received their registration certificate from the Township under this Part
and the proper permits under the Municipal Waste Planning, Recycling and Waste
Reduction Act and/or the Solid Waste Management Act and/or Hazardous Sites
Cleanup Act and/or Air Pollution Control Act and/or Act of July 13, 1988, P.L.
525, No. 93, dealing with infectious and chemotherapeutic waste disposal, 35
P.S. § 6019.1 et seq., upon commencing to receive solid waste or any other
types of waste at the permitted site, shall be subject to the following
restrictions on the hours and days which vehicles may deliver waste to the
facility site:
      A.   Vehicles may deliver waste to the facility only between the hours of
7 a.m. and 5 p.m. each day when delivery is permitted.
      B.   Delivery of waste to the facility shall occur only on weekdays,
Monday through Friday, and shall not be permitted on Saturdays or Sundays.
Delivery of waste to the facility shall not occur on a weekday if the weekday
is a State holiday as determined by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
   2.   Township shall be permitted to have two inspectors of the Township's
choice, present at the facility site to oversee the times when vehicles are
delivering waste and to oversee and inspect the contents of any or all vehicles
that deliver waste to the facility site and to oversee the operation of the
landfill itself. The Township inspectors shall be entitled to be present at the
facility site at all times when any activity or operations are occurring. If
the inspectors report any violations to the Township, the Township may proceed
to enforce the provisions of any applicable ordinance, statute, rule or
regulation that may apply.
(Ord. 44-8-92, 8/10/1992, §VI)
§ 20-107. Hazardous Waste. 1. Hazardous Waste.
      A.   No registration certificate shall be issued for any hazardous waste
facility or for the collection, storage, production, generation,
transportation, processing, treatment or disposal of hazardous,
chemotherapeutic or infectious waste unless the applicant shall first provide
the Supervisors certification of compliance by the applicant, and the operator
of any site involved, with this Part, any State permit, and any laws, rules and
regulations of this Township, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or any other
proper authority, and further conditioned upon the future deposit and
containment of hazardous waste in compliance with the requirements of this
Part, any State permit, and any laws, rules and regulations of this Township,
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or any other proper authority such that the
applicant shall guarantee there is no possibility that hazardous waste or any
matter derived from such hazardous waste will leak or escape from the container
and area in which such hazardous waste is disposed of and so that the applicant
shall guarantee that there is no possibility that such hazardous waste will at
any time in the future adversely affect the public health, safety, and welfare
and economic and social well-being of the citizens of the Township. If the
applicant or operator abandons the disposal facility or if the applicant or the
disposal operations and methods do not comply with the requirements of this
Part or State permit or any rule or regulation of any other proper authority,
the Supervisors immediately may proceed to enforce the provisions of any
applicable ordinance, statute, rule or regulation of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania or any regulatory agency or other proper authority.
      B.   Any hazardous waste generated, collected, stored, transported,
processed, treated or disposed of at any landfill, resource recovery facility
or any other operation or which occurs as a result of any waste management
activity within the Township shall be treated, handled and disposed of in
accord with the Department of Environmental Protection's regulations for the
handling of said hazardous waste as well as shall be treated, handled and
disposed of in accord with the provisions of the Hazardous Sites Cleanup Act of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Act of October 18, 1988, P.L. 756, No. 108,
35 P.S. § 6020.101 et seq. This provision shall be applicable regardless of the
amount of hazardous waste involved. [Ord. 12/10/2001]
   2.   The applicant for a certificate of registration dealing in any way with
hazardous waste shall also provide evidence to the Township that said applicant
has in force public liability insurance specifically covering environmental
hazards in an amount not less than $10 million or such greater amount as the
Supervisors may fix, depending upon the nature and scope of the project. Said
insurance shall be with a reputable insurance company acceptable to the
Supervisors and shall contain a noncancellation clause and shall be and remain
in effect, unless substitute insurance likewise meeting the terms hereof is
subsequently provided, for a period of at least 100 years after the deposit of
waste commences, the generation of wastes occurs or after the deposit of the
last waste deposited or generated on the site.
(Ord. 44-8-92, 8/10/1992, §VII; as amended by Ord. 12/10/2001)
§ 20-108. Consideration of Background of Applicant and Suspension, Modification
or Revocation of Registration.
   1.   If an applicant or applicants, or any operator, contractor or agent, or
any principal of any corporate applicant, operator, contractor or agent, or any
principal or a corporate principal, shall commit an environmental violation as
herein defined, the Township may suspend, modify or revoke a certificate of
registration, under the circumstances hereinafter set forth.
   2.   Definitions.
      PRINCIPAL - any person owning more than 5% of the capital stock of a
corporation, or an officer of the corporation, or a management level employee
of the corporation.
      ENVIRONMENTAL VIOLATION - any violation in connection with the project
registered or sought to be registered under this Part, the registration
certificate issued pursuant hereto, and State permit in relation to the project
or any law, rule or regulation of any proper authority relating to this
project, including any criminal or other laws as they apply to or relate to
this project. "Environmental violation" shall also mean any past or present
violation of any criminal law, which violation in any manner relates to solid
waste, waste or environmental matters, including contracts and obtaining
contracts in relation thereto, any pastor present violation of any criminal law
which is in the category of "crimen falsi" offenses, and any active or
continuing violation of any law, rule, regulation or permit of any proper
authority relating to solid waste, waste or other environmental matters
connected with or related to the collection, storage, transportation,
processing, treatment and disposal of waste.
   3.   The applicant shall notify the Township of any "environmental
violation" at the time of application or as soon as the same shall have
occurred, giving adequate detail to permit proper evaluation thereof.
Notification shall be given promptly upon assertion of any environmental
violation by any proper authority whether or not the violation has been proven
or appeals exhausted, but no adverse action shall be taken by the Township in
connection with any such violation until a final adjudication thereof.
   4.   The Township will not exercise its rights under this provision to
suspend, modify or revoke a certificate of registration with respect to any
environmental violation, the harmful effects of which have been promptly
corrected or eliminated, or (in appropriate cases where the violation is purely
technical and no harm has been done, as to which reasonable efforts have been
undertaken to prevent future violations of the same or similar type) unless the
violation or a series of violations are, in the opinion of the Supervisors
exercising reasonable executive discretion and judgment, of such a material and
substantive nature or of such long duration or cumulative impact as to manifest
an unwillingness or inability to comply with this Part, or unless such
violations are criminal in nature. If the Commonwealth or the Federal
Government shall suspend or revoke any required permit in connection with the
project, the registration hereunder shall be automatically suspended or
revoked.
(Ord. 44-8-92, 8/10/1992, §VIII)
§ 20-109. Registration Conditions and Preservation of Legal Liability.
   1.   All applicants shall be fully responsible as provided by law for all
consequences of their operations and facilities and compliance with this Part
shall not alter or diminish any such legal liability that might otherwise exist
whether to the Township or to any person or other entity.
   2.   In order to meet the terms of this Part and to ensure that the
applicant for a registration certificate will continue to observe the
requirements hereof, and in furtherance of the purposes hereof, the Supervisors
may condition the issuance of any certificate of registration upon such terms

§ 20-111. Host Municipality Benefit Fee.
   1.   Host Municipality Benefit Fee.
      A.   Imposition. There is imposed a host municipality benefit fee upon
the operator of each landfill, resource recovery facility, or facility or
operation dealing with waste as herein defined that has a currently existing
permit or receives any new permit from the Department of Environmental
Protection pursuant to the provisions of the Municipal Waste Planning,
Recycling and Waste Reduction Act of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Act of
July 28, 1988, P.L. 556, No. 101, 53 P.S. § 4000.101 et seq., and the Solid
Waste Management Act of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Act of July 7, 1980,
P.L. 380, No. 97, 35 P.S., § 6018.101 et seq., and the Act of July 13, 1988,
P.L. 525, No. 93, dealing with Infectious and Chemotherapeutic Waste Disposal,
35 P.S. § 6019.1 et seq. and the Hazardous Sites Cleanup Act of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Act of October 18, 1988, P.L. 756, No. 108, 35
P.S. § 6020.101 et seq., and the Air Pollution Control Act of the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania, Act of January 8, 1960, P.L. (1959), No. 2119, as amended, 35
P.S. § 4001 et seq. The fee shall be paid to the host municipality. If the host
municipality owns or operates the landfill or facility, the fee shall not be
imposed for waste generated within such municipality. If the landfill or
facility is located within more than one host municipality, the fee shall be
apportioned among them according to the percentage of the permitted area
located in each municipality.
      B.   Amount. The fee is $1 per ton of weighed waste or $1 per three cubic
yards of volume-measured waste for all waste received or generated at a
landfill, resource recovery facility, or facility or operation dealing with
waste as herein defined. Any amounts paid by an operator to a host municipality
pursuant to a preexisting agreement shall serve as a credit against the fee
amount imposed by this section.
      C.   Municipal Options. Nothing in this Part shall prevent a host
municipality from receiving a higher fee or receiving the fee in a different
form or at different times than provided in any of the legislative enactments
dealing with waste as has been defined within this Part, if the host
municipality and the operator of the landfill, resource recovery facility, or
facility or operation dealing with waste as herein defined agree in writing.
      D.   Supersede. The fee imposed by this section shall preempt and
supersede any tax imposed on each municipal waste landfill or resource recovery
facility under the act of December 31, 1965 (P.L. 1257, No. 511), known as the
"Local Tax Enabling Act" which is in excess of the amount imposed on or before
December 31, 1987.
      E.   County Options. Nothing in this Part shall prevent a host county
from negotiating a fee or fee in a different form, if the host county and the
operator of the landfill, resource recovery facility, or facility or operation
dealing with waste as herein defined agree in writing. Any county which has
negotiated a fee as of the effective date of this act may require that the fee
be continued.
   2.   Form and Timing of Host Municipality Benefit Fee Payment.
      A.   Quarterly Payment. Each operator shall make the host municipality
benefit fee payment quarterly. The fee shall be paid on or before April 20,
July 20, October 20 and January 20 for the 3 months ending the last day of
March, June, September and December.
      B.   Quarterly Reports. Each host municipality benefit fee payment shall
be accompanied by a form prepared, furnished and completed by the operator. The
form shall state the weight or volume of waste received or generated by the
landfill or facility or operation during the payment period and provide such
other information deemed necessary by the Township. The form shall be signed by
the operator.
      C.   Timeliness of Payment. An operator shall be deemed to have made a
timely payment of the host municipality benefit fee if all of the following are
met:
         (1)   The enclosed payment is for the full amount owed pursuant to
this Section, and no further host municipality action is required for
collection.
         (2)   The payment is accompanied by the required form and such form is
complete and accurate.
         (3)   The letter transmitting the payment that is received by the host
municipality is postmarked by the United States Postal Service on or prior to
the final day on which the payment is to be received.
      D.   Discount. Any operator that makes a timely payment of the host
municipality benefit fee as provided in this Section shall be entitled to
credit and apply against the fee payable by him a discount of 1% of the amount
of the fee collected by him.
      E.   Alternative Proof. For purposes of this Section, presentation of a
receipt indicating that the payment was mailed by registered or certified mail
on or before the due date shall be evidence of timely payment.
   3.   Collection and Enforcement of Fee.
      A.   Interest. If an operator fails to make a timely payment of the host
municipality benefit fee, the operator shall pay interest on the unpaid amount
due at the rate established pursuant to section 806 of the Act of April 9, 1929
(P.L. 343, No. 176), known as the fiscal code, from the last day for timely
payment to the date paid.
      B.   Additional Penalty. In addition to the interest provided in
subsection (A), if an operator fails to make timely payment of the host
municipality benefit fee, there shall be added to the amount of fee actually
due 5% of the amount of such fee, if the failure to file a timely payment is
not for more than 1 month, with an additional 5% for each additional month, or
fraction thereof, during which such failure continues, not exceeding 25% in the
aggregate.
      C.   Assessment Notices. If the host municipality determines that any
operator of a landfill, resource recovery facility, or facility or operation
dealing with waste as herein defined has not made a timely payment of the host
municipality benefit fee, it will send a written notice for the amount of the
deficiency to such operator within 30 days from the date of determining such
deficiency. When the operator has not provided a complete and accurate
statement of the weight or-volume of waste received or generated at the
landfill, resource recovery facility, or facility or operation dealing with
waste, as herein defined, for the payment period, the host municipality may
estimate the weight or volume in its deficiency notice.
      D.   Constructive Trust. All host municipality benefit fees collected by
an operator and held by such operator prior to payment to the host municipality
shall constitute a trust fund for the host municipality, and such trust shall
be enforceable against such operator, its representatives and any person
receiving any part of such fund without consideration or with knowledge that
the operator is committing a breach of the trust. However, any person receiving
payment of lawful obligation of the operator from such fund shall be presumed
to have received the same in good faith and without any knowledge of the breach
of trust.
      E.   Manner of Collection. The amount due and owing as the host
municipality benefit fee shall be collectable in any manner provided by law for
the collection of debts. If the person liable to pay any such amount neglects
or refuses to pay the same after demand, the amount, together with interest and
any costs that may accrue, shall be a judgment in favor of the host
municipality, upon the property of such person, but only after the same has
been entered and docketed of record by the Prothonotary of the County where
such property is situated.
      F.   Remedies Cumulative. The remedies provided to host municipalities in
this Part are in addition to any other remedies provided at law or in equity.

of the Township Supervisors adopted pursuant hereto or the term of any
registration certificate or the term of any permit issued by the Commonwealth
or any law, rule or regulation of any Federal, State or local authority in
relation to the matters covered hereby, is hereby declared to constitute a
public nuisance and any person committing such a violation shall be liable for
the costs of abatement of any pollution and any public nuisance caused by such
violation.
   5.   Any person, firm or corporation who shall violate or fail to comply
with any of the provisions of this Part, any rules or regulations adopted
hereunder or any term or condition of nay registration certificate or any
agreement or undertaking entered into with the Township in connection herewith,
upon conviction thereof in an action brought before a district justice in the

Rules of Criminal Procedure, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than
$1,000 plus costs and, in default of payment of said fine and costs, to a term
of imprisonment not to exceed 90 days. Each day that a violation of this Part
continues or each Section of this Part which shall be found to have been
violated shall constitute a separate offense. [Ord. 12110120011
   6.   This Part shall not restrict the right of the Township to take such
other action as may be allowed by law to abate nuisances, to correct same on
its own, and to recover the costs thereof, to forfeit bonds, to file municipal
claims and otherwise exercise such rights or remedies as may be otherwise
provided by law.
   7.   This Part shall not restrict the right of any person to exercise and
enjoy all rights and remedies otherwise available to such person by law

does not intend to preempt or restrict any such rights and remedies of any
person.
   8.   The Supervisors shall have the right and the applicant, by applying for
a certificate of registration, or a transporter, collector or processor, by
engaging in conduct within Township, shall be deemed to consent to the
Supervisors or their agents entering any building, property, premises, place or
vehicle, where any waste is deposited or disposed of or stored, collected or
processed for the purpose of making such investigation or inspection and taking
such samples as may be necessary to ascertain compliance or noncompliance by
any person with the provisions of this Part, any registration certificate
issued hereunder, any permit issued by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or any
law, rule or regulation of the Township, Commonwealth, United States or any
other proper authority. The Supervisors shall also have the right to inspect
vehicles hauling waste, whether loaded or empty, and to take samples thereof.
All rights hereunder shall be exercised in a reasonable manner and in
compliance with reasonable requirements of the inspected party as to matters of
safety and accompaniment by representatives of the inspected party during
inspections, but this requirement shall not require advance notice or prohibit
inspection merely because no one is available at the time to accompany an
inspector.
   9.   The remedies herein provided for the enforcement of the provisions of
this Part or any other remedy afforded by law shall not be deemed mutually
exclusive and may be employed simultaneously or consecutively at the discretion
of the Supervisors.

competent jurisdiction, such ruling shall not affect the validity of any other
section, sentence, clause or phrase hereof, all of which shall remain in full
force and effect and, for this purpose, the provisions of this Part are hereby
declared to be severable and the intention of the Supervisors is hereby
declared to be that this Part would have been enacted without such

materials and the weight of materials deposited in the facility and all of such
information shall be subject to inspection by the Township or its agents.
   14.   The Supervisors may participate to the maximum extent allowed by law
in the State permitting process and in all administrative and judicial remedies
provided for therein and nothing in this Part shall be deemed to detract in any
way from the Township's right to participate in the permitting process and in
all administrative and judicial remedies provided for with respect thereto.
   15.   No grant of a certificate of registration hereunder and no grant of a
certificate contingent upon a State permit hereunder shall be deemed to be the
consent of the Township to the issuance of a permit by the State or to prohibit
the Township from taking any position before the State that it deems advisable.
   16.   This Part and all obligations imposed hereunder or under any
registration certificate or agreement pursuant hereto shall be binding upon
applicant and his or its heirs, successors and assigns.
   17.   Nothing in this act shall be construed as estopping the Commonwealth,

courts of law or equity to abate pollution forbidden under this act, or abate
nuisances under existing law. It is hereby declared to be the purposes of this
act to provide additional and cumulative remedies to control the collection,
storage, transportation, processing, treatment, and disposal of waste within

alter rights of action or remedies now or hereafter existing in equity, or
under the common law or statutory law, criminal or civil, nor shall any
provision of this act, or the granting of any permit under this act, or any act

decisional law or in equity, from proceeding in courts of law or equity to
suppress nuisances, or to abate any pollution now or hereafter existing, or to
enforce common law or statutory rights. No courts in this Commonwealth having
jurisdiction to abate public or private nuisances shall be deprived of such
jurisdiction in any action to abate, any private or public nuisance instituted

§ 22-201. General.
   1.   The procedures set forth in this Part shall be followed for all
subdivision and/or land development plans.
   2.   The pre-application sketch plan review is optional. Its purpose is to
provide the developer with helpful advice prior to the formal proceedings.
   3.   For minor subdivisions and minor land development, however, a sketch
plan is the only required plan submittal. Information to be submitted in such
cases is specified in §
22-302 (1) and (2). (See definitions of minor subdivision and minor land
development in Part 8.)
   4.   The preliminary plan is mandatory for all non-minor subdivisions and
land development. Approval of the preliminary plan authorizes the construction
of specified public improvements and the preparation of final plans.
   5.   The final plan is mandatory for all non-minor subdivisions and land
development. Under conditions specified in §
22-304(1), the preliminary plan may be considered as the final plan. Otherwise,
the final plan will have incorporated all the changes and modifications
required by the Township. Approval of the final plan authorizes the recording
of the plan, construction of buildings and selling of land.
(Ord. 3/9/1993A, § 200)
§ 22-202. Sketch Plan.
The Planning Commission encourages the submission of a sketch plan for review
prior to the formal filing of a preliminary plan. Sketch plans are intended for
informal discussion between the subdivider and the Planning Commission and
shall not constitute formal filing of a subdivision or land development plan.
Minor subdivision and minor land development shall require a modified sketch
plan as described in §
22-302(4).

requested by the subdivider in writing and is granted before the expiration
date. The final plans shall be filed with the Clinton County Register and
Recorder before proceeding with the sale of lots or construction of buildings.
   2.   Recording of the plan shall not constitute grounds for tax reassessment
until lots are sold or improvements installed.
   3.   Recording the final plan after approval by the Township shall have the
effect of an irrevocable offer to dedicate all streets and other public ways to
public use and to dedicate or reserve all park reservations and other public

installed and inspected and determined to be in a satisfactory state of repair,
or a suitable guarantee .for installation and maintenance is provided.
      D.   The Township shall designate the Township Engineer or other
individual to approve final design and inspect the installation of
improvements.

final plan approval, the applicant shall file with the Township a financial
security as an improvement guarantee equal to 110% of the estimated cost to
install the same improvements estimated as of 90 days after the date scheduled
for completion by the developer. Such guarantee may consist of an irrevocable
letter of credit, a restricted or escrowed bank account or acceptable
performance bond. For phased development, financial security in lieu of
improvement completion need cover only the phase for which final plan approval
is sought. Such financial security shall be posted with a bonding company or
Federal or Commonwealth chartered lending institution chosen by the party
posting the financial security, provided said bonding company or lending
institution is authorized to conduct such business within the Commonwealth.
Such bond, or other security shall provide for and secure to the public, the

estimate, then the estimate shall be recalculated and rectified by a registered
professional engineer chosen mutually by the Township and the developer. The
estimate certified by the engineer shall be presumed fair and reasonable and
shall be the final estimate. In the event an engineer is so chosen, fees for
the services of said engineer shall be paid equally by the Township and the
developer.

1 year, the Township may increase the amount of financial security by up to 10%
for each 1 year period beyond the first anniversary date of the posting of the
original security or to an amount not exceeding 110% of the cost of completing
the required improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration of the
preceding 1 year period.
If a development is projected over a period of years, the Township may
authorize submission of plans by stages, which shall be subject to such
requirements or guarantees as the Commission deems essential for the protection
of any finally approved section of the development.
   3.   Release from Improvement Guarantee.
      A.   The Township may authorize the release to the developer of such
portions. of the security necessary for payment to the contractor or
contractors performing the installation of required improvements. Any request
for the release of funds shall be in writing to the Township which shall have
45 days from receipt of the request to authorize its engineer to complete
inspection of and certify, in writing, that the improvements to be covered by
the funds have been completed satisfactorily.

shall notify the Township in writing by certified or registered mail of said
completion. The Township shall, within 10 days after receipt of such notice,
authorize final inspection by its engineer of the aforesaid improvements. A
report shall be made in writing by certified mail to the developer within 30
days of the inspection authorization and shall indicate approval or rejection
of the completed improvements.
      D.   Upon approval of the completed improvements, the Township shall
release to the developer those funds remaining in the financial security
deposit including all interest accrued thereunder. Prior to release of such
funds, the developer shall guarantee in writing the structural integrity of the
improvements for a period of 1 year.

satisfactory, the aforementioned written report shall contain a statement of
reasons for rejection. The developer shall proceed to correct or complete those
improvements and upon completion shall notify the Township by those procedures
contained in this Section.
      F.   Should the Township fail to comply with the time limitations as
provided, all improvements will be deemed to have been approved and the
developer shall be released from all liability pursuant to the financial
guarantee agreement.
      G.   If financial security has been provided in lieu of completion of
improvements required as a condition for the final plan approval as set forth
in this Section, the Township shall not condition the issuance of building,
grading or other permits relating to the erection or placement of improvements,
including buildings, upon the lots or land as depicted upon the final plat upon
actual completion of the improvements depicted upon the approved final plat.

   5.   Double frontage lots shall be avoided, except where essential for
separation from collector streets or to overcome topographic disadvantages.
Where frontage along a collector occurs, a planting strip for a screen, at
least 15 feet in width, shall be provided along the back of the lot. Where lots
back on a railroad, creek or natural barrier, there may also be required a 15
foot planting screen strip. Interior lots having frontage on two streets shall
be prohibited except where unusual conditions make it desirable.
   6.   If, after subdividing, remnants of land exist, they shall be
incorporated in existing or proposed lots, or legally dedicated to public use,
if acceptable to the Township.
   7.   A parcel being subdivided for the purpose of being added to an
existing, adjacent lot of record shall not be subject to minimum lot size or
the soils testing requirements, provided that a note indicating such is placed
on the plot plan and that the existing lot and the addition shall be combined
in one deed of record. If both parcels are described separately in the same
deed, then a note shall be placed on the plan and in the deed indicating that
the two lots are to be considered as one. In this manner the purchaser is
precluded from subsequent subdivision of the acquired addition without prior
approval thereof under the terms and conditions of this Chapter.
(Ord. 3/9/1993A, § 403)
§ 22-405. Blocks.
   1.   Exceptions from strict conformity with the standards hereinbefore set
forth may be made by the Planning Commission to allow unique and imaginative
design of block layouts. Site plans presented to the Planning Commission for
review shall show the detailed design being proposed including structures,
trees and other natural features as required in this Chapter under Part 3. Such
original designs may comprise industrial, commercial or residential
development. Nothing in this Section shall relieve the subdivider from strict
conformity with the regulations unless he can show that his proposals for
original design observe the spirit of compliance, if not the exact content.
   2.   The length, width and shape of blocks shall be determined with
sensitive regard to: type of building proposed, topography and natural features
and safe and efficient vehicular and pedestrian circulation.
   3.   Blocks shall have a minimum length of 300 feet.
   4.   Where practicable, blocks along major and collector streets shall not
be less than 1,000 feet long.
   5.   In the design of blocks longer than 1,000 feet, special consideration
shall be given to the requirements of satisfactory fire protection.
   6.   Crosswalks shall be required between streets wherever necessary to
facilitate pedestrian circulation and to give access to community facilities,
such as parks or playgrounds.
(Ord.3/9/1993A,§ 404)
§ 22-406. Building Lines.
The minimum building line, measured from the required right-of-way line shall
be as stated in the Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27]. Where sub-surface disposal is indicated, the distance from the
right-of-way line to the building line shall be adequate to provide an area for
the sub-surface drainage field. For other than residential lots, the Commission
may require additional setbacks. Corner lots shall have extra width to permit
the appropriate building setback from both streets.
(Ord.3/9/1993A,§ 405)
§ 22-407. Streets.
   1.   Street Classification.
      A.   The State highway system includes all public streets and highways
operated and maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.
      B.   The Township Street System includes all public streets and roads
maintained by Lamar Township. Subdividers proposing public dedication of
streets within a subdivision shall submit road design and construction plans
which meet the minimum specifications of the Township. A deed which dedicates
to the Township the land to be used as a public street shall be recorded with
the final plan.
      C.   Private streets include all streets not dedicated, accepted and
maintained as public streets. Private streets may be permitted where the
following conditions can be met:
         (1)   A survey of the centerline of the private right-of-way shall be
shown on the plot plans along with a notation identifying the street and right-
ofway as being private.
         (2)   The subdivider shall provide a right-of-way use and maintenance
agreement in each deed, lease or conveyance prescribing a right-of-way width
and location and setting forth an arrangement between the subdivider and buyer
or lessee for improvement and maintenance of the private right-of-way.
         (3)   Where an existing private right-of-way is proposed to provide
access to a new subdivision, the subdivider shall provide a right-of-way use
and maintenance agreement signed by all property owners using the rightof-way
if such an agreement has not been previously included in the existing deeds.
This agreement shall be recorded with the final plan and prescribe a road
right-of-way width and location and set forth arrangements for and level of
maintenance of the private right-of-way.
         (4)   Private roads shall comply with dimensional requirements of
Table 2.
         (5)   An all-weather surface shall be provided with a minimal base of
6 inches of 2A compacted aggregate.
   2.   Street Definitions.
      PRIVATE - a road whose function is to provide access to no more than
three abutting properties. It is not dedicated, accepted or maintained as a
public street. It conforms to the conditions of §
22-407(1)(C) of this Chapter.
      LOCAL - a street whose sole function is to provide access to abutting
proprieties. It serves or is designed to serve no more than 25 dwelling units
and can handle approximately 200 trips per day.
      COLLECTOR - a street whose principal function is to carry traffic between
local and arterial streets but that may also provide direct access to abutting
properties. It is designed to carry 200 to 800 trips per day.
      ARTERIAL - a major street that serves as an avenue for traffic into and
out of the Township and carries high volumes of traffic.
      CUL-DE-SAC -a street that terminates in a vehicular turnaround.
   3.   Access.
      A.   Any new driveway accessing a municipal road shall conform to the
standards in §
22-407(4).
      B.   In order to protect the public safety, the Planning Commission may
restrict access onto a public street or highway to specific locations shown on
the plot plan.
      C.   Any subdivision or land development plan proposing any new public or
private streets or any new driveway(s) accessing a state highway shall contain
a notice that a highway occupancy permit must be issued by the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation (PennDOT) before construction of access onto the
state highway can be initiated. Additionally, the subdivider must submit to the
Township Planning Commission a copy of the permit issued by PennDOT prior to
subdivision approval.
      D.   Subdividers or developers proposing any new public or private
streets or any new driveway(s) accessing onto a municipal road shall obtain a
zoning permit from the Township Zoning Officer before construction of access
onto the municipal road can be initiated. Additionally, the subdivider must
submit to the Township Planning Commission a copy of the access permit prior to
subdivision approval.
   4.   Driveways.
      A.   All proposed lots or land development shall be situated in such a
fashion so that safe driveway access onto a public or private road can be
provided. Driveway access shall be defined as that portion of a property on
which a driveway could be constructed in accordance with the minimum guidelines
contained in Table 1.
      B.   In a situation where significant safety hazards exist, such as
excessive slope or areas of extremely limited sight distance, the Township may
require, prior to granting final approval, that the subdivider construct the
driveway access in strict accord with the guidelines contained in Table 1 or
that a deed restriction be placed on the lot requiring the guidelines be
complied with when a driveway is proposed for construction.
      C.   Drainage of driveways shall be designed and engineered in accordance
with provisions of the Fishing Creek Stormwater Management Plan in effect or
hereinafter adopted. Stormwater shall not discharge from any driveway on to the
access road.
      D.   All driveways shall have a maximum grade of 15%.
      E.   All driveways shall provide a stopping or leveling area which
extends 20 feet beyond the edge of the road cartway. This leveling area shall
not exceed a maximum of 5% in grade nor intersect the shoulder of roads so as
to produce a change in grade exceeding 8%. The leveling area shall intersect
the street or road at an angle of no less than 50°.
      F.   Driveways proposed in the village center (VC) zoning district shall
have a reduced dimension, if necessary, in order to be consistent with existing
driveway scale in the village area.
   5.   Street Pattern.
      A.   All subdivision plans shall extend or continue existing rights-of-
way at a width required by the adopted minimums, as specified by this Chapter.
      B.   New streets in the village center (VC) zoning districts shall be
compatible in pattern and scale to existing streets in the village.
      C.   Local streets within a new development or subdivision shall be laid
out to discourage through traffic. However, cul-de-sacs are prohibited in the
village areas (VC zoning districts) where a traditional grid layout is
appropriate.

1 Driveway widths apply to intersections with 90° angles. Where a driveway
forms less than a 90 °angle with the access street, a wider driveway width will
be required.
2 The minimum interval shall apply between an intersection and the first
driveway.
3 Minimum sight distance shall be measured from the point of intersection of
the driveway and the street cartway centerline. No significant obstructions or
plantings higher than 30 inches or tree limbs lower than 8 feet shall be
permitted within this area.
4 Single unit driveways located in the village center (VC) zoning district may
comply with reduced dimensions in order to be compatible with existing village
scale.
5 For the purposes of driveway design, the multi-unit residential design
criteria shall be used for driveways providing access to five or more dwelling
units. All other dwelling units shall meet the driveway requirements for
single-family residential use.
      D.   Local streets shall generally not provide access to more than 25
lots, shall be laid out to discourage short cuts to streets or property beyond
the subdivision and shall minimize traffic speeds using appropriate posting.
However, provision for the extension and continuation of collector streets into
and from adjoining areas shall be required.
      E.   Where a subdivision or land development abuts or contains an
existing or proposed collector street, the Planning Commission may require
marginal access streets, reverse frontage lots or such other treatment as will
provide protection for abutting properties, reduction in the number of
intersections with the arterial street and separation of local and through
traffic.
      F.   If the lots in a development are large enough for resubdivision, or
if a portion of the tract is not subdivided, suitable access and street
openings for such an eventuality shall be provided.
   6.   Street Design.
      A.   Minimum construction standards for public and private streets
serving residential, commercial, institutional and industrial development are
shown on Table III and are further detailed in the following sub-sections:
         (1)   All streets proposed for dedication to the Township shall meet
the requirements set forth in Table III, for Local or Collector streets at the
time of dedication;
         (2)   Streets shall be surfaced to the grades and dimensions shown on
plans, profiles and cross-sections submitted by the sub-divider or developer
and approved by the Township. Before finalizing street installation, the sub-
divider shall install any required utilities and provide adequate drainage
facilities for the street in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 22 of
the Lamar Township Code of Ordinances;
         (3)   The pavement sub-base, base and wearing surface shall be
constructed to the specifications contained in Table III. (see also PADOT's
Publication 70, Guidelines for the Design of Local Roads and Streets, or most
current standards.) All components of the pavement structure shall meet the
requirements specified in the most current version of PADOT's Publication, form
408;
         (4)   Where low volumes of traffic are anticipated, the Township
Supervisors may authorize the use of the alternate standards for construction
of local streets as set forth in Table III. At a minimum, all such streets
shall meet the specifications of the State's Dirt and Gravel Roads Program and
shall be reviewed and inspected by the Clinton County Conservation District
prior to consideration of acceptance by the Township;
         (5)   The sub-base shall extend six (6) inches beyond the required
cartway width on each side of the proposed street in order to provide
additional support and structural integrity for the cartway wearing surface.
The sub-base shall be composed of shale, crushed stone (two (2) A or
equivalent), or other material approved by the Township Supervisors and shall
be constructed to the depth set forth in Table III;
         (6)   Street shoulders shall be constructed to a compacted depth equal
to the depth of the base and wearing surface of the street. The finished
surface elevation of the shoulder shall meet the finished elevation of the edge
of the cartway;
         (7)   Private streets serving five (5) or more lots or dwelling units
shall be constructed in accordance with the standards for Local Streets
contained in Table III;
         (8)   All private streets being offered for dedication to the Township
shall be constructed in accordance with the standards for Local Streets
contained in Table III;
         (9)   Existing private streets proposed as access to a new subdivision
or development must be constructed with a stabilized, all-weather driving
surface in accordance with the standards of this ordinance. An independent
engineering analysis, paid for by the sub-divider or developer, may be required
by the Township to evaluate the capability of the existing road to accommodate
the project addition use generated by the proposed development; and
         (10)   Where additional development is proposed utilizing an existing
private street or right-of-way, the total number of lots or dwelling units
served by the private roadway shall be determined by the applicable
construction standards. It shall be the responsibility of the sub-divider or
developer to improve the conditions of the existing private street where such
improvement is deemed appropriate by the Township.

based on the soil types and drainage patterns of the area. In wet or poorly-
drained areas, the Township may also require a 4-inch pavement base drain.
(5)   The sub-base shall consist of shale, crushed aggregate, or other material
approved by the Township Supervisors.
(6)   Where low volumes of traffic are anticipated, the Township Supervisors
may authorize the use of these or other alternate construction standards, All
streets constructed utilizing alternate standards shall however meet the
specifications of the State's Dirt and Gravel Roads Program, and be reviewed
and inspected by the County Conservation District.
(7)   Private streets serving 1 or 2 lots or dwelling units need not be
constructed to meet specific standards. Private streets serving 5 or more lots
or dwelling units shall be constructed to the standards set forth for local
streets. All private streets being offered for dedication to the Township shall
be constructed to the standards for local streets.
      B.   Where a proposed street is to remain private, the provisions of §22-
407(l)(C) shall apply.
      C.   Minimum right-of-way and cartway widths are shown in Table 2. The
following requirements shall also be applied.
         (1)   Provision for smaller street dimensions shall be approved in the
village center (VC) zoning district and in districts directly abutting the VC
district. Right-of-way width, cartway width and minimum radius shall be reduced
in order to conform with the scale of existing village streets. If a hazard is
demonstrated to exist, width and radius may be modified to address such hazard.
         (2)   Provision for a modified street right-of-way may be required by
the Commission for public safety and convenience, or access to off-street
parking in commercial and industrial areas and in areas of high density
residential development.

requirements of the Fishing Creek watershed stormwater management plan in
effect or hereinafter adopted. If conflicts emerge between this Chapter and the
watershed stormwater management plan, the more strict provisions shall apply.
      E.   The requirements contained in this §
22-409 shall apply to all areas of Lamar Township not located in the Fishing
Creek/Cedar Run Watershed. Those areas located within the Fishing Creek/Cedar
Run Watershed shall be governed by the Fishing Creek/Cedar Run Watershed
Stormwater Management Ordinance [
Chapter 26] enacted by the Board of Supervisors of the Township of Lamar on
November 11, 1996. [Ord. 54-5-96A]
   2.   Plan Requirements.
      A.   Subdivisions and land developments adjacent to streams must comply
with §
22-413 "Stream Corridors."
      B.   The erosion and sediment pollution control plan shall be prepared by
the subdivider or a knowledgeable designee who shall consider the potential for
accelerated soil erosion resulting from development activities. Soil erosion
and sedimentation control measures shall be designed to protect existing
vegetation and minimize the area and time of soil exposure. The plan must
comply with the most recent DEP regulations and/or guidelines for soil erosion
and sedimentation control in effect. [Ord. 12/10/2001]
      C.   The stormwater management plan for the proposed subdivision shall
include a brief description of:
         (1)   Existing drainage patterns and stormwater runoff characteristics
of the site, including any drainage or stormwater problems and facilities.
Existing conditions shall be calculated for the site in its natural wooded or
meadow state.

§ 22-413. Stream Corridors and Sinkholes.
Land uses, including agricultural land uses, which occur adjacent to streams
and/or sinkholes shall require an undisturbed buffer or filter strip along the
stream or sinkhole. The requirement for a buffer applies to all streams and
watercourses which are defined as a channel or conveyance of surface water
having a defined bed and banks, whether artificial or natural, with
intermittent or perennial flow.
      A.   The purpose of the buffer is to intercept sediment and pollutants
from project runoff occurring overland before they reach the stream and/or
sinkhole, thereby protecting local water resources and the environment.
      B.   The buffer width shall be a minimum of 50 feet measured from the
stream bank or sinkhole to the area of the proposed soil disturbance. This
buffer shall apply to each side of the watercourse where soil disturbance is
proposed. If the watercourse marks the project boundary, the buffer requirement
shall apply to only one side of the stream.
      C.   Where the subdivision and land development has a slope in excess of
8%, the following buffer widths shall apply to each applicable side of the
watercourse.
 
% Slope Buffer Width
0-8%    50'
8-15%   65'
15-25%  80'
25%+    100'
 
      D.   The slopes of a site may not be averaged over the gross acreage.
Only the area within 200 feet of the watercourse shall be considered for the
purpose of slope calculation.
      E.   If the land on each side of the stream bank has different slope
characteristics (as shown by the diagram) a different buffer width would be
required on each side of the stream.

guidelines:
      A.   Storm water from roadways, parking lots, storm sewers, roof drains
or other concentrated runoff paths shall not be discharged into sinkholes.
      B.   Sinkholes shall be protected by diverting surface water away from a
sinkhole or planting and maintaining a dense filter strip of suitable
vegetative material (e.g., tall grasses) at least 30 feet in width in such
manner and location as to disperse and slow the runoff and to promote the
maximum possible filtration of both solid and dissolved impurities.
      C.   Sinkholes with a capacity sufficient to receive an appreciable
volume of storm water, as determined by the Township, must be posted in a
clearly visible manner. Such notice shall explain the sinkhole designation as
contamination prone and shall prohibit disposal of any material including but
not limited to refuse, rubbish, hazardous wastes, organic matter or soil.
      D.   If increased runoff is to be discharged near a sinkhole, even in
filtered condition, a geologic assessment of the effects of such runoff shall
be made and submitted with the stormwater management plan specified in §
22-409. Such discharge shall be prohibited if it is determined that this runoff
poses a hazard to life, property or groundwater resources or causes increased
land subsidence.
   2.   Commercial Land Development and Major Subdivisions. Those applications
proposing the use of onlot wells and/or onlot sewage disposal systems for
commercial and major subdivision purposes in areas underlain by karst
topography or carbonate bedrock units which are sinkhole-prone shall require

the use of the proposed well(s) and/or onlot sewage disposal systems.
Accompanying the map and narrative will be an analysis of the well(s) impact
upon the ground water of the region and any anticipated water quality/quantity
impacts to areas located downgradient and/or along any geologic fracture, trend
or fault. These anticipated impacts shall also consider existing and potential
land uses located within the affected area.
      D.   Should it be determined that the proposed use(s) would result in a
degradation of the groundwater at nearby properties, the study shall present
measures to be employed to mitigate these adverse impacts.
      E.   Where existing sinkholes are located, no stormwater runoff shall be
discharged into or near the sinkhole and a filter strip shall be established as
a buffer. Specifications and mapped description for such a buffer shall be
furnished by the developer.

  previously enacted its Ordinance No. 4-12-65, as amended (hereinafter the “Prior
  Ordinance”), imposing a tax at the rate of five (5) mills or one-half percent (½%) for

1    “WHEREAS, on July 2, 2008, the Pennsylvania Legislature enacted Public Law 197, Act
  No. 32 (hereinafter “Act 32”), which Act 32, inter alia, provided for the consolidated
  collection of local income taxes within a Tax Collection District established in each

  than on and after January 1, 2012; and

FISHING CREEK/CEDAR RUN WATERSHED
A. General Provisions
§ 26-101. Short Title.
This Part shall be known and may be cited as the “Lamar Township Fishing Creek/
Cedar Run Watershed Stormwater Management Ordinance.”
(Ord. 4-09-2007, 4/9/2007, § 101)
§ 26-102. Statement of Findings.
The governing body of the Municipality finds that:
      A.   Inadequate management of accelerated runoff or stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flows and velocities, contrib
utes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams
and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and
control stormwater, undermines flood plain management and flood control efforts
in downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens public
health and safety, and increases non-point source pollution of water resources.
      B.   A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff,
is fundamental to the public health, safety and welfare and the protection of
people of the Commonwealth, their resources and the environment.
      C.   Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams, which also
protects and maintains surface water quality.
      D.   Federal and State regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are required
to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer
systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).
(Ord. 4-09-2007, 4/9/2007, § 102)
§ 26-103. Purpose.
The purpose of this Part is to promote health, safety, and welfare within the
Municipality and its watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing the
benefits described in § 26- 102 of this Part, through provisions designed to:
      A.   Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa.Code Chapter 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim and restore
the existing and designated uses.
      B.   Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.
      C.   Manage stormwater runoff close to the source.
      D.   Provide the minimum procedures and performance standards for
stormwater planning and management.
      E.   Maintain groundwater recharge, to prevent degradation of surface and
groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources.
      F.   Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
      G.   Provide proper operations and maintenance of all permanent SWM BMPs
that are implemented within the Municipality.
      H.   Provide the minimum standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.

(Ord. 4-09-2007, 4/9/2007, §302; as amended by Ord. 07-05-2017, 7/5/2017)
§ 26-123. Water Quality.
Water quality control shall be implemented using the following methodologies:
      A.   The simplified method, as detailed below, is independent of site
conditions.
         (1)   Retention and detention facilities shall he sized to capture the
first 2 inches of runoff from all impervious surfaces.
         (2)   The first 1 inch of runoff shall be permanently removed and
shall not be released into the surface Waters of this Commonwealth. This is the
Permanently Removed Volume (PRV). Removal options include reuse, evaporation,
transpiration, and infiltration. A list of the site conditions and BMP's
generally suitable for infiltration is provided in Appendix 26- B.
         (3)   The subsequent 1 inch of runoff shall be detained. This is the
Extended Detention Volume (EDV).
         (4)   Infiltration of the first ½ half inch of the PRV is encouraged.
This portion of the PRV is the Groundwater Recharge Volume (GRV). A list of the
site conditions and BMP's generally suitable for infiltration is provided in
Appendix 26-B.
         (5)   The Permanently Removed Volume (PRV) requirement fur land areas
with existing cover consisting of meadow, brush, wood-grass combina tion, or
woods proposed for conversion to any other non-equivalent type of pervious
cover shall be ¼ inch of runoff.
         (6)   Retention and detention facilities should be designed to drain
both the PRV and EDV completely within 48 to 96 hours from the start of the
storm.
         (7)   Retention facilities should be designed to accommodate
infiltration of the PRV. Infiltration areas should be spread out and located in
the sections of the site that are most suitable for infiltration. A list of the
site conditions and BMPs generally suitable for infiltration is provided in
Appendix 26-B.
      B.   The Design Storm Method, as detailed below, requires technical
modeling based on site conditions.
         (1)   Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the 2-year 24-hour duration rainfall.
         (2)   Do not increase peak rate of runoff for (1 -, 2-, 10-, 25-, 100-
year storms (at minimum), pre-development to post-development; as necessary,
provide additional peak rate control for as required by Act 167 planning.
         (3)   Existing (pre-development) non-forested pervious areas must be
considered meadow or its equivalent.
         (4)   Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present, shall
he considered meadow in the model for existing conditions. Township may require
up to 100 percent of the existing area be modeled as meadow for existing
conditions for sites with known stormwater concerns.
      C.   In all cases, retention and detention facilities should be designed
to completely drain water quality volumes (in the ease of the Simplified Method
this is includes both the PRV and FDV) over a period of time not less than 4S
hours and not more than 96 hours from the start of the design storm.
The Pennsylvania Stormwater Best Management Practice Manual (1) provides
guidance on selection and application of both water quality control
methodologies.

Stormwater Management Plan:
Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment discharge
rates for the 1 -, 2-, 10-, 25-, and 100-year storms. If it is shown, that the
peak rates of discharge indicated by the post-development analysis are less
than or equal to the peak rates of discharge indicated by the pre-development
analysis for 1-, 2-, I 0-, 25-, and 100-year, 24-hour storms, then the
requirements of this section have been met. Otherwise, the applicant shall
provide additional controls as necessary to satisfy the peak rate of discharge
requirement.
   2.   Areas covered by a Release Rate Map from an approved Act 167 Stormwater
Management Plan:
For the 1-, 2-, 10-, 25-, and 100-year storms, the post-development discharge
rates will follow the release rate maps in this Part. For any areas not shown
on the release rate maps, the post-development discharge rates shall not exceed
the predevelopment discharge rates.

APPENDIX 26-A
LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES
ALTERNATIVE APPROACH FOR
MANAGING STORMWATER RUNOFF
Natural hydrologic conditions may be altered by development practices, which
may create impervious surfaces, destroy drainage swales, construct storm
sewers, and change local topography. A traditional approach to drainage has
been to remove runoff from sites as quickly as possible and capture it in
downstream detention basins. This approach leads to the degradation of water
quality as well as additional expenditures for detaining and managing
concentrated runoff.
The recommended approach is to promote practices that will minimize post-
development runoff rates and volumes and minimize needs for artificial
conveyance and storage facilities. To simulate pre-development hydrologic
conditions, increased infiltration often is helpful to offset the effects of
increasing the area of impervious surfaces. The ability to increase
infiltration depends upon the soil types and land use.
Preserving natural hydrologic conditions requires careful site design that
includes preservation of natural drainage features, minimization of impervious
surfaces, reduction of hydraulic connectivity of impervious surfaces, and
protection of natural depression storage areas. A well-designed site will
contain a mix of all these features. The following describes various techniques
to achieve this:
      A.   Preserve Drainage Features. Protect natural drainage features,
particularly vegetated drainage swales and channels. Locate streets and
adjacent storm sewers away from valleys and swales.
      B.   Protect Natural Depression Storage Areas. Depression storage areas
have no surface outlet, or they drain very slowly. Depressions should be
protected and the storage capacity should be incorporated into required
detention facilities.
      C.   Avoid Creating Impervious Surfaces. Reduce impervious surfaces to
the maximum extent possible. Building footprints, sidewalks, driveways and
other features should be minimized.
      D.   Avoid Connecting Impervious Surfaces. Route roof runoff over lawns
and avoid using storm sewers. Grade sites to increase the travel time of
stormwater runoff. Avoid concentrating runoff.
      E.   Use Pervious-Paving Materials. Use pervious materials for driveways,
parking lots, access roads, sidewalks, bike trails and hiking trails. Provide
pervious strips between streets and sidewalks.
      F.   Reduce Setbacks. Reduce setbacks for buildings to shorten the
driveways and entry walks.
      G.   Construct Cluster Developments. Construct cluster developments to
reduce street length per lot.

EXAMPLE CALCULATIONS TO DETERMINE
EXEMPTION FROM SWM SITE PLAN PREPARATION REQUIREMENTS
Example I
   1.   The proposed new impervious area B of a garage is 900 sq. ft which is
next to the house and a driveway which are 1920 and 700 sq. ft respectively.
   2.   Determine the longest dimension of the area by connecting the out to
out points of the area (the diagonal D). This measures 102 ft. (the driveway is
32 ft by 30 ft and the house is 60 ft by 32 ft)
   3.   Extend the area of the house and driveway (60 ft. by 82 ft) in every
direction by 102 ft and draw a rectangle. This is a 264 ft. by 286 ft.
rectangle. The area of this rectangle is designated as the Area of Influence
(AOI) and is equal to 75,504 sq. ft. which is 1.7 acres.
   4.   Now, calculate the Total Impervious Area (TIA) inside this Area of
Influence (AOI) which is designated as a = area of the existing house + area of
the new garage + area of the driveway + portion of neighbor's house on the
right + area of hickory lane on the bottom.
   5.   a= 1920+900+700+1200+264*10= 7360 sq. ft.
   6.   According to Table 26-1A, maximum exemption for 1.7 Acres is 6800 sq.
ft. 7360 sq. ft. is larger than 6800 sq. ft.
   7.   So, construction of this new garage requires preparation of SWM Site
Plan that includes Peak Rate Control.

IMAGES/0-0-0-33.png]
Example 2
   1.   Proposed new impervious area, B = Area of the garage = 600
   2.   Total Impervious Area (TIA) within the Area of Influence (AOI) is
      a = Area of the house+ area of the garage+ area of the driveway+ Area of
the Rhubarb's lane
         =50*30+600+30*5+20*25+(94*2+50)*10
         =5130 sq. ft
   3.   Area of Influence (AOI)=(94*2+50)*(94+30+50+94)
               =(238*268) sq. ft.
               =63784 sq. ft.
               =1.5 acres
   4.   From Table 26-1A, Total Impervious Area allowed from Peak Rate Control
and SWM Site Plan preparation is 6200 sq. ft., corresponding to the Area of
Influence (AOI), is 1.5 acres. The Total Impervious Area 5130 sq. ft. within
the Area of Influence (AOI) is less than 6200 sq. ft.; therefore, construction
of the 600 sq. ft. garage is exempt from preparation of the SWM Site Plan (and
from peak rate control) requirement.

BACKGROUND PROVISIONS
§ 27-101. Short Title.
This Chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Lamar Township Zoning
Ordinance of 1992."
(Ord. 3/9/1993B, § 100)
§ 27-102. Authority.
   1.   Township Authority. Section 601 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code provides that the Supervisors of Lamar Township may implement
comprehensive plans and accomplish related land use purposes by enacting a
zoning ordinance.
   2.   Applicability. This Chapter requires that, within the Township of
Lamar, in the County of Clinton and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, no land,
body of water or structure shall hereafter be used or occupied and no structure
or part thereof shall hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved
or structurally altered unless in conformity with all the regulations and
procedures herein specified for the district in which such land, body of water
or structure is located.
(Ord. 3/9/1993B, § 101)
§ 27-103. Purpose.
   1.   General Purposes. This Chapter is enacted for the following purposes:
to promote the health, safety, morale and general welfare of the inhabitants of
the Township of Lamar by lessening congestion in the roads and streets;
securing safety from fire, panic and other dangers; providing adequate light
and air; preventing the overcrowding of land; avoiding undue concentration of
population; facilitating the adequate provision of transportation, water,
sewage, schools, parks and other public requirements; conserving the value of
buildings; protecting and preserving natural resources and agricultural land
and activities and encouraging the most appropriate use of land.
   2.   Community Development Objectives. This Chapter provides a legal basis
and framework for future Township development and redevelopment. Its provisions
are guided by the policies and proposals contained within the Township
Comprehensive Plan.
(Ord. 3/9/1993B, § 102)
§ 27-104. Interpretation.
   1.   Conflict with Other Laws. In interpreting and applying the provisions
of this Chapter, they shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the
promotion of health, safety, morale and the general welfare of the Township and
its citizens. It is not intended by this Chapter to interfere with or abrogate
or annul any rules or regulations previously adopted or permits previously
issued by the Township which are not in conflict with any provisions of this
Chapter, nor is it intended by this Chapter, to impose a greater restriction
upon the use of the buildings or premises or upon the height of the building,
or require a larger open space than is imposed or required by such ordinance,
rules, regulations or permits or by easements, covenants, building restrictions
or agreements, the provisions of this Chapter shall control.
   2.   Validity. Should any Section, subsection or provision of this Chapter
be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such decision
shall not affect the validity of this Chapter as a whole or any other part
thereof. Likewise, if a court of competent jurisdiction finds the application
of any provision or provisions of this Chapter to any lot, building or other
structure or tract of land to be invalid or ineffective in whole or in part,
the effect of such decision shall be limited to the person, property or
situation immediately involved and shall not affect any other persons, property
or situation.
(Ord. 3/9/1993B, § 103)
PART 2
ZONING DISTRICTS
§ 27-201. Establishments of Districts.
For the purpose of implementing the objectives of this Chapter, the Township of
Lamar is hereby divided into the following zoning districts.
   R-1   Rural Residential District
   R-2   Moderate Density Residential District
   VC   Village Center District
   RRC   Rural Roadside Commercial District
   GC   General Commercial District
   LI   Eight Industrial District
   AG   Agricultural District
   O/R   Open Space District
   HI   Highway Interchange District
(Ord. 3/9/1993B, § 200)
§ 27-202. Purpose of Districts.
   1.   R-1 -Rural Residential District. This district is intended to encourage
low density development in new single-family residential neighborhoods and to
facilitate the orderly growth of existing developments. To maintain the
community's rural character, minimum lot sizes, building setbacks and buffer
requirements have been established. In order to create an appropriate
residential atmosphere, compatible public and semipublic uses such as churches
and recreational facilities are permitted in this district while industrial and
commercial activities, with the exception of home occupations, are discouraged.
   2.   R-2 - Moderate Density Residential District. This district applies to
areas within the Township that are or will be connected to public water and
sewer and where higher density residential development already exists or could
be located in the future without conflicting with other land uses. Densities
may vary throughout this district, but a principal concern is to reserve
adequate open space.
   3.   VC - Village Center District. The purpose of this district is to
establish areas that can support basic neighborhood type residential and
commercial uses, including small retail and service and repair shops,
restaurants, office and service related establishments. Such uses are intended
to encourage new small business activity that is compatible with the rural
residential character of the Township's small village centers.
   4.   RRC - Rural Roadside Commercial District. This district is intended to
provide low intensity commercial uses that are compatible with adjoining
farmland, provided that buffer yard requirements are met. This use would be
encouraged along Route 64 in the western end of the Township in order to
provide commercial development opportunities while providing for adequate
setbacks and other standards that will not impact negatively on the productive
farmland.
   5.   GC - General Commercial District. The intent of this district is to
provide space for commercial operations serving both Township residents and a
broader regional market and to protect the character of residential and
agricultural areas from large scale commercial development. Standards within
this district are intended to minimize the interference of commercial
operations with other uses in the vicinity, to minimize traffic hazards caused
by poor access or inadequate carrying capacity of public roads, and to provide
for off-street parking and loading.
   6.   LI - Light Industrial District. This district is intended to encourage
construction and continued use of areas in the Township for general or light
industrial and manufacturing purposes, including industrial parks. Regulations
developed for this district prohibit uses or activities which would
substantially interfere with the utilization of these areas for industrial
purposes. However, reasonable standards are applied to minimize unenclosed
storage areas and to ensure adequate buffer strips, or screening, between this
district and all other adjoining districts.
   7.   AG - Agricultural District. The purpose of this district is to preserve
and protect the practice of farming, emphasize the economic importance of
farming to the community and the nation and ensure the preservation of prime
soils for future generations. Limited residential and agricultural-related
activities are permitted in this district; uses which would substantially
interfere with agricultural enterprises are discouraged.
   8.   O/R. - Open Space and Recreation District. This district is intended to
encourage the conservation of land in those areas where the terrain,
environmentally sensitive lands and other important natural features would not
be feasible for development or in the public interest. These areas are limited
principally to seasonal uses, recreational, forestry related activities and
similar types of activities that will not significantly change the character of
this environment.
   9.   HI - Highway Interchange District. The purpose of this district is to
provide an area for commercial development keyed to the major interstate road
network, represented by intersecting I-80 and Route 220. Reasonable limitations
are needed, however, in terms of height, scale density and open space to assure
compatibility with surrounding farm land and woodland areas. The intent would
also be to ensure an attractive entrance to the Township at this highway
interchange to encourage travel related businesses to locate nearby.
(Ord. 3/9/1993B, § 201)
§ 27-203. Zoning Map.
   1.   The boundaries of each of the districts are hereby established as shown
on the official zoning map, which is made a part of this Chapter together with
all future notations, references and amendments. (A copy of the Zoning Map can
be found on the last page of this Chapter.)
   2.   The official Zoning Map shall be identified by the signature of the
Chairman of the Board of Supervisors, be properly attested to by the Township
Secretary, and shall bear the Township seal.
   3.   No change of any nature shall be made to the official Zoning Map,
except in conformance with the procedures set forth in Part 14. The final
authority as to the current status of zoning districts in the Township shall be
the official Zoning Map. Any changes made to the zoning districts shall be made
on the official Zoning Map promptly after the amendment has been approved by
the Board of Supervisors and the Township Secretary.
(Ord. 3/9/1993B, § 202)
§ 27-204. Interpretation of Boundaries.
   1.   Designation of District Boundaries. The district boundary lines, except
for the floodplain districts, are intended generally to follow the centerlines
of streets, the centerlines of railroad rights-of-way, existing lot lines, or
municipal boundary lines, all as shown on the official Zoning Map by a specific
dimension expressing its distance in feet from a road centerline or other
boundary line as indicated.
   2.   Determination of Location of Boundaries. In case of uncertainty as to
the true location of a district boundary line in a particular instance, the
Zoning Officer shall request the Zoning Hearing Board to render its
determination with respect thereto. Provided, however, no boundary shall be
changed by the Zoning Hearing Board.
   3.   Extension of District Boundaries. Where a district boundary line
divides a lot which was in single ownership at the time of passage of this
Chapter, the Zoning Hearing Board may permit, as a special exception, the
extension of the regulations for either portion of the lot, not to exceed 50
feet beyond the district line into the remaining portion of the lot.
(Ord. 3/9/1993B, § 203)
§ 27-205. Floodplain District Boundary Changes.
The delineation of any boundary of the floodplain districts may be revised only
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). No change in any floodplain
boundary shall be made unless the Township has sought and obtained approval for
said change as per Federal insurance regulations.
(Ord. 3/9/1993B, § 204)
PART 3
DISTRICT REGULATIONS
§ 27-301. Application of District Regulations.
The regulations set forth in this Part for each district shall be minimum
regulations and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of structure or
land, except as hereinafter provided:
   A.   No building, structure or land shall hereafter be used or occupied and
no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in conformity
with all of the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is
located.
   B.   No building or other structure shall hereafter be erected or altered:
      (1)   To exceed the height or bulk.
      (2)   To accommodate or house a greater number of families.
      (3)   To occupy a greater percentage of lot area.
      (4)   To have narrower or smaller rear yards, front yards, side yards or
other open space, than herein required or in any other manner be contrary to
this Chapter.

** In order to maintain the existing character and visual quality of the
historic villages of Salona and Mackeyville, the required front yard setback
provisions for a proposed building shall be decreased in depth to the average
alignment of existing buildings within 100 feet on each side of the proposed
buildings providing such calculation is limited to the same side of the street.
In determining the average, the building may be located within five feet of
average, provided the resulting setback is at least six feet off the road or
street right-of-way.
***   For single-family detached dwelling lots that entirely front a cul-de-sac
street, the front yard setback may be increased beyond the required front yard
setback to achieve the required minimum lot width at the building line; and the
required minimum lot width at the street line may be reduced to not less than
30 feet.

PART 4
GENERAL REGULATIONS AND APPLICABILITY
§ 27-401. Intent.
This Part lists specific controls over general aspects of land utilization
which are not included elsewhere in Chapter. The following regulations shall
apply to all zoning districts and uses as applicable.
(Ord. 3/9/1993B, § 400)
§ 27-402. Public Utility Corporation Exemption.
The provisions of this Chapter shall not apply to any existing or proposed
building or extension thereof used by any public utility corporation, if upon
petition of the corporation, the Public Utility Commission shall, after a
public hearing, decide that the present or proposed situation of the building
in question is reasonably necessary for the convenience or welfare of the
public.
(Ord. 3/9/1993B, § 401)
§ 27-403. Environmental Performance Standards.
   1.   Upon request of the Township the owner shall furnish or obtain proof at
his own expense that he is in compliance with the regulations of the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection for fugitive emissions,
particulate matter emissions, sulfur compound emissions, standards for sources,
sources of volatile organic compounds, emission of hazardous air pollutants,
and ambient air quality sources. [Ord.12/10/2001]
   2.   Storage of waste materials on the lot shall be in conformity with DEP
regulations, but in no case shall the period be greater than 30 days. All waste
materials awaiting transport shall be kept in enclosed containers and be
screened from view from all adjacent properties, in accordance with §
27-806. [Ord. 12/10/2001]
   3.   All lighting shall be so designed and located that the light sources
are shielded from adjoining residences and streets and shall not be of
excessive brightness nor cause a glare hazardous or noxious to pedestrians or
drivers at or beyond the lot boundaries. No direct beams of light shall be
directed toward adjacent properties.
   4.   Any operation producing heat shall be operated in such a manner as to
prevent any effect from the heat beyond the property lines of the lot on which
the operation is located.
   5.   All electromagnetic radiation shall comply with the regulations of the
Federal Communication Commission (FCC).
   6.   No use shall endanger the ground water table elevation and water
quality nor adversely affect ground water supplies of nearby properties.
   7.   In sinkhole-prone areas, hydrogeological data shall be submitted to the
Township as specified in §
22-414 of the Township Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance [
Chapter 22].
(Ord. 3/9/1993B, § 402; as amended by Ord. 12/10/2001)
§ 27-404. Pipeline Setback.
There shall be a minimum setback distance of 20 feet measured from a pipeline
right-ofway line, between any proposed building and any petroleum, petroleum

(Ord. 3/9/1993B, § 403)
§ 27-405. Building Height Exceptions.
No building or structure shall exceed the maximum height of buildings specified
in this Chapter, except that regulations shall not apply to agricultural
structures, silos, water towers, church spires, belfries, antennas, chimneys or
other appurtenances usually required to be placed above the roof level and not
intended for human occupancy. Although exempted from structural height
limitations, those structures should not significantly impair solar access of
buildings or solar collector locations.
(Ord. 3/9/1993B, § 404)
§ 27-406. Building Setback Exceptions.
The required building setback provisions for a proposed building may be
decreased in depth to the average alignment of adjacent buildings. Setback
reduction may occur when alignment of existing buildings is less than the front

reduction encroach on the street line. The granting of an exception shall be
the authority of the Zoning Hearing Board.
(Ord. 3/9/1993B, § 405)
§ 27-407. Required Yard Exceptions.

thereto. Upon final approval, the developer shall guarantee improvements and
post financial security in accordance with § 22305 of the Township Subdivision
and Land Development Ordinance [
Chapter 22].
   7.   In the event that a development plan, or a section thereof, is given
final approval and thereafter the landowner abandons such plan or the section
thereof that has been finally approved, and so notifies the Board of
Supervisors in writing; or, in the event the landowner fails to commence and
carry out the planned residential development within a reasonable time, no
development or further development shall take place on the property included in
the development plan until after the property is reclassified by enactment of
an amendment to this Chapter in the manner prescribed for such amendments.
(Ord. 3/9/1993B, § 617)
§ 27-619. As-Built Drawings.
Whenever a developer installs or causes to be installed any sewer lines or
water lines, the developer shall, as soon as practicable after installations
are complete, furnish the Township with a copy of a drawing that shows the
exact location of such lines. Such drawings must be verified as accurate by the
service provider. Compliance with this requirement shall be a condition of the
continued validity of the permit authorizing such development.
(Ord. 3/9/1993B, § 618)
§ 27-620. Jurisdiction.
District justices shall have initial jurisdiction over proceedings brought
under this Section. The enforcement remedies are as follows:
      A.   Any person, partnership or corporation, who or which has violated
the planned residential development provisions of this Chapter, shall, upon
being found liable therefore in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the
Township, pay a judgement of not more than $500 plus all court costs, including
reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Township. No judgement shall commence
or be imposed, levied or payable until the date of the determination of a
violation by the district Justice. If the defendant neither pays nor timely
appeals the judgement, the Township may enforce the judgement pursuant to the
appropriate rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation, unless the district Justice determines
otherwise. All judgements, costs, and reasonable attorney fees collected for
the violation of planned residential development provisions shall be paid to
the Township.
      B.   The court of common pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of
stay, upon cause shown, tolling the per them judgement pending a final
adjudication of the violation and judgement.
      C.   Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed or interpreted
to grant to any person or entity other than the Township the right to commence
any action for enforcement pursuant to this Section.

(Ord. 3/9/1993B, § 704)
PART 8
PERFORMANCE ZONING
§ 27-801. Authority and Purpose.
   1.   The Municipalities Planning Code makes provisions for waiving standards
to promote better land development. This change incorporates similar language
into the purpose of the local ordinance.
   2.   It is the intent of this Chapter to encourage flexibility, economy and
creativity in layout and design of subdivisions and land development (mobile
home parks) and planned residential developments. The Planning Commission
should have the authority to alter site requirements in order to encourage
sound site planning and development practices that are consistent with
contemporary planning concepts and principles and the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code.
(Ord. 319/1993B, § 800)
§ 27-802. Definition.
Performance zoning is a method of regulating land use based upon flexibility
and creativity. When this approach is used, it supersedes the standards of
conventional zoning districts. Under performance zoning, land uses are
permitted based upon meeting certain site criteria rather than upon their
location in a specific zoning district. The increased flexibility of
performance zoning enables the landowner to work with the constraints of the
site and to buffer adjoining uses. Performance criteria include site capacity,
evaluation and buffer standards which are described in §
27-804,
27-805 and
27-806 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 3/9/1993B, § 801)
§ 27-803. Design Standards.
These standards may be used at the discretion of the Planning Commission to
evaluate major subdivision and land development and planned residential
developments as an alternative to specific standards and requirements of the
particular zoning district. Performance zoning, when applied by the Planning
Commission, shall supersede the specific zoning requirements for the district,
or districts, in which the development-project is located.
(Ord. 3/9/1993B, § 802)
§ 27-804. Site Capacity Calculation.
   1.   Each site has physical features which are unique and not found
elsewhere. Portions of some sites may not be usable due to steep slope, wetland
or other sensitive areas.
   2.   A minimum of buildable land also should be reserved for recreation and
open space. The purpose of this Section is to establish the appropriate
intensity of use to which a specific tract may be put. For each tract, the
developer shall submit the following calculation with the initial plan:
      A.   Base Site Area. That portion of the tract which is not usable for
the activities proposed for the site shall be subtracted from the site area to
determine base site area. Use the following formula to determine the base site
area:
   1.   Site area of the development as determined by actual onsite survey.                                            Ac.
   2.   Subtract: all land within the ultimate right-of way used for existing ro                                       Ac.
and utility rights of-way or easements.
   3.   Subtract: land which is not contiguous; i.e.,
      a.   A separate parcel which does not abut or adjoin, nor share common
boundaries with the rest of the development, and/or;
      b.   Land which is cut off from the main parcel by a road, railroad existing
land uses, or major streams so as to serve as a major barrier to common use, or so                                           Ac.
that it is isolated and unavailable for building purposes.
   4.   Subtract: land which in a previously approved subdivision was reserved f                                       Ac.
resource reasons such as flooding or recreation.
   5.   Subtract: land used or zoned for another use; i.e., land which is used or is
to be used for commercial or industrial uses in a residential development, or land in                                        Ac.
a different zoning district than the primary use.
Total: Equals BASE SITE AREA                                                                                                 Ac.
 
      B.   Resource Protection Land. All land within the base site area shall
be mapped and measured for the purpose of determining the amount of open space
needed to protect it. On the form below identify the amount of land in each
resource and then multiply the open space ratio that has been determined for
that resource.
   DETERMINATION OF RESOURCE PROTECTION AREA
Resource Open Space Ratio Acres of Land in Resource Land (Acres in Resource x
                                                    Open Space Ratio) 4
Resource             Open Space Ratio Acres of Land in Land (Acres in Resource
                                      Resource         x Open Space Ratio) 4
Floodplains          1.00
Floodplain soils     1.00
Lakes or ponds       1.00
Wetlands             1.00
Steep Slope (25% or  .85
more)
Forest               .80

Total Land with Resource Restrictions
Total Resource Protection Land
4 The open space ratio appears in the first column.
   C.   Recreation Land. In order to provide for usable public or common open
space as near to each development as possible, the following specific
guidelines are intended to assure that a minimum amount of land, not included
in the chart above, is retained for open space and recreational purposes:
      Take   Base site area                                       
      Subtract   Total land with Resource Restriction       -                  
      Equals   TOTAL UNRESTRICTED LAND         =                  
      D.   In determining the recreation or open space requirement, or set
aside, for a particular type of development, use the following formula:
         Multiply   Total Unrestricted Land by:   x                  
               1.   Zero (0) for single-family detached uses where permitted as
part of a major subdivision.
               2.   Two-tenths (0.20) for single-family cluster or performance
subdivision in residential districts.
               3.   Two-tenths (0.20) for commercial projects using the
performance standard.
               4.   Zero (0) for all uses in the agricultural district.
         Equals TOTAL RECREATION LAND   =                  
      E.   Determination of Site Capacity. Individual site capacity is
determined by calculating the net buildable site area. For single-family
performance subdivisions, the number of allowable dwelling units is determined
by multiplying the net density by net buildable site area. The calculations are
as follows:
Take     Resource Protection Land                          Ac.
Add      Recreation Land                 +                  Ac.
Equals   TOTAL OPEN SPACE                =                  Ac.
Take     Base Site Area                                    Ac.
Subtract Total Open Spaces 5                               Ac.
Equals   NET BUILDABLE SITE AREA 3       =                  Ac.
Multiply by Net Density for project area                   Ac.
Equals   NUMBER OF DWELLING UNITS        =                  DU's
         (do not round up)
5 In the case of commercial projects, the net buildable site area is the final
calculation.
 
   NOTE: For commercial projects the formula is intended to provide the
developer and Planning Commission with the net buildable site area, including
the resource protection and open space set aside, and does not relate to the
number of building units.
(Ord. 3/9/1993E, § 803)
§ 27-805. Criteria for Evaluating Subdivisions, Mobile Home Park Developments
and Planned Residential Developments_ And Land Developments.
   1.   Once the developable site area has been determined as a result of the
previous calculations, the project would be evaluated according to the criteria
below. The intent is to produce a project which is compatible with the existing
landscape, adjoining land uses and structures, and which exhibits creativity in
layout and design
   2.   The Planning Commission shall use a positive and negative rating
criteria to evaluate the project in terms of all of the applicable criteria
that appear on the site performance criteria and rating chart. In some cases
where there are major qualitative factors involved, there are five rating
categories, ranging from +4 to a -4; in other cases, there are three rating
categories; +2, 0 and -2.
   3.   Some of the categories that deal with infrastructure, parking, and
other physical requirements shall be considered absolute guidelines that must
be met for the development, or project, to be approved.
   4.   The developer, or builder, may use the rating categories as a guide in
preparing the site plan and should, during the review process, work
cooperatively with the Planning Commission to address, correct or improve a
negative rating.
   5.   The rating categories factors would be taken into account in approving
major subdivisions, commercial projects, mobile home park developments and
planned residential developments.
   6.   Site Performance Criteria and Rating Factors.
      A.   Architectural Compatibility. This criterion pertains to all areas of
the Township, but principally to proposed structures in the villages of

(Ord. 3/9/1993B, § 804; as amended byOrd. 12/10/2001)
§ 27-806. Buffer Yard Screenings.
   1.   Definition. A buffer is a specified land area together with the
planting and landscaping required on the land. A buffer may also contain a
barrier, such as a berm or a fence, where such additional screening is
necessary to achieve the desired level of buffering between various activities.
   2.   Purpose. The provisions of this Section are provided for the following
purposes:
      A.   To act as a guide in evaluating buffering criteria when the
performance zoning approach is used.
      B.   To act as buffer design standards as referenced throughout Chapter
when the conventional zoning district approach is used.
      C.   To provide flexibility to the developer by manipulation of four
basic elements: distance, plant material type, plant material density and land
forms.
      The general purpose of a buffer is to ameliorate nuisances and
unfavorable land use relationships. The required buffer is intended to minimize
nuisances including incongruous land uses.
   3.   Buffer of Agriculture Areas. Where development is proposed adjacent to
or within the agricultural zoning district, a buffer yard of trees shall be
provided. This requirement shall supersede use of the design diagrams below, if
at the discretion of the Planning Commission, a tree plantation better serves
to preserve the larger rural landscape. Existing hedgerows and woodlots shall
be preserved to the greatest extent possible and can be used toward the
fulfillment of the buffer requirements.
   4.   Location of Buffer Yards. Buffer yards shall be located on the side and
rear lot lines of a parcel extending to the lot or parcel boundary line. The
buffer is normally calculated along the property line. However, design
variations are allowed and may be calculated as shown on the "Design Option
Chart," Table 1.
   5.   Determination of Buffer Yard Requirements.
      A.   Existing hedgerows and woodlots, may be applied toward fulfillment
of the buffer yard requirements. The Planning Commission may require that more
trees be added to an existing hedgerow in order to increase the buffer density.
      B.   To determine the type of buffer yard required between two adjacent
parcels, the following procedure shall be followed:
         (1)   Identify the land use class of the proposed use by referring to
Table 3, "Buffer Yard Requirements."
         (2)   Identify the land use class of each adjoining use by referring
to Table 2, "Land Use Classification Chart."
         (3)   Determine the buffer yard requirements for side and rear lot
lines or the portion thereof on the subject parcel by referring to Table 1,
"Design Options." Retained natural woodland shall be preferred landscaping. The
buffer yards specified are to be provided on each lot or parcel independent of
adjoining uses or adjoining buffer yards, except that the Planning Commission
may take such existing buffering into consideration when determining the buffer
yard requirements.
         (4)   When a developed use is proposed adjacent to vacant land, the
owners of the affected properties may submit a contractual agreement whereby
the buffer yard for the developed use is reduced or waived, provided that the
owner of said property to be developed agrees to: (a) develop at no greater
intensity than the specified land use class and (b) if an additional buffer is
needed at a future time, it will be provided on the vacant land. This agreement
or common consent, shall be recorded on the respective property deeds of all
affected landowners.
         (5)   Should a developed use increase in intensity from a given land
use class to a higher one (e.g., Class 3 to Class IV), the Planning Commission
shall determine, during the site plan review process, whether additional buffer
yard is needed and if so to what extent and type.
Note: Buffer yard requirements are stated in terms of the width of the buffer
yard and the number of plant units required per 100 linear feet of buffer yard.
The requirements may be satisfied by any of the options indicated (Buffer Yard
Type A through E).
   6.   Buffer Yard Use. A buffer yard may be used for passive recreation. It
may contain pedestrian, bike or equestrian trails provided that:
      A.   Adequate plant material is retained as necessary to achieve the
buffer effect.
      B.   The total width of the buffer yard is maintained.
   7.   Buffer Yard Maintenance. It shall be the responsibility of the property
owner to maintain required landscaping and buffer yards. Dead plant materials
must be replaced within 1 year of their original planting. landscaped areas and
buffer yards shall be kept free of noxious weeds and trash. Where natural plant
growth changes the actual buffer effect over time, the Zoning Officer may
require supplementary plantings to achieve the intent and purposes of this
Chapter.
   8.   Optional Landscaping Methods. As a design option, the developer may
propose to develop, with concurrence of the Planning Commission, an orchard, a
grove of trees or similar vegetation in keeping with the rural character of the
Township. For example, an earth berm with appropriate vegetation may be used to
reduce the required number of plantings in the buffer yard design standards.
Such reduction would be determined by the Planning Commission after review of
the earth berm and proposed vegetative pattern.
   9.   Buffer Yard Design.
      A.   Plant Materials. All plant materials required within a specified
buffer yard shall be plaited to completion within 6 months from date of
approval of the site plan and thereafter be properly maintained.
      B.   Plant Types. The following landscape/plant materials are suggested
for inclusion in the required buffer yards:
         (1)   Canopy trees: maple, oak, birch, beech, linden, honey-locust,
ash, ginko, sweetgum.
         (2)   Deciduous shrubs and shrublike trees: Russian olive, dogwood,
redbud, dowering crab, hawthorn, magnolia, fruit (pear, cherry, plum, peach,
honeysuckle, lilac, cotoneaster, forsythia, euonymus, hydrangea, privet,
vibernum.
         (3)   Evergreens: pine, fir, spruce, hemlock, juniper, yew,
arborvitae, rhododendron.
      C.   Minimum Allowable Size/Trees. Minimum 6 feet in height or not less
than 1 inch in caliper.
      D.   Required Number of Plantings. The number of canopy trees, evergreens
and shrubs is based on the depth of the buffer yard and the types of land uses
to be buffered. To determine the required number, identify the adjoining land
use (A-E) and buffer yard depth and then count the number of canopy trees,
evergreens and shrubs in the respective block on the chart below.

Interpreting Table 3
Table 3 is used to determine the type of buffer required for any project using
the Performance Zoning Standard.
      A.   To determine the land use class for any type of development, consult
Table 2, "Land Use Classification." Classes are divided into five categories,
based on the nature and character of the use. (Agriculture, for example, is in
Class I, while industrial use is in Class V.)
      B.   If the adjoining land parcel is occupied, identify the adjacent land
use by class also (See horizontal heading entitled "Adjacent Existing Land Use
Class" near the left of chart). Then, select the proposed land use class from
the vertical column labeled "Land Use Class" at the extreme left of the chart
in order to identify the type of buffer yard design required. A proposed land
use IV, for example, that is adjacent to another land use IV property, would
require an A type buffer yard design as described in Table 1. No buffer would
be required between two Class I residential uses.
      C.   When the adjacent land is vacant, the type of buffer yard design
required depends on the zoning designation of the particular adjoining parcel.
For instance, a project that qualifies as a land use Class 3 on Table 2 would
require a C-type buffer in an (R-1) residential district and a B-type buffer in
the (H-I) highway interchange district.

and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this
Chapter.

§27-1704. Administration and Enforcement.
   1.   Applications.
      A.   Permit applications shall document compliance with this Part and
shall be accompanied by drawings showing the location of the solar energy
system on the building or property, including property lines. Permits must be
kept on the premises where the solar energy system is located.
      B.   The permit shall be revoked if the solar energy system, whether new
or preexisting, is moved or otherwise altered, either intentionally or by
natural forces, in a manner which causes the solar energy system not to be in
conformity with this Part. In the case of nonconformity caused by natural
forces, the owner shall have a maximum of 90 days to initiate necessary
remedial action to bring system back in conformance with the Part.
      C.   The solar energy system must be properly maintained and be kept free
from all hazards, including, but not limited to, faulty wiring, loose
fastenings, being in an unsafe condition or detrimental to public health,
safety or general welfare.
      D.   For PSES systems, conditional use approval is required prior to
obtaining land development plan approval. The conditional use approval and land
development plan processes can be concurrent. All necessary stormwater plan
approval, E & S and NPDES permits must be approved prior to receiving final
Council approval of the land development plan. An approved land development
plan is required for application for a zoning permit.
      E.   ASES systems for single-family residential use are exempt from the
land development process, but a zoning permit is required.
   2.   Fees and Costs.
      A.   The Applicant shall pay all permit application fees and inspection
fees when seeking approval of a solar energy system under this Part.
      B.   The Applicant shall, prior to receipt of an approved permit, sign a
Lamar Township developer’s agreement and submit funds for a developer’s account
which will reimburse the Township for any actual fees or costs incurred arising
out of or related to the application (collectively the "costs"). The costs
shall include, but not be limited to, engineering and legal fees. Any funds
remaining after project completion shall be returned to the developer.
   3.   Modifications. The Township may grant modification of the requirements
of one or more provisions of this Part if the literal enforcement will exact
undue hardship because of peculiar conditions pertaining to the property in
question, provided that such modification will not be contrary to the public
interest and that the purpose and intent of the ordinance is observed. All
requests for a modification shall be in writing and shall state in full the
grounds and facts of unreasonableness or hardship on which the request is
based, the provision or provisions of the ordinance involved and the minimum
modification necessary.
   4.   Enforcement.
      A.   Upon the receipt of a written complaint setting forth the existence
of unauthorized construction, modification, or use in violation of this Part,
or other notice thereof, the, Zoning and Code Enforcement Officer, that may be
authorized by the Township Council shall cause written notice to be given
either by personal service or registered or certified mail to the applicant of
the property upon which the violation exists, to immediately cease and the
construction, modification or the unauthorized use of the solar energy system.
Such a written notice shall be required to enforce the remedies set forth in
this Section. However, the Township shall still be entitled to give a verbal
notice for defective systems as authorized above.
      B.   Upon failure of such applicant to comply as directed in said notice,
the Enforcement Officer, other municipal officials or solicitor may appear on
behalf of the Township and initiate legal proceedings to enforce the provisions
of this Part before a District Magistrate.
      C.   Any Applicant who or which shall violate or permit to be violated
the provisions of this Part shall, upon being found liable therefore in a civil
enforcement proceeding brought by Lamar Township before a District Magistrate,
pay a fine of not more than $600, plus all court costs, including reasonable
attorney's fees incurred by (Township) as a result thereof. No fine shall
commence or be imposed, levied, or be payable until the date of the
determination of the violation by a District Magistrate. Each day that a
violation exists and is continued shall constitute a separate offense, unless
the District Magistrate who determines that a violation has occurred further
shall determine that there was a good faith basis for the defendant to have
believed that there was no such violation, in which event there shall be deemed
to have been only one such violation until the fifth day following the date of
determination by such District Magistrate and thereafter every day shall
constitute a separate offense.
      D.   In addition, the Township shall also be entitled to recover from any
applicant all the Township's costs or fees (collectively the "costs") arising
out of or related to the application or enforcement of this Part. Such costs
may also include those to remedy violations of this Part or to abate nuisances.
The costs shall include, but not be limited, engineer fees, geologist fees,
attorney fees, zoning officer fees, and staff/employee time. The costs may be
collected as a Municipal Claim under applicable law against the property upon
which the solar energy system, or portions thereof, is located.
(Ord. 2024-01, §2)
§27-1705. Construction and Severability.
   1.   The provisions of this Part shall be construed to the maximum extent
possible to further the purposes and policies set forth herein, as consistent
with applicable state statutes and regulations. If the provisions of this
Section and state law are in conflict, then state law shall prevail.
   2.   It is the intention of the Township Supervisors that the provisions of
this Part are severable and if any provisions of this Part shall be declared
unconstitutional or invalid by the judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect any of
the remaining provisions of this Part.
