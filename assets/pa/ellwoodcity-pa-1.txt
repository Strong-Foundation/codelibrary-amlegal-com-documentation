ADOPTING ORDINANCES
ORDINANCE # 2220
AN ORDINANCE OF THE BOROUGH OF ELLWOOD CITY, LAWRENCE AND BEAVER COUNTIES,
PENNSYLVANIA, ENACTING A CODE OF ORDINANCES OF THE BOROUGH OF ELLWOOD CITY,
PENNSYLVANIA, PROVIDING FOR THE REPEAL OF CERTAIN ORDINANCES NOT INCLUDED IN
THE CODE OF ORDINANCES, UNLESS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED; PROVIDING FOR THE
MANNER OF AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES; AND PROVIDING WHEN THIS ORDINANCE
SHALL BECOME EFFECTIVE.
THE BOROUGH OF ELLWOOD CITY ORDAINS AS FOLLOWS:
Section 1. This ordinance, consisting of Parts 1 through 16 inclusive, is
enacted as the "Code of Ordinances, Borough of Ellwood City, Pennsylvania" and
shall be treated as a new and original comprehensive ordinance of the Borough
which shall supersede all other general and permanent ordinances enacted by the
Borough prior to May 1, 1997.
Section 2. All provisions of the Code shall be in full force and effect thirty
(30) days from the date this ordinance is enacted. Any ordinance or parts of
ordinances adopted prior to May 1, 1997 are specifically repealed and shall
become null and void and cease to be in effect.
Section 3. The repeal provided for in Section 2 of this Ordinance shall not
affect any offense or act committed or done or any penalty imposed or any
contract or right established or accruing before the effective date of this
Ordinance.
Section 4. Any and all additions or amendments to the Code, when passed in a
form as to indicate the intention of Council to make the additions and
amendments a part of the Code, shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code
so that reference to the "Code of Ordinances, Borough of Ellwood City,
Pennsylvania" shall be understood and intended to include the additions and
amendments.
Section 5. A copy of the Code shall be kept on file in the office of the
Borough Secretary, preserved in loose-leaf form. It shall be the express duty
of the Borough Secretary, or someone authorized by the Secretary, to insert in
their designated places all amendments or ordinances which indicate the
intention of Council to make them a part of the Code when they have been
printed or reprinted in page form, and to extract from the Code all provisions
which may from time to time be repealed by the Borough. This copy of the Code
shall be available for all persons desiring to examine it and shall be
considered the official Code of Ordinances of the Borough of Ellwood City, and
shall be so certified by the Borough Secretary.
Section 6. In case of the amendment of any section of the Code, or the addition
of any new section to the Code by amendment, for which a penalty is not
provided, the general penalty as provided in Section
202.99 of the Code shall apply to the section as amended or added, or in case
the amendment contains provisions for which a penalty, other than the
aforementioned general penalty, is provided in another section in the same
chapter, the penalty so provided in that other section shall be held to relate
to the section so amended, unless the penalty is specifically repealed therein.
Section 7. It shall be unlawful for any person to change or amend, by additions
or deletions, any part or portion of the Code, or to insert or delete pages or
portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with the Code in any manner whatsoever
which will cause the ordinances of the Borough of Ellwood City to be
misrepresented thereby. Any person violating this section shall be penalized as
provided in Section
202.99 of the Code of Ordinances, Borough of Ellwood City, Pennsylvania.

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is consistent with
the best accepted practice for codification. Each section is self- identifying
as to code, chapter and section number. For example, 238.02 indicates that the
code number is 2, the chapter number is 238 (or the 38th chapter within code
2), and the section number is .02. The code and chapter numbers appear left of
the decimal, with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the
decimal, and the chapter number being the first two digits left of the decimal.
The section number appears to the right of the decimal. As another example,
408.01 indicates that the code number is 4, the chapter number is 408 (or the
8th chapter within code 4), and the section number is .01.
   With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even- numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99. Newly created sections subsequent to the original
codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event
the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For
example, newly created 660.061, 660.062 and 660.063 follow 660.06 and precede
660.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

   (a)   These Codified Ordinances may be amended or supplemented at any time
and, when any amendment or supplement is adopted in such form as to indicate
the intention of Council to make the same a part thereof, such amendment or
supplement shall be incorporated in, and deemed a part of, these Codified
Ordinances, so that a reference to these Codified Ordinances shall be
understood and construed as including these Codified Ordinances and any and all
such amendments and supplements.

Ordinances shall be integrated therewith by following the form of arrangement
and plan set forth in the original Codified Ordinances as follows: each Code

except penalty sections, shall be consecutive within each chapter commencing
with the first section of
Chapter 202, which shall be numbered 202.01, the first "2" signifying Code 2,
and the two figures "02" before the decimal signifying the chapter within the
Code, and the two figures "01" after the decimal signifying the first section

      (5)   Calendar-Computation of Time. The terms "month" and "year" mean the

202.04   SEPARABILITY OF PROVISIONS.
   Each section and each part of each section of these Codified Ordinances is
hereby declared to be an independent section or part of a section and
notwithstanding any other evidence of legislative intent, it is hereby declared
to be the controlling legislative intent that if any such section or part of a
section, or any provision thereof, or the application thereof to any person or
circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remaining sections or parts of
sections and the application of such provision to any other person or
circumstance, other than those as to which it is held invalid, shall not be
affected thereby, and it is hereby declared to be the legislative intent that
these Codified Ordinances would have been adopted independently of such section
or part of a section so held to be invalid.
202.05   ORDINANCES REPEALED.
   All ordinances, resolutions, and parts of ordinances and resolutions, in
conflict with the provisions of these Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed.
202.06   EXEMPTIONS FROM REPEAL.
   The repeal provided for in Section
202.05 shall not affect:
   (a)   Any offense or act committed or done, or any penalty or forfeiture
incurred, or any contract or right established or accruing, before the adoption
of these Codified Ordinances;
   (b)   Any ordinance or resolution promising or guaranteeing the payment of
money by or to the Borough, or authorizing the issuance of any bonds of the
Borough, or any evidence of the Borough's indebtedness, or any contract or
obligation assumed by the Borough;
   (c)   The administrative ordinances and resolutions of Council not in
conflict or inconsistent with the provisions of these Codified Ordinances;
   (d)   Any right, license or franchise conferred by any ordinance or
resolution of Council on any person or corporation;
   (e)   Any ordinance establishing, naming, relocating or vacating any street
or other public way;
   (f)   Any ordinance or part thereof providing for the establishment of
positions, for salaries or compensation;
   (g)   Any prosecution, suit or other proceeding pending, or any judgment
rendered, on or prior to the adoption of these Codified Ordinances;
   (h)   Any ordinance levying or imposing taxes or assessments;
   (i)   Any ordinance establishing or changing the boundaries of the Borough;
or
   (j)   Any ordinance or resolution adopted by Council after the adoption of
these Codified Ordinances.
202.07   CONFLICTS OF LAWS.
   (a)   In the event of a conflict between any of the provisions of these
Codified Ordinances, or between any of the provisions of these Codified
Ordinances and a provision of any standard code adopted by the Borough pursuant
to the Borough Code, the provision that establishes the higher or stricter
standard shall control. In the event of a conflict between any of the
provisions of these Codified Ordinances and any provision of State law,
including rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to State law, the State
law, rule or regulation shall control.
   (b)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
   (c)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
   (d)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
   (e)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different meetings
of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments are to
be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
202.08   FILE COPY; INSPECTION BY PUBLIC.
   A certified copy of these Codified Ordinances shall be kept on file in the
office of the Secretary/Treasurer. It shall be the duty of the Secretary/
Treasurer, or someone duly authorized by the Secretary/Treasurer, to insert in
their designated places all ordinances or resolutions which indicate the
intention of Council to make such ordinances or resolutions a part of these
Codified Ordinances when printed or reprinted in page form, and to extract from
these Codified Ordinances all provisions which may be from time to time
repealed by Council. Such certified copy of these Codified Ordinances shall be
available for all persons desiring to examine these Codified Ordinances, and
the copy on file shall be considered the official Codified Ordinances of the
Borough.

the maximum fine for ordinance violations, the maximum fine authorized shall be
the maximum fine for the Borough.
   (d)   Surcharges; Equitable Remedies. The imposition of any penalty provided
for in this section shall be in addition to any surcharge levied for a
violation of a provision of these Codified Ordinances, or a provision of a
technical or other code adopted by reference in these Codified Ordinances, or a
rule, regulation or order promulgated or made under authority of either or
under authority of State law, and shall be in addition to any equitable remedy
provided by a provision of these Codified Ordinances, or a provision of a
technical or other code adopted by reference in these Codified Ordinances, or a
rule, regulation or order promulgated or made under authority of either, or

   (a)   Duties of Secretary/Treasurer. For the purpose of procuring accurate
information, in reference to the ownership of real estate, the Secretary/
Treasurer shall, under the direction of Council, cause to be made all necessary
books, maps and plans as will show the situation and dimensions of each
property thereon, which books, maps and plans shall be so prepared as to show
the location and the name of the owner or owners thereof, with blank space for
the name of the owner of each lot, and with provisions for the names of future
owners and the dates of future transfers of title.
   (b)   Access to Records; Assistance of Engineer. For the purpose of
establishing the real estate registry, the Secretary/Treasurer shall have
access, without charge, to any public records wherein the necessary information
may be obtainable, and may also cause a search to be made in other places for
any muniments or evidences of title not reported to him or her as herein
provided and requisite for the completion of such books, maps and plans. In
such work, he or she shall have the assistance of the Engineer.
   (c)   Preservation and Keeping of Registry. Those books, maps and plans
referred to in subsection (a) hereof shall be carefully preserved and shall be
so kept, by additions from time to time, as to show the ownership of every lot
or piece of real estate or subdivision thereof within the limits of the
Borough, with the succeeding transmissions of title from the time of the
commencement of those plans, but nothing contained therein shall, at any time,
invalidate any Municipal or tax claim by reason of the fact that the same is
not assessed or levied against the registered owner.
   (d)   Duty of Owners of Real Estate. All owners of real estate within the
limits of the Borough, within one month after the date of the approval of
original Ordinance 810, passed December 8, 1933, and every subsequent
purchaser, devisee or other person, within one month after acquiring title in
any manner whatsoever, to any real estate in the Borough, shall furnish to the
Secretary/Treasurer, at his or her office, descriptions of their respective
properties upon forms to be furnished by the Borough and, at the same time,
shall present their conveyances to be stamped as evidence of the registry
thereof.

shall present for registry the deeds of all properties within the Borough sold
by them at judicial sales, and the Prothonotary and Recorder of Deeds of
Lawrence and Beaver Counties shall not admit for record any deed of any
property in the Borough bearing a date subsequent to December 8, 1933, unless
the same is first duly stamped as provided in subsection (d) hereof.
   (f)   Penalty. Whoever neglects or refuses to comply with this section, for
a period of thirty days after public notice, shall be liable to a penalty of
five dollars ($5.00), to be recovered with costs of suit in the name and for
the use of the Borough as penalties of like amount are now recoverable.
(Ord. 810. Passed 12-8-33.)
210.02   AUTHORIZED SIGNATORIES.
   (a)   For purposes of legal documents, agreements and grant applications,
the President of Council, the Vice President of Council and the Borough Manager
or Secretary shall be authorized to sign said documents; and for purposes of
deposit and/or withdrawal of Borough funds, the President, Vice President,
Borough Secretary and Borough Treasurer shall be authorized to sign. All
authorizations will be in effect until such authority is rescinded in writing.

signatures (President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer) shall be required
to negotiate such transactions.
(Res. 2000-1. Passed 1-17-00.)
210.03   COMPLIANCE WITH RIGHT-TO-KNOW LAW.
   (a)   The purpose of this policy is to assure compliance with the
Pennsylvania Right-to-Know Law, 65 P.S. § 66.1 et seq., as amended, to provide
access to the public records of the Borough, to preserve the integrity of
Borough records, and to minimize the financial impact to the residents of the
Borough regarding the resources utilized in the receipt and processing of
public record requests and the retrieval and copying of public records.
   (b)   It is the policy of the Borough to require the presence of a
designated employee when public records are examined and inspected and to
charge reasonable fees for duplication of public records of the Borough. The
Borough has designated the Borough Manager as responsible for assuring
compliance with the Pennsylvania Right-to-Know Law, according to the following
guidelines:
      (1)   The Borough may designate certain employee(s) to process public
records requests.
      (2)   The Borough Manager shall be responsible for minimizing, where
possible, the financial impact to the Borough regarding the resources utilized
in the receipt and processing of public record requests and the retrieval and
copying of public records.
      (3)   All requests for public records of the Borough under this policy
shall be specific in identifying an describing each public record requested. In
no case shall the Borough be required to create a public record which does not
exist or to compile, maintain, format or organize a public record in a manner
in which the Borough does not currently compile, maintain, format or organize
the public record. All requests for public records shall be submitted in
writing and on a form provided by the Borough, as shown below, entitled "Public
Record Review/Duplication Request Form".
      (4)   The designated employee shall make the good faith effort to
determine whether each record requested is a public record.
      (5)   The Borough shall facilitate a reasonable response to a request for
Borough public records. In no case is the Borough expected to provide
extraordinary staff to respond to a request, but will respond in a manner
consistent with Borough administrative responsibilities and consistent with the
requirements of the Pennsylvania Right-to-Know Law.
      (6)   The designated employee shall respond to the requester within five
business days from the date of receipt of the written request. If the Borough
does not respond within five business days of receipt thereof, the request is
deemed denied.
      (7)   The response provided by the Borough shall consist of:
         A.   Approval for access to the public record;
         B.   Review of the request by the designated employee; or
         C.   Denial of access to the record requested.
      (8)   If access to the public record requested is approved, the public
record shall be available for access during the regular business hours of the
Borough. The designated employee shall cooperate fully with the requester,
while also taking reasonable measures to protect the Borough public records
from the possibility of theft and/or modification. The presence of a designated
employee is required when public records are examined and inspected.
      (9)   Fees for duplication of public records shall be as follows:
         A.   Photocopying: Twenty-five cents ($0.25) per page;
         B.   Duplication of public electronic and/or tape records: Actual cost
to the Borough of duplicating the public record;
         C.   Certified copies: One dollar ($1.00) per page; and
         D.   Postage: Actual cost to the Borough of mailing the public record.
         The Borough may, in its discretion, waive fees.
      (10)   In the event the estimated cost of fulfilling a request submitted
under this policy is expected to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
designated employee(s) shall obtain 50 percent of the expected cost in advance
of fulfilling the request to avoid unwarranted expense of Borough resources.
      (11)   If the request is being reviewed, the notice provided by the
Borough shall be in writing and include the reason for the review and the
expected response date, which shall be within 30 days of the notice of review.
If the Borough does not respond within 30 days thereof, the request is deemed
denied. Review of the request is limited situations where:
         A.   The record requested contains information which is subject to
access, as well as information which is not subject to access that must be
redacted prior to a grant of access. The redacted information is considered a
denial as to that information;
         B.   The record requires retrieval from a remote location;
         C.   A timely response is necessary to determined whether a record
requested is a public record;

to do all other necessary things to effectuate coverage of employees and
officers under the Old Age and Survivors Insurance System.
   (c)   Payroll Deduction System; Matching Borough Payments. The Secretary/
Treasurer is hereby authorized to establish a system of payroll deductions, to
be matched by payments by the Borough, to be made into the Contribution Fund of
the Social Security Act through the office of the State Agency, and to make
charges of this tax to the fund or funds from which wage or salary payments are
issued to employees and officers of the Borough. Such payments are to be made

until such time as payments are made.
   (d)   Appropriation Into Contribution Fund; Date Participation Commences.
Appropriation is hereby made from the proper fund or funds of the Borough in
the necessary amount to pay into the Contribution Fund, as provided in Section
4 of the enabling Act and in accordance with the plan or plans and agreement.
Authority is hereby given to the President of Council and the Secretary/
Treasurer to enter into an agreement with the State Agency, which agreement
shall be in accordance with Act No. 491 and with paragraph 218 of the Social
Security Act. Such plan and agreement shall provide that the participation of
the Borough shall commence as of January 1, 1951.
(Ord. 1207. Passed 6-6-52.)

nonetheless participate in the retirement plan outlined below, provided that he
or she will have completed ten years or more of service at the time of his or
her mandatory retirement.
   (b)   Funding of Plan. The retirement plan will be funded as follows:
      (1)   The employee or appointee shall contribute four percent of his or
her wages or salary.
      (2)   The Borough shall contribute a sum equal to that contributed by the
employee or appointee.
   (c)   Payment to Employees or Appointees Leaving Before Mandatory
Retirement. If the employee or appointee leaves the employ of the Borough prior
to mandatory retirement, he or she shall receive the amount of his or her
contribution to the retirement plan plus interest.
   (d)   Payment to Employees or Appointees Remaining Until Mandatory
Retirement. If the employee or appointee remains in the employ of the Borough
until mandatory retirement, he or she shall receive the amount of his or her
contribution, the amount of the contribution paid by the Borough and all
interest thereon.
(Ord. 1822. Passed 12-22-76.)
290.04   COMPLIANCE OF EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS WITH INTERNAL REVENUE CODE.
   In order for employee benefit plans to comply with Section 89 of the
Internal Revenue Code, the following steps shall be taken:
   (a)   Ensure that each plan is in writing prior to the end of the plan year
beginning on or after January 1, 1989.
   (b)   Ensure that employees' rights under each plan are legally enforceable.
   (c)   Provide employees with reasonable notification of their benefits under
each plan.
   (d)   Maintain each plan for the exclusive benefit of employees and their
dependents.

Borough is required to pay all claims incurred under each plan.
   (f)   Test the benefit plan(s) for discrimination and report any appropriate
excess values to the Internal Revenue Service.
(Res. 1989-3. Passed 1-16-89.)
290.05   DEFERRED COMPENSATION.
   The U.S. Conference of Mayors' Deferred Compensation Program and its
attendant investment options are hereby adopted and established as the Borough
of Ellwood City Deferred Compensation Plan for the voluntary participation of
all eligible Borough employees, elected officials and independent contractors.
The Secretary/Treasurer is hereby authorized to execute for the Borough
individual participation agreements with each said employee requesting the
same, to act as the Administrator of the Plan, representing the Borough, and to
execute such agreements and contracts as are necessary to implement the
Program. It is implicitly understood that other than the incidental expenses of
collecting and disbursing the employee's deferrals and other minor
administrative matters, there is to be no cost to the Borough for the Program.
(Res. 1995-16. Passed 8-23-95.)
290.06    SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY.
   (a)   Sexual Harassment Prohibited. It is the policy of the Borough of
Ellwood City to maintain a working and learning environment free from sexual
harassment. Sexual harassment is hereby prohibited. Any employee of the Borough
who engages in conduct which constitutes sexual harassment as defined in this
Policy shall be subject to discipline up to and including discharge. Any
employee of the Borough who is subjected to sexual harassment in the course of
his or her employment or as a result of his or her employment with the Borough
of Ellwood City shall have the right to file a complaint under this Policy.
   (b)   Sexual Harassment Defined. Sexual harassment is a form of sex
discrimination prohibited by Titles VII and IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
as amended, and the Pennsylvania Human Relation Act. The following behavior
constitutes prohibited sexual harassment for purposes of this Policy:
      (1)   Unwelcome sexual advances;
      (2)   Requests for sexual favors; or
      (3)   Other unwelcome verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature,
where:
         A.   Submission to such conduct is explicitly or implicitly required
of the recipient;
         B.   Submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as the basis
of work-related decisions affecting the recipient; or
         C.   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably
interfering with the recipient's work or school performance or of creating an
intimidating, hostile, or offensive working or learning environment.
   (c)   Consequences of Violation of Policy. Any employee of the Borough of
Ellwood City who is found to have engaged in conduct constituting sexual
harassment may be subject to discipline up to and including discharge. The
results of any disciplinary action taken will be placed in the employee's
personnel file. The employee may reply, in writing, to any charges or
discipline taken and to include such reply in the personnel file.
   In addition, any employee found to have violated this Policy may be required
to participate in educational or training activities, counseling, or mediation,
as a condition of continued employment. Determination of the appropriate
disciplinary sanction or educational or conciliatory requirements shall be
based upon the circumstances of the individual case, considering the following
factors, among others: the severity of the misconduct; the pervasiveness or
persistence of the misconduct; the effect of such misconduct on the victim or
victims; and the intent of the perpetrator.
   (d)   Complaint Procedure.
      (1)   The Personnel Committee of Council is hereby designated as the
Sexual Harassment Liaison. It shall be the responsibility of the Liaison to
promptly and thoroughly investigate any and all sexual harassment complaints
received or referred by other Borough staff, and make recommendations to the
Borough Council based upon that investigation.
      (2)   The Personnel Committee of Council shall receive sexual harassment
complaints from staff. Each year, staff and employees shall be notified that
the Borough Manager is available to receive sexual harassment complaints,
answer questions concerning sexual harassment, and assist in resolving problems
which may involve sexual harassment.
      (3)   Employees may lodge sexual harassment complaints with other
appropriate individuals in the Borough. The staff may lodge complaints with
their supervisors, with the Borough Sexual Harassment Liaison, or through their
union representatives. All sexual harassment complaints so lodged shall be
promptly and thoroughly investigated.
      (4)   In the case of sexual harassment complaints lodged by an employee
with his or her department head, at the complainant's request, the department
head will attempt to resolve the problem informally. If an informal resolution,
satisfactory to the complainant, is reached, no further investigation or action
by the Borough is required.
      (5)   All other complaints not informally resolved to the complainant's
satisfaction shall be referred to the Sexual Harassment Liaison, which shall
immediately initiate an investigation, which shall include, but not be limited
to, the following:
         A.   Interview of the complainant;
         B.   Interview of the accused; and
         C.   Interview of any other persons with personal knowledge of the
allegations of the complaint. All employees involved in such an investigation
shall maintain strict confidentiality.
   (e)   Disposition of Complaint.
      (1)   In all cases investigated by the Borough Sexual Harassment Liaison,
the results of the investigation shall be reported in writing to Borough
Council, to the complainant and to the accused. Such report shall include a
conclusion and a summary of facts upon which such conclusion is based, and a
recommendation as to remediation, if appropriate.
      (2)   If the Sexual Harassment Liaison concludes that unlawful sexual
harassment has occurred, Borough Council shall determine the appropriate
remediation and/or discipline. Any disciplinary action shall be subject to
limitations of the Borough Code and other applicable law.
      (3)   If the Sexual Harassment Liaison concludes that no unlawful sexual
harassment has occurred, the Borough Council, the complainant and the accused
shall be so notified. Under no circumstances shall any record of a complaint
which is found to be without basis be released to any person other than the
complainant, the accused, and the Borough Council, without consent of the
accused, except by an order of court.
       (4)   If the investigation is inconclusive, the Liaison shall so state
in its report. The Borough Council, at its discretion, may order the
complainant and the accused to participate in nondisciplinary remediation,
including, but not limited to, meetings, training, counseling or mediation.
Under no circumstances shall an accused or a complainant be disciplined based
upon an inconclusive investigation.
      (5)   If the Sexual Harassment Liaison concludes that the accused is not
guilty of unlawful sexual harassment, and that the complaint was lodged in bad
faith, then Borough Council may impose appropriate discipline on the
complainant, subject to the limitations of the law and applicable collective
bargaining agreements. In addition, if the Sexual Harassment Liaison concludes
that the accused retaliated against the complainant in any way because of the
complaint, Borough Council may impose appropriate discipline on the accused,
subject to the law and applicable collective bargaining agreements.
   (f)   Guidelines for Investigating Sexual Harassment Complaints. Individuals
vested with responsibility for investigating staff and student sexual
harassment complaints are called upon to exercise independent judgment in
determining the appropriate procedure to follow, within the confines of due
process and collective bargaining agreement protections. The following
guidelines are intended to assist the investigator in conducting such an
investigation.
      (1)   The complainant should be encouraged to tell his or her story in a
private setting, accompanied by a union representative, if desired. The
investigator should attempt to elicit specific facts from the complainant,
including the identity of the alleged harasser, the time and place of the
incident or incidents complained of, or other possible victims of harassment.
      (2)   If the accused is represented by a union, he or she should have the
opportunity to bring a union representative to the interview. The accused
should be informed of the specific charges against him or her and should be
allowed to fully explain his or her version of the incident. If the complainant
is an adult, he or she should ordinarily be identified. The investigator should
also bear in mind that an accused has a right to be informed as to the identity
of his or her accuser before discipline is imposed.
      (3)   The investigator should interview any witnesses with actual
knowledge of the incident(s) complained of. Such witnesses should be instructed
to refrain from discussing the investigation with others.
      (4)   The investigator should interview any other individuals who may
have been subject to harassment by the accused. The investigator shall keep in
mind that the more people interviewed, the greater the likelihood of damaging
gossip; therefore, the investigator should interview only those individuals who
the investigator has reason to believe may have been subject to harassment by
the accused. The investigator should instruct such individuals to refrain from
discussing the investigation with others.
      (5)   To the extent practical, the investigator should refrain from
sharing details of the complaint allegations with witnesses.
      (6)   Severe sexual harassment may constitute sexual abuse or sexual
assault. The investigator should alert the accused to the fact that the
harassment complained of may constitute a crime, and advise him or her that a
criminal complaint can be filed with the police or the district attorney.
(Res. 1998-12. Passed 8-17-98.)

participant's monthly normal retirement benefit determined in accordance with
Section
292.04(a), which amount shall be based upon the participant's final monthly
average compensation and credited service determined as of such computation
date and which shall represent the monthly benefit which would be payable in
the normal form as of the participant's attainment of normal retirement age,
provided that the participant shall satisfy all requirements pursuant to the

   In no event, however, shall the accrued benefit exceed the maximum

Compensation shall be limited on an annual basis, for the purposes of this
Plan, to the amount specified in accordance with Code Section 401(a)(17), as

thereof, not to exceed five years, to any member of the Plan who was not

(Ord. 2224. Passed 12-29-97.)
   (b)   Employer Contributions. The employer shall contribute to the Plan the
amount determined by the Plan's actuary and certified by the Chief

292.12(b). The contributions of the employer for a given year may be reduced by
other contributions to the Plan, including, but not limited to, employee

   (c)   State Aid Contributions. Payments of general Municipal pension system
State aid, or any other amount of State aid payments in accordance with the
Act, which are received by the employer and deposited into the Pension Fund,
shall be used to the extent permitted pursuant to the Act to reduce the
unfunded liability or, after such liability has been funded, to apply against
the annual obligation of the employer for future service costs or, to the
extent that the payment may be in excess of such obligation, to reduce employee
contributions hereunder.
   (d)   Gifts. To the extent permitted by law, the Plan Administrator may
accept gifts, outright or in trust, for deposit into the Pension Fund. The
application of such gifts shall be governed by the rules of the Plan and such
directions prescribed by the donor as are not inconsistent with the rules of
the Plan and applicable law. Such gifts shall be applied in the same manner as
State aid contributions.
   (e)   Use or Diversion of Assets. At no time shall it be possible for the
Plan assets to be used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than for the
exclusive benefit of the participants and their beneficiaries, except that
contributions made by the employer may be returned to the employer if the
contribution was made due to a mistake of fact and the contribution is returned
within one year of the mistaken payment of the contribution, or the Plan is
terminated, as provided in Section
292.11.
(Ord. 2138. Passed 3-15-93.)
292.04   RETIREMENT BENEFITS.
   (a)   Normal Retirement. A participant who retires upon attainment of normal
retirement age shall be entitled to receive a monthly retirement benefit, in an
amount equal to 1.3 percent of the participant's final monthly average
compensation multiplied by the participant's credited service paid in the
normal form, commencing on the first day of the month coincident with or next
following the date of retirement.
(Ord. 2224. Passed 12-29-97.)
   (b)   Early Retirement. A participant who terminates employment after
attaining early retirement age, but prior to attainment of normal retirement
age, shall be entitled to a monthly retirement benefit, commencing on the first
day of any month prior to the date on which attainment of normal retirement age
would occur if the participant continued in employment until such date, in an
amount equal to the participant's accrued benefit at the date of termination of
employment, paid in the normal form actuarially reduced for early commencement.
Such actuarial reduction for early commencement shall be in an amount equal to
one-half of one percent for each month that the payment commencement date
precedes the date the participant would attain normal retirement age.
   (c)   Late Retirement. A participant who retires after the first day of the
month coincident with or next following the date on which normal retirement age
has been attained shall receive a retirement benefit pursuant to subsection (a)
hereof in an amount equal to the amount calculated as of the date on which
actual retirement occurs.
   (d)   Disability Retirement. A participant who has incurred a total and
permanent disability, which causes such participant to cease active employment
with the employer before the attainment of normal or early retirement age,
shall be eligible to receive a disability retirement benefit under this Plan.
The disability retirement benefit shall be in an amount equal to the
participant's accrued benefit determined as of the date of disability. The
disability retirement benefit shall be paid monthly until the earliest of the
death of the participant or cessation of total and permanent disability.
   The employer may require proof of continued disability, but not more
frequently than once in any twelve-month period. Any participant who refuses to
submit to a medical examination or furnish proof of continued disability upon
the request of the employer shall cease to be eligible for receipt of a
disability retirement benefit. A participant who does not resume employment
upon cessation of total and permanent disability shall be deemed to have
terminated employment as of the date the total and permanent disability
commenced, and any benefits due pursuant to Section
292.06 shall be reduced by the value of the benefits received hereunder.
   (e)   Application for Benefit. A participant must complete and execute an
application for benefit, on a form and in the manner prescribed by the Plan
Administrator, and deliver the said application to the Plan Administrator at
least thirty days prior to the date on which benefit payments are to commence.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no retirement
benefit payments or any other benefit payments shall be due or payable on or
before the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date
that is thirty days after the date the Plan Administrator receives the
application for benefit.
   (f)   Non-Duplication of Benefit. A participant who shall be receiving a
monthly retirement benefit under this Plan, and who shall resume employment as
an employee, shall have benefit payments suspended until the first day of the
month coincident with or next following the date such employment shall cease.
Such benefit payments shall be adjusted to reflect any additional years of
credited service which may have accrued prior to the resumption of payment of
benefits.
   (g)   Small Amounts. If the Plan Administrator determines that the value of
a participant's accrued benefit is so small as to make monthly pension payments
administratively impractical, the Plan Administrator may cause such payments to
be made at such other periodic intervals as are administratively practical, but
no less frequently than annually, or may make a single lump sum payment equal
to the commuted value of such accrued benefit to the extent permitted under
applicable law.
   (h)   Cessation of Benefit Payments. Any pension benefit payable hereunder
shall be payable through and including the later of the month in which such
participant's death occurs or the month in which any period certain payments
due on or after the participant's death have been paid. Any survivor annuity
payable on or after the participant's death, in accordance with the form of
pension benefit elected, shall be paid through the month in which such
surviving annuitant's death occurs.
   (i)   Special Provision for Restated Plans. The benefit amount of any
participant who may have retired prior to the restatement date shall not be in
any way altered by the provisions of this Plan, except where otherwise
expressly indicated herein, and shall continue to be determined on the basis of
the terms of the Plan in effect on the day preceding the restatement date.
   (j)   Maximum Benefit Limitations.
      (1)   Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, no
benefit provided under this Plan attributable to contributions of the employer
shall exceed, as an annual amount, the lesser of:
         A.   The amount specified in Code Section 415(b)(1)(A), as adjusted
pursuant to Code Section 415(d), assuming the form of benefit shall be a
straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits); or
         B.   One hundred percent of the participant's average compensation for
the participant's high three years.
      (2)   The limitations described in paragraph (j)(1) hereof shall be
governed by the following conditions and definitions:
         A.   "Compensation" shall include the participant's wages, salaries
and fees for personal services actually rendered in employment, to the extent
that the amounts are includable in gross income, and shall exclude
contributions made by the employer to a plan of deferred compensation, to the
extent that, before the application of Code Section 415 limitations to that
plan, the contributions are not includable in the gross income of the employee
for the taxable year in which contributed; exclude distributions from a
qualified plan of deferred compensation; and exclude other amounts which
receive special tax benefits, such as premiums for group term life insurance,
to the extent not includable in the gross income of the employee, or
contributions made by the employer (whether made under a salary reduction
agreement or not) to the purchase of an annuity contract pursuant to Code
Section 403(b).
         B.   Benefits paid or payable in a form other than a straight life
annuity (with no ancillary benefits), or where the employee contributes to the
Plan or makes rollover contributions, shall be adjusted on an actuarially
equivalent basis to determine the limitation contained herein.
         C.   In the case of a benefit which commences prior to the attainment
of age sixty-two by the participant, the limitation set forth in paragraph (j)
(1)A. hereof shall be adjusted on an actuarially equivalent basis to the amount
determined pursuant to paragraph (j)(1)A. hereof commencing at age sixty-two.
However, the reduction shall not reduce the limitation below seventy-five
thousand dollars ($75,000) for a benefit commencing at or after age fifty-five,
or, if the benefit commences prior to the attainment of age fifty-five, the
amount which is actuarially equivalent to a benefit of seventy-five thousand
dollars ($75,000) commencing at age fifty-five.
         D.   In the case of a benefit which commences after the attainment of
age sixty-five by the participant, the limitation set forth in paragraph (j)
(1)A. hereof shall be adjusted on an actuarially equivalent basis to the amount
determined pursuant to paragraph (j)(1)A. hereof commencing at age sixty-five.
         E.   Benefits paid to a participant which total less than ten thousand
dollars ($10,000) from all defined benefit plans maintained by the employer,
expressed as an annual benefit, shall be deemed not to exceed the limitation of
this section, provided that the employer has not, at any time, maintained a
defined contribution plan in which the participant has participated. However,
in the case of a participant with fewer than ten years of participation, the
limitation expressed in this paragraph shall be reduced by one-tenth for each
year of participation less than ten, but in no event shall this limitation be
less than one thousand dollars ($1,000).
         F.   The limitations expressed herein shall be based upon Plan years
for calculation purposes, shall be applied to all defined benefit plans
maintained by the employer as one defined benefit plan and to all defined
contribution plans maintained by the employer as one defined contribution plan,
and shall be applied and interpreted, consistent with Code Section 415 and
regulations thereunder, as applicable to government plans in general and this
Plan in particular.

   (k)   Additional Benefits for Qualified Participants. A "participant" who
attains a normal retirement, early retirement, late retirement, disability
retirement or a payable death benefit, or terminates on or after January 1,
2000, shall be entitled to receive an additional monthly retirement benefit
provided that they had contributed an extra one percent from gross earnings
from their date of hire until January 5, 1998, at which time an ordinance was
changed that authorized all members to contribute the same percentage and
further granted retirement eligibility upon completion of twenty years of
credited service. Furthermore, only those qualifying participants who retire
after January 1, 2000, shall be entitled to an additional benefit to be
determined by accumulating the excess employee contributions with interest
until the date of retirement and calculating the actuarial equivalent annuity
benefit in accordance with Section
292.01 of the Plan.

   (b)   Commencement of Benefits. A participant may elect to commence

         B.   Over a period beginning not later than the required beginning
date and extending over the life of such participant or over the lives of such
participant and a designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond
the life expectancy of such participant, or the joint life expectancies of such
participant and a designated beneficiary).
         If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this Plan dies
prior to the date when his or her entire interest has been distributed to him
or her after distribution of his or her benefits has begun in accordance with
paragraph (c)(1)B. hereof, the remaining portion of such benefit shall be
distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used
under paragraph (c)(1)B. hereof as of the date of his or her death.
      (2)   If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this Plan dies
before distribution of his or her benefit has begun, the entire interest of
such employee shall be distributed within five years of the death of such
employee, unless the following sentence is applicable: If any portion of the
employee's interest is payable to (or for the benefit of) a designated
beneficiary, such portion shall be distributed over the life of such designated
beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such
beneficiary), and such distributions begin not later than one year after the
date of the employee's death or such later date as provided by regulations
issued by the Secretary of the Treasury, then for purposes of the five-year
rule set forth in the preceding sentence, the benefit payable to the
beneficiary shall be treated as distributed on the date on which such
distributions begin. However, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the
designated beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the participant, then the
date on which distributions are required to begin shall not be earlier than the
date upon which the employee would have attained age seventy and one-half.
Further, if the surviving spouse dies before the distributions to such spouse
begin, this paragraph shall be applied as if the surviving spouse were the
employee.
      (3)   For purposes of this subsection, the following definitions and

permitted under regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury).
         D.   The life expectancy of an employee and/or an employee's spouse
(other than in the case of a life annuity) may be redetermined, but not more
frequently than annually.
   (d)   Personal Right of Participant. Each participant's right to receive any
benefits hereunder is personal and expires on such participant's death. No
heir, legatee, devisee, beneficiary, assignee or other person claiming by or

whose employment with the employer ceased for any reason other than death or
disability prior to the attainment of an early or normal retirement age shall
only be entitled to receive a distribution of accumulated contributions. Upon
receipt of such accumulated contributions, said participant and his or her
beneficiary shall not be entitled to any further payments from the Plan.
   (c)   Forfeiture. A participant who terminates employment with the employer,
at a time when not vested in any portion of the accrued benefit derived from
employer contributions, shall cease to be a participant hereunder and shall not

have the accumulated contributions distributed to the beneficiary of the
participant if the participant dies prior to receipt of the accumulated
contributions.
   (d)   Vested Benefits. A participant who has completed at least ten years of
service shall become vested in his or he accrued benefits. If the participant

      (6)   To prepare and distribute, in such manner as may be required by law
or as the Administrator deems appropriate, information explaining the Plan;
      (7)   To require from the employer or any participant such information as
shall be necessary for the proper administration of the Plan; and
      (8)   To appoint and retain any individual to assist in the
administration of the Plan, including such legal, clerical, accounting and
actuarial services as may be required by any applicable law or laws.
   The Plan Administrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from or
modify the terms of the Plan or to change or add to any benefits provided by
the Plan, or to waive or fail to apply any requirements of eligibility for
benefits under the Plan. Further, the Plan Administrator shall have no power to
adopt, amend or terminate the Plan, to select or appoint any trustee or to
determine or require any contributions to the Plan, said powers being
exclusively reserved to Council.
   (d)   Organization of Pension Plan Committee. The Pension Plan Committee, if
one is appointed, may organize itself in any manner deemed appropriate to
effectuate its purposes hereunder, subject to the following:
      (1)   The Committee shall act by a majority of its members at the time in
office and such action may be taken either by vote at a meeting or in writing
without a meeting.
      (2)   The Committee shall, from time to time, appoint a Chairperson, a
Secretary, who may be, but need not be, a Committee member, and such other
agents as it may deem advisable.
      (3)   The Committee may, from time to time, authorize any one or more of
its members to execute any document or documents, including any application,
request, certificate, notice, consent, waiver or direction, and shall notify
Council, in writing, of the name or names of the member or members so
authorized. In the absence of a designation, the Chairperson shall be deemed to
be so authorized. Any trustee or other fiduciary appointed hereunder shall
accept and be fully protected in relying upon any document executed by the
designated member or members (or the Chairperson in the absence of a
designation) as representing a valid action by the Committee until the
Committee files with such fiduciary a written revocation of such designation.
      (4)   The Committee or its delegate shall maintain and keep such records
as are necessary for the efficient operation of the Plan or as may be required
by any applicable law, regulation or ruling and shall provide for the
preparation and filing of such forms or reports as may be required to be filed
with any governmental agency or department and with the participants and/or
other persons entitled to benefits under the Plan.
   (e)   Compensation and Expenses of Committee Members. The Committee members
shall each serve without compensation for services, unless otherwise agreed by
Council in writing. All reasonable expenses incident to the functioning of the
Committee, including, but not limited to, fees of accountants, counsel,
actuaries and other specialists, and other costs of administering the Plan, may
be paid from the Pension Fund upon approval by Council, to the extent permitted
under applicable law and not otherwise paid by the employer.
   (f)   Liability. No member of Council, nor the Plan Administrator, the
enrolled actuary or any other person involved in the administration of the
Plan, shall be liable to any person on account of any act or failure to act,
which is taken or omitted to be taken in good faith, in performing their
respective duties under the terms of this Plan. To the extent permitted by law,
the Borough shall, and hereby does agree to, indemnify and hold harmless each
present member of the Committee and each successor thereof and each of any such
member's heirs, executors and administrators, and the Committee's delegates and
appointees (other than any person, bank, firm or corporation which is
independent of the Borough and which renders services to the Plan for a fee),
from any and all liability and expenses, including counsel fees, reasonably
incurred in any action, suit or proceeding to which he or she is or may be made
a party by reason of being or having been a member, delegate or appointee of
the Committee, except in matters involving criminal liability or intentional or
willful misconduct. If the Borough purchases insurance to cover claims of a
nature described above, then there shall be no right of indemnification, except
to the extent of any deductible amount under the insurance coverage or to the
extent of the amount the claims exceed the insured amount.
   (g)   Approval of Benefits. The Plan Administrator shall review and approve
or deny any application for retirement benefits within thirty days following
receipt thereof or within such longer time as may be necessary under the
circumstances. Any denial of an application for retirement benefits shall be in
writing and shall specify the reason for such denial.
   (h)   Appeals. Any person whose application for retirement benefits is
denied, who questions the amount of benefit paid, who believes a benefit should
have commenced which did not so commence, or who has some other claim arising
under the Plan ("claimant"), shall first seek a resolution of such claim under
the procedure hereinafter set forth.
      (1)   Any claimant shall file a notice of the claim with the Plan
Administrator, which notice shall fully describe the nature of the claim. The
Plan Administrator shall review the claim and make an initial determination
approving or denying the claim.
      (2)   If the claim is denied, in whole or in part, the Plan Administrator
shall, within ninety days (or such other period as may be established by
applicable law) from the time the application is received, mail notice of such
denial to the claimant. Such ninety-day period may be extended by the Plan
Administrator, if special circumstances so require, for up to ninety additional
days, by the Plan Administrator's delivering notice of such extension to the
claimant within the first ninety-day period. Any notice hereunder shall be
written in a matter calculated to be understood by the claimant and, if it is a
notice of denial, shall set forth the specific Plan provisions on which the
denial is based, an explanation of additional material or information, if any,
necessary to perfect such claim and a statement of why such material or
information is necessary, and an explanation of the review procedure.
      (3)   Upon receipt of notice denying the claim, the claimant shall have
the right to request a full and fair review by Council of the initial
determination. Such request for review must be made by notice to Council within
sixty days of receipt of such notice of denial. During such review, the
claimant or a duly authorized representative shall have the right to review any
pertinent documents and to submit any issues or comments in writing. Council
shall, within sixty days after the receipt of the notice requesting such review
(or in special circumstances, such as where Council in its sole discretion
holds a hearing, within 120 days of receipt of such notice), submit its
decision, in writing, to the person or persons whose claim has been denied. The
decision shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties, shall be
written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall
contain specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the
decision is based.
      (4)   Any notice of a claim questioning the amount of a benefit in pay
status shall be filed within ninety days following the date of the first
payment which would be adjusted if the claim is granted, unless the Plan
Administrator allows a later filing for good cause shown.
      (5)   A claimant who does not submit a notice of a claim or a notice
requesting a review of a denial of a claim within the time limitations
specified above shall be deemed to have waived such claim or right to review.
(Ord. 2138. Passed 3-15-93.)
292.09   PENSION FUND.
   (a)   Operation. Council is hereby authorized to hold and supervise the
investment of the assets of the Pension Fund, subject to the provisions of the
laws of the Commonwealth and of this Plan and any amendment thereto.
   The Pension Fund shall be used to pay benefits as provided in the Plan and,
to the extent not paid directly by the employer, to pay the expenses of
administering the Plan pursuant to authorization by the employer.
   The employer intends the Plan to be permanent and for the exclusive benefit
of its employees. It expects to make the contributions to the trust required
under the Plan. The employer shall not be liable in any manner for any
insufficiency in the Pension Fund. Benefits shall be payable only from the
Pension Fund and only to the extent that there are monies available therein.
   The Pension Fund shall consist of all funds held by the employer under the
Plan, including contributions made pursuant to the provisions hereof and the
investments, reinvestments and proceeds thereof. The Pension Fund shall be
held, managed and administered pursuant to the terms of the Plan. Except as
otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, the employer has exclusive authority
and discretion to manage and control the Pension Fund assets. The employer may,
however, appoint a trustee, custodian and/or investment manager, at its sole
discretion.
   (b)   Powers and Duties of Employer. With respect to the Pension Fund, the
employer shall have the following powers, rights and duties, in addition to
those vested in it elsewhere in the Plan or by law, unless such duties are
delegated:
      (1)   To retain, in cash, so much of the Pension Fund as it deems
advisable and to deposit any cash so retained in any bank or similar financial
institution (including any such institution which may be appointed to serve as
trustee hereunder), without liability for interest thereon.
      (2)   To invest and reinvest the principal and income of the Fund and to
keep said Fund invested, without distinction between principal and income, in
securities which are, at the time, legal investments for fiduciaries under the
Pennsylvania Fiduciaries Investment Act, or as the same may be subsequently
modified or amended.
      (3)   To sell property held in the Fund, at either public or private
sale, for cash or on credit, at such times as it may deem appropriate; to
exchange such property; and to grant options for the purchase or exchange
thereof.
      (4)   To consent to and participate in any plan of reorganization,
consolidation, merger, extension or other similar plan affecting property held
in the Fund and to consent to any contract, lease, mortgage, purchase, sale or
other action by any corporation pursuant to any such plan.
      (5)   To exercise all conversion and subscription rights pertaining to
property held in the Fund.
      (6)   To exercise all voting rights with respect to property held in the
Fund and, in connection therewith, to grant proxies, discretionary or
otherwise.
      (7)   To place money, at any time, in a deposit bank deemed to be
appropriate for the purposes of this Plan, no matter where situated, including,
in those cases where a bank has been appointed to serve as trustee hereunder,
the savings department of its own commercial bank.
      (8)   To maintain and invest the assets of this Plan, on a collective and
commingled basis, with the assets of other pension plans maintained by the
employer, provided that the assets of each respective plan shall be accounted
for and administered separately.
      (9)   To invest the assets of the Pension Fund in any collective
commingled trust fund maintained by a bank or trust company, including any bank
or trust company which may act as a trustee hereunder. In this connection, the
commingling of the assets of this Plan with assets of other eligible,
participating plans through such a medium is hereby specifically authorized.
Any assets of the Plan which may be so added to such collective trusts shall be
subject to all of the provisions of the applicable declaration of trust, as
amended from time to time, which declaration, if required by its terms or by
applicable law, is hereby adopted as part of the Plan, to the extent of the
participation in such collective or commingled trust fund by the Plan.
      (10)   To make any payment or distribution required or advisable to carry
out the provisions of the Plan, provided that if a trustee is appointed by the
employer, such trustee shall make such distribution only at the direction of
the employer.
      (11)   To compromise, contest, arbitrate, enforce or abandon claims and
demands with respect to the Plan.
      (12)   To retain any funds or property subject to any dispute, without
liability for the payment of interest thereon, and to decline to make payment
or delivery thereof until final adjudication is made by a court of competent
jurisdiction.
      (13)   To pay, and to deduct from and charge against the Pension Fund,
any taxes which may be imposed thereon, whether with respect to the income,
property or transfer thereof, or upon or with respect to the interest of any
person therein, which the Fund is required to pay, and to contest, in its
discretion, the validity or amount of any tax, assessment, claim or demand
which may be levied or made against or in respect of the Pension Fund, the
income, property or transfer thereof, or in any matter or thing connected
therewith.
      (14)   To appoint any persons or firms (including, but not limited to,
accountants, investment advisors, counsel, actuaries, physicians, appraisers,
consultants, professional plan administrators and other specialists), or
otherwise act to secure specialized advise or assistance, as it deems necessary
or desirable in connection with the management of the Fund. To the extent not
prohibited by applicable law, the employer shall be entitled to rely
conclusively upon, and shall be fully protected in any action or omission taken
by it in good faith reliance upon, the advice or opinion of such persons or
firms, provided that such persons or firms were prudently chosen by the
employer, taking into account the interests of the participants and
beneficiaries and with due regard to the ability of the persons or firms to
perform their assigned functions.
      (15)   To retain the services of one or more persons or firms for the
management of (including power to acquire and dispose of) all or any part of
the Fund assets, provided that each of such persons or firms is registered as
an investment advisor under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, is a bank (as
defined in that Act), or is an insurance company qualified to manage, acquire
or dispose of pension trust assets under the law of more than one state. In
such event, the employee shall follow the directions of such investment manager
or managers, with respect to the acquisition and disposition of fund assets,
but shall not be liable for the acts or omissions of such investment manager or
managers, nor shall it be under any obligation to review or otherwise manage
any Fund assets which are subject to the management of such investment manager
or managers. If the employer appoints a trustee, the trustee shall not be
permitted to retain such an investment manager, except with the express written
consent of the employer.
   In addition to the foregoing powers, the employer shall also have all of the
powers, rights and privileges conferred upon trustees by the Pennsylvania
Fiduciaries Investment Act, or as the same may be subsequently modified or
amended, and the power to do all acts, take all proceedings and execute all
rights and privileges, although not specifically mentioned herein, as the
employer may deem necessary to administer the Pension Fund.
   (c)   Investment of Funds. The employer shall not be required to make
separate investments for individual participants or to maintain separate
investments for each participant's account, but may invest contributions and
any profits or gains therefrom in common investments.
   (d)   Compensation and Expenses of Appointed Trustee. If a trustee is
appointed, the trustee shall be entitled to such reasonable compensation as
shall from time to time be agreed upon by the employer and the trustee, unless
such compensation is prohibited by law. Such compensation, and all expenses
reasonably incurred by the trustee in carrying out his or her functions, shall
constitute a charge upon the employer or the Pension Fund, which may be
executed at any time after thirty days written notice to the employer. The
employer shall be under no obligation to pay such costs and expenses, and, in
the event of its failure to do so, the trustee shall be entitled to pay the
same, or to be reimbursed for the payment thereof, from the Pension Fund.
   (e)   Periodic Accounting of Fund. If a trustee is appointed, the Pension
Fund shall be evaluated annually, or at more frequent intervals, by the
trustee, and a written accounting rendered as of each fiscal year end of the
Fund, and as of the effective date of any removal or resignation of the
trustee, and at such additional dates as requested by the employer, showing the
condition of the Fund and all receipts, disbursements and other transactions
effected by the trustee during the period covered by the accounting, based on
fair market values prevailing as of such date.
   (f)   Value. All determinations as to the value of the assets of the Pension
Fund, and as to the amount of the liabilities thereof, shall be made by the
employer or its appointed trustee, whose decisions shall be final and
conclusive and binding on all parties thereto, the participants and
beneficiaries and their estates. In making any such determination, the employer
or trustee shall be entitled to seek and rely upon the opinion of or any
information furnished by brokers, appraisers and other experts, and shall also
be entitled to rely upon reports as to sales and quotations, both on security
exchanges and otherwise as contained in newspapers and in financial
publications.
(Ord. 2138. Passed 3-15-93.)
292.10   AMENDMENTS.
   The employer shall have the right to amend the Plan, at any time, by
adoption of the appropriate resolution or ordinance, and with respect to any
provisions thereof, and all parties thereto or claiming any interest
thereunder, shall be bound thereby, provided, however, that no amendment shall
revise the accrued benefit of a participant determined as of the later of the
date such amendment is adopted or the date such amendment becomes effective, if
such revised vested accrued benefit is less than that computed under the Plan
without regard to such amendment.
   No amendment to the Pension Plan, which provides for a benefit modification,
shall be made, unless the cost estimate described in Section
292.12(c) has been prepared and presented to the employer in accordance with
the Act.
(Ord. 2138. Passed 3-15-93.)
292.11   TERMINATION OF PLAN.
   (a)   Right to Terminate. It is the present intention of the employer to
maintain the Plan indefinitely. Nevertheless, the employer reserves the right,
at any time, to permanently discontinue further contributions to the Plan or to
terminate the entire Plan consistent with the provisions of applicable law.
   (b)   Distribution Upon Termination. In the event of the termination or
partial termination of the Plan, all amounts of benefits accrued by the
affected participants to the date of such termination, to the extent funded on
such date, shall immediately become fully vested and nonforfeitable. In the
event of termination of the Plan, the employer shall direct either that the
accrued benefits of participants in the Plan continue to be held in the Pension
Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Plan (other than those provisions
relating to forfeitures), without regard to such termination, until all funds
have been distributed in accordance with such provisions, or that distribution
be made to each participant, in an amount equal to his or her accrued benefit
as of such date, in the form of a lump sum or such other form as may be
approved by the employer.
   If there are insufficient assets in the Pension Fund to provide for all
vested accrued benefits as of the date of Plan termination, priority shall
first be given to the distribution of any amounts attributable to participant
contributions before assets are applied to the distribution of vested benefits
attributable to other sources hereunder.
   (c)   Residual Assets. If all liabilities under the Plan to participants and
others entitled to receive a benefit have been satisfied, and there remain any
residual assets in the Pension Fund, the residual assets shall be returned to
the employer, insofar as such return does not contravene any provision of law,
and any remaining balance, in excess of employer contributions, shall be
returned to the Commonwealth.
(Ord. 2138. Passed 3-15-93.)
292.12   COMPLIANCE WITH MUNICIPAL PENSION PLAN FUNDING STANDARD AND RECOVERY
ACT OF 1984.
   (a)   Actuarial Valuations. The Plan's actuary shall perform an actuarial
valuation at least biennially, unless the employer is applying or has applied
for supplemental State assistance pursuant to Section 603 of the Act, whereupon
actuarial valuation reports shall be made annually.
   Such biennial actuarial valuation report shall be made as of the beginning
of each Plan year occurring in an odd-numbered calendar year, beginning with
the year 1985.
   Such actuarial valuation shall be prepared and certified by an approved
actuary, as such term is defined in the Act.
   The expenses attributable to the preparation of any actuarial valuation
report or experience investigation required by the Act, or any other expenses
which are permissible under the terms of the Act and which are directly
associated with administering the Plan, shall be allowable administrative
expenses, payable from the assets of the Pension Fund. Such allowable expenses
shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
      (1)   Investment costs associated with obtaining authorized investments
and investment management fees;
      (2)   Accounting expenses;
      (3)   Premiums for insurance coverage on Fund assets;
      (4)   Reasonable and necessary counsel fees incurred for advice or to
defend the Fund; and
      (5)   Legitimate travel and education expense for Plan officials,
provided, however, that the Municipal officials of the employer, in their
fiduciary role, shall monitor the services provided to the Plan to ensure that
the expenses are necessary and reasonable and benefit the Plan, and provided,
further, that the Plan Administrator shall document all such expenses item by
item and, where necessary, hour by hour.
   (b)   Duties of Chief Administrative Officer. Such actuarial reports shall
be prepared and filed under the supervision of the Chief Administrative
Officer.
   The Chief Administrative Officer of the Plan shall determine the financial
requirements of the Plan on the basis of the most recent actuarial report and
shall determine the minimum Municipal obligation of the employer, with respect
to funding the Plan, for any given Plan year. The Chief Administrative Officer
shall submit the financial requirements of the Plan and the minimum Municipal
obligation of the employer to the governing body of the employer annually and
shall certify the accuracy of such calculations and their conformity with the
Act.
   (c)   Benefit Plan Modifications. Prior to the adoption of any benefit plan
modification by the employer, the Chief Administrative Officer of the Plan
shall provide to the employer a cost estimate of the proposed benefit plan
modification. Such estimate shall be prepared by an approved actuary, which
estimate shall disclose to the employer the impact of the proposed benefit plan
modification on the future financial requirements of the Plan and the future
minimum Municipal obligation of the employer with respect to the Plan.
(Ord. 2138. Passed 3-15-93.)
292.13   INCAPACITY OF PARTICIPANT.
   If any participant shall be physically or mentally incapable of receiving or
acknowledging receipt of any payment of pension benefits hereunder, the
employer, upon the receipt of satisfactory evidence that such participant is so
incapacitated and that another person or institution is maintaining him or her
and that no guardian or committee has been appointed for him or her, may
provide for such payment of pension benefits hereunder to such person or
institution so maintaining him or her, and any such payment so made shall be
deemed for every purpose to have been made to such participant. (Ord. 2138.
Passed 3-15-93.)
292.14   BENEFITS FOR DECEASED PARTICIPANTS.
   If any benefit shall be payable under the Plan to or on behalf of a
participant who has died, if the Plan provides that the payment of such
benefits shall be made to the participant's estate, and if no administration of
such participant's estate is pending in a court of proper jurisdiction, then
the employer at its sole option, may pay such benefit to the surviving spouse
of such deceased participant, or, if there is no such surviving spouse, to such
participant's then living issue, per stirpes, provided, however, that nothing
contained herein shall prevent the employer from insisting upon the
commencement of estate administration proceedings and the delivery of any such
benefits to a duly appointed executor or administrator.
(Ord. 2138. Passed 3-15-93.)
292.15   LIABILITY OF OFFICERS OF EMPLOYER.
   Subject to the provisions of the Act, no past, present or future officer of
the employer shall be personally liable to any participant, beneficiary or
other person under any provision of the Plan or any policy issued pursuant
thereto.
(Ord. 2138. Passed 3-15-93.)
292.16   INTEREST IN OR RIGHT TO ASSETS OF FUND.
   Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to give any participant or
beneficiary any interest in any specific property of the Pension Fund or any
right thereto, except to receive such distributions as are expressly provided
for in this Plan.
(Ord. 2138. Passed 3-15-93.)
292.17   EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS.
   Participation in this Plan shall not give any right to any employee to be
retained in the employ of the employer, nor shall it interfere with the right
of the employer to discharge any employee and to deal with him or her without
regard to the effect that such treatment might have upon him or her as a
participant in this Plan.
(Ord. 2138. Passed 3-15-93.)
292.18   USE AND BENEFIT OF INCOME AND PRINCIPAL OF FUND.
   The income and principal of the Pension Fund are for the sole use and
benefit of the participants in this Plan, and, to the extent permitted by law,
shall be free, clear and discharged of and from, and are not to be in any way
liable for, debts, contracts or agreements, now contracted or which may
hereafter be contracted, and from all claims and liabilities now or hereafter
incurred by any participant or beneficiary.
(Ord. 2138. Passed 3-15-93.)
292.19   FURNISHING OF INFORMATION BY EMPLOYER.
   The employer shall furnish to the Plan Administrator, and, where applicable,
the trustee, information in the employer's possession as the Plan Administrator
and the trustee shall require from time to time to perform their duties under
the Plan.
(Ord. 2138. Passed 3-15-93.)
292.20   ASSIGNMENT OF PAYMENTS.
   To the extent permitted by law, no payments to any person under any
contract, nor the right to receive such payments, nor any interest in the Plan
and the Pension Fund, shall be subject to assignment, alienation, transfer or
anticipation, either by voluntary or involuntary act of any participant or
beneficiary or by operation of law, nor shall such payment right or interest be
subject to the demand or claims of any such person's debts, obligations or
liabilities.

Ch. 250
294.01   DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   For purposes of this Plan, the masculine shall be read for the
feminine, and the singular shall be read for the plural, wherever the person or
context shall plainly so require.
   (b)   The following words and phrases, as used in this Plan, shall have the
meanings set forth in this subsection, unless a different meaning is otherwise
clearly required by the context:
      (1)   "Accrued benefit" means, as of any given date, the benefit
determined under Section
294.04(b), calculated on the basis of final monthly average salary as of the
date of determination and multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which
shall be the participant's aggregate service determined as of such date and the
denominator of which shall be the projected aggregate service of the
participant as if the participant continues in employment until attainment of
normal retirement age. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, in no event shall the fraction exceed one. The accrued benefit shall
include any service increment determined pursuant to Section
294.04(d) attributable to the participant's aggregate service as of the
determination date.
         In no event, however, shall the accrued benefit exceed the maximum
limitation, determined as of the date of computation, provided under Section
294.04(g). All accrued benefits are subject to all applicable limitations,
reductions, offsets and actuarial adjustments provided pursuant to the terms of
this Plan prior to the actual payment thereof.
      (2)   "Accumulated contributions" means the total amount contributed by
any participant to this Fund or its predecessor by way of payroll deduction or
otherwise, plus interest credited at three and one-half percent per annum.
Interest shall be credited, in the form of a simple interest rate, from the
midpoint of the Plan year during which the contributions were paid to the first
day of the month preceding the date that a distribution of accumulated
contributions under Sections
294.06(c) and
294.07(b) shall be paid or payment of benefits shall commence. Solely for the
purpose of making a distribution of accumulated contribution under Section
294.06(c), interest shall be credited at six percent per annum.
      (3)   "Act" means the Municipal Pension Plan Funding Standard and
Recovery Act, which was enacted as Act 205 of 1984, as amended, 53 P.S. 895.101
et seq.
      (4)   "Actuarial equivalent" means two forms of payment of equal
actuarial present value on a specified date. The actuarial present value shall
be determined by use of the UP-1984 Mortality Table and seven percent interest,
unless otherwise specifically provided herein.
      (5)   "Actuary" means the person, partnership, association or corporation
which, at any given time, is serving as actuary, provided that such actuary
must be an "approved actuary," as defined in the Act.
      (6)   "Aggregate service" means the total period or periods of the
participant's employment with the employer, whether or not interrupted.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, should any such participant receive a
distribution of accumulated contributions which must be maintained in the Plan
with respect to a period of employment, such period of employment shall not be
included in aggregate service thereafter unless, at the commencement of the
next period of employment, the participant repays to the Fund the amount of
such distribution, with interest. For purposes of this paragraph, interest
shall accrue as of the date the employee receives a distribution of accumulated
contributions and shall be computed at the same rate and in the same manner as
described in paragraph (b)(2) hereof.
      (7)   "Beneficiary" means the person or other entity designated by the
participant to receive a distribution of the participant's accumulated
contributions should the participant die prior to becoming entitled to a
retirement benefit. If a participant does not designate a beneficiary or the
beneficiary does not survive the participant, the beneficiary shall be the
surviving spouse, or if there is no surviving spouse, the issue, per stirpes,
or if there is no surviving issue, the estate, but if no personal
representative has been appointed, the beneficiary shall be those persons who
would be entitled to the estate under the intestacy laws of the Commonwealth if
the participant had died intestate and a resident of the Commonwealth.

294.04   RETIREMENT BENEFITS.
   (a)   Normal Retirement. Each participant shall be entitled to normal
retirement benefits after retirement on or after the participant has attained
normal retirement age.
   (b)   Normal Retirement Benefit. Each participant who becomes entitled to a
benefit pursuant to subsection (a) hereof shall receive a benefit paid monthly
in an amount equal to fifty percent of the participant's final monthly average
salary, as determined herein.
   (c)   Late Retirement. A participant may continue to work beyond the
attainment of normal retirement age, subject to the employer's rules and
regulations regarding retirement age. If a participant who has met the
requirements of subsection (a) hereof continues to work beyond normal
retirement age, there shall be no retirement benefits paid until employment
ceases and retirement begins. The retirement benefit of a participant who
retires after the attainment of normal retirement age shall be calculated in
accordance with subsection (b) hereof on the basis of the final monthly average
salary as of such participant's actual retirement date.
   (d)   Service Increment. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, a participant who retires after completion of at least twenty-six
years of aggregate service may be entitled to receive a monthly service
increment benefit, provided, however, that the participant shall have accrued
sufficient service credit pursuant to this subsection. Such service increment
shall only be available to a participant who retires on a retirement date after
the attainment of normal retirement age and whose aggregate service, for
purposes of this subsection, shall only include periods of time when the
participant actively renders service in employment and shall not include any
period of time during which the participant received a disability benefit under
the terms of this Plan or was not otherwise in active employment. Such service
increment shall be an amount equal to one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each
completed year of aggregate service in excess of twenty-five years, but shall
not exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00), and shall be paid monthly in addition
to the amount of normal retirement benefit calculated pursuant to subsection
(b) hereof.
   (e)   Payment of Benefits. Retirement benefit payments shall be payable as
of the first day of the month coincident with or next following the
participant's retirement date and the first day of each month thereafter during
the participant's lifetime. A participant must complete an application for
benefit, in the manner prescribed by the Plan Administrator, and deliver such
application to the Plan Administrator at least thirty days prior to the date on
which benefit payments shall commence. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, no retirement benefit payments nor any other payments
shall be due or payable on or before the first day of the month coincident with
or next following the date that is thirty days after the date the Plan
Administrator receives the application for benefits. Payment of benefits
hereunder shall cease as of the date of death of the participant.
   (f)   Cost-of-Living Adjustments.
      (1)   Each participant who has retired or who shall retire after December
31, 1987, and who receives a retirement benefit determined pursuant to
subsection (b) hereof, shall be entitled to receive a cost-of-living adjustment
to the amount of benefit payable to such participant under subsections (b) and
(d) hereof. Such cost-of-living adjustment shall be determined by Council and
shall not exceed the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for the
year in which the participant was last employed as an employee of the employer.
Further, the total retirement benefits payable under this Plan shall not exceed
seventy-five percent of the participant's final monthly average salary; the
total cost-of-living increase shall not exceed thirty percent; and the cost-of-
living adjustment shall not impair the actuarial soundness of the Pension Fund.
      (2)   Act 64 of 2002 - ad hoc benefit adjustment. Act 64 of 2002, which
amends Act 147 of 1988, was signed into law June 19, 2002. This law requires
that pension plans covering police provide an ad hoc benefit adjustment for
retirees whose benefits began before January 1, 1996. The increase is the sum
of the following:
         A.   Base adjustment of fifteen cents ($0.15) times the number of
whole years of active service times the number of whole years retired (as of
January 1, 2001); and
         B.   Longevity adjustment equal to the base adjustment times the
longevity factor. The longevity factor is .025 times the number of whole years
retired (as of January 1, 2001) plus .05 times the number of whole years
retired (as of January 1, 2001).
(Ord. 2306. Passed 9-16-02.)
   (g)   Maximum Benefit Limitations.
      (1)   Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, no
benefit provided under this Plan attributable to contributions of the employer
shall exceed, as an annual amount, the lesser of:
         A.   The amount specified in Code Section 415(b)(1)(A), as adjusted
pursuant to Code Section 415(d), which amount shall be one hundred twelve
thousand, two hundred twenty-one dollars ($112,221) as of the restatement date
of this Plan, assuming the form of benefit shall be a straight life annuity
(with no ancillary benefits); or
         B.   One hundred percent of the participant's average compensation for
the participant's high three years.
      (2)   The limitations described in paragraph (g)(1) hereof shall be
governed by the following conditions and definitions:
2003 Replacement
         A.   "Compensation" shall include the participant's wages, salaries
and fees for personal services actually rendered in employment, to the extent
the amounts are includable in gross income, and shall exclude contributions
made by the employer to a plan of deferred compensation, to the extent that,
before the application of Code Section 415 limitations to that plan, the
contributions are not includable in the gross income of the employee for the
taxable year in which contributed; exclude distributions from a qualified plan
of deferred compensation; and exclude other amounts which receive special tax
benefits, such as premiums for group term life insurance, to the extent not
includable in the gross income of the employee, or contributions made by the
employer (whether made under a salary reduction agreement or not) to the
purchase of an annuity contract pursuant to Code Section 403(b).
          B.   Benefits paid or payable in a form other than a straight life
annuity (with no ancillary benefits), or where the employee contributes to the
Plan or makes rollover contributions, shall be adjusted on an actuarially
equivalent basis to determine the limitation contained herein.
         C.   In the case of a benefit which commences prior to the attainment
of age sixty-two by the participant, the limitation set forth in paragraph (g)
(1)A. hereof shall be adjusted on an actuarially equivalent basis to the amount
determined pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)A. hereof commencing at age sixty-two.
However, the reduction shall not reduce the limitation below seventy-five
thousand dollars ($75,000) for a benefit commencing at or after age fifty-five,
or, if the benefit commences prior to the attainment of age fifty-five, the
amount which is actuarially equivalent to a benefit of seventy-five thousand
dollars ($75,000) commencing at age fifty-five. However, in the case of a
qualified participant (a participant with respect to whom a period of at least
fifteen years of service, including applicable military service, as a full-time
employee of a police or fire department, is taken into account in determining
the amount of benefit), the limitation contained herein shall not reduce the
limitation set forth in paragraph (g)(1)A. hereof to an amount less than sixty-
two thousand, three hundred forty-five dollars ($62,345) as of the restatement
date of this Plan, and such amount shall be adjusted pursuant to Code Section
415(d);
         D.   In the case of a benefit which commences after the attainment of
age sixty-five by the participant, the limitation set forth in paragraph (g)
(1)A. hereof shall be adjusted on an actuarially equivalent basis to the amount
determined pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)A. hereof commencing at age sixty-five.
         E.   Benefits paid to a participant which total less than ten thousand
dollars ($10,000) from all defined benefit plans maintained by the employer,
expressed as an annual benefit, shall be deemed not to exceed the limitation of
this paragraph, provided that the employer has not, at any time, maintained a
defined contribution plan in which the participant has participated. However,
in the case of a participant with fewer than ten years of participation, the
limitation expressed in this paragraph shall be reduced by one-tenth for each
year of participation less than ten, but in no event shall this limitation be
less than one thousand dollars ($1,000).
         F.   The limitations expressed herein shall be based upon Plan years
for calculation purposes, shall be applied to all defined benefit plans
maintained by the employer as one defined benefit plan and to all defined
contribution plans maintained by the employer as one defined contribution plan,
and shall be applied and interpreted, consistent with Code Section 415 and
regulations thereunder, as applicable to government plans in general and this
Plan in particular.
   (h)   Deferred Retirement Option Plan (DROP).
      (1)   Eligibility. Effective October 22, 2007, members of the Ellwood
City Borough Police Department who have not retired prior to the implementation
of the DROP may enter into DROP on the first day of any month following
completion of 25 years of credited service and attaining the age of 50. Those
members of the Ellwood City Borough Police Department hired after September 19,
2018, may enter into DROP on the first day of any month following completion of
25 years of credited service and attaining the age of 55.
      (2)   Written Election. A member of the Police Department electing to
participate in the DROP must complete and execute a "DROP Option Form" prepared
by the Borough of Ellwood City, which shall evidence the member's participation
in the DROP, and designation of the Individual DROP Account, with all
applicable information necessary to enable the plan administrator to ensure
payment of benefits into the Individual DROP Account. The form must be signed
by the member and notarized and submitted to the Borough 30 days prior to the
date on which the member wishes the DROP option to be effective. The DROP
option notice shall include an irrevocable notice to the ownership, by the
member, that the member shall resign from employment with the Ellwood City
Police Department effective on a specific date (the "resignation date"). In no
event shall the resignation date be shorter than 12 months or longer than 48
months from the execution of the DROP option form. An officer shall cease to
work as an Ellwood City Borough Police Officer on the officer's resignation
date, unless the employer terminates or honorably discharges the officer prior
to the resignation date. In addition, all retirement documents required by the
Police Pension Administrator must be filed and presented to the Borough for
approval of retirement and payment of pension. Once a retirement application
has been approved by the Police Pension Administrator, it is irrevocable. If
DROP participant is re-employed by the Borough, participant may not re-enroll
in any DROP Program.
      (3)   Limitation on Pension Accrual. After the effective date of the DROP
option, the member shall no longer earn or accrue additional years of
continuous service for pension purposes.
      (4)   Benefit Calculation. For all retirement Fund purposes, continuous
service of a member participating in the DROP shall remain as it existed on the
effective date of commencement of participation in the DROP. Service thereafter
shall not be recognized or used for the calculation or determination of any
benefits payable by the Borough of Ellwood City Police Pension Fund. The
average applicable compensation of the member for pension calculation purposes
shall remain, as it existed on the effective date of commencement of
participation in the DROP. Earnings or increases in earnings thereafter shall
not be recognized or used for the calculation or determination of any benefits
payable by the Pension Fund. The pension benefit payable to the members shall
increase only as a result of cost of living adjustments in effect on the
effective date of the member's participation in the DROP or by applicable cost
of living adjustments granted thereafter.
      (5)   Payments to the DROP Account. The monthly retirement benefits that
would have been payable had the member elected to cease employment and receive
a normal retirement benefit, shall, upon the member commencing participation in
DROP, be paid into the separate account established to receive the
participant's monthly pension payments (Individual DROP Account).
      (6)   Accrual of Non-Pension Benefits. After an officer elects to
participate in the DROP program, all other contractual benefits shall continue
to accrue with the exception of those provisions relating to the Police Pension
Plan and the buyback of accrued, but unused, sick, compensatory or vacation
time. Prior to participating in the DROP program, an officer may request
payment for any accrued but unused sick or vacation time which the employer
would be obligated to buyback from the officer upon retirement. An officer may
utilize leave time during the DROP period, but the employer shall not be
required to buyback any such unused leave time at the end of the DROP period.
      (7)   Payout. Upon the termination date set forth in the member's drop
option notice or such date as the employer separates the member from
employment, the retirement benefits payable to the member or member's
beneficiary, if applicable, shall be paid to the member or beneficiary and
shall no longer be paid to the member's Individual DROP Account. Within 45 days
following termination of a member's employment pursuant to their participating
in the DROP program, the balance in the members' Individual DROP Account shall
be paid to the member in a single lump sum payment or at the member's option,
in any fashion permitted by law, including, but no limited to transfer of joint
ownership of the Individual DROP Account by the employer to employee.
      (8)   Disability During DROP. If a member becomes temporarily disabled
during his participation in DROP, his participation freezes and the time period
while on disability does not count towards the 48 month participation limit.
Upon return to duty, membership in DROP shall resume, continuing with the
remaining time left in the 48 month membership period. The member shall receive
disability pay in the same amount as disabled Police Officers that are not
participating in DROP. In no event shall a member on temporary disability have
the ability to draw from his DROP account. However, notwithstanding any other
provision in this paragraph, if an officer is disabled and has not returned to
work as of the date of his required resignation, then such resignation shall
take precedence over all other provisions herein and said officer shall be
required to resign. Nothing contained in this Plan shall be construed as
conferring any legal rights upon any police employee or other person to a
continuation of employment nor shall participation in the DROP Program
supersede or limit in any way the right of the employer to honorably discharge
a police employee based upon an inability to perform his or her full duties as
a police officer.
      (9)   Death. If a DROP member dies before the DROP account balances are
paid, the participant members' legal beneficiary shall have the same rights as
the member to withdraw the account balance.
      (10)   Forfeiture of benefits. Notwithstanding an officer's participation
in the DROP Plan, an officer who is convicted or pleads guilty to engaging in
criminal misconduct which constitutes a "crime related to public office or
public employment," as that phrase is defined in Pennsylvania's Pension
Forfeiture Act, 43 P.S. §§ 1311 - 1314, shall forfeit his right to receive a
pension, including any amounts currently deposited in the DROP Account. In such
a case, the member shall only be entitled to receive the contributions, if any
made by the member to the Fund, without interest. Remaining monies shall be
returned to the Police Pension Plan in accordance with law.
      (11)   Account Manager. The employee shall designate the Individual DROP
Account. The employer and the Police Wage and Policy Committee further agree
that the employer shall not be responsible for any fees pertaining to the
account, investment loss incurred in the plan or for the failure of any
investment to earn a specific or expected return or to earn as much as any
other opportunity, whether or not such other investment opportunity was offered
or available to participants in the plan.
      (12)   Cost of Management for DROP Program. The Police Wage and Policy
Committee and the employer agree that any costs or fees associated with the
management of the DROP Program, with the exception of those amounts which would
have been expended in connection with calculation and payment of a
superannuation retirement benefit, accounts shall be paid directly from the
Police Pension Fund and not by the employer. The Police Wage and Policy
Committee and the Employer agree that any costs or fees associated with the
management of an Individual DROP Account accounts shall be paid directly by the
employee and not by the employer. The account shall bear interest from 0% to
not more than 4.5% annually.
      (13)   Amendment. Any amendments to the DROP Ordinance shall be
consistent with the provisions covering deferred retirement option plans set
forth in any applicable collective bargaining agreement and shall be binding
upon all future DROP participants. The DROP Plan may only be amended by a
written instrument, not by any oral agreement or past practice.
      (14)   Effective Date. The Effective Date of the changes in this
Ordinance is January 1, 2007; however, the implementation of the DROP program
will be provided as in this division.
      (15)   Construal of Provisions. An Officer's election to participate in
the DROP program shall in no way be construed as a limitation on the Employer's
right to suspend or terminate an officer for just cause or to grant the officer
an honorable discharge based upon a physical or mental inability to perform his
or her duties.
      (16)   Severability. The provisions of this division shall be severable:
and if any of its provisions shall be held to be unconstitutional or illegal,
the validity of any of the remaining provisions of the division shall not be
affected thereby. It is hereby expressly declared as the intent of the Employer
Council that this division would have been adopted had such unconstitutional or
illegal provision or provisions not been included herein.
      (17)   Annual Report. No later than 60 days after the close of each
fiscal year, the Actuary shall produce a report setting out the pension
system's experience regarding the DROP through and including the most recent
fiscal year. The report shall set out, on an annual basis and from inception,
the number of persons enrolled in the DROP, the number of persons to have
retired after entry into the DROP, the average length of enrollment in the
DROP, the average lump sum payment made to such persons, the breakdown of
enrollees and retirees and by years of employment with the Borough, and such
other data as the Borough deems relevant to determining the efficacy of the
DROP in terms of either its cost-effectiveness or as a management tool.
      (18)   This subsection (h) is eliminated for any/all officers hired after
September 20, 2021.
   (i)   Required Distributions.
      (1)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the entire
benefit of any participant who becomes entitled to benefits prior to his or her
death shall be distributed either:
         A.   Not later than the required beginning date; or
         B.   Over a period beginning not later than the required beginning
date and extending over the life of such participant or over the lives of such
participant and a designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond
the life expectancy of such participant, or the joint life expectancies of such
participant and designated beneficiary).
      If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this Plan dies prior
to the date when his or he entire interest has been distributed to him or her
after distribution of his or her benefits has begun in accordance with
paragraph (h)(1)B. hereof, the remaining portion of such benefit shall be
distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used
under paragraph (h)(1)B. hereof, as of the date of his or her death.
      (2)   If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this Plan dies
before distribution of his or her benefit has begun, the entire interest of
such employee shall be distributed within five years of the death of such
employee, unless the following sentence is applicable: If any portion of the
employee's interest is payable to (or for the benefit of) a designated
beneficiary, such portion shall be distributed over the life of such designated
beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such
beneficiary), and such distributions begin not later than one year after the
date of the employee's death or such later date as provided by regulations
issued by the Secretary of the Treasury, then for purposes of the five-year
rule set forth in the preceding sentence, the benefit payable to the
beneficiary shall be treated as distributed on the date on which such
distributions begin. However, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the
designated beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the participant, then the
date on which distributions are required to begin shall not be earlier than the
date upon which the employee would have attained age seventy and one-half.
Further, if the surviving spouse dies before the distributions to such spouse
begin, this paragraph shall be applied as if the surviving spouse were the
employee.
      (3)   For purposes of this subsection, the following definitions and
procedures shall apply:
         A.   "Required beginning date" means April 1 of the calendar year
following the later of the calendar year in which the employee attains age
seventy and one-half or the calendar year in which the employee retires.
         B.   "Designated beneficiary" means any individual designated by the
employee under this Plan according to its rules.
         C.   Any amount paid to a child shall be treated as if it had been
paid to the surviving spouse if such amount will become payable to the
surviving spouse upon such child's reaching majority (or other designated event
permitted under regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury).
         D.   The life expectancy of an employee and/or an employee's spouse
(other than in the case of a life annuity) may be redetermined, but not more
frequently than annually.
   (j)   Assignment of Benefits. The pension benefit payments prescribed herein
shall not be subject to attachment, execution, levy, garnishment or other legal
process, shall be payable only to the participant or designated beneficiary and
shall not be subject to assignment or transfer.
   (k)   Retired Participants. Any participant who has retired prior to the
restatement date shall not have the benefit altered in any way by the
provisions of this amended and restated Plan, except where otherwise expressly
provided herein. Such retired participants shall continue to have their
benefits governed by the terms of the Plan in effect on the day preceding the
restatement date.
(Ord. 2137. Passed 3-15-93; Ord. 2454. Passed 9-20-10; Ord. 2552. Passed 11-19-
18; Ord. 2591. Passed 11-15-21.)
294.05   DISABILITY RETIREMENT.
   (a)   Entitlement to Benefit. A participant who incurs a total and permanent
disability as a result of and in the course of active rendering of services in
employment shall be entitled to a disability retirement benefit, as of the
disability date.
(Ord. 2137. Passed 3-15-93.)
   (b)   Amount of Benefit. If a participant is entitled to a disability
retirement benefit under subsection (a) hereof due to the incurrence of a total
and permanent disability as a result of and in the course of active rendering
of services in employment, then the benefit shall be calculated at a rate no
less than fifty percent of the member's "Final Monthly Average Salary'' as of
the "'Disability Date", provided that any member who receives benefits for the
same injuries under the Social Security Act (49 Stat. 620,42 U.S.C. §§ 301 et
seq.) shall have his or her disability benefits offset or reduced by the amount
of such benefits.
(Ord. 2165. Passed 3-20-95; Ord. 2293. Passed 2-18-02; Ord. 2312. Passed 12-16-
02.; Ord. 2582. Passed 7-19-21.)
   (c)   Payment of Benefits. Disability retirement benefit payments shall be
made monthly as of the first day of each month, commencing as of the first day
of the month coincident with or immediately following the participant's
disability date and continuing until the earliest of the death of the
participant or the cessation of total and permanent disability.
   A participant who fails to return within three months to employment as an
employee of the employer, upon cessation of total and permanent disability,
prior to the attainment of normal retirement age, shall be deemed to have
terminated employment as of the disability date, shall not be entitled to any
distribution of accumulated contributions pursuant to Section
294.07(b), to the extent that the total amount of disability payments exceeds
the value of the participant's accumulated contributions as of the disability
date, and shall not be entitled to any other benefits under the Plan on account
of any aggregate service as of the disability date.
   (d)   Verification of Disability. The Plan Administrator shall, in his, her
or its sole discretion, determine whether a participant has incurred a total
and permanent disability. The Plan Administrator shall rely on the report of a
physician acceptable to the Plan Administrator. If the Plan Administrator
determines that a participant who is totally and permanently disabled has
recovered sufficiently to resume active employment as a police officer, or if a
participant refuses to undergo a medical examination as directed by the Plan
Administrator (such a medical examination may not be required more frequently
than once in any given twelve-month period), the payment of disability
retirement benefits shall cease.
   (e)   Cessation of Disability. A participant who is receiving payment of
disability retirement benefits under this Plan must notify the Plan
Administrator of any change which may cause a cessation of entitlement to
receipt of such benefits hereunder. If a participant fails to provide immediate
notice to the Plan Administrator of any such change in status and continues to
receive payment of benefits hereunder to which the participant is not entitled,
then the Plan Administrator may take whatever action is necessary to recover
any amount of improperly paid amounts, including legal action or offsetting
such amounts against any future payments of retirement or other benefits under
the Plan, including the cost of such actions.
(Ord. 2137. Passed 3-15-93.)

294.04(a) and before retirement benefit payments commence, the surviving spouse
of a member of the police force or a member who retires on pension who dies or
if so spouse survives or if he or she survives and subsequently dies, then the
child or children under the age of 18 years or, if attending college, under or
attaining the age of 23 years, of a member of the police force or a member who
retires on pension who dies shall, during his or her lifetime in the case of a
surviving spouse or until reaching the age of 18 years of, if attending
college, under or attaining the age of 23 years in the case of a child or
children, be entitled to receive a pension calculated at no less than fifty
percent of the pension the member was receiving or would have been receiving
had he or she been retired at the time of his or her death.
   (c)   Death of Participant Prior to Retirement. The surviving spouse of a
member of the police force who dies before his or her pension has vested, or if
no spouse survives, or if he or she survives and subsequently dies, the child
or children under the age of 18 years or, if attending college, under or
attaining the age of 23 years, of the member of the police force shall be
entitled to receive repayment of all money which the member invested in the
pension fund plus interest or other increases in value of the member's
investment in the pension fund unless the member has designated another
beneficiary for this purpose.
   (d)   For purposes of this section, the phrase "attending college" shall
mean the eligible children are registered at an accredited institution of
higher learning and are carrying a minimum course load of seven credit hours
per semester and the term "regional police department" shall mean a municipal
police force organized and operated in combination by two or more
municipalities through an intermunicipal agreement pursuant to 53 Pa.C.S. Ch.

employee, except as otherwise hereinbefore provided, shall have all interest
and rights under this Plan limited to those contained in this section.

employment with the employer shall terminate for any reason, other than death
or total and permanent disability, prior to the attainment of normal retirement
age, shall be entitled to receive a distribution of accumulated contributions.
Upon receipt of such accumulated contributions, said participant and his or her
beneficiary shall not be entitled to any further payments from the Plan.
   (c)   Deferred Vested Benefits. A participant who has completed at least
twelve years of aggregate service and whose employment with the employer shall
terminate for any reason, other than death or total and permanent disability,
prior to the attainment of normal retirement age, shall be entitled to elect to
receive a deferred vested benefit in lieu of a distribution of accumulated
contributions under subsection (b) hereof. Such a deferred vested benefit shall
be in an amount equal to the participant's accrued benefit as of the date
employment terminates and shall commence, after application pursuant to Section
294.04(e), as of the first day of the month coincident with or next following
the date on which the participant's normal retirement age would be attained if
the participant continued in employment until such date.

   (a)   Designation and Authority of Plan Administrator. The Plan
Administrator shall be the Police Pension Board or the individual appointed by
Council who or which shall have the power and authority to do all acts and to
execute, acknowledge and deliver all instruments necessary to implement and

shall be filled in the same manner as the position was originally filled.
(Ord. 2153. Passed 12-19-94.)
   (c)   Powers and Duties of Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator shall
have full power and authority to do whatever shall, in his or her or its
judgment, be reasonably necessary for the proper administration and operation
of the Plan. The interpretation or construction placed upon any term or
provision of the Plan by the Plan Administrator, or any action of the Plan
Administrator taken in good faith, shall, upon Council's review and approval
thereof, be final and conclusive upon all parties thereto, whether employees,
participants or other persons concerned. By way of specification and not
limitation, and except as specifically limited hereafter, the Plan
Administrator is hereby authorized to:
      (1)   Construe this Plan;
      (2)   Determine all questions affecting the eligibility of any employee
to participate herein;
      (3)   Compute the amount and source of any benefit payable hereunder to
any participant or beneficiary;
      (4)   Authorize any and all disbursements;

as the Plan Administrator deems appropriate, information explaining the Plan;
      (7)   Require from the employer or any participant such information as
shall be necessary for the proper administration of the Plan; and
      (8)   Appoint and retain any individual to assist in the administration
of the Plan, including such legal, clerical, accounting and actuarial services
as may be required to any applicable law or laws.
   The Plan Administrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from or
modify the terms of the Plan or change or add to any benefits provided by the
Plan, or to waive or fail to apply any requirements of eligibility for benefits
under the Plan. Further, the Plan Administrator shall have no power to adopt,
amend or terminate the Plan, to select or appoint any trustee or to determine
or require any contributions to the Plan, said powers being exclusively
reserved to Council.
   (d)   Organization of Police Pension Board. The Police Pension Board may
organize itself in any manner deemed appropriate to effectuate its purposes
hereunder, subject to the following:
       (1)   The Board shall act by a majority of its members at the time in
office and such action may be taken either by vote at a meeting or in writing
without a meeting.
      (2)   The Board shall, from time to time, appoint a Chairperson, a
Secretary, who may be, but need not be, a Board member, and such other agents
as it may deem advisable.
      (3)   The Board may, from time to time, authorize any one or more of its
members to execute any document or documents, including any application,
request, certificate, notice, consent, waiver or direction, and shall notify
Council, in writing, of the name or names of the member or members so
authorized. In the absence of a designation, the Chairperson shall be deemed to
be so authorized. Any trustee or other fiduciary appointed hereunder shall
accept and be fully protected in relying upon any document executed by the
designated member or members (or the Chairperson in the absence of a
designation), as representing a valid action by the Board, until the Board
files with such fiduciary a written revocation of such designation.
      (4)   The Board or its delegate shall maintain and keep such records as
are necessary for the efficient operation of the Plan or as may be required by
any applicable law, regulation or ruling and shall provide for the preparation
and filing of such forms or reports as may be required to be filed with any
governmental agency or department and with the participants and/or other
persons entitled to benefits under the Plan.
   (e)   Compensation and Expenses of Plan Administrator. The Plan
Administrator shall serve without compensation for services, unless otherwise
agreed by Council in writing. All reasonable expenses incident to the
functioning of the Plan Administrator, including, but not limited to, fees of
accountants, counsel, actuaries and other specialists, and other costs of
administering the Plan, may be paid from the Pension Fund upon approval by
Council, to the extent permitted under applicable law and not otherwise paid by
the employer.
   (f)   Liability. No member of Council, nor the Plan Administrator, the
enrolled actuary or any other person involved in the administration of the
Plan, shall be liable to any person on account of any act or failure to act,
which is taken or omitted to be taken in good faith, in performing their
respective duties under the terms of this Plan. To the extent permitted by law,
the employer shall, and hereby does agree to, indemnify and hold harmless the
Plan Administrator and each successor thereof and each of any such individual's
heirs, executors and administrators, and the delegates and appointees (other
than any person, bank, firm or corporation which is independent of the employer
and which renders services to the Plan for a fee), from any and all liability
and expenses, including counsel fees, reasonably incurred in any action, suit
or proceeding to which he or she or it is or may be made a party by reason of
being or having been a member, delegate or appointee of the Plan Administrator,
except in matters involving criminal liability or intentional or willful
misconduct. If the employer purchases insurance to cover claims of a nature
described above, then there shall be no right of indemnification, except to the
extent of any deductible amount under the insurance coverage or to the extent
of the amount the claims exceed the insured amount.
   (g)   Approval of Benefits. The Plan Administrator shall review and approve
or deny any application for retirement benefits within thirty days following
receipt thereof or within such longer time as may be necessary under the
circumstances. Any denial of an application for retirement benefits shall be in
writing and shall specify the reason for such denial.
   (h)   Appeals. Any person whose application for retirement benefits is
denied, who questions the amount of benefit paid, who believes a benefit should
have commenced which did not so commence, or who has some other claim arising
under the Plan ("claimant"), shall first seek a resolution of such claim under
the procedure hereinafter set forth.
      (1)   Any claimant shall file a notice of the claim with the Plan
Administrator, which notice shall fully describe the nature of the claim. The
Plan Administrator shall review the claim and make an initial determination
approving or denying the claim.
      (2)   If the claim is denied, in whole or in part, the Plan Administrator
shall, within ninety days (or such other period as may be established by
applicable law) from the time the application is received, mail notice of such
denial to the claimant. Such ninety-day period may be extended by the Plan
Administrator, if special circumstances so require, for up to ninety additional
days, by the Plan Administrator's delivering notice of such extension to the
claimant within the first ninety-day period. Any notice hereunder shall be
written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and, if it is a
notice of denial, shall set forth the specific Plan provisions on which the
denial is based, an explanation of additional material or information, if any,
necessary to perfect such claim and a statement of why such material or
information is necessary, and an explanation of the review procedure.
      (3)   Upon receipt of notice denying the claim, the claimant shall have
the right to request a full and fair review by Council of the initial
determination. Such request for review must be made by notice to Council within
sixty days of receipt of such notice of denial. During such review, the
claimant or a duly authorized representative shall have the right to review any
pertinent documents and to submit any issues or comments in writing. Council
shall, within sixty days after receipt of the notice requesting such review (or
in special circumstances, such as where Council in its sole discretion holds a
hearing, within 120 days of receipt of such notice), submit its decision, in
writing, to the person or persons whose claim has been denied. The decision
shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties, shall be written in a
manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall contain specific
references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based.
      (4)   Any notice of a claim questioning the amount of a benefit in pay
status shall be filed within ninety days following the date of the first
payment which would be adjusted if the claim is granted, unless the Plan
Administrator allows a later filing for good cause shown.
      (5)   A claimant who does not submit a notice of a claim or a notice
requesting a review of a denial of a claim within the time limitations
specified above shall be deemed to have waived such claim or right to review.
(Ord. 2137. Passed 3-15-93.)
294.09   POLICE PENSION FUND.
   (a)   Operation. Council is hereby authorized to hold and supervise the
investment of the assets of the Police Pension Fund, subject to the provisions
of the laws of the Commonwealth and of this Plan and any amendment thereto.
   The Pension Fund shall be used to pay benefits as provided in the Plan and,
to the extent not paid directly by the employer, to pay the expenses of
administering the Plan pursuant to authorization by the employer.
   The employer intends the Plan to be permanent and for the exclusive benefit
of its employees. It expects to make the contributions to the Pension Fund
required under the Plan. The employer shall not be liable in any manner for any
insufficiency in the Pension Fund. Benefits shall be payable only from the
Pension Fund and only to the extent that there are monies available therein.
   The Pension Fund shall consist of all funds held by the employer under the
Plan, including contributions made pursuant to the provisions hereof and the
investments, reinvestments and proceeds thereof. The Pension Fund shall be
held, managed and administered pursuant to the terms of the Plan. Except as
otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, the employer has exclusive authority
and discretion to manage and control the Pension Fund assets. The employer may,
however, appoint a trustee, custodian and/or investment manager, at its sole
discretion.
   (b)   Powers and Duties of Employer. With respect to the Pension Fund, the
employer shall have the following powers, rights and duties, in addition to
those vested in it elsewhere in the Plan or by law, unless such duties are
delegated:
      (1)   To retain, in cash, so much of the Pension Fund as it deems
advisable and to deposit any cash so retained in any bank or similar financial
institution (including any such institution which may be appointed to serve as
trustee hereunder), without liability for interest thereon.
      (2)   To invest and reinvest the principal and income of the Pension Fund
and to keep said Fund invested, without distinction between principal and
income, in securities which are, at the time, legal investments for fiduciaries
under the Pennsylvania Fiduciaries Investment Act, or as the same may be
subsequently modified or amended.
      (3)   To sell property held in the Fund, at either public or private
sale, for cash or on credit, at such times as it may deem appropriate; to
change such property; and to grant options for the purchase or exchange
thereof.
      (4)   To consent to and participate in any plan of reorganization,
consolidation, merger, extension or other similar plan affecting property held
in the Fund and to consent to any contract, lease, mortgage, purchase, sale or
other action by any corporation pursuant to any such plan.
      (5)   To exercise all conversion and subscription rights pertaining to
property held in the Fund.
      (6)   To exercise all voting rights with respect to property held in the
Fund and, in connection therewith, to grant proxies, discretionary or
otherwise.
      (7)   To place money, at any time, in a deposit bank deemed to be
appropriate for the purposes of this Plan, no matter where situated, including,
in those cases where a bank has been appointed to serve as trustee hereunder,
the savings department of its own commercial bank.
      (8)   To maintain and invest the assets of this Plan, on a collective and
commingled basis, with the assets of other pension plans maintained by the
employer, provided that the assets of each respective plan shall be accounted
for and administered separately.
      (9)   To invest the assets of the Pension Fund in any collective
commingled trust fund maintained by a bank or trust company, including any bank
or trust company which may act as a trustee hereunder. In this connection, the
commingling of the assets of this Plan with assets of other eligible,
participating plans through such a medium is hereby specifically authorized.
Any assets of the Plan which may be so added to such collective trusts shall be
subject to all of the provisions of the applicable declaration of trust, as
amended from time to time, which declaration, if required by its terms or by
applicable law, is hereby adopted as part of the Plan, to the extent of the
participation in such collective or commingled trust fund by the Plan.
      (10)   To make any payment or distribution required or advisable to carry
out the provisions of the Plan, provided that if a trustee is appointed by the
employer, such trustee shall make such distribution only at the direction of
the employer.
      (11)   To compromise, contest, arbitrate, enforce or abandon claims and
demands with respect to the Plan.
      (12)   To retain any funds or property subject to any dispute, without
liability for the payment of interest thereon, and to decline to make payment
or delivery thereof until final adjudication is made by a court of competent
jurisdiction.
      (13)   To pay, and to deduct from and charge against the Pension Fund,
any taxes which may be imposed thereon, whether with respect to the income,
property or transfer thereof, or upon or with respect to the interest of any
person therein, which the Fund is required to pay, and to contest, in its
discretion, the validity or amount of any tax, assessment, claim or demand
which may be levied or made against or in respect of the Pension Fund, the
income, property or transfer thereof, or in any matter or thing connected
therewith.
      (14)   To appoint any persons or firms (including, but not limited to,
accountants, investment advisors, counsel, actuaries, physicians, appraisers,
consultants, professional plan administrators and other specialists), or
otherwise act to secure specialized advice or assistance, as it deems necessary
or desirable in connection with the management of the Fund. To the extent not
prohibited by applicable law, the employer shall be entitled to rely
conclusively upon, and shall be fully protected in any action or omission taken
by it in good faith reliance upon, the advice or opinion of such persons or
firms, provided that such persons or firms were prudently chosen by the
employer, taking into account the interests of the participants and
beneficiaries and with due regard to the ability of the persons or firms to
perform their assigned functions.
      (15)   To retain the services of one or more persons or firms for the
management of (including the power to acquire and dispose of) all or any part
of the Fund assets, provided that each of such persons or firms is registered
as an investment advisor under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, is a bank
(as defined in that Act), or is an insurance company qualified to manage,
acquire or dispose of pension trust assets under the laws of more than one
state. In such event, the employer shall follow the directions of such
investment manager or managers, with respect to the acquisition and disposition
of Fund assets, but shall not be liable for the acts or omissions of such
investment manager or managers, nor shall it be under any obligation to review
or otherwise manage any Fund assets which are subject to the management of such
investment manager or managers. If the employer appoints a trustee, the trustee
shall not be permitted to retain such an investment manager, except with the
express written consent of the employer.
   In addition to the foregoing powers, the employer shall also have all of the
powers, rights and privileges conferred upon trustees by the Pennsylvania
Fiduciaries Investment Act, or as the same may be subsequently modified or
amended, and the power to do all acts, take all proceedings and execute all
rights and privileges, although not specifically mentioned herein, as the
employer may deem necessary to administer the Pension Fund.
   (c)   Investment of Funds. The employer shall not be required to make
separate investments for individual participants or to maintain separate
investments for each participant's account, but may invest contributions and
any profits or gains therefrom in common investments.
   (d)   Compensation and Expenses of Appointed Trustee. If a trustee is
appointed, the trustee shall be entitled to such reasonable compensation as
shall from time to time be agreed upon by the employer and the trustee, unless
such compensation is prohibited by law. Such compensation, and all expenses
reasonably incurred by the trustee in carrying out his or her functions, shall
constitute a charge upon the employer or the Pension Fund, which may be
executed at any time after thirty days written notice to the employer. The
employer shall be under no obligation to such costs and expenses, and, in the
event of its failure to do so, the trustee shall be entitled to pay the same,
or to be reimbursed for the payment thereof, from the Pension Fund.
   (e)   Periodic Accounting of Fund. If a trustee is appointed, the Pension
Fund shall be evaluated annually, or at more frequent intervals, by the
trustee, and a written accounting rendered as of each fiscal year end of the
Fund, and as of the effective date of any removal or resignation of the
trustee, and at such additional dates as requested by the employer, showing the
condition of the Fund and all receipts, disbursements and other transactions
effected by the trustee during the period covered by the accounting, based on
fair market values prevailing as of such date.
   (f)   Value. All determinations as to the value of the assets of the Pension
Fund, and as to the amount of the liabilities thereof, shall be made by the
employer or its appointed trustee, whose decisions shall be final and
conclusive and binding on all parties thereto, the participants and
beneficiaries and their estates. In making any such determination, the employer
or trustee shall be entitled to seek and rely upon the opinion of or any
information furnished by brokers, appraisers and other experts, and shall also
be entitled to rely upon reports as to sales and quotations, both on security
exchanges and otherwise as contained in newspapers and in financial
publications.
(Ord. 2137. Passed 3-15-93.)
294.10   AMENDMENTS.
   The employer may amend this Plan, at any time or from time to time, by an
instrument, in writing, executed in the name of the employer under its
Municipal seal by officers duly authorized to execute such instrument and
delivered to Council, provided, however, that:
   (a)   No amendment shall deprive any participant or any beneficiary of a
deceased participant of any of the benefits to which he or she is entitled
under this Plan, with respect to contributions previously made.
   (b)   No amendment shall provide for the use of funds or assets held under
this Plan other than for the benefit of employees, and no funds contributed to
this Plan or assets of this Plan shall, except as provided in Section
294.11(d), ever revert to or be used or enjoyed by the employer.
   (c)   No amendment to the Plan which provides for a benefit modification
shall be made, unless the cost estimate described in Section
294.12(c) has been prepared and presented to Council in accordance with the
Act.
(Ord. 2137. Passed 3-15-93.)
294.11   TERMINATION OF PLAN.
   (a)   Right to Terminate. The employer shall have the power to terminate
this Plan in its entirety at any time by an instrument, in writing, executed in
the name of the employer.
   (b)   Automatic Termination of Contributions. Subject to the provisions of
the Act governing financially distressed municipalities, the liability of the
employer to make contributions to the Pension Fund shall automatically
terminate upon liquidation or dissolution of the employer, upon its
adjudication as a bankrupt or upon the making of a general assignment for the
benefit of its creditors.
   (c)   Distribution Upon Termination. In the event of the termination of the
Plan, all amounts of vested benefits accrued by the affected participants as of
the date of such termination, to the extent funded on such date, shall be
nonforfeitable hereunder. In the event of termination of the Plan, the employer
shall direct either that the Plan Administrator continue to hold the vested
accrued benefits of participants in the Pension Fund in accordance with the
provisions of the Plan (other than those provisions relating to forfeitures),
without regard to such termination, until all funds have been distributed in
accordance with the provisions, or that the Plan Administrator immediately
distribute to each participant an amount equal to the vested accrued benefit to
the date of termination.
   If there are insufficient assets in the Pension Fund to provide for all
vested accrued benefits as of the date of Plan termination, priority shall
first be given to the distribution of any amounts attributable to mandatory or
voluntary employee contributions before assets are applied to the distribution
of any vested benefits attributable to other sources hereunder.
   All other assets attributable to the terminated Plan shall be distributed
and disposed of in accordance with the provisions of applicable law and the
terms of any instrument adopted by the employer which effects such termination.
   (d)   Residual Assets. If all liabilities to vested participants and any
others entitled to receive a benefit under the terms of the Plan have been
satisfied, and there remain any residual assets in the Pension Fund, such
residual assets remaining shall be returned to the employer, insofar as such
return does not contravene any provision of law, and any remaining balance, in
excess of employer contributions, shall be returned to the Commonwealth.
   (e)   Exclusive Benefit Rule. In the event of the discontinuance and
termination of the Plan, as provided herein, the employer shall dispose of the
Pension Fund in accordance with the terms of the Plan and applicable law. At no
time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the Plan shall any part
of the corpus or income of the Pension Fund, after deducting any administrative

296.01   DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   For purposes of this Plan, the masculine shall be read for the
feminine, and the singular shall be read for the plural, wherever the person or
context shall plainly so require.
   (b)   The following words and phrases, as used in this Plan, shall have the
meanings set forth in this subsection, unless a different meaning is otherwise
clearly required by the context:
      (1)   "Accrued benefit" means, as of any given date, the benefit
determined under Section
296.04(b), calculated on the basis of final monthly average salary as of the
date of determination and multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which
shall be the participant's aggregate service determined as of such date and the
denominator of which shall be the projected aggregate service of the
participant as if the participant continues in employment until attainment of
normal retirement age. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, in no event shall the fraction exceed one.
         In no event, however, shall the accrued benefit exceed the maximum
limitation, determined as of the date of computation provided under Section
296.04(e). All accrued benefits are subject to all applicable limitations,
reductions, offsets and actuarial adjustments provided pursuant to the terms of
the Plan prior to the actual payment thereof.
      (2)   "Accumulated contributions" means the total amount contributed by
any participant to this Fund or its predecessor by way of payroll deduction or
otherwise, plus interest credited at three and one-half percent per annum.
Interest shall be credited, in the form of a simple interest rate, from the
midpoint of the Plan year during which the contributions were paid to the first
day of the month preceding the date that a distribution of accumulated
contributions under Sections
296.06(c) and
296.07(b) shall be paid or payment of benefits shall commence.
      (3)   "Act" means the Municipal Pension Plan Funding Standard and
Recovery Act, which was enacted as Act 205 of 1984, as amended, 53 P.S. 895.101
et seq.
      (4)   "Actuarial equivalent" means two forms of payment of equal

unless otherwise specifically provided herein.
      (5)   "Actuary" means the person, partnership, association or corporation
which, at any given time, is serving as actuary, provided that such actuary
must be an "approved actuary," as defined in the Act.
      (6)   "Aggregate service" means the total period or periods of the
participant's employment with the employer, whether or not interrupted.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, should any such participant receive a
distribution of accumulated contributions which must be maintained in the Plan
with respect to a period of employment, such period of employment shall not be
included in aggregate service thereafter unless, at the commencement of the
next period of employment, the participant repays to the Fund the amount of
such distribution, with interest. For purposes of this paragraph, interest
shall accrue as of the date the employee receives a distribution of accumulated
contributions and shall be computed at the same rate and in the same manner as
described in paragraph (b)(2) hereof.
      (7)   "Beneficiary" means the person or other entity designated by the
participant to receive a distribution of the participant's accumulated
contributions should the participant die prior to becoming entitled to a
retirement benefit. If a participant does not designate a beneficiary or the
beneficiary does not survive the participant, the beneficiary shall be the
surviving spouse, or if there is no surviving spouse, the issue, per stirpes,
or if there is no surviving issue, the estate, but if no personal
representative has been appointed, the beneficiary shall be those persons who
would be entitled to the estate under the intestacy laws of the Commonwealth if
the participant had died intestate and a resident of the Commonwealth.

pursuant to Section
296.08(b).

      (12)   "Compensation" means the total remuneration of the employee,
whether salary or hourly wages, including overtime pay, holiday pay, longevity
pay and any other form of remuneration, excluding the uniform allowance paid by
the employer for services rendered in employment. Compensation shall be limited
on an annual basis, for purposes of the Plan, to the amount specified pursuant
to Code Section 401(a)(17), as adjusted under Code Section 415(d), which amount
shall be two hundred twenty-eight thousand, eight hundred sixty dollars
($228,860) as of the restatement date.
      (13)   "Council" means the Council of the Borough.
      (14)   "Disability date" means the date when a participant is determined
by the Plan Administrator to be incapacitated due to total and permanent
disability, or the date when the participant's employment terminates due to
such total and permanent disability, if later.
      (15)   "Employee" means any individual employed as a fire-fighter by the
employer on a regular, full-time basis as a member of the employer's Fire
Department.
      (16)   "Employer" means the Borough.
      (17)   "Employment" means, for the purpose of determining aggregate
service:
         A.   The period of time for which an employee is directly or
indirectly compensated or entitled to compensation by the employer for the
performance of duties as a fire-fighter;
         B.   Any period of time for which an employee is paid a fixed,
periodic amount in the nature of salary continuation payments, for reasons
other than the performance of duties (such as vacation, holidays, sickness,
entitlement to benefits under workers' compensation or similar laws), either
directly by the employer or through a program to which the employer has made
contributions on behalf of the employee;
         C.   Any period during which an employee is entitled to disability
benefits under this Plan, provided that the employee returns to employment
within three months of the date on which it is determined that the employee is
no longer totally and permanently disabled, if such determination occurs prior
to the date a participant attains normal retirement age; and
         D.   Any period of voluntary or involuntary military service with the
Armed Forces of the United States of America, provided that the participant has
been employed as a regular, full-time fire-fighter in the employer's Fire
Department for a period of at least six months immediately prior to the period
of military service and that the participant returns to employment within six
months following discharge from military service or within such longer period
during which employment rights are guaranteed by applicable law or under the
terms of a collective bargaining agreement with the employer.
      (18)   "Final monthly average salary" means the average monthly salary
earned by the participant and paid by the employer during the final thirty-six
months immediately preceding termination of active employment. Salary shall
include the employee's compensation to which the employee is entitled for the
rendering of services in employment, but shall exclude, for this purpose, any
single sum or extraordinary payments made which are not directly attributable
to active employment during the averaging period, including, but limited to,
payment for accumulated sick leave, payment of a longevity bonus or payment of
a back pay damage award.
         Final monthly average salary shall be calculated by taking into
account only those periods during which an employee receives salary, as that
term is defined in paragraph (b)(18) hereof. Therefore, for example, the final
monthly average salary for a participant who receives disability benefits from
this Plan, or who is voluntarily or involuntarily serving in the United States
Armed Forces during the final thirty-six months of aggregate service, shall be
based on the period during which the employee last received salary from the
employer.
         Salary used to determine final monthly average salary shall be limited
on an annual basis, for purposes of this Plan, to the amount specified in
accordance with Code Section 401(a)(17), as adjusted under Code Section 415(d),
which amount shall be two hundred twenty-eight thousand, eight hundred sixty
dollars ($228,860) as of the restatement date.

mailed in a properly addressed envelope, postage prepaid, to the last known
address of the person entitled thereto, on or before the last day of the
specified notice period, or, if such notice is to be provided to the employer
or the Plan Administrator, it must be received by the recipient on or before
the last day of the specified notice period.
      (23)   "Participant" means an employee who has met the eligibility

296.02(a), and who has not for any reason ceased to be a participant hereunder.

administered under the terms of this Plan, which shall include all money,
property, investments, policies and contracts standing in the name of the Plan.

time to time, and designated as the Borough of Ellwood City Fire-Fighters'
Pension Plan.
      (26)   "Plan Administrator" means the Board or the individual appointed
for the purpose of supervising and administering the provisions of the Plan. If

mental impairment due to which a participant is unable to perform the usual and
customary duties of employment, and which is reasonably expected to continue to
be permanent for the remainder of the participant's lifetime. For purposes of
this paragraph and Section
296.05, a condition shall not be treated as a total and permanent disability
unless such condition is a direct result of and occurs in the line of duty of
employment. Therefore, an employee whose physical or mental impairment does not
occur in the line of duty is not entitled to receive disability benefits under
the Plan. "Total and permanent disability" shall not include injuries which are
willfully self-inflicted, which are due to alcoholism or an addiction to
narcotics, or which are sustained in the perpetration of any felonious criminal

determine the minimum Municipal obligation of the employer. The employer shall

(Ord. 2258. Passed 12-29-99.)
   (c)   Late Retirement. A participant may continue to work beyond the
attainment of normal retirement age, subject to the employer's rules and
regulations regarding retirement age. If a participant who has met the
requirements of subsection (a) hereof continues to work beyond normal

ceases and retirement begins. The retirement benefit of a participant who
retires after the attainment of normal retirement age shall be calculated in
accordance with subsection (b) hereof on the basis of the final monthly average
salary as of such participant's actual retirement date.
   (d)   Payment of Benefits. Retirement benefit payments shall be payable as

Administrator receives the application for benefits. Payment of benefits
hereunder shall cease as of the date of death of the participant.
   (e)   Maximum Benefit Limitations.
      (1)   Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, no
benefit provided under this Plan attributable to contributions of the employer
shall exceed, as an annual amount, the lesser of:
         A.   The amount specified in Code Section 415(b)(1)(A), as adjusted
pursuant to Code Section 415(d), which amount shall be one hundred twelve
thousand, two hundred twenty-one dollars ($112,221) as of the restatement date
of this Plan, assuming the form of benefit shall be a straight life annuity
(with no ancillary benefits); or
         B.   One hundred percent of the participant's average compensation for
the participant's high three years.
      (2)   The limitations described in paragraph (e)(1) hereof shall be
governed by the following conditions and definitions:
         A.   "Compensation" shall include the participant's wages, salaries
and fees for personal services actually rendered in employment, to the extent
the amounts are includable in gross income, and shall exclude contributions
made by the employer to a plan of deferred compensation, to the extent that,
before the application of Code Section 415 limitations to that plan, the
contributions are not includable in the gross income of the employee for the
taxable year in which contributed; exclude distributions from a qualified plan
of deferred compensation; and exclude other amounts which receive special tax
benefits, such as premiums for group term life insurance, to the extent not
includable in the gross income of the employee, or contributions made by the
employer (whether made under a salary reduction agreement or not) to the
purchase of an annuity contract pursuant to Code Section 403(b).
         B.   Benefits paid or payable in a form other than a straight life
annuity (with no ancillary benefits), or where the employee contributes to the
Plan or makes rollover contributions, shall be adjusted on an actuarially
equivalent basis to determine the limitation contained herein.
         C.   In the case of a benefit which commences prior to the attainment
of age sixty-two by the participant, the limitation set forth in paragraph (e)
(1)A. hereof shall be adjusted on an actuarially equivalent basis to the amount
determined pursuant to paragraph (e)(1)A. hereof commencing at age sixty-two.
However, the reduction shall not reduce the limitation below seventy-five
thousand dollars ($75,000) for a benefit commencing at or after age fifty-five,
or if the benefit commences prior to the attainment of age fifty-five, the
amount which is actuarially equivalent to a benefit of seventy-five thousand
dollars ($75,000) commencing at age fifty-five. However, in the case of a
qualified participant (a participant with respect to whom a period of at least
fifteen years of service, including applicable military service, as a full-time
employee of a police or fire department is taken into account in determining
the amount of benefit), the limitation contained herein shall not reduce the
limitation set forth in paragraph (e)(1)A. hereof to an amount less than sixty-
two thousand, three hundred forty-five dollars ($62,345) as of the restatement
date of this Plan, and such amount shall be adjusted pursuant to Code Section
415(d).
         D.   In the case of a benefit which commences after the attainment of
age sixty-five by the participant, the limitation set forth in paragraph (e)
(1)A. hereof shall be adjusted on an actuarially equivalent basis to the amount
determined pursuant to paragraph (e)(1)A. hereof commencing at age sixty-five.
         E.   Benefits paid to a participant which total less than ten thousand
dollars ($10,000) from all defined benefit plans maintained by the employer,
expressed as an annual benefit, shall be deemed not to exceed the limitation of
this paragraph, provided that the employer has not, at any time, maintained a
defined contribution plan in which the participant has participated. However,
in the case of a participant with fewer than ten years of participation, the
limitation expressed in this paragraph shall be reduced by one-tenth for each
year of participation less than ten, but in no event shall this limitation be
less than one thousand dollars ($1,000).
         F.   The limitations expressed herein shall be based upon Plan years
for calculation purposes, shall be applied to all defined benefit plans
maintained by the employer as one defined benefit plan and to all defined
contribution plans maintained by the employer as one defined contribution plan,
and shall be applied and interpreted, consistent with Code Section 415 and
regulations thereunder, as applicable to government plans in general and this
Plan in particular.
   (f)   Required Distributions.
      (1)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the entire
benefit of any participant who becomes entitled to benefits prior to his or her
death shall be distributed either:
         A.   Not later than the required beginning date; or
         B.   Over a period beginning not later than the required beginning
date and extending over the life of such participant or over the lives of such
participant and a designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond
the life expectancy of such participant, or the joint life expectancies of such
participant and a designated beneficiary).
         If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this Plan dies
prior to the date when his or her entire interest has been distributed to him
or her after distribution of his or her benefits has begun in accordance with
paragraph (f)(1)B. hereof, the remaining portion of such benefit shall be
distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used
under paragraph (f)(1)B. hereof, as of the date of his or her death.
      (2)   If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this Plan dies
before distribution of his or her benefit has begun, the entire interest of
such employee shall be distributed within five years of the death of such
employee, unless the following sentence is applicable: If any portion of the
employee's interest is payable to (or for the benefit of) a designated
beneficiary, such portion shall be distributed over the life of such designated
beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such
beneficiary), and such distributions begin not later than one year after the
date of the employee's death or such later date as provided by regulations
issued by the Secretary of the Treasury, then for purposes of the five-year
rule set forth in the preceding sentence, the benefit payable to the
beneficiary shall be treated as distributed on the date on which such
distributions begin. However, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the
designated beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the participant, then the
date on which distributions are required to begin shall not be earlier than the
date upon which the employee would have attained age seventy and one-half.
Further, if the surviving spouse dies before the distributions to such spouse
begin, this paragraph shall be applied as if the surviving spouse were the
employee.
      (3)   For purposes of this subsection, the following definitions and
procedures shall apply:
         A.   "Required beginning date" means April 1 of the calendar year
following the later of the calendar year in which the employee attains age
seventy and one-half or the calendar year in which the employee retires.
         B.   "Designated beneficiary" means any individual designated by the
employee under this Plan according to its rules.
         C.   Any amount paid to a child shall be treated as if it had been
paid to the surviving spouse if such amount will be payable to the surviving
spouse upon such child's reaching majority (or other designated event permitted
under regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury).
         D.   The life expectancy of an employee and/or an employee's spouse
(other than in the case of a life annuity) may be redetermined, but not more
frequently than annually.
   (g)   Assignment of Benefits. The pension benefit payments prescribed herein
shall not be subject to attachment, execution, levy, garnishment or other legal
process, shall be payable only to the participant or designated beneficiary and
shall not be subject to assignment or transfer.
   (h)   Retired Participants. Any participant who has retired prior to the
restatement date shall not have the benefit altered in any way by the
provisions of this amended and restated Plan, except where otherwise expressly
provided herein. Such retired participants shall continue to have their
benefits governed by the terms of the Plan in effect on the day preceding the
restatement date.
(Ord. 2139. Passed 3-15-93.)
   (i)   Act 64 of 2002 - Ad Hoc Benefit Adjustment. Act 64 of 2002, which
amends Act 147 of 1988, was signed into law June 19, 2002. This law requires
that pension plans covering firefighters provide an ad hoc benefit adjustment
for retirees whose benefits began before January 1, 1996. The increase is the
sum of the following:
      (1)   Base adjustment of fifteen cents ($0.15) time number of whole years
of active service times number of whole years retired (as of January 1, 2001);
and
      (2)   Longevity adjustment equal to the base adjustment times the
longevity factor. The longevity factor is .025 times the number of whole years
retired (as of January 1, 2001), plus .05 times the number of whole years
retired (as of January 1, 2001).
(Ord. 2305. Passed 9-16-02.)
296.05   DISABILITY RETIREMENT.
   (a)   Entitlement to Benefit. A participant who incurs a total and permanent
disability as a result of and in the course of active rendering of services in
employment shall be entitled to a disability retirement benefit as of the
disability date.
   (b)   Amount of Benefit. A participant who is entitled to a disability
retirement benefit under subsection (a) hereof shall receive a benefit in an
amount equal to fifty percent of the participant's final monthly average
salary, as determined herein, as of the disability date. If a participant has
not completed at least three years of aggregate service, the participant's
final monthly average salary shall be determined based upon the actual service
rendered by the participant in employment, for purposes of this subsection.
   (c)   Payment of Benefits. Disability retirement benefit payments shall be
made monthly as of the first day of each month, commencing as of the first day
of the month coincident with or immediately following the participant's
disability date and continuing until the earliest of the death of the
participant or the cessation of total and permanent disability, or the
attainment of normal retirement age. Such a participant who attains normal
retirement age shall thereafter receive a normal retirement benefit pursuant to
Section
296.04(b), provided that such a participant shall not be entitled to payment of
the additional single sum distribution described in Section
296.04(b).
   A participant who fails to return within three months to employment as an
employee of the employer, upon the cessation of total and permanent disability
prior to the attainment of normal retirement age, shall be deemed to have
terminated employment as of the disability date, shall not be entitled to any
distribution of accumulated contributions pursuant to Section
294.07(b), to the extent that the total amount of disability payments exceeds
the value of the participant's accumulated contributions as of the disability
date, and shall not be entitled to any other benefits under the Plan on account
of any aggregate service as of the disability date.
   (d)   Verification of Disability. The Plan Administrator shall, in his or
her sole discretion, determine whether a participant has incurred a total and
permanent disability. The Plan Administrator shall rely on the report of a
physician acceptable to the Plan Administrator. If the Plan Administrator
determines that a participant who is totally and permanently disabled has
recovered sufficiently to resume active employment as a fire-fighter, or if a
participant refuses to undergo a medical examination as directed by the Plan
Administrator (such a medical examination may not be required more frequently
than once in any given twelve-month period), the payment of disability
retirement benefits shall cease.
   (e)   Cessation of Disability. A participant who is receiving payment of
disability retirement benefits under this Plan must notify the Plan
Administrator of any change which may cause a cessation of entitlement to
receipt of such benefits hereunder. If a participant fails to provide immediate
notice to the Plan Administrator of any such change in status and continues to
receive payment of benefits hereunder to which the participant is not entitled,
then the Plan Administrator may take whatever action is necessary to recover
any amount of improperly paid amounts, including legal action or offsetting
such amounts against any future payments of retirement or other benefits under
the Plan, including the cost of such actions.
(Ord. 2139. Passed 3-15-93.)
296.06   DEATH BENEFITS.
   (a)   Death of Participant. Upon the occurrence of the death of a
participant, benefits shall be payable in accordance with this section.
   (b)   Survivor Benefits. If a participant dies after commencement of benefit
payments hereunder or after the participant is eligible to retire under Section
296.04(a) and before retirement benefit payments commence, a survivor benefit
shall be paid to the surviving spouse, if any, of the participant, in an amount
equal to fifty percent of the participant's accrued benefit as of the date of
death. The survivor benefit shall be paid to the surviving spouse until the
earlier of the date of death or the remarriage of the surviving spouse. Upon
the death or remarriage of the surviving spouse, the survivor benefit shall be
paid monthly, in equal shares, to the surviving dependent children of the
deceased participant, until a total of ninety-six monthly payments have been
paid to the surviving spouse and dependent children combined or there ceases to
be any beneficiaries for receipt of the surviving benefit, whichever shall
first occur. Dependent children shall include the children of the deceased
participant who have not attained eighteen years of age. The shares payable to
the surviving dependent children shall be adjusted as each child ceases to be
eligible to receive a share of the benefit hereunder.
   (c)   Death of Participant Prior to Retirement. If a participant dies before
payment of a benefit has commenced and without eligibility for payment of a
survivor benefit under subsection (b) hereof, the beneficiary shall be eligible
to receive a distribution in an amount equal to the accumulated contributions
of the participant as of the date of death of the participant. If the
participant has received disability retirement benefits hereunder, the amount
of distribution of accumulated contributions shall be reduced by the amount of
disability retirement benefits which have been paid hereunder.
(Ord. 2139. Passed 3-15-93.)
296.07   TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.
   (a)   Rights of Terminated Employee. A participant who ceases to be an
employee, except as otherwise hereinbefore provided, shall have all interest
and rights under this Plan limited to those contained in this section.
   (b)   Distribution of Accumulated Contributions. A participant whose
employment with the employer shall terminate for any reason, other than death
or total and permanent disability, prior to the attainment of normal retirement
age, shall be entitled to receive a distribution of accumulated contributions.
Upon receipt of such accumulated contributions, said participant and
beneficiary shall not be entitled to any further payments from the Plan.
   (c)   Deferred Vested Benefits. A participant who has completed at least ten
years of aggregate service and whose employment with the employer shall
terminate for any reason, other than death or total and permanent disability
prior to the attainment of normal retirement age, shall be entitled to elect to
receive a deferred vested benefit in lieu of a distribution of accumulated
contributions under subsection (b) hereof. Such a deferred vested benefit shall
be in an amount equal to the participant's accrued benefit as of the date
employment terminates and shall commence after application pursuant to Section
296.04(d) as of the first day of the month coincident with or next following
the date on which the participant's normal retirement age would be attained if
the participant continued in employment until such date.
(Ord. 2139. Passed 3-15-93.)
296.08   ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Designation and Authority of Plan Administrator. The Plan
Administrator shall be the Fire-Fighters' Pension Board or the individual
appointed by Council who or which shall have the power and authority to do all
acts and to execute, acknowledge and deliver all instruments necessary to
implement and effectuate the purpose of this Plan. The Plan Administrator may
delegate authority to act on his or her or its behalf to any persons he or she
or it deems appropriate. If a Plan Administrator is not appointed, Council
shall be the Plan Administrator.
   (b)   Membership of Fire-Fighters' Pension Board. Council shall appoint a
Fire-Fighters' Pension Board to administer the affairs of the Plan and shall
delegate such authority as it shall deem appropriate to the Board. The Board
shall consist of five members, who shall be the President of Council, the
Manager, the Chairperson of the Public Safety Committee and two employees who
shall be elected by vote of the employees. Each member of the Board shall serve
in that capacity until the earliest of resignation, death, removal or
otherwise. Vacancies on the Board shall be filled in the same manner as the
position was originally filled.
   (c)   Powers and Duties of Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator shall
have full power and authority to do whatever shall in his or her or its
judgment, be reasonably necessary for the proper administration and operation
of the Plan. The interpretation or construction placed upon any term or
provision of the Plan by the Plan Administrator or any action of the Plan
Administrator taken in good faith shall, upon Council's review and approval
thereof, be final and conclusive upon all parties thereto, whether employees,
participants or other persons concerned. By way of specification and not
limitation, and except as specifically limited hereafter, the Plan
Administrator is hereby authorized to:
      (1)   Construe this Plan;
      (2)   Determine all questions affecting the eligibility of any employee
to participate herein;
      (3)   Compute the amount and source of any benefit payable hereunder to
any participant or beneficiary;
      (4)   Authorize any and all disbursements;
      (5)   Prescribe any procedure to be followed by any participant and/or
other person in filing any application or election;
      (6)   Prepare and distribute, in such manner as may be required by law or
as the Plan Administrator deems appropriate, information explaining the Plan;
      (7)   Require from the employer or any participant such information as
shall be necessary for the proper administration of the Plan; and
      (8)   Appoint and retain any individual to assist in the administration
of the Plan, including such legal, clerical, accounting and actuarial services
as may be required to any applicable law or laws.
   The Plan Administrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from or
modify the terms of the Plan or change or add to any benefits provided by the
Plan, or to waive or fail to apply any requirements of eligibility for benefits
under the Plan. Further, the Plan Administrator shall have no power to adopt,
amend or terminate the Plan, to select or appoint any trustee or to determine
or require any contributions to the Plan, said powers being exclusively
reserved to Council.
   (d)   Organization of Fire-Fighters' Pension Board. The Fire-Fighters'
Pension Board may organize itself in any manner deemed appropriate to
effectuate its purposes hereunder, subject to the following:
       (1)   The Board shall act by a majority of its members at the time in
office and such action may be taken either by vote at a meeting or in writing
without a meeting.
      (2)   The Board shall, from time to time, appoint a Chairperson, a
Secretary, who may be, but need not be, a Board member, and such other agents
as it may deem advisable.
      (3)   The Board may, from time to time, authorize any one or more of its
members to execute any document or documents, including any application,
request, certificate, notice, consent, waiver or direction, and shall notify
Council, in writing, of the name or names of the member or members so
authorized. In the absence of a designation, the Chairperson shall be deemed to
be so authorized. Any trustee or other fiduciary appointed hereunder shall
accept and be fully protected in relying upon any document executed by the
designated member or members (or the Chairperson in the absence of a
designation) as representing a valid action by the Board until the Board files
with such fiduciary a written revocation of such designation.
      (4)   The Board or its delegate shall maintain and keep such records as
are necessary for the efficient operation of the Plan or as may be required by
any applicable law, regulation or ruling and shall provide for the preparation
and filing of such forms or reports as may be required to be filed with any
governmental agency or department and with the participants and/or other
persons entitled to benefits under the Plan.
   (e)   Compensation and Expenses of Plan Administrator. The Plan
Administrator shall serve without compensation for services, unless otherwise
agreed by Council in writing. All reasonable expenses incident to the
functioning of the Plan Administrator, including, but not limited to, fees of
accountants, counsel, actuaries and other specialists, and other costs of
administering the Plan, may be paid from the Pension Fund upon approval by
Council, to the extent permitted under applicable law and not otherwise paid by
the employer.
   (f)   Liability. No member of Council, nor the Plan Administrator, the
enrolled actuary or any other person involved in the administration of the
Plan, shall be liable to any person on account of any act or failure to act,
which is taken or omitted to be taken in good faith, in performing their
respective duties under the terms of this Plan. To the extent permitted by law,
the employer shall, and hereby does agree to, indemnify and hold harmless the
Plan Administrator and each successor thereof and each of any such individual's
heirs, executors and administrators, and the delegates and appointees (other
than any person, bank, firm or corporation which is independent of the employer
and which renders services to the Plan for a fee) from any and all liability
and expenses, including counsel fees, reasonably incurred in any action, suit
or proceeding to which he or she or it is or may be made a party by reason of
being or having been a member, delegate or appointee of the Plan Administrator,
except in matters involving criminal liability or intentional or willful
misconduct. If the employer purchases insurance to cover claims of a nature
described above, then there shall be no right of indemnification, except to the
extent of any deductible amount under the insurance coverage or to the extent
of the amount the claims exceed the insured amount.
   (g)   Approval of Benefits. The Plan Administrator shall review and approve
or deny any application for retirement benefits within thirty days following
receipt thereof or within such longer time as may be necessary under the
circumstances. Any denial of an application for retirement benefits shall be in
writing and shall specify the reason for such denial.
   (h)   Appeals. Any person whose application for retirement benefits is
denied, who questions the amount of benefit paid, who believes a benefit should
have commenced which did not so commence, or who has some other claim arising
under the Plan ("claimant"), shall first seek a resolution of such claim under
the procedure hereinafter set forth.
      (1)   Any claimant shall file a notice of the claim with the Plan
Administrator, which notice shall fully describe the nature of the claim. The
Plan Administrator shall review the claim and make an initial determination
approving or denying the claim.
      (2)   If the claim is denied, in whole or in part, the Plan Administrator
shall, within ninety days (or such other period as may be established by
applicable law) from the time the application is received, mail notice of such
denial to the claimant. Such ninety-day period may be extended by the Plan
Administrator, if special circumstances so require, for up to ninety additional
days by the Plan Administrator's delivering notice of such extension to the
claimant within the first ninety-day period. Any notice hereunder shall be
written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and, if it is a
notice of denial, shall set forth the specific Plan provisions on which the
denial is based, an explanation of additional material or information, if any,
necessary to perfect such claim and a statement of why such material or
information is necessary, and an explanation of the review procedure.
      (3)   Upon receipt of notice denying the claim, the claimant shall have
the right to request a full and fair review by Council of the initial
determination. Such request for review must be made by notice to Council within
sixty days of receipt of such notice of denial. During such review, the
claimant or a duly authorized representative shall have the right to review any
pertinent documents and to submit any issues or comments in writing. Council
shall, within sixty days after receipt of the notice requesting such review (or
in special circumstances, such as where Council in its sole discretion holds a
hearing, within 120 days of receipt of such notice), submit its decision, in
writing, to the person or persons whose claim has been denied. The decision
shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties, shall be written in a
manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall contain specific
references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based.
      (4)   Any notice of a claim questioning the amount of a benefit in pay
status shall be filed within ninety days following the date of the first
payment which would be adjusted if the claim is granted, unless the Plan
Administrator allows a later filing for good cause shown.
      (5)   A claimant who does not submit a notice of a claim or a notice
requesting a review of a denial of a claim within the time limitations
specified above shall be deemed to have waived such claim or right to review.
(Ord. 2139. Passed 3-15-93.)
296.09   FIRE-FIGHTERS' PENSION FUND.
   (a)   Operation. Council is hereby authorized to hold and supervise the
investment of the assets of the Fire-Fighters' Pension Fund, subject to the
provisions of the laws of the Commonwealth and of this Plan and any amendment
thereto.
   The Pension Fund shall be used to pay benefits as provided in the Plan and,
to the extent not paid directly by the employer, to pay the expenses of
administering the Plan pursuant to authorization by the employer.
   The employer intends the Plan to be permanent and for the exclusive benefit
of its employees. It expects to make the contributions to the Pension Fund
required under the Plan. The employer shall not be liable in any manner for any
insufficiency in the Pension Fund. Benefits shall be payable only from the
Pension Fund and only to the extent that there are monies available therein.
   The Pension Fund shall consist of all funds held by the employer under the
Plan, including contributions made pursuant to the provisions hereof and the
investments, reinvestments and proceeds thereof. The Pension Fund shall be
held, managed and administered pursuant to the terms of the Plan. Except as
otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, the employer has exclusive authority
and discretion to manage and control the Pension Fund assets. The employer may,
however, appoint a trustee, custodian and/or investment manager, at its sole
discretion.
   (b)   Powers and Duties of Employer. With respect to the Pension Fund, the
employer shall have the following powers, rights and duties, in addition to
those vested in it elsewhere in the Plan or by law, unless such duties are
delegated:
      (1)   To retain, in cash, so much of the Pension Fund as it deems
advisable and to deposit any cash so retained in any bank or similar financial
institution (including any such institution which may be appointed to serve as
trustee hereunder), without liability for interest thereon.
      (2)   To invest and reinvest the principal and income of the Pension Fund
and to keep said Fund invested, without distinction between principal and
income, in securities which are, at the time, legal investments for fiduciaries
under the Pennsylvania Fiduciaries Investment Act, or as the same may be
subsequently modified or amended.
      (3)   To sell property held in the Fund, at either public or private
sale, for cash or on credit, at such times as it may deem appropriate; to
exchange such property; and to grant options for the purchase or exchange
thereof.
      (4)   To consent to and participate in any plan of reorganization,
consolidation, merger, extension or other similar plan affecting property held
in the Fund and to consent to any contract, lease, mortgage, purchase, sale or
other action by any corporation pursuant to any such plan.
      (5)   To exercise all conversion and subscription rights pertaining to
property held in the Fund.
      (6)   To exercise all voting rights with respect to property held in the
Fund and, in connection therewith, to grant proxies, discretionary or
otherwise.
      (7)   To place money, at any time, in a deposit bank deemed to be
appropriate for the purposes of this Plan, no matter where situated, including,
in those cases where a bank has been appointed to serve as trustee hereunder,
the savings department of its own commercial bank.
      (8)   To maintain and invest the assets of this Plan, on a collective and
commingled basis, with the assets of other pension plans maintained by the
employer, provided that the assets of each respective plan shall be accounted
for and administered separately.
      (9)   To invest the assets of the Pension Fund in any collective
commingled trust fund maintained by a bank or trust company, including any bank
or trust company which may act as a trustee hereunder. In this connection, the
commingling of the assets of this Plan with assets or other eligible,
participating plans through such a medium is hereby specifically authorized.
Any assets of the Plan which may be so added to such collective trusts shall be
subject to all of the provisions of the applicable declaration of trust, as
amended from time to time, which declaration, if required by its terms or by
applicable law, is hereby adopted as part of the Plan, to the extent of the
participation in such collective or commingled trust fund by the Plan.
      (10)   To make any payment or distribution required or advisable to carry
out the provisions of the Plan, provided that if a trustee is appointed by the
employer, such trustee shall make such distribution only at the direction of
the employer.
      (11)   To compromise, contest, arbitrate, enforce or abandon claims and
demands with respect to the Plan.
      (12)   To retain any funds or property subject to any dispute, without
liability for the payment of interest thereon, and to decline to make payment
or delivery thereof until final adjudication is made by a court of competent
jurisdiction.
      (13)   To pay, and to deduct from and charge against the Pension Fund,
any taxes which may be imposed thereon, whether with respect to the income,
property or transfer thereof, or upon or with respect to the interest of any
person therein, which the Fund is required to pay, and to contest, in its
discretion, the validity or amount of any tax, assessment, claim or demand
which may be levied or made against or in respect of the Pension Fund, the
income, property or transfer thereof, or in any matter or thing connected
therewith.
      (14)   To appoint any persons or firms (including, but not limited to,
accountants, investment advisors, counsel, actuaries, physicians, appraisers,
consultants, professional plan administrators and other specialists), or
otherwise act to secure specialized advice or assistance, as it deems necessary
or desirable in connection with the management of the Fund. To the extent not
prohibited by applicable law, the employer shall be entitled to rely
conclusively upon, and shall be fully protected in any action or omission taken
by it in good faith reliance upon, the advice or opinion of such persons or
firms, provided that such persons or firms were prudently chosen by the
employer, taking into account the interests of the participants and
beneficiaries and with due regard to the ability of the persons or firms to
perform their assigned functions.
      (15)   To retain the services of one or more persons or firms for the
management of (including the power to acquire and dispose of) all or any part
of the Fund assets, provided that each of such persons or firms is registered
as an investment advisor under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, is a bank
(as defined in that Act), or is an insurance company qualified to manage,
acquire or dispose of pension trust assets under the laws of more than one
state. In such event, the employer shall follow the directions of such
investment manager or managers, with respect to the acquisition and disposition
of Fund assets, but shall not be liable for the acts or omissions of such
investment manager or managers, nor shall it be under any obligation to review
or otherwise manage any Fund assets which are subject to the management of such
investment manager or managers. If the employer appoints a trustee, the trustee
shall not be permitted to retain such an investment manager, except with the
express written consent of the employer.
   In addition to the foregoing powers, the employer shall also have all of the
powers, rights and privileges conferred upon trustees by the Pennsylvania
Fiduciaries Investment Act, or as the same may be subsequently modified or
amended, and the power to do all acts, take all proceedings and execute all
rights and privileges, although not specifically mentioned herein, as the
employer may deem necessary to administer the Pension Fund.
   (c)   Investment of Funds. The employer shall not be required to make
separate investments for individual participants or to maintain separate
investments for each participant's account, but may invest contributions and
any profits or gains therefrom in common investments.
   (d)   Compensation and Expenses of Appointed Trustee. If a trustee is
appointed, the trustee shall be entitled to such reasonable compensation as
shall from time to time be agreed upon by the employer and the trustee, unless
such compensation is prohibited by law. Such compensation, and all expenses
reasonably incurred by the trustee in carrying out his or her functions, shall
constitute a charge upon the employer or the Pension Fund, which may be
executed at any time after thirty days written notice to the employer. The
employer shall be under no obligation to pay such costs and expenses, and, in
the event of its failure to do so, the trustee shall be entitled to pay the
same, or to be reimbursed for the payment thereof, from the Pension Fund.
   (e)   Periodic Accounting of Fund. If a trustee is appointed, the Pension
Fund shall be evaluated annually, or at more frequent intervals, by the
trustee, and a written accounting rendered as of each fiscal year end of the
Fund, and as of the effective date of any removal or resignation of the
trustee, and at such additional dates as requested by the employer, showing the
condition of the Fund and all receipts, disbursements and other transactions
effected by the trustee during the period covered by the accounting, based on
fair market values prevailing as of such date.
   (f)   Value. All determinations as to the value of the assets of the Pension
Fund, and as to the amount of the liabilities thereof, shall be made by the
employer or its appointed trustee, whose decisions shall be final and
conclusive and binding on all parties thereto, the participants and
beneficiaries and their estates. In making any such determination, the employer
or trustee shall be entitled to seek and rely upon the opinion of or any
information furnished by brokers, appraisers and other experts, and shall also
be entitled to rely upon reports as to sales and quotations, both on security
exchanges and otherwise as contained in newspapers and in financial
publications.
(Ord. 2139. Passed 3-15-93.)
296.10   AMENDMENTS.
   The employer may amend this Plan, at any time or from time to time, by an
instrument, in writing, executed in the name of the employer under its
Municipal seal by officers duly authorized to execute such instrument and
delivered to Council, provided, however, that:
   (a)   No amendment shall deprive any participant or any beneficiary of a
deceased participant of any of the benefits to which he or she is entitled
under this Plan, with respect to contributions previously made.
   (b)   No amendment shall provide for the use of funds or assets held under
this Plan other than for the benefit of employees, and no funds contributed to
this Plan or assets of this Plan shall, except as provided in Section
296.11(d), ever revert to or be used or enjoyed by the employer.
   (c)   No amendment to the Plan which provides for a benefit modification
shall be made, unless the cost estimate described in Section
296.12(c) has been prepared and presented to Council in accordance with the
Act.
(Ord. 2139. Passed 3-15-93.)
296.11   TERMINATION OF PLAN.
   (a)   Right to Terminate. The employer shall have the power to terminate
this Plan in its entirety at any time by an instrument, in writing, executed in
the name of the employer.
   (b)   Automatic Termination of Contributions. Subject to the provisions of
the Act governing financially distressed municipalities, the liability of the
employer to make contributions to the Pension Fund shall automatically
terminate upon liquidation or dissolution of the employer, upon its
adjudication as a bankrupt or upon the making of a general assignment for the
benefit of its creditors.
   (c)   Distribution Upon Termination. In the event of the termination of the
Plan, all amounts of vested benefits accrued by the affected participants as of
the date of such termination, to the extent funded on such date, shall be
nonforfeitable hereunder. In the event of termination of the Plan, the employer
shall direct either that the Plan Administrator continue to hold the vested
accrued benefits of participants in the Pension Fund in accordance with the
provisions of the Plan (other than those provisions relating to forfeitures),
without regard to such termination, until all funds have been distributed in
accordance with the provisions, or that the Plan Administrator immediately
distribute to each participant an amount equal to the vested accrued benefit to
the date of termination.
   If there are insufficient assets in the Pension Fund to provide for all
vested accrued benefits as of the date of Plan termination, priority shall
first be given to the distribution of any amounts attributable to mandatory or
voluntary employee contributions before assets are applied to the distribution
of any vested benefits attributable to other sources hereunder.
   All other assets attributable to the terminated Plan shall be distributed
and disposed of in accordance with the provisions of applicable law and the
terms of any instrument adopted by the employer which effects such termination.
   (d)   Residual Assets. If all liabilities to vested participants and any
others entitled to receive a benefit under the terms of the Plan have been
satisfied, and there remain any residual assets in the Pension Fund, such
residual assets remaining shall be returned to the employer, insofar as such

report or investigation required by the Act, or any other expenses which are
permissible under the terms of the Act and which are directly associated with
administering the Plan, shall be allowable administrative expenses, payable
from the assets of the Pension Fund. Such allowable expenses shall include, but

and investment management fees;
      (2)   Accounting expenses;

the expenses are necessary and reasonable and benefit the Plan, and provided,
further, that the Plan Administrator shall document all such expenses item by
item and, where necessary, hour by hour.
   (b)   Duties of Chief Administrative Officer. Such actuarial reports shall
be prepared and filed under the supervision of the Chief Administrative
Officer.
   The Chief Administrative Officer of the Plan shall determine the financial
requirements of the Plan on the basis of the most recent actuarial report and
shall determine the minimum Municipal obligation of the employer, with respect
to funding the Plan, for any given Plan year. The Chief Administrative Officer
shall submit the financial requirements of the Plan and the minimum Municipal
obligation of the employer to Council annually and shall certify the accuracy
of such calculations and their conformity with the Act.
   (c)   Benefit Plan Modifications. Prior to the adoption of any benefit plan
modification by the employer, the Chief Administrative Officer of the Plan
shall provide to Council a cost estimate of the proposed benefit plan
modification. Such estimate shall be prepared by an approved actuary, which
estimate shall disclose to Council the impact of the proposed benefit plan
modification on the future financial requirements of the Plan and the future
minimum Municipal obligation of the employer with respect to the Plan. (Ord.

Administrator, upon the receipt of satisfactory evidence that such participant
is so incapacitated and that another person or institution is maintaining him
or her, may provide for such payment of pension benefits hereunder to such
person or institution so maintaining him or her, and any such payments so made
shall be deemed for every purpose to have been made to such participant.

whatsoever against the employer or the Plan Administrator as a result of this
Plan, except those expressly granted to them hereunder. Nothing herein shall be

of the employer.
(Ord. 2139. Passed 3-15-93.)

      (2)   Park any vehicle in such a position that the vehicle is not

one or more proper coins of the United States as specified in the legend on the
parking meter. Upon the deposit of the coin or coins and placing the meter in
operation, the parking space may be lawfully occupied by the vehicle for the
time indicated on the meter. If any vehicle shall remain in any such parking

meter for the parking of that vehicle.
(1988 Code § 7-1098)

conduct through the public exhibition of obscene films and live theater
productions, the display and/or sale of obscene publications and the use of so-

(Ord. 2370. Passed 10-18-05.)
864.05   POLICE PROTECTION.
   (a)   The Chief of Police shall determine whether and to what extent
additional police protection is reasonably necessary for the public assembly,
parade, neighborhood association parade or block party for traffic control and
public safety. The Chief of Police shall base this decision on the size,
location, duration, time and date of the event, the expected sale or service of
alcoholic beverages, the number of streets and intersections blocked, and the
need to detour or preempt citizen travel and use of the streets and sidewalks.
The speech content of the event shall not be a factor in determining the amount
of police protection necessary. If possible, without disruption of ordinary
police services or compromise of public safety, regularly scheduled on-duty
personnel will police the event. If additional police protection for the public
assembly is deemed necessary by the Chief of Police, he or she shall so inform
the applicant for the permit. The applicant then shall have the duty to secure
the police protection deemed necessary by the Chief of Police at the sole
expense of the applicant.

association parades or block parties conducted for the sole purpose of public
issue speech protected under the First Amendment are not required to pay for
any police protection provided by the Borough.

parade or block party which is also subject to police protection fees shall not
be charged for police protection as a result of this chapter.
(Ord. 2370. Passed 10-18-05.)
864.06   STANDARDS FOR ISSUANCE.
   (a)   The Borough shall issue a permit as provided herein when, from a
consideration of the application and from such other information as may
otherwise be obtained, they find that:
      (1)   The conduct of the public assembly, parade, neighborhood
association parade or block party will not substantially interrupt the safe and
orderly movement of other pedestrian or vehicular traffic contiguous to its
route or location;
      (2)   The conduct of the public assembly, parade, neighborhood
association parade or block party will not require the diversion of so great a
number of Borough police officers to properly police the line of movement and
the areas contiguous thereto as to prevent normal police protection of the
Borough;
      (3)   The concentration of persons, animals and vehicles at public
assembly points of the public assembly, parade, neighborhood association parade
or block party will not unduly interfere with proper fire and police protection
of, or ambulance service to, areas contiguous to such public assembly;
      (4)   The conduct of the public assembly, parade, neighborhood
association parade or block party is not reasonably likely to cause injury to
persons or property;
      (5)   The public assembly, parade, neighborhood association parade or
block party is scheduled to move from its point of origin to its point of
termination expeditiously and without unreasonable delays en route;
      (6)   Adequate sanitation and other required health facilities are or
will be made available in or adjacent to any public assembly areas;
      (7)   There are sufficient parking places near the site of the public
assembly, parade, neighborhood association parade or block party to accommodate
the number of vehicles reasonably expected;
      (8)   The applicant has secured the police protection, if any, required
under Section
864.05;
      (9)   Such public assembly, parade, neighborhood association parade or
block party is not for the primary purpose of advertising any product, goods or
event that is primarily for profit and the parade itself is not primarily for
profit. The prohibition against advertising any product, goods or event shall
not apply to signs identifying organizations or sponsors furnishing or
sponsoring exhibits or structures used in the parade;
      (10)   No public assembly, parade, neighborhood association parade or
block party permit application for the same time and location is already
granted or has been received and will be granted;
      (11)   No public assembly, parade, neighborhood association parade or
block party permit application for the same time but different location is
already granted or has been received and will be granted, and the police
resources required for that prior public assembly, parade, neighborhood
association parade or block party are so great that in combination with the
subsequent proposed application, the resulting deployment of police services
would have an immediate and adverse effect upon the welfare and safety of
persons and property;
      (12)   No event is scheduled elsewhere in the Borough where the police
resources required for that event are so great that the deployment of police
services for the proposed public assembly, parade, neighborhood association
parade or block party would have an immediate and adverse effect upon the
welfare and safety of persons and property.
   (b)   No permit shall be granted that allows for the erection or placement
of any structure, whether permanent or temporary, on a Borough street,
sidewalk, or right-of-way unless specific approval is granted by the Borough as
part of the application for the public assembly, parade, neighborhood
association parade or block party permit.
(Ord. 2370. Passed 10-18-05.)
864.07   NON-DISCRIMINATION.
   The Borough shall uniformly consider each application upon its merits and
shall not discriminate in granting or denying permits under this chapter based

neighborhood association parade or block party permit, may authorize the

applicant. An applicant desiring to accept an alternate permit, shall, within
five days after notice of the action of the Borough, file a written notice of
acceptance with the Borough offices.
   (b)   An alternate public assembly, parade, neighborhood association parade
or block party permit shall conform to the requirements of, and shall have the
effect of, a public assembly, parade, neighborhood association parade or block
party permit issued under this chapter.
(Ord. 2370. Passed 10-18-05.)

866.01   GENERAL.
   After the effective date of this chapter, it shall be unlawful for any
person operating a food service establishment to be issued a yearly food
service permit without being in compliance with the Borough's FOG Ordinance.
(Ord. 2430. Passed 6-16-08.)
866.02   DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter, the following words and phrases, unless otherwise
distinctly expressed in this chapter, or manifestly incompatible with the
intent of a particular provision, shall be construed as follows:
   (a)   “Document of Certification” is an official statement from the proper
officer of the Borough stating that the food service establishment is in
compliance with the Borough's FOG Ordinance.
   (b)   “Food service establishment” means any commercial or public facility
that prepares and/or serves food or beverages for sale or consumption.
   (c)   “FOG” includes, but is not limited to, all residual fats, oils and
greases that are by-products from food service establishments. Some examples of
FOG include but are not limited to lard & cooking oils, meat fats, mayonnaise
and salad dressings, butter, ice cream and other dairy products, creams and
sauces, baked goods, and food scraps.
   (d)   “Person” means any person, syndicate, associate, partnership, firm,
corporation, institution, agency, authority, or any entity recognized by law as
the subject of rights and duties.
(Ord. 2430. Passed 6-16-08.)
866.03   DOCUMENT OF CERTIFICATION APPLICATION.
   (a)   Any person or entity operating a food service establishment located
within the Borough shall make application on a form furnished by the Borough at
least six months following the adoption of this chapter, or within six months
prior to the opening of any new food service establishment. The applicant shall
then permit a representative of the Wastewater Treatment Department to perform
a site inspection. The site inspection shall include but not be limited to
visual and photographic verification of a properly operating grease collection
unit, a records review that demonstrates proper maintenance of a grease
collection unit and proper disposal of any collected FOG.
   (b)   In the event that the food service establishment is found to be in
compliance, the Wastewater Treatment Plant Operator or his designate, upon
review of any required submitted documentation, shall issue a Document of
Certification. When an illegal connection or malfunctioning grease collection
unit is discovered by the means of the above-mentioned inspection, or
insufficient documentation as to the proper operation and disposal of any
grease disposal unit is discovered, no Document of Certification will be issued
until the illegal connections/malfunctioning system are corrected, or a proper
documentation system established, and the system is re-inspected and certified
satisfactory by the Wastewater Treatment Plant Operator or his designate. There
shall be a charge of one hundred and fifty dollars ($150.00) for the initial
application and inspection. The cost for re-inspection and subsequent yearly
inspections shall be based upon the actual man hours (minimum fifty dollars
($50.00)). All applicants shall apply for a building permit and pay the
appropriate fee(s).
(Ord. 2430. Passed 6-16-08.)
866.04   GREASE TRAP AND INTERCEPTOR INSTALLATION, MAINTENANCE, RECORD-KEEPING
AND REMOVAL.
   (a)   No later than six months after adoption of this chapter, all users
shall install grease traps or interceptors designed to limit the introduction,
contribution and discharge of greases into the Borough's wastewater collection
system or POTW. Grease traps and interceptors with appropriate sampling or
inspection points shall be installed at the user's expense whenever any user
operates a commercial, industrial, or institutional cooking establishment.
Grease traps and interceptors must have a minimum capacity of 1,000 gallons or
more as required to affect a grease concentration maximum of 200mg/l.
   (b)   Alternative methods of compliance may be approved by the Borough if
the user demonstrates that compliance with this chapter is impossible or
impractical at the time of adoption of this chapter as a result of limited
space. However, any such proposed alternative method of compliance will be
required to meet the performance criteria specified in subsection (a) hereof,
and the user must adequately demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Borough
that the proposed alternative method will satisfy those performance criteria.
In addition, any such alternative method must be cleaned at a more frequent
interval than is required of grease traps and interceptors under subsection (e)
hereof. Prior to approval of any such proposed alternative method of
compliance, documentation of the proposed method's actual performance criteria
must be submitted to the Borough for review and approval.
   (c)   Grease traps and interceptors may also be required in other
facilities, as deemed necessary by the Borough.
   (d)   Upon prior written approval of the Borough, non-cooking establishment
may be exempted from the requirements of this chapter after an inspection of
the subject premises and submission of adequate supporting documentation, as
deemed necessary, in the sole and absolute discretion of the Borough. At a
minimum, such supporting documentation shall include: blueprints of the subject
premises, a full and detailed description of the operations and activities at
the subject premises, and a full and detailed list of all potential sources of
grease at the subject premises.
   (e)   Users shall empty and service grease traps and interceptors to comply
with the performance criteria in subsection (a) hereof as often as necessary,
but in any event no longer than every sixty days. The Borough may require a
specific schedule if deemed necessary. Under-the-counter types of grease traps
and interceptors shall be cleaned at least daily and shall comply with the
performance criteria in subsection (a) hereof. There shall be no reintroduction
of wastewater back into the grease trap or interceptor unless said wastewater
has been proven to contain 100 mg/l or less of grease. Under no circumstances
shall the sludge or scum layer be reintroduced or discharged in the Borough's
wastewater collection system or POTW.
   (f)   Users shall supply an adequate sampling point downstream of the grease
trap or interceptor, prior to mixing with other sanitary flows, and accessible
entry into each chamber of grease trap or interceptor. The minimum requirement
for the sampling point shall be four inch vertical clean-out. The Borough shall
have the right to inspect at any time and without prior notice.
   (g)   Users shall retain detailed records on-site for a minimum of three
years reflecting maintenance carried out pursuant to this chapter. At a
minimum, such records shall contain the following information: date of service,
name of the employee involved, and a receipt reflecting all services rendered
by the waste hauler providing the service.
   (h)   Users are required to keep the grease trap or interceptor free of
inorganic solids such as grit, towels, gloves, cigarettes, eating utensils,
etc., which could clog or settle in the trap or interceptor, thereby reducing
the effective volume or capacity of the trap or interceptor.
   (i)   Users are required to ensure that all waste material removed from the
grease traps and interceptors is disposed of in a manner that complies with all
Federal, State and local statutes, rules, regulations, policies and ordinances.
   (j)   Except as provided herein, for a period of six months following the
adoption of this chapter, no enforcement actions will be taken under this
section for failure to achieve the performance criteria specified in subsection
(a) hereof. If during such period, an obstruction of any of the Borough's
sanitary sewer main(s) occurs and causes a sewer overflow, spill or leak or
other event with any environmental impact, and such overflow, spill, or leak or
other event may be attributed in part or in whole to a particular user, then
the Borough will seek enforcement action under the Sewer Use Ordinance (
Chapter 1040 of this Code of Ordinances), and/or the Industrial Wastewater
Pretreatment Regulations (
Chapter 1042 of this Code of Ordinances). For purposes of this section, an
overflow, spill, leak or other event shall be deemed to have an environmental
impact when such overflow or other event involves an amount of wastewater equal
to or in excess of 300 gallons, or any amount of wastewater reaches any body or
surface water.
(Ord. 2430. Passed 6-16-08.)
866.05   RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (a)   The Wastewater Treatment Plant Operator or his designate is hereby
authorized, empowered and directed to make reasonable rules and regulations for
the operation and enforcement of this chapter as he deems necessary, which
shall include, but not be limited to:
      (1)   Establishing acceptable forms of security or guarantees;
      (2)   Acceptable testing and inspection methods;
      (3)   Establishing the forms of applications, plumber certifications;
      (4)   Establishing proper documentation regulations for food service
establishments; and
      (5)   Establishing criteria for determination of applicability to food
service establishments.
   (b)   All rules and regulations issued pursuant to this section shall be in
writing and be approved by the Borough prior to such rules and regulations
being effective.
(Ord. 2430. Passed 6-16-08.)
866.06   ENFORCEMENT; DEFENSE OF CITATIONS.
   Nothing in this chapter shall limit, in any fashion whatsoever, the
Borough's rights to enforce any ordinance, resolution or law of the Borough or
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Nothing in this chapter shall be a defense of any
citation issued by any municipal corporation or the Commonwealth pursuant to
any other law, ordinance or resolution.
(Ord. 2430. Passed 6-16-08.)
866.07   VIOLATION.
   Failure of the food service establishment to provide, in the time frames
described, the subsequent required documentation and adoption of the best
management practices will result in a violation of this chapter. This violation
will result in an immediate Notice of Violation. The Notice of Violation shall
carry an automatic fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00) and provide the food
service establishment with ten calendar days from the date the Notice was
issued to correct the problem. Any person who shall fail, neglect or refuse to
comply with any of the terms or provisions of this chapter, or of any
regulation or requirement pursuant thereto and authorized thereby shall, upon
conviction before any district justice, be sentenced to pay a fine of one
thousand dollars ($1,000) and costs of prosecution, and in default of payment
thereof, to imprisonment for a term not to exceed ninety days.

private agency designated by the governing body to collect and administer the
tax on earned income and net profits.
   (i)   “Net profits” means the net income from the operation of a business,
profession or other activity, not including corporations, after provision for

making such return shall, at the time of filing thereof, pay to the Income Tax
Officer the amount of tax shown as due thereon.
      (1)   Every taxpayer who anticipates any income which is not subject to
the provisions of Section
880.05 shall file a declaration of the estimated tax for that part of the
taxable year beginning July 1, 1978, and ending December 31, 1978. Such
declaration for the taxable year beginning July 1, 1978, and ending December
31, 1978, shall be filed on or before October 31, 1978, and shall be
accompanied by a payment of at least one-half of the estimated tax due for the
said period, and at least a similar amount for the said period shall be paid on
or before January 31, 1979.
      (2)   Such declaration shall also be filed on or before April 30, 1979,
for the taxable calendar year of January 1, 1979, on or before April 30 of each
year for that calendar year during the life of this chapter by all such
taxpayers. Such declarations shall be filed upon a form furnished by the Income
Tax Officer, which form may simply state that the figures used in making such
declaration are the figures used in making the declaration of the estimate for
Federal Income Tax, provided, however, that it is understood that such figures
may be modified according to the provisions of this chapter so that the
declaration required by this section shall set forth only such income as is
taxable under the provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   On April 30, 1979, and for each calendar year thereafter that this
chapter is in effect, such a declaration of estimated tax to be paid to the
Borough shall be accompanied by a payment of at least one fourth of the
estimated annual tax, and at least a similar amount for such year, shall be
paid on or before July 31, October 31 and January 31 of such year, provided,
however, that such estimate may be amended at the time of making any quarterly
payment, and further provided that, on or before April 15 of the year following
that for which such declaration was filed, a final return shall be filed and
any balance which may be due to the Borough shall be paid therewith. Should it
then appear that such taxpayer has paid more than the amount of tax to which
the Borough would be entitled under the provisions of this chapter, a refund of
the amount so overpaid shall be made.

(Ord. 2008. Passed 3-17-87.)
886.03   IMPOSITION OF TAX; AUTHORITY.
   For general revenue purposes, there is hereby imposed a realty transfer tax
upon the transfer of real estate or interest in real estate situated within the
Borough, regardless of where the documents making the transfer are made,
executed or delivered, or where the actual settlements on such transfer took
place, as authorized by Article XI-D of the Tax Reform Code of 1971, Local Real
Estate Transfer Tax, 72 P.S. 8101-D et seq.
(Ord. 2008. Passed 3-17-87; Ord. 2416. Passed 10-15-07.)
886.04   APPLICATION; RATE; EVIDENCE OF PAYMENT; LIMITATIONS; INTEREST ON
UNPAID TAX.
   (a)   Whoever makes, executes, delivers, accepts or presents for recording
any document, or in whose behalf any document is made, executed, delivered,
accepted or presented for recording, shall be subject to pay a tax, for and in
respect to the transaction or any part thereof, at the rate of one percent of
the value of the real estate represented by such document, which is split fifty
percent with the Ellwood City Area School District. Such tax shall be payable
at the earlier of the time the document is presented for recording or within
thirty days of acceptance of such document or within thirty days of an entity
becoming an acquired company.
   (b)   The payment of the tax imposed by this chapter shall be evidenced by
the affixing of an official stamp or writing by the Recorder whereon the date
of the payment of the tax, the amount of the tax and the signature of the
collecting agent shall be set forth.
   (c)   It is the intent of this chapter that the entire burden of the tax
imposed herein on a person or transfer shall not exceed the limitations
prescribed in the Local Tax Enabling Act, being the Act of December 31, 1965,
P.L. 1257, 53 P.S. 6901 et seq., so that if any other political subdivision
shall now or hereafter impose such tax on the same person or transfer, then the
tax levied by the Borough under the authority of such Act shall, during the
time such duplication of the tax exists, except as hereinafter otherwise
provided, be one-half of the tax rate. Such one-half rate shall become
effective without any action on the part of the Borough, provided, however,
that the Borough and any other political subdivision which imposes such tax on
the same person or transfer may agree that, instead of limiting their
respective rates to one-half of the rate herein provided, they will impose
respectively different rates, the total of which shall not exceed the maximum
rate permitted under the Act.
   (d)   If, for any reason, the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate
in effect at the time the tax is due shall be added and collected.
(Ord. 2008. Passed 3-17-87; Ord. 2416. Passed 10-15-07.)
886.05   EXEMPTION FOR GOVERNMENTAL BODIES.
   The United States, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or any of their
instrumentalities, agencies or political subdivisions, shall be exempt from
payment of the tax imposed by this chapter. The exemption of such governmental
bodies shall not, however, relieve any other party to a transaction from
liability for the tax.
(Ord. 2008. Passed 3-17-87.)
886.06   EXCLUDED TRANSACTIONS.
   (a)   The tax imposed by Section
886.03 shall not be imposed upon:
      (1)   A transfer to the Commonwealth, or any of its instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions, by gift, dedication or deed, in lieu of
condemnation or deed of confirmation in connection with condemnation
proceedings, or a reconveyance by the condemning body of the property condemned
to the owner of record at the time of condemnation, which reconveyance may
include property line adjustments, provided that said reconveyance is made
within one year from the date of condemnation;
      (2)   A document which the Borough is prohibited from taxing under the
Constitution or statutes of the United States;
      (3)   A conveyance to a municipality, township, school district or
county, pursuant to acquisition by such municipality, township, school district
or county of a tax delinquent property at sheriff sale or Tax Claim Bureau
sale;
      (4)   A transfer, for no or nominal actual consideration, which corrects
or confirms a transfer previously recorded, but which does not extend or limit
existing record legal title or interest;
      (5)   A transfer or division in kind, for no or nominal actual
consideration, of property passed by testate or intestate succession and held
by cotenants, provided, however, that if any of the parties take shares greater
in value than his or her undivided interest, tax shall be due on the excess;
      (6)   A transfer between husband and wife; between persons who were
previously husband and wife who have since been divorced, provided that the
property or interest therein subject to such transfer was acquired by the
husband and wife or husband or wife prior to the granting of the final decree
in divorce; between parent and child or the spouse of such child; between
brother and sister or the spouse of a brother or sister; and between a
grandparent and grandchild or the spouse of such grandchild; except that a
subsequent transfer by the grantee within one year shall be subject to tax as
if the grantor were making such transfer;
      (7)   A transfer, for no or nominal actual consideration, of property
passing by testate or intestate succession from a personal representative of a
descendant to the descendants, devisee or heir;
      (8)   A transfer, for no or nominal actual consideration, to a trustee of
an ordinary trust, where the transfer of the same property would be exempt if
the transfer was made directly from the grantor to all of the possible
beneficiaries, whether or not such beneficiaries are contingent or specifically
named. No such exemption shall be granted unless the Recorder of deeds is
presented with a copy of the trust instrument that clearly identifies the
grantor and all possible beneficiaries;
      (9)   A transfer, for no or nominal consideration, from a trustee to a
beneficiary of an ordinary trust;
      (10)   A transfer, for no or nominal actual consideration, from a trustee
to a successor trustee;
      (11)   A transfer:
         A.   For no or nominal actual consideration, between a principal and
agent or a straw party; or
         B.   From or to an agent or straw party where, if the agent or straw
party were the principal, no tax would be imposed under this chapter. Where the
document by which title is acquired by a grantee or the statement of value
fails to set forth that the property was acquired by the grantee from, or for
the benefit of, his or her principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that
the property is the property of the grantee in his or her individual capacity
if the grantee claims an exemption from taxation under this paragraph;
      (12)   A transfer made pursuant to the statutory merger or consolidation
of a corporation or the statutory division of a non-profit corporation, except
where the State Department of Revenue reasonably determines that the primary
intent for such merger, consolidation or division is avoidance of the tax
imposed by this chapter;
      (13)   A transfer from a corporation or association of real estate held
of record in the name of the corporation or association where the grantee owns
stock of the corporation or an interest in the association in the same
proportion as his or her interest in or ownership of the real estate being
conveyed, and where the stock of the corporation or the interest in the
association has been held by the grantee for more than two years;
      (14)   A transfer from a nonprofit industrial development agency or
authority to a grantee of property conveyed by the grantee to that agency or
authority as security for a debt of the grantee or a transfer to a nonprofit
industrial development agency or authority;
      (15)   A transfer from a nonprofit industrial development agency or
authority to a grantee purchasing directly from it, but only if:
         A.   The grantee shall directly use such real estate for the primary
purpose of manufacturing, fabricating, compounding, processing, publishing,
research and development, transportation, energy conversion, energy production,
pollution control, warehousing or agriculture; and
         B.   The agency or authority has the full ownership interest in the
real estate being transferred;
      (16)   A transfer by a mortgagor to the holder of a bona fide mortgage in
default in lieu of a foreclosure, or a transfer pursuant to a judicial sale in
which the successful bidder is the bona fide holder of a mortgage, unless the
holder assigns the bid to another person;
      (17)   Any transfer between religious organizations or other bodies or
persons holding title for a religious organization, if such real estate is not
being or has not been used by such transferor for commercial purposes;
      (18)   A transfer to a conservancy which possesses a tax exempt status
pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, (68A Stat.
3, 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)), and which has as its primary purpose preservation of
land for historic, recreational, scenic, agricultural or open space
opportunities;
      (19)   A transfer of real estate devoted to the business of agriculture
to a family farm corporation by a member of the same family which directly owns
at least seventy-five percent of each class of the stock thereof;
      (20)   A transfer between members of the same family of an ownership
interest in a real estate company or family farm corporation;
      (21)   A transfer whereon the tax due is one dollar ($1.00) or less; and
      (22)   Leases for the production or extraction of coal, oil, natural gas
or minerals and assignments thereof.
   (b)   In order to exercise any exclusion provided in this section, the true,
full and complete value of the transfer shall be shown on the statement of
value. A copy of the Pennsylvania Realty Transfer Tax Statement of Value may be
submitted for this purpose. For leases of coal, oil, natural gas or minerals,
the statement of value may be limited to an explanation of the reason such
document is not subject to tax under this chapter.
(Ord. 2008. Passed 3-17-87.)
886.07   TAXABLE DOCUMENTS.
   Except as otherwise provided in Section
886.06, documents which make, confirm or evidence any transfer or demise of
title to real estate between associations or corporations and the members,
partners, shareholders or stockholders thereof, are fully taxable. For the
purposes of this chapter, corporations and associations are entities separate
from their members, partners, stockholders or shareholders.
(Ord. 2008. Passed 3-17-87.)
886.08   ACQUIRED COMPANIES.
   (a)   A real estate company is an acquired company upon a change in the
ownership interest in the company, however effected, if the change does not
affect the continuity of the company; and if the change, of itself or together
with prior changes, has the effect of transferring, directly or indirectly,
ninety percent or more of the total ownership interest in the company within a
period of three years.
   (b)   With respect to real estate acquired after February 16, 1986, a family
farm corporation is an acquired company when, because of voluntary or
involuntary dissolution, it ceases to be a family farm corporation, or when,
because of issuance or transfer of stock or because of acquisition or transfer
of assets that are devoted to the business of agriculture, it fails to meet the
minimum requirements of a family farm corporation under this chapter.
   (c)   Within thirty days after becoming an acquired company, the company
shall present a declaration of acquisition with the recorder of each county in
which it holds real estate for the affixing of documentary stamps and
recording. Such declaration shall set forth the value of real estate holdings
of the acquired company in such county. A copy of the Pennsylvania Realty
Transfer Tax Declaration of Acquisition may be submitted for this purpose.
(Ord. 2008. Passed 3-17-87.)
886.09   TAX CREDITS.
   (a)   Where there is a transfer of residential property by a licensed real
estate broker, which property was transferred to him or her within the
preceding year as consideration for the purchase of other residential property,
a credit for the amount of the tax paid at the time of transfer shall be given
to him or her toward the amount of the tax due upon the transfer.

grantor, a credit for the amount of tax paid at the time of the lease shall be
given to the grantor toward the tax due upon the transfer.
   (d)   Where there is a conveyance by deed of real estate which was
previously sold under a land contract by the grantor, a credit for the amount

under this section, the difference shall be paid. If the credit allowed is
greater than the amount of tax due, no refund or carryover credit shall be
allowed.
(Ord. 2008. Passed 3-17-87.)
886.10   DETERMINATION OF TERMS OF LEASES.

option to renew or extend a lease will be exercised if the rental charge to the
lessee is fixed or if a method for calculating the rental charge is
established.
(Ord. 2008. Passed 3-17-87.)
886.11   DISPOSITION OF PROCEEDS OF JUDICIAL SALES.
   The tax imposed by this chapter shall be fully paid, out of the proceeds of
any judicial sale of real estate and shall have priority before any other
obligation, claim, lien, judgment, estate or costs of the sale and of the writ
upon which the sale is made, except for the State Realty Transfer Tax. The
sheriff or other officer conducting said sale shall pay the tax herein imposed
out of the first monies paid in connection therewith. If the proceeds of the
sale are insufficient to pay the entire tax herein imposed, the purchaser shall
be liable for the remaining tax.

7, 1983 (P.L. 40, No. 21), the Recorder of Deeds shall be the collection agent
for the local realty transfer tax, including any amount payable to the Borough
based on a redetermination of the amount of tax due by the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania of the State realty transfer tax, without compensation from the
Borough.

statement of value showing what taxes are due each municipality.
   (c)   On or before the tenth of each month, the Recorder shall pay over to
the borough all local realty transfer taxes collected, less two percent for the
use of the County, together with a report containing the information as is

transfer tax. The two percent commission shall be paid to the County.
   (d)   Upon a redetermination of the amount of realty transfer tax due by the
Commonwealth, the Recorder shall re-record the deed or record the additional
transfer tax form only when both the State and local amounts and a re-recording

shall set forth therein and as a part of such document the true, full and
complete value thereof, or shall be accompanied by a statement of value
executed by a responsible person connected with the transaction, showing such
connection and setting forth the true, full and complete value thereof or the

to any excludable real estate transfers which are exempt from taxation based on
family relationship. Other documents presented for the affixing of stamps shall

executed by a responsible person connected with the transaction, showing such
connection and setting forth the true, full and complete value thereof or the
reason, if any, why such document is not subject to taxation under this
chapter.

886.14   UNDERPAYMENTS; FAILURE TO RECORD DECLARATIONS.
   (a)   If any part of any underpayment of tax imposed by this chapter is due
to fraud, there shall be added to the tax an amount equal to fifty percent of
the underpayment.
   (b)   In the case of failure to record a declaration required under this
chapter on the date prescribed therefor, unless it is shown that such failure
is due to reasonable cause, there shall be added to the tax five percent of the
amount of such tax if the failure is not for more than one month, with an
additional five percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during
which such failure continues, not to exceed fifty percent in the aggregate.
(Ord. 2008. Passed 3-17-87.)
886.15   UNPAID TAXES AS LIENS.
   The tax imposed by this chapter shall become a lien upon the lands,
tenements or hereditaments, or any interest therein, lying or being situated
wholly or in part within the boundaries of the Borough, which lands, tenements,
hereditaments or interest therein are described in or conveyed or transferred
by the deed which is the subject of the tax imposed, assessed and levied by

1022.11   SIDEWALK CAFÉ.
   (a)   Declaration of Necessity and Intent. It is hereby found and declared:
      (1)   That there exists the need for outdoor eating establishment
(sidewalk cafés) in the pedestrian oriented areas of the Borough to provide a
unique environment for relaxation and food consumption.
      (2)   That because of the high intensity of development in certain
commercial zoning districts in the downtown area and along commercial

redevelopment of existing structures, there exists a need to provide an
opportunity for sidewalk cafés to be located on sidewalks in the public right-
of-way.
      (3)   That the existence of sidewalk cafés encourages additional
pedestrian traffic to these areas and encourages more activity in pedestrian
oriented areas and redevelopment.
      (4)   That the presence of sidewalk cafés may impede the flow of
pedestrian traffic.
      (5)   That there is a need for regulations and standards for the
existence and operation of sidewalk cafés to facilitate and ensure a safe
environment in these areas.
      (6)   That the establishment of café zones, permit conditions and safety
standards for sidewalk cafés is necessary to protect and promote the general
health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the Borough.
      (7)   That the issuance of a sidewalk café permit shall not constitute
nor shall it be construed to constitute a vacation or abandonment by the
Borough of its interest in the right- of-way or any easements contained
therein.

   (i)   Access to private driveways shall be provided except during working
hours when construction operations prohibit such access. The permittee must
notify property owners in advance whenever a driveway is to be blocked. Free
access must be provided at all times to fire hydrants.
   (j)   Excavations shall be in two classes: that portion in the area outside
the cartway and that portion within the cartway.
      (1)   For excavations in any area other than the cartway, excavated
materials shall be laid compactly along the side of the trench and kept trimmed
up so as to cause as little inconvenience as possible to public travel. In
order to expedite the flow of traffic or to abate a dirt or dust nuisance, the
Director may require the permittee to provide toe boards or bins, and if the
excavated area is muddy and causes inconvenience to pedestrians, temporary
wooden plank walks shall be installed by the permittee as directed by the
Director. If the street is not wide enough to hold the excavated material
without using part of the adjacent sidewalk, the permittee shall keep a
passageway at least one-half the sidewalk width open along such sidewalk line.
      (2)   For excavations within the cartway, all excavating material shall
be wasted and removed from the site. This shall be done at the time of
excavation or after excavation backfill has been completed. If excavation
material is left at the site until after completion of the work, all conditions
stated in paragraph (j)(1) hereof shall be complied with.
   (k)   Work authorized by a permit shall be performed between the hours of 7:
00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., Monday through Saturday, unless the permittee obtains
written consent from the Director to do the work at an earlier or later hour.
Such permission shall be granted only in the case of an emergency or in the
event that the work authorized by the permit is to be performed in traffic-
congested areas.
   (l)   In granting any permit, the Director may attach such other conditions
thereto as may be reasonably necessary to prevent damage to public or private
property, or to prevent the operation from being conducted in a manner
hazardous to life or property or in a manner likely to create a nuisance. Such
conditions may include, but shall not be limited to:
      (1)   Limitations on the period of time of the year in which the work may
be performed;
      (2)   Restrictions as to the size and type of equipment;
      (3)   Designation of routes upon which materials may be transported;

various locations, as directed, i.e. gravel meeting the requirements of Section
350, “Subbase,” of the Penn DOT Specifications Manual Form 408, most recent
edition, for single course gradation band option with one inch top size or
approved alternative.
      (2)   Special trench backfill. Crushed stone meeting or exceeding the
requirements of Section 677 of the Penn DOT Specifications Manual Form 408,
most recent edition, for 2RC aggregate, Type A or better, material.
      (3)   Asphalt pavement. Eight-inch concrete meeting or exceeding the
specifications as stated in paragraph (m)(5) hereof, with a minimum of one and
one-half inch of ID-2A wearing course, meeting or exceeding the requirements of
Section 420 of Penn DOT Specifications Manual Form 408, the most recent
edition.
      (4)   Grass seed. Grass seed for surface restoration of all off-street,
private right-of-way areas, which seed shall meet or exceed the requirements of
Section 804 of Penn DOT Specifications Manual Form 408, the most recent
edition, for Formula B materials of the following mix by weight, or approved
equal:
         Perennial Ryegrass (Pennfine or Manhattan)   20%
         Pennlawn Red Fiscue   30%
         Kentucky Bluegrass   50%
      (5)   Concrete. Class A, 6.0 bags/CY minimum mix for a compressive
strength of 2,750 psi @ 7 days and 3,300 psi @ 28 days and flexural strengths
of 500 psi @ 7 days and 600 psi @ 28 days. Any street opening on a concrete
road must be cut joint to joint, one full lane, pinned, poured and at least ten
inches thick with wire mesh, according to PennDot specifications.
   (n)   During the progress of the work, the permittee shall accommodate both
vehicular and pedestrian traffic and shall provide unobstructed access to fire
hydrants, and to water and gas valves. Gutters and waterways must be kept open
or other provisions made for the removal of storm water. Street intersections
may be blocked one-half at a time, and the permittee shall lay and maintain
temporary driveways, bridges and crossings as, in the opinion of the Engineer,
are necessary to reasonably accommodate the traveling public.
   (o)   The following regulations shall govern excavations in and around
existing utilities:
      (1)   The permittee will be required, at his or her own expense, to
protect, support and sustain all sewer, water, gas or service pipes and
electric light, power, telephone or telegraph poles, conduits and other
fixtures laid across or along the line of the utility, whether such facilities
are public or private. Damage to any private sewer shall be repaired by the
permittee.
      (2)   The Engineer, as well as the company or corporation owning any
Municipal or utility company pipes, poles or conduits, must be notified by the
permittee before any such facilities are removed or molested. In case any water
or sewer lines, or any utility company, gas or electric facilities, including
service connections and/or appurtenances, are damaged, they shall be repaired
by the authorities having control of the same, and the expense of said repairs
shall be paid by the permittee directly. Existing private sewer service lines
which are damaged, disrupted or taken up by a contractor's operations shall be
reconnected and restored to full service by and at the expense of the
permittee. The permittee shall also be responsible for the maintenance of
damaged sections of private service laterals for the full term of the warranty
period.
      (3)   It shall be the responsibility of the permittee to ascertain and
verify the actual location and elevation of existing pipelines or buried
conduits in the path of the work before commencing an excavation.
   (p)   All excavations which are four feet or more in depth, which exceed any
State or Federal regulatory agency's stipulated maximum depth for unshored
excavations, or which are made in unstable material, such that shoring is
necessary to facilitate proper and safe working conditions, shall be shored.
All shoring shall meet or exceed O.S.H.A. or State Labor Department
requirements. Shoring shall consist of timber or metal sheeting supported by a
sound system of cross jacks acting against a sheeting whaler grid. As an
alternative to shoring by sheeting, a permittee may employ an approved type of
trench box of reinforced steel construction and workmen shall conduct work from
within such box.
   (q)   An excavation involving the removal of bituminous or concrete paving
in streets, private drives and parking area trenching situations shall be
accomplished by sawing or cutting the improved surface at the edges of the
proposed trench at points one foot on either side of the trench opening at
ground surface. Sawing or cutting shall extend to the full depth of the
existing surface. Where existing surfaces are damaged, taken up, undercut or
unraveled by construction excavations operations or water breakages which
extend beyond the original saw or cut marks for removal, the permittee, in
restoring such bituminous or concrete surfaces to their original condition,
shall re-saw or cut the surface to a straight and even line six feet beyond the
furthest point of damage.
   (r)   When temperatures fall to 32° Fahrenheit, all grouting and concrete
materials entering into the construction are to be preheated and used while
warm. When any mortar or cement concrete work is carried out under freezing
conditions, the heated area must be maintained for at least 24 hours or the
installation shall be protected from frost by covering the same with hay, straw
or a similar substance to a depth of at least two feet before auxiliary heat is
removed. Where areas cannot be appropriately protected by covering with hay or
straw, and where it is impractical to completely cover the work area with an
enclosure and heat the work area to at least 40° Fahrenheit, the work shall be
suspended.
   (s)   A trench shall be excavated along the lines proposed by the permit
holder and approved by the Engineer. All trenches shall have vertical sides. No
tapering of sides shall be permitted unless approved in writing. The width of
the trench, unless otherwise approved, shall be six inches minimum and 18
inches maximum on each side of the utility pipe. The bottom of the trench shall
be hollowed out so as to allow the body of the pipe to have a bearing
throughout on the trench bottom. Ground adjacent to all excavations shall be
graded to prevent water running in. Any accumulated water in the excavation
shall be removed by pumping or other means approved by the Engineer prior to
the placement of pipes or utilities and before backfill is begun.

required, the permittee shall waste all excavated native materials and shall be
solely responsible for arrangements for wasting such materials. The permittee
shall then apply specified crushed aggregate in maximum lifts of 24 inches and
mechanically tamp the same into place using an approved type pad compactor and
methods for the full depth of the excavation or to the level of the required
base course. In all cases where an excavation has taken place in a paved
roadway or an area proposed to be paved, each layer shall be compacted to
densities equal to that of the adjacent original material so that pavement can
be placed or replaced immediately. The permittee must notify the Director no
less than 24 hours prior to beginning the backfilling of excavations.
   (c)   The following regulations shall govern surface restoration:
      (1)   The permittee is totally responsible for effecting surface
restoration in kind. In improved pavement areas, whether such paving is public
or private, if the existing pavement is asphalt or bituminous concrete, after
sawcutting, as specified, the damaged area of the existing pavement structure
shall be removed and the repair area undercut to receive an eight- inch asphalt
concrete pavement structure installation. In undercutting to receive the
replacement pavement structure, the bottom of the excavation shall be given a
ten-inch lift of crushed aggregate base course leveled to true lines and grades
and mechanically tamped to achieve maximum compaction. Thereupon, the permittee
shall install eight inches of concrete and a minimum of one and one-half inch
lift of ID-2A top material meeting the requirements of Section
1024.13(m)(3). However, the top of the eight inches of concrete shall not be
any higher than the top of the existing base material and shall not extend up
into the asphalt surface material. The surface course shall then be finished
with ID-2A top material to provide a smooth and uniform surface with the
existing surface. If the existing bituminous surface is less than one and one-
half inches, the concrete shall be held lower to allow a minimum of one and
one-half inches of ID-2A top material. The contractor shall seal all joints
after paving is complete. If the existing pavement is cement concrete, the
minimum width of replaced concrete pavements shall be four feet at interiors
and six feet at joints. In excavations occurring under existing pavement, where
the pavement has been removed, a sub-base course of concrete, eight inches in
thickness, shall be placed extending at least one foot onto each side of the
unexcavated portion of the trench top. If the existing surface or pavement
material is other than asphalt or concrete, the former pavement shall be
replaced with a pavement comparable to that which had been removed.
      (2)   The permittee may temporarily restore the surface whenever it is
impractical to immediately effect final, permanent surface restoration. A
temporary restoration shall be identical to final permanent restoration, except
that asphaltic, concrete or matching surface materials may be substituted with
crushed aggregate, as specified, for a period not exceeding 30 days.
      (3)   The permittee shall be totally responsible for surface restoration,
including vegetation of all previously seeded areas disturbed by the project.
Disturbed areas shall be restored as nearly as possible to original conditions.
The permittee shall be required to grade the area to match adjacent contours,
apply topsoil and nutrients as required to develop permanent grasses, and seed
and mulch all such disturbed areas. The permittee shall be encouraged to strip
and stockpile topsoil prior to trenching or excavation operations, with such
stockpiled topsoil to be returned for disturbed area restoration. Grass seed
for surface restoration of all off-street private right-of-way areas shall be
of the mix design as specified.
   (d)   All work, including pavement cuts, openings, test holes, excavations,
backfilling, proper bridging of the excavation and final restoration of the
surface, shall be done by the permittee in accordance with Borough regulations
and specifications and under the inspection of the Director. A permittee may
contract the work to be done by others, but the permittee shall be responsible
and liable for all such work done the same as if the work had been done by the
permittee.
   (e)   Disturbed portions of the highway, including, but not limited to,
slopes and appurtenances and structures such as guide rails, curbs, signs,
markings, drain pipes, driveways and vegetation, shall be restored by the
permittee to a condition at least equal to that which existed before the start
of work authorized by the permit, if the restoration is consistent with the
“Roadway Construction Standards”. Additional restoration may also be required,
upon written notification, to restore the structural integrity of the pavement
or shoulder. If the permittee opens pavement having a bituminous concrete
surface and the Department's wearing course is less than five years old, the
permittee shall, in addition to the restoration conditions outlined in the
permit and in this section, overlay the pavement in accordance with the
following conditions:
      (1)   When a longitudinal opening longer than 100 linear feet has been
made in the pavement, the permittee shall overlay the traffic lanes in which
the opening was made, for the entire length of highway that was opened, in a
manner authorized by the Department.
      (2)   When two or more openings are made in any one block, the permittee
shall overlay the traffic lanes in which the openings were made for the entire
length of highway between the openings plus 11 feet on each side of the
opening.
      (3)   When four or more openings have been made by the same permittee at
any time within 100 linear feet of pavement, the permittee shall overlay
traffic lanes in which the openings were made, for the entire length of highway
between the openings, in a manner authorized by the Department.
   (f)   After an excavation is commenced, the work of making and backfilling
the same shall be prosecuted with due diligence.
   (g)   The Director shall make such inspections as he or she may deem
necessary of all work authorized by a permit. The Director is hereby empowered
to provide a full-time inspector, if necessary, to ensure compliance with the
provisions of this chapter.
   (h)   All inspection costs shall be borne by the permittee. Such costs shall
be based on a schedule of fees adopted by Council from time to time.
   (i)   The permittee shall be responsible for all work performed by him or
her and for a period of two years from the date of final inspection and
approval by the Director. The Director shall record the date and time of the
final inspection and acceptance on the appropriate forms. One copy shall be
retained by the Borough and one copy shall be sent to the permittee.
   (j)   If, during the two-year period provided for in subsection (i) hereof,
the Director determines that settlement of the restored area occurs, the
surface area deteriorates, cracks or fails, or any other condition occurs which
indicates failure of the restored area, the Director shall inform the
permittee, in writing, and the permittee shall make the necessary corrections
and/or repairs as directed by the Director.
   (k)   In no case shall any opening made by the permittee be considered in
the charge or care of the Borough or any of its officers or employees, and no
officer or employee is authorized in any way to take or assume any jurisdiction
over any such opening, except in the exercise of the police power, when it is
necessary to protect life and property.
   (l)   Anytime an intersection is crossed or a curb is cut at an
intersection, handicap ramps must be installed in all directions regardless of
adjacent sidewalks, in accordance with State regulations.

of any term or condition of a permit, written notice thereof shall be given to
the permittee and the bonding company. Such notice shall include the work to be
done, the estimated cost thereof and the period of time necessary for the
completion of the work.
(Ord. 1996. Passed 8-19-86.)

time therein specified, either cause the required work to be performed or,
failing therein, indemnify the Borough for the cost of doing the work as set
forth in the notice.
(Ord. 1996. Passed 8-19-86.)
1024.18   INSURANCE.
   Each applicant, prior to the receipt of a permit, shall provide the Borough
with an acceptable certificate of insurance indicating that the applicant is
insured against claims for damage which may arise from or out of the
performance of the work, whether such performance is by the applicant, his or
her subcontractor or anyone directly or indirectly employed by him or her. Such
insurance shall cover collapse, explosive hazards and underground work by
equipment on the street, and shall include protection against liability arising
from completed operations. In order to protect the Borough and the permittee,
the permittee shall provide a certificate of liability insurance in the amount
of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) for each occurrence or five hundred
thousand dollars ($500,000) aggregate for bodily injury, and two hundred fifty
thousand dollars ($250,000) for each occurrence and two hundred fifty thousand
dollars ($250,000) aggregate for property damage. Public utilities and
authorities may submit annually such evidence of insurance coverage in lieu of
individual submissions for each permit.
(Ord. 1996. Passed 8-19-86.)

   When the Borough improves or paves any street, the Secretary/Treasurer shall
give notice to all persons owning property abutting on the street about to be
paved or improved, and to all public utilities and Municipal authorities
operating in the Borough, and all such persons, public utilities and Municipal
authorities shall make all connections, as well as any repairs thereto, which
would necessitate excavation of the street, within forty-five days from the
giving of such notice. The time shall be extended if permission is requested in
writing and approved by the Manager after consultation with the Director and
the Engineer.
(Ord. 1996. Passed 8-19-86.)
1024.20   NEW STREETS.
   No permit shall be issued by the Director which would allow an excavation or
opening in a paved and improved street surface less than five years old, unless
the applicant can clearly demonstrate that the public health or safety require
that the proposed work be permitted, or unless an emergency condition exists.
(Ord. 1996. Passed 8-19-86.)
1024.21   SUBSURFACE FACILITIES LIST OR MAP.
   (a)   Every person owning, using, controlling or having an interest in

the manner in which the Borough may direct, for the purpose of discharging such
drainage or waste matter as the Borough may specify. However, any property
located as herein provided shall not be required to be connected with the
sanitary sewer if:
      (1)   In the judgment of Council, upon appeal thereto by the owner or
owners of such property, the connection of such property with the sanitary
sewer would be physically impracticable and unreasonably expensive; and
      (2)   If one or more septic tanks are provided by such property owner for
the disposal of the drainage and waste from such property.
   (b)   No privy shall hereafter be constructed or maintained at any location
within the Borough.

of the Borough.
(Ord. 1218. Passed 1-12-53.)
1040.06   CONNECTION PERMIT REQUIRED; FEES.
   (a)   No person, whether a resident or nonresident, shall, in any instance,
begin building construction or sewer construction, or tap or connect into any
sanitary sewer line connecting to or a part of the Ellwood City sanitary
sewerage system, or materially change the quantity or strength of an existing
discharge, without first making application and obtaining a permit from the
office of the Manager. The Manager shall collect fees based on an analysis
determined in accordance with the Pennsylvania Municipal Authorities Act, being
Act 203 of the Public Acts of 1990.
   (b)   The June 30, 1998, analysis determined that a person connecting to the
sanitary sewer system could be charged a fee. Based upon the same, the
connecting fee shall be amended to be one thousand dollars ($1,000) for all
residents and non-residents who enter the Borough sewage treatment system. All
persons connecting in the Borough shall also pay an inspection and
administrative cost fee of seventy-six dollars ($76.00).
   (c)   A person having residential connections (defined as residences having
the primary entrance to the dwelling from the exterior of the building, not
through a hallway) shall be required to pay the connection fee and one EDU for
the tapping fee.

connection as defined above, will pay one connection fee per connection. In
addition to the connection fee, an application for service must be provided,
which includes estimated annual water use as a multiple of an EDU. This
estimate must by approved by the Borough Manager. One EDU for the Borough sewer
system is 204 gallons per day of water usage. The fee paid will be equal to the
tapping fee, multiplied by the decimal number of EDU's of water usage
estimated, with a minimum of one EDU to be paid. Eighteen months after
connection to the Borough sewer system, the Borough will compare the average of
the most recent twelve months of water usage to the estimated water usage. The
Borough will either credit or invoice the difference in cost, subject to
interest at a rate of three percent on the outstanding balance of the accounts.

upon five days notice for failure of the property owner to pay the bill for
sewer rental or sewage service charges with respect to that property within
thirty days after the date the bill was rendered.
(Ord. 2135. Passed 2-15-93.)
1040.10   RESPONSIBILITY OF PROPERTY OWNER FOR BILLS; PENALTIES FOR NONPAYMENT;
TERMINATION OF UTILITY SERVICES.
   (a)   The owner of any property is responsible for all the sewage rental or
sewage service charges for sewer services rendered to any tenant or occupant of
that property. Any sewer rental or sewage service charge not paid on or before
fifteen days after the date on which the bill for the same is rendered shall be

The applicant shall then permit a representative of the Wastewater Treatment
Department or a State certified Sewage Enforcement Officer to perform a dye
test, smoke test or air test of the sewer drainage system on the property to be
sold, said smoke test to involve the use of nontoxic, non-staining smoke, which
is forced through the sewer system by the use of air blowers or other visual
inspections as may be necessary. The Wastewater Treatment Plant Operator or his
designate or in the event of an on-lot septic system, a State certified Sewage
Enforcement Officer shall also have the right to rely on the results of any

of weather conditions, and when such is the case, the applicant shall provide
the Wastewater Treatment Plant Operator or his designate or in the event of an
on-lot septic system, a State certified Sewage Enforcement Officer with written
authorization to perform the test as soon as weather permits. In addition, the
applicant shall provide a signed written acknowledgment from the purchaser of
the real estate, agreeing to correct, at the said purchaser's sole expense, any
violations/defects that may be discovered as the result of subsequent tests.
Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit any purchaser from requiring the
applicant to reimburse the purchaser for any costs incurred; provided,
nevertheless, that primary liability shall run with the land and no such
agreement shall affect the Borough's enforcement powers to excuse the current
owner from performance.
      (2)   When an illegal storm or surface water connection or malfunctioning
drainage system or malfunctioning on-lot septic system, has been discovered and
the necessary remedial activities to correct such connection would require a

for all cost overruns related to the remedial work, together with a license to
the Wastewater Treatment Plant Operator or his designate or in the event of an
on-lot septic system, a State certified Sewage Enforcement Officer to enter
upon the property to complete work in case of default by the contractor. If the
corrective work is not completed by ninety days from the date of the contract,
the temporary certification shall expire. In this event, the Wastewater
Treatment Plant Operator or his designate or in the event of an on-lot septic
system, a state certified Sewage Enforcement Officer shall be authorized to

1046.13   CUSTOMER'S INSTALLATIONS.
   (a)   Character of Service. The phase, voltage, size and types of all motors
installed by customers shall be subject to the approval of the Borough.
Customers shall, as provided for and regulated by this chapter, install motor
starting devices, automatic circuit breakers, switches, fuses or overload
devices of a type approved by the Borough, and shall adjust, renew or replace
the same from time to time or on request of the Borough. The Borough Manager
may issue regulations concerning the method of starting motors in order to keep
excess current required for such starting as low as practicable, without in any
way rendering the Borough responsible for control or operation of any such
equipment. The voltages and phases of motors which may be part of the
customer's installation to which the Borough supplies service shall conform, as
applicable, to the following requirements:
      (1)   A motor rated one-half horsepower or less shall be a single-phase
motor and shall be rated for connection to 120-volt or 240-volt single-phase
circuits.
      (2)   A motor rated larger than one-half horsepower, but not exceeding
five horsepower, shall be single-phase and shall be a motor rated for
connection to 240-volt single- phase circuits. A motor rated larger than one-
half horsepower, but not exceeding five horsepower, shall not be rated for
connection to 120-volt single-phase circuits.
      (3)   A motor rated in excess of five horsepower or a group of motors
having combined horsepower rating in excess of five horsepower shall be
connected only for three-phase operation and only where the Borough supplies
polyphase service to the customer's installation.
      (4)   Motors frequently started or motors arranged for automatic control
shall be of the type to give maximum starting torque with maximum current, and
shall be equipped with controlling devices approved by the Borough. At the
customer's expense, the customer shall, as provided for and regulated by this
chapter, install a reverse-phase relay of approved type on every alternating
current motor used for passenger or freight elevators, hoists, pumps or cranes.
      (5)   Notwithstanding the requirements set forth in paragraphs (a)(1),
(2) and (3) hereof, the Borough Manager may authorize a connection of a motor
or a group of motors to a voltage or a phase other than in accordance with the
aforesaid requirements where, in the opinion of the Borough Manager, the
required type of connection would impose a hardship upon the customer and the
proposed connection would not interfere with the Borough's electric
distribution system or with the rendering of electric service to any other
customer of the Borough.
   (b)   Fluorescent and Neon Lights. As provided for and regulated by this
chapter, customers shall install, in connection with any fluorescent or neon
lighting or other lighting or display facilities having similar load
characteristics, auxiliary equipment designed to correct the power factor of
such installations to not less than eighty-five percent.
   (c)   Low Power Factor Equipment. The Borough shall not be obligated to
furnish service for gaseous tube lighting, air conditioning equipment or other
types of electrical equipment having a power factor lower than that of
available good quality, high-power factor equipment. If power factor corrective
equipment is necessary, it, together with required switching equipment, shall
be provided and maintained by the customer at his or her expense. Static power
factor correction shall at no time exceed one-third of the amount of the
demand.
   (d)   Capacity Limitation. The Borough will not supply single-phase service
to any customer's installation where the connected load exceeds fifty KVA. In
instances where the connected load exceeds fifty KVA, the customer shall, as
provided for and regulated by this chapter, arrange or rearrange the customer's
installation to accept polyphase service which will be supplied by the Borough.
The Borough will not supply polyphase service at a secondary voltage where the
customer's demand exceeds 300 KVA unless otherwise authorized by the Borough
Manager.
      Single-Phase Source Derived From Polyphase Service. Only transformers
with separate primary and secondary windings shall be utilized where the
customer's installation is arranged to derive single-phase power from the
polyphase service supplied by the Borough. Auto transformers, balance coils or
means other than a transformer with separate primary and secondary windings
shall not be utilized for such purpose.
      Safety Disconnect Switch. A safety disconnect switch shall be provided at
the entry to all spaces housing a solid or liquid fuel furnace or boiler. In
the case of furnace or boiler rooms, the switch shall be located on the
exterior wall of said room. In dwelling units, the switch shall be located
inside the entry to the area containing the furnace or boiler.
      Marking. In all panelboards, each and every means of disconnect and
overload protection shall be clearly marked, indicating the circuit controlled
and protected by such device. The required marking shall indicate room(s) and
whether receptacles and/or lighting circuits are controlled and protected, plus
any designated circuits.
      Overcurrent Protection. Overcurrent protection shall consist of either
“S”-type fuses, circuit breakers or noninterchangeable cartridge fuses.
      Protection of Equipment. Protection of equipment against loss of voltage,
undervoltage, transient or sustained overvoltage, voltage unbalance,
overcurrent, phase failure, phase reversal, loss of synchronism and short
circuit shall be the responsibility of the customer. (Ord. 2211. Passed 4-29-
97.)
      Customer-Owned Emergency Generation Systems. No person shall operate a
customer- owned generation system except as provided herein and only as a
customer-owned emergency generation system.
      Emergency systems. Emergency systems shall be those systems legally
required and classed as emergency by Municipal, State, Federal or other codes,
or by any governmental agency having jurisdiction. These systems shall be
intended to automatically supply illumination or power, or both, to designated
areas and equipment in the event of failure of the normal supply or in the
event of accident of elements or a system intended to supply, distribute and
control power and illumination essential for safety to human life. The
installation, operation and maintenance of emergency systems, including
emergency generators, shall comply with the requirements of the National
Electrical Code.
      Generation systems. Customer-owned generation systems intended to provide
power during the interruption of the normal electrical service supplied by the
Borough shall be permitted subject to the following requirements:
      Equipment. The installation, operation and maintenance of generation
equipment shall be required to be approved by the Borough and shall comply with
the National Electrical Code.
      Electrical interconnection. No electrical interconnection between the
Borough's system and the customer generation equipment shall be permitted at
any time.
      Double-throw switch. The customer shall install, in a manner approved by
the Borough, a double-throw switch so that there can be no electrical
interconnection between the Borough service and the customer generation system.
         The double pole switch may be manual or automatic and shall be of
adequate rating with respect to voltage and current. The double throw switch
shall be of break before make type to maintain complete electrical isolation of
customer generation from the Borough system.

(Ord. 2211. Passed 4-29-97.)
1046.22   METER ERRORS AND TESTS.
   (a)   Adjustment of Error. The customer shall accept, as a standard of
measurement, the meter or meters installed by the Borough. Should the meter or
meters become defective or fail to register correctly, the amount of energy
used shall be determined by a test of the meter or meters, by the registration
of a meter or meters replacing the defective meter or meters during the period
next following or by the amount of energy used during a corresponding period of
the preceding year. In the event it is ascertained that the meter is
registering at a rate of one percent or more faster than normal, then the
customer shall receive a credit adjustment based upon the customer's (or his or
her predecessor's) kilowatt hour consumption during the twelve-month period
preceding the testing of the meter.
   (b)   Meter Tests. The Borough, at its own expense, will make periodic tests
and inspections of its meters in order to maintain them at a high standard or
accuracy, but the Borough reserves the right to make a charge, at a rate as
from time to time shall be determined by Council, for any additional tests or
inspections made at the request of the customer, provided that such test finds
the meter to be correct within prescribed tolerances of accuracy.

The Borough may temporarily suspend service for the purpose of making necessary
repairs and make every reasonable effort to notify customers in advance, except
in cases of emergency.
   (c)   Emergency Load Control. A load emergency situation exists whenever:
      (1)   The demands for power on all or part of the utility's system exceed
or threaten to exceed the capacity then actually available to supply such
demands;
      (2)   System instability or cascading outages could result from actual or
expected transmission overloads or other contingencies; or
      (3)   Such conditions exist in the system or another public utility or
power pool with which the utility's system is interconnected and cause a
reduction in the capacity available to the utility from that source or threaten
the integrity of the utility's system.
   In such case, the utility shall take such reasonable steps as the time
available permits to bring the demands within the then-available capacity or to
otherwise control load. Such steps shall include, but shall not be limited to,
reduction or interruption of service to one or more customers, in accordance
with the utility's procedures for controlling load.
(Ord. 2211. Passed 4-29-97.)

the Borough be resold or used by other than the customer contracting with the
Borough.
   (b)   Unbalanced Load. The customer shall at all times take and use energy
in such a manner that it will be taken equally between phases, and the customer
shall, at his or her own cost and expense, make all necessary changes as
provided for and regulated by this chapter to ensure such balancing. In
addition, when the unbalancing equals or exceeds ten percent of the lesser
phase, it shall be assumed that the energy taken by the customer from each
phase is equal to the amount taken from the greater phase.
   (c)   Fluctuations. The customer shall not use his or her electric service
in such a manner as to cause excessive voltage fluctuations or cause or
generate R-F interference or disturbances within the Borough's electric
distribution system. The Borough shall not be obligated to supply service or to
continue to supply service to any customer's installation that causes
fluctuations that interfere with or disturb the Borough's electric distribution
system in any manner, unless corrective measures are promptly taken or
corrective equipment is promptly installed by the customer, as provided for and
regulated by this chapter, at the customer's sole expense.
   (d)   Change of Installation. The service connections, transformers, meters
and appliances have a limited capacity and no addition to the equipment or load
of the customer connected shall be made without the prior written consent of
the Borough. The customer shall be liable for any damage resulting from his or

for the energy at and from the point of delivery thereof, and for the wires,
apparatus, devices and appurtenances thereon used in connection with the
service. The customer is responsible for the risk of damage to property and the
risk of fire or personal injury resulting from improper wiring and the manner
of attachment or use and maintenance of electrical wiring, equipment,
appliances, fixtures and apparatus, and no person, except electricians licensed
pursuant to
Chapter 1464  of the Building and Housing Code, shall install or make any
change to, alteration of, addition to or repair of any part of the customer's
installation. The customer shall indemnify, save harmless and defend the
Borough against all claims, demands, costs or expenses for loss, damage or
injury to persons or property in any manner directly or indirectly arising
from, connected with, or growing out of, the transmission or use of current by
the customer at or on the customer's side of the point of delivery.

consumption up to the annual consumption of the customer subject to capacity
limits contained herein. The installation shall comply with all applicable land
use, zoning, planning, Borough Code rules and regulations and the applicable
electric classification and rates.
   (b)   The Borough shall provide net metering if a customer generates
electricity and owns, operates or leases the electric generation system with a
capacity that will not exceed 25 kW per meter for residential customers and/or
not larger than 50 kilowatts if installed for nonresidential customers.
   (c)   The system capacity shall produce no more than 110% of the customers'
consumption, calculated on the average of the two previous 12 month periods of
actual electrical usage at the time of installation of energy generating
equipment and subject to the capacity limits specified herein. For new building
construction or in instances where less than two previous 12 periods of actual
usage is not available, electrical consumption will be estimated at 110% of the
consumption of units of similar size and characteristics at the time of the
installation energy generating equipment and subject to the capacity limits
herein. Net metering shall be accomplished through a single meter provided by
the Borough at the customers expense, that runs forward and backward in order
to measure net energy flow during a billing period.
   (d)   If the customer generates more energy than consumed during a monthly
billing cycle, the customer shall receive an energy credit in the kWh for the
next billing month to offset consumption in the subsequent billing periods
until all credits are used. During any subsequent billing period prior to the
end of an annualized billing period, the crediting of excess energy kWh will
result in the reduction of cost paid by the customer for the equivalent
volumetric energy kWh.
   (e)   Monthly credit shall be applicable to energy only. Excess energy
credits at the end of a 12 month period established at the discretion of the
Borough, shall be credited in dollars and calculated by multiplying excess kWh
credits by the average Borough's all in the wholesale electric rate over the
previous 12 month period. This average wholesale Borough electric rate shall be
based on the previous 12 month power supply cost to the Borough. Regardless of
the in service date of the installation, the 12 month period shall be set by
the Borough. The customer shall be required to pay all applicable charges
including customer, capacity, tax and any purchased power adjustment.
   (f)   The customer shall retain ownership of all Renewable Energy
Certificates associated with electric energy produced from all eligible energy
resources of the customer-generator facility and consumed by the customer.
   (g)   If the total generating capacity of all customer-generation using net
metering systems served exceeds 5% of the capacity necessary to meet the
Borough's aggregated monthly peak demand for a particular calendar year, the
Borough may elect not to provide net metering services to additional customers.
   (h)   Fees shall include Borough costs, including but not limited to an
application fee and inspection fee. Each fee shall be set by resolution of the
Borough. Customer shall be responsible for cost of any and all system studies
and upgrades, including metering, required to accommodate generation.
   (i)   All customer owned generation shall be subjected to the Borough of
Ellwood City Technical Requirements for Customer Owned Generation, as amended
by resolution of the Borough.

   (b)   Storage on Residential Property.
      (1)   Containers. Garbage and rubbish that has accumulated shall be
placed in containers into which plastic bags have first been inserted.
Containers shall be durable, watertight and made of rust-resistant galvanized

      (2)   Plastic bags.
         A.   Persons on residential properties must place all refuse as

contractor's collection service. The contractor may provide the bags through
sale at established outlets and as approved by the Borough. No location shall

withstand minimum winds of twenty-five miles per hour when empty. Carts must be
easy to tilt and roll when fully loaded to specified capacity.
         E.   The cart must be equipped with attachment points, which make it
compatible on American semi-automated bar-locking lifters. Carts must also be

         H.   The contractor must have storage capacity sufficient to handle
the inventory of carts and lids required prior to start-up of the contract and
also for replacement inventory during the duration of the contract.
         I.   The carts shall be provided with instructions for proper use,
including any customer actions that would cause damage, such as placement of
hot ashes in the container causing the cart to melt, and procedures to follow
to minimize potential fire problems. The Borough will provide to the contractor
for reproduction and distribution with the carts, a template of a pamphlet
explaining the "do's and don'ts," for garbage, yard waste and recyclables,
directions for placement of the cart, and a place for the contractor to

customers who switch to a new service level; and to customers who need a cart
replacement for a damaged cart. Carts shall be delivered no later than five

yard waste from several establishments are collected in the same vehicle, an
individual establishment's contribution to the load may be apportioned.

that identifies the weight of yard waste collected and the facility that
processes the material.

establishment by a collector other than the Borough or its authorized agent,
the occupants of said establishment shall submit an annual report to the
Borough reporting the type and weight of materials recycled or processed for
mulch or compost during the previous calendar year. This requirement may be
fulfilled by the submission of a letter or form from the collector which
certifies that recycle materials and/or yard waste are being collected,
recycled, and processed for mulch or compost from the establishment.

Municipal and institutional establishments must be informed of the recycling
yard waste program.

wireless facilities, shall be removed as follows:
         A.   All abandoned or unused small wireless facilities and accessory
equipment shall be removed within 90 days of the cessation of operations at the
site or receipt of notice that the small wireless facility has been deemed
abandoned by the Borough unless a time extension is approved by the Borough.
         B.   If the small wireless facility or accessory equipment is not
removed within 90 days of the cessation of operations at a site, or within any
longer period approved by the Borough, the small wireless facility and/or
associated facilities and equipment may be removed by the Borough and the cost
of removal assessed against the owner of the small wireless facility regardless
of the owner's or operator's intent to operate the small wireless facility in
the future.
         C.   The Borough reserves the right to pursue all available remedies
under the law to ensure removal of the small wireless facility and restoration
of the site at the expense of the permittee. Any delay by the Borough in taking
action shall not invalidate the Borough's right to take action.
      (2)   With respect to a small wireless facility collocated on a municipal
pole, the Borough may abandon a municipal pole upon 30 days' notice to the
permittee. Permittee must remove or transfer all facilities from abandoned
municipal poles within the same 30 days unless granted additional time by the
Borough. The Borough will not unreasonably withhold consent of such request for
additional time. The permittee shall post a decommissioning bond in the amount
of 100% of the total cost of decommissioning with the Borough. If the Borough
has no attachment(s) on said municipal poles and the permittee has not removed
or transferred its facilities therefrom, the Borough may, in its sole
discretion: (1) revoke the permit for that municipal pole; or (2) remove the
small wireless facilities at the permit holder's expense, with no liability
falling on the Borough except in the case of gross negligence or willful
misconduct.

purpose;
         B.   The Borough desires to decommission the utility pole; or
         C.   The Borough designates the area of the subject utility pole or
wireless support structure as an underground district.
      (2)   Within 90 days of receipt of a notice of discontinuance from the
Borough, the permittee shall remove the small wireless facility and any
accessory equipment, including the utility pole and any wireless support
structures if the permittee's small wireless facilities and accessory equipment
are the only wireless facilities on the utility pole. The Borough shall not be
liable to the permittee or applicant as a result of requiring the
discontinuance of a small wireless facility in the event that an applicant or
permittee is prevented from placing and/or maintaining its small wireless
facility pursuant to this section.
(Ord. 2590. Passed 11-15-21.)
1072.07   INDEMNIFICATION.
   (a)   Each person that owns or operates a small wireless facility shall, at
its sole cost and expense, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Borough, its

arising in whole or in part from, caused by or connected with any act or
omission of the person, its officers, agents, employees or contractors arising
out of, but not limited to, the construction, installation, operation,
maintenance or removal of the small wireless facility. Each person that owns or
operates a small wireless facility, or holds a permit issued pursuant to this
chapter, shall defend any actions or proceedings against the Borough in which

any other land so disturbed, directly caused by the activities of the permittee
or the permittee's contractors and return the right-of-way in as good of
condition as it existed prior to any work being done in the right-of-way by the
permittee. If the permittee fails to make the repairs required by the Borough
within 30 days after written notice, the Borough may perform those repairs and
charge the permittee the reasonable, documented cost of the repairs plus a
penalty of $500. In the event an applicant or permittee has failed to pay any
costs invoiced by the Borough for repair work or penalties charged pursuant to
this section, the Borough shall not process any further applications unless or
until the applicant or permittee has paid the amount assessed for the repair
costs and the assessed penalty. Any unpaid invoice shall be subject to interest
accruing on the unpaid amount at 18% per annum beginning on the 31st day from

pole for future public uses in a documented and approved plan as adopted at the
time an application is filed. A reservation of space shall not preclude
collocation, the replacement of an existing utility pole or the installation of
a new utility pole. If the replacement of a municipal pole is necessary to

shall pay for the replacement municipal pole and the municipal pole shall
accommodate the future use.

subcontractor shall provide the Borough with a certificate of insurance, in a
form satisfactory to the Borough Solicitor, evidencing general liability
coverage in the minimum amount of $1 ,000,000 per occurrence and property
damage coverage in the minimum amount of $1,000,000 per occurrence covering the
small wireless facility and naming the Borough as an additional insured on each
insurance policy. All permits issued for location of a small wireless facility
pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed to be revoked in the event said
insurance policy is cancelled, expires, or ceases to exist.

noncompliance. Within 60 days of suspension or revocation of a permit due to
noncompliance with Act 50 or other applicable codes, the applicant shall remove
the small wireless facility and any accessory equipment, including the utility
pole and any wireless support structures if the applicant's small wireless
facilities and accessory equipment are the only wireless facilities on the
utility pole. Within 90 days of the end of a permit term or an extension of the
permit term, the applicant shall remove the small wireless facility and any
accessory equipment, including the utility pole and any wireless support

right-of-way under this chapter, the permittee must restore the right-of-way to
its prior condition in accordance with Borough specifications. If the permittee

within 30 days of billing thereof, all costs and expenses incurred by the

found liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the
Borough, shall pay a judgment of not more than $600 plus all court costs,
including reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Borough as a result thereof.
No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or payable until the date of

(Ord. 2143. Passed 8-16-93.)
1244.06   PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   Before approving any final subdivision plan, the Council shall require a
written agreement, and appropriate financial surety, as specified in Section
1244.07, that necessary grading, paving and street improvements, sidewalks,
street lights, fire hydrants, water mains, storm sewers and sanitary sewers, as
may be required by the Borough, shall be installed by the developer in strict
accordance with the design standards and specifications of the Borough within a
specified time period.
(Ord. 2143. Passed 8-16-93.)
1244.07   PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES.
   (a)   The Council shall insure, through receipt of certificates of
compliance submitted and attested by the Borough Engineer, with review of the
Planning Commission, that the required improvements have been installed
according to the specifications of the final plan, or as an alternative,
require the posting of adequate surety to cover the cost for such improvements.
The Council may also insure, through the posting of bonds or other surety,
rights of way and road surfaces which are in any manner utilized for transport
or related purposes during development and construction associated with
subdivision development.
   (b)   The Council shall specify one of the following alternatives, or such
other alternatives as may be acceptable, for guaranteeing compliance with the
requirements of this section. Final approval of a plan may not be granted by
the Council until the surety required is fully provided. In any event, the
required surety shall be secured along with the written agreement prior to any
construction or related activity.
      (1)   Completion of improvements prior to final approval. Prior to final
plan approval, the developer shall complete, in a manner satisfactory to the
Council and the Borough Engineer, all improvements required in these
Subdivision and Land Development Regulations as specified in the final
subdivision plan, and as preliminarily approved by the Council, and shall
dedicate the same to the Borough in accordance with these Regulations.
      (2)   Guarantee of future performance. In lieu of requiring the
completion of all improvements prior to final plan approval, the Borough may,
at its discretion, enter into an agreement with the developer whereby the
developer shall guarantee to complete all improvements required by these
Subdivision and Land Development Regulations, or otherwise specified by the
Borough and in a manner satisfactory to the Council. To secure this agreement,
the developer shall provide, subject to approval of the Borough, one of the
following guarantees:
         A.   Surety bond. The developer shall obtain a security bond from a
surety bond company authorized to do business in the Commonwealth. The bond
shall be payable to the Borough. The amount of financial security shall be
equal to 110 percent of the cost of the required improvements as estimated by
the developer and approved by the Borough Engineer. The duration of the bond
shall be until such time as the improvements are accepted by the Borough in
accordance with the requirements of these Regulations.
         B.   Escrow account. The developer shall deposit cash or another
instrument readily convertible into cash at face value, either with the Borough
or in escrow with a bank. In the use of any instrument other than cash, and in
the case of an escrow account, the bank with which the funds are to be
deposited shall be subject to the approval of the Council. The amount of
financial security shall be equal to 110 percent of the cost of the required
improvements as estimated by the developer and approved by the Borough
Engineer. In case of an escrow account, the developer shall file with the Board
an agreement between the financial institutions and himself or herself,
guaranteeing the following:
            1.   That the funds of said escrow account shall be held in trust
until released by the Borough and may not be used or pledged by the developer
as security in any other matter during the period; and
            2.   That in the case of a failure on the part of the developer to
complete said improvements, the financial institution shall immediately make
the funds in said account available to the Borough for use in the completion of
those improvements.
         C.   Property escrow. The developer shall offer as a guarantee land or
other property, including corporate stocks or bonds. The value of any such
property shall be at least equal to 110 percent of the cost, as estimated by
the developer and approved by the Borough Engineer, of the installation of all
contracted improvements. The established value of any property so used shall
take into account the likelihood of a decline in the value of said property
during the guarantee period. The Borough shall retain the right to reject the
use of any property when it believes that the property will be unusually
difficult to sell, or for other reasons such as will inhibit the Borough from
exchanging the property for a sufficient amount of money to complete the
required improvements.
            When property is offered as an improvement guarantee, the developer
shall:
            1.   Execute an agreement with the trustee when it is not the
Borough, instructing the trust to release the property to the Borough in case
of default. The agreement shall also state that the property may be released
only upon consent of the Borough. The agreement shall be placed on file with
the Borough Secretary/Treasurer.
            2.   File with the Borough an affidavit affirming that the property
to be used as a guarantee is free and clear of any encumbrances or liens at the
time it is to be put in trust; and
            3.   Execute and file with the Borough an agreement stating that
the property to be placed in trust as an improvement guarantee will not be used
for any other purpose or pledged as a security in any other matter until it is
released by the Borough.
         D.   Extension of guarantees. If the developer requires more than one
year from the date of posting financial security to complete the required
improvements, the amount of security may be increased to assure that financial
security equals 110 percent. Any additional security shall be posted by the
developer in accordance with this section.
(Ord. 2143. Passed 8-16-93.)
1244.08   RELEASE FROM IMPROVEMENT BOND.
   The following procedure shall be followed when the required improvements
have been completed:
   (a)   When the developer has completed all the required improvements, the
developer shall notify the Zoning Hearing Board, in writing, by certified or
registered mail, of the completion of the required improvements, and shall send
a copy thereof to the Borough Engineer.
   (b)   The Council shall, within ten days of receipt of such notice, direct
and authorize the Borough Engineer and the Planning Commission to inspect all
of the aforesaid improvements. The Borough Engineer shall thereupon file a
report, in writing, with the Council, and shall mail a copy of the same to the
developer by certified or registered mail. The report shall be made and mailed
within forty-five days of receipt by the Borough Engineer of the aforesaid
authorization by the Borough. The report shall be detailed and shall indicate
approval or rejection of said improvements. If any portion thereof shall be
rejected, the report shall contain a statement of reasons for such nonapproval
or rejection.
   (c)   The Borough shall notify the developer within fifteen days, in
writing, by certified or registered mail, of the action of the Borough.
   (d)   If the Council or the Borough Engineer fails to comply with the time

shall be rejected by the Borough, the developer shall proceed to complete the
same, and, upon completion, the same procedure of notification as outlined
herein shall be followed.

subdivider's or developer's right to contest or question, by legal proceedings
or otherwise, any determination of the Council or the Borough Engineer.

standards, ordinances and requirements of the Borough, the subdivider or
developer shall be required to deposit with the Borough a maintenance
guarantee, as provided for in this section, to secure the structural integrity
of the improvements and to guarantee the proper function of those improvements
in accordance with the design standards established in
Chapter 1246 and the specifications of the final plan.
   (b)   The term of the maintenance guarantee shall be eighteen months from
the date of the acceptance of the public improvements by the Council. The
amount of the maintenance guarantee shall be fifteen percent of the actual cost
of installation of the required public improvements.
(Ord. 2143. Passed 8-16-93.)
1244.10   MODIFICATION.
   (a)   The Council may grant a modification of the requirements of one or
more provisions of these Subdivision and Land Development Regulations if the
literal enforcement will exact undue hardship because of peculiar conditions
pertaining to the land in question, provided that such modification will not be
contrary to the public interest and that the purpose and intent of these
Regulations are observed.
   (b)   The following process must be observed:
      (1)   All requests for modification shall be in writing and shall
accompany and be part of the application for development. The request shall
state, in full, the grounds and facts of unreasonableness or hardship on which
the request is based, the provision or provisions of these Regulations involved
and the minimum modification necessary.
      (2)   The request for modification shall be referred to the Borough
Planning Commission for review and recommendation.
      (3)   The Council and the Borough Planning Commission shall keep a
written record of all actions taken on all requests for modifications.

   In the event that any of the required improvements is not installed and
constructed as provided for in the written agreement, these Subdivision and
Land Development Regulations or in conformity with the requirements of the
Zoning Hearing Board, or in accordance with the approved final plat, the
Council shall enforce any corporate bond or other security by appropriate legal
and equitable remedies. In addition:
   (a)   If the proceeds of such bond or other security are insufficient to pay
the cost of installing or making repairs or corrections to all the improvements
covered by said security, the Council may, at its option, install part of such
improvements and may institute appropriate legal or equitable action to recover
the monies necessary to complete the remainder of the improvements.
   (b)   All of the proceeds, whether resulting from the security or from any
legal or equitable action brought against the developer, or both, shall be used
solely for the installation of the improvements covered by such security and
not for any other Municipal purpose.

1246.01   APPLICATION OF STANDARDS.
   The following principles, standards and requirements for the subdivision of
land shall be applied by the Council in evaluating the plans for proposed
subdivision and shall be considered minimum requirements.
(Ord. 2143. Passed 8-16-93.)
1246.02   LAND REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Land subject to hazards of life, health and safety shall not be
subdivided until such hazards have been removed.
   (b)   Where not prohibited by these Subdivision and Land Development
Regulations, or any other laws or ordinances, land located in any designated
flood plain area may be replatted for development, provided that the developer
constructs all buildings, structures and improvements so that the possibility
of flood damage from the 100-year flood is eliminated.
   (c)   If the Council determines that only a part of a proposed tract can be
safely developed, it shall limit development to that part.
(Ord. 2143. Passed 8-16-93.)
1246.03   STREET REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Proposed streets shall be properly related to the Borough and/or State
roads and highway plans which have been prepared or which may be prepared and
officially adopted.
   (b)   Streets shall be logically related to the topography so as to produce
usable lots and reasonable grades.
   (c)   Minor streets shall be so laid out as to discourage through traffic,
but provisions for street connections into and from adjacent areas will be
generally required.
   (d)   Half streets shall be prohibited except to complete an existing half
street.
   (e)   Dead-end streets shall be permitted when it is clear that through
traffic at such a street end is not essential to the street system in that
district, and, under the said conditions, dead-end streets must have adequate
turning space for vehicles, which is a minimum right-of-way radius of fifty
feet.
   (f)   Any street or way already established shall be continued at not less
than its existing width.
   (g)   Any street or way that is planned, though not already established,
shall be continued at not less than its width as planned.
   (h)   Maximum allowable grades shall be as follows:
      (1)   Arterial street, five percent.
      (2)   Collector street, six percent.
      (3)   Minor street, ten percent.
(Grades in excess of ten percent may be approved by the Council where it is
clear that no traffic hazard is or will be created thereby).
   (i)   Minimum grades on all streets shall be one percent.
   (j)   Vertical curves shall be installed on all street grade changes
exceeding one percent.
   (k)   Alignment shall be as follows:
      (1)   Minimum centerline radius for horizontal curves:
         A.   Arterial street, 1,000 feet.
         B.   Collector street, 300 feet.
         C.   Minor street, 100 feet.
      (2)   Horizontal curves shall be made on all deflecting angles along the
centerlines of streets.
      (3)   Degree of curvature shall be set to assure proper sight distance.
   (l)   Minimum street right-of-way widths and cartway widths shall be as
follows:
 
Type of Street Type of Development Cartway (ft.) Right of Way Minor (ft.)
               Single-family lots  24            50
Collector      Single-family and   30            50
               commercial
Arterial       All types           As prescribed by the Pennsylvania Depart-
                                   ment of Transportation.
 
In cases where a new subdivision is planned to join the street system on an
existing subdivision, the above minimum requirements shall apply except where
the existing streets and rights of way are larger than required. In this event,
the Council may require that the new streets and rights of way be as large as
those in the existing subdivision. Private covenants may apply if their
provisions are at least as strict as the provisions of this section.
   (m)   Cul-de-sacs are permitted where the length does not exceed 800 feet
and where a turn-around with a right-of-way diameter of fifty feet is provided.
Extension of a cul-de-sac will be permitted to connect to a street system of a
new or extended subdivision, provided that the maximum street lengths for
blocks and cul-de-sacs are met. Cul-de-sacs shall be avoided unless it is clear
that a through street is not essential to the street system of the plan or the
adjacent area.
   (n)   Street intersections shall be as follows:
      (1)   All curbs at intersections shall be rounded by a minimum radius of:
         A.   Collector and arterial streets         25 feet
         B.   Minor streets               20 feet
            Twenty-foot radii will be maintained where collector and/or
arterial streets intersect minor streets.
      (2)   When fences, hedges or other plantings, structures or walls on any
lot corner would create a traffic hazard by limiting vision clearance across a
corner lot from a height of three feet above the finished paved areas, at the
centerline of the right of way, the subdivider shall cut such structure and/or
vegetation in conjunction with grading the right of way to provide a sight line
of 120 feet along the centerline of a major street from the centerline
intersections, and 100 feet at minor street intersections. When an arterial,
collector and minor street intersect, each shall retain its respective footage
requirements along the centerline to form the sight triangle.
      (3)   Where the grade of any street at the approach to an intersection
exceeds five percent, a leveling area shall be provided with a transitional
grade not to exceed two percent for a distance of fifty feet from the nearest
right-of-way line of the intersection.

1252.01   GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   Certain physical developments are classified as land development in the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, Act 170 of 1988, and as such are
subject to regulation. The design and construction standards are found in
Section
1252.05 and are applicable to land development. Land development is
characterized by the fact that the development site is in single ownership and
the buildings and/or use areas are rented or leased to prospective users. There
is no division of land typical of land subdivision actions, although buildings
and/or use areas may be sold at the time of development or at some future time.
It shall be unlawful for an applicant to construct land developments as defined
herein until:
   (a)   The final site plan was approved by the Borough and recorded as may be
required by the Borough.

intersections and at all horizontal curves of 145 degrees or less, at all
vertical curves in excess of twelve percent, where necessary, to 
provide for safe pedestrian travel, and at all other locations deemed by the

practice and in accordance with agreements with, or as approved by the Borough
Engineer. All such utilities shall be underground.
NOTE: All traffic, parking and pedestrian plans shall be completed using such
standard resource criteria as provided by the American Planning Association or
the Institute for Traffic Engineers.
(Ord. 2143. Passed 8-16-93.)
1252.06   WAIVER OF REQUIREMENTS.

appeal to the Borough Council.
(Ord. 2143. Passed 8-16-93.)
1252.07   ACCEPTANCE AND MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   Insofar as the land development involves the lease or rental of buildings
and/or space on the site and site improvements (such as roads, parking areas
and stormwater drainage devices), which are to be privately maintained or
maintained by a private (non-public) organization created by the developer,
there is no need for Municipal acceptance of such site improvements. If the
developer shall propose, and the Borough shall agree, that certain on-site
improvements should be dedicated to the Borough, the provisions for this
approach shall follow those as specified for subdivisions in these Subdivision
and Land Development Regulations. Where a developer proposes improvements on
the site plan and the same is approved by the Borough, the developer shall make
such improvements as indicated on the plan. Where the developer shall be
considered in violation of these Regulations, the actions for the enforcement
of these Regulations, as set forth shall be instituted.
   In addition, all permits which the Borough issues (building, etc.) shall be
held in abeyance until the developer successfully complies with the
requirements of these Regulations. Where the developer does not intend to
maintain the improvements, and where a homeowner's association or similar
organization will not be organized for these responsibilities, the developer
will submit a plan for maintenance of such facilities. This document will be
legally enforceable, clearly establishing maintenance responsibility, and shall
be approved by the Borough and recorded in the Lawrence or Beaver County
Recorder's Office by the developer.

      (1)   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape, or

district in which the property is located.
      (2)   That because of such physical circumstances or conditions there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the

applicant.

character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor

adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.

variance that will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible.

reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the
purpose of this Zoning Code.
   (j)   A copy of the final decision or finding shall be delivered to the

corner lot, the front facade of the main building shall be oriented so as to be
most compatible with adjacent buildings and uses.
            3.   For the purpose of this part, the front facade of the building
shall be considered that wall which faces the greatest street right-of-way
width and which carries the highest volume of traffic in a 24-hour period.

any and all regulations and restrictions as may be imposed from time-to-time by
Borough Council.
            3.   Exterior merchandising is only permitted during the hours of
operation of the subject business.
            4.   A minimum of 20% of the square footage of the front face of

floor front facades): 10%
               d.   For determining square footage of front for percentage of
transparency, the height of the front for any first floor is to be 15 feet high
from the top of the first floor. This is not a building height restriction,
just the guideline for determining the percentage of transparency area
required.

constructed, operated, maintained, repaired, modified and removed in strict
compliance with all current applicable technical, safety and safety-related
codes, including but not limited to, the most recent editions of the American
National Standards Institute (ANSI) Code, National Electrical Safety Code,
National Electrical Code, as well as the accepted and responsible workmanlike
industry practices of the National Association of Tower Erectors. Any tower-
based WCF shall at all times be kept and maintained in good condition, order
and repair by qualified maintenance and construction personnel, so that the
same shall not endanger the life of any person or any property in the Borough.
      (2)   Notice. Upon submission of an application for a tower-based WCF and
the scheduling of the public hearing upon the application, the WCF applicant
shall mail notice to all owners of every property within 500 feet of the
proposed facility. The WCF applicant shall provide proof of the notification to
the Borough.
      (3)   Special Exception Required. Tower-based WCF are permitted by
special exception, at a height necessary to satisfy their function in the WCF
applicant's wireless communications system. No WCF applicant shall have the
right under these regulations to erect a tower to the maximum height specified
in this section unless it proves the necessity for such height. The WCF
applicant shall demonstrate that the antenna/tower/pole for the tower-based WCF
is the minimum height necessary for the service area.
         A.   Prior to the Zoning Hearing Board’s approval of a special
exception authorizing the construction and installation of tower-based WCF, it
shall be incumbent upon the WCF applicant for such special exception approval
to prove to the reasonable satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing Board that the
WCF applicant cannot adequately extend or infill its communications system by
the use of equipment such as redoes, repeaters, antenna(s) and other similar
equipment installed on existing structures, such as utility poles or their
appurtenances and other available tall structures. The WCF applicant shall
further demonstrate that the proposed tower-based WCF must be located where it
is proposed in order to serve the WCF applicant’s service area and that no
other viable alternative location exists.
         B.   The special exception application shall be accompanied by a
propagation study evidencing the need for the proposed tower or other
communication facilities and equipment, a description of the type and
manufacturer of the proposed transmission/radio equipment, the frequency range
(megahertz band) assigned to the WCF applicant, the power in watts at which the
WCF applicant transmits, and any relevant related tests conducted by the WCF
applicant in determining the need for the proposed site and installation.
         C.   The special exception application shall also be accompanied by
documentation demonstrating that the proposed tower-based WCF complies with all
state and federal laws and regulations concerning aviation safety.
         D.   Where the tower-based WCF is located on a property with another
principal use, the WCF applicant shall present documentation to the Zoning
Hearing Board that the owner of the property has granted an easement for the
proposed WCF and that vehicular access will be provided to the facility.
         E.   The special exception application shall also be accompanied by
documentation demonstrating that the proposed tower-based WCF complies with all
applicable provisions in this section.
         F.   In determining the location of a proposed tower-based WCF,
preference shall be given to municipally-owned property on the northern and
southern ends of the Borough.
      (4)   Engineer Inspection. Prior to the Borough’s issuance of a permit
authorizing construction and erection of a tower-based WCF, the applicant shall
employ a Pennsylvania-registered structural engineer to issue to the Zoning
Hearing Board a written certification of the proposed WCF's ability to meet the
structural standards offered by either the Electronic Industries Association or
the Telecommunication Industry Association. Such engineer shall also certify
the proper construction of the foundation and the erection of the structure.
This certification shall be provided during the special exception proceedings,
or at a minimum be made as a condition attached to any approval given such that
the certification be provided prior to issuance of any building permits.
      (5)   Visual Appearance and Land Use Compatibility. Tower-based WCF shall
employ stealth technology which may include the tower portion to be painted
silver or another color approved by the Borough Zoning Hearing Board, or shall
have a galvanized finish. All tower-based WCF and related equipment shall be
aesthetically and architecturally compatible with the surrounding environment
and shall maximize the use of a like facade to blend with the existing
surroundings and neighboring buildings to the greatest extent possible. The
Zoning Hearing Board shall consider whether its decision upon the subject
application will promote the harmonious and orderly development of the zoning
district involved; encourage compatibility with the character and type of
development existing in the area; benefit neighboring properties by preventing
a negative impact on the aesthetic character of the community; preserve
woodlands and trees existing at the site to the greatest possible extent; and
encourage sound engineering and land development design and construction
principles, practices and techniques.
      (6)   Co-location and Siting. An application for a new tower-based WCF
shall demonstrate that the proposed tower-based WCF cannot be accommodated on
an existing or approved structure or building, or sited on land owned by the
Borough of Ellwood City. The Borough Zoning Hearing Board may deny an
application to construct a new tower-based WCF if the WCF applicant has not
made a good faith effort to mount the commercial communications antenna(s) on
an existing structure. The WCF applicant shall demonstrate that it contacted
the owners of tall structures, buildings, and towers within a one-quarter of a
mile radius of the site proposed, sought permission to install an antenna on
those structures, buildings, and towers and was denied for one of the following
reasons:
         A.   The proposed antenna and related equipment would exceed the
structural capacity of the existing building, structure or tower, and its
reinforcement cannot be accomplished at a reasonable cost.
         B.   The proposed antenna and related equipment would cause radio
frequency interference with other existing equipment for that existing
building, structure, or tower and the interference cannot be prevented at a
reasonable cost.
         C.   Such existing buildings, structures, or towers do not have
adequate location, space, access, or height to accommodate the proposed
equipment or to allow it to perform its intended function.
         D.   A commercially reasonable agreement could not be reached with the
owner of such building, structure, or tower.
      (7)   Permit Required for Modifications. To the extent permissible under
applicable state and federal law, any WCF applicant proposing the modification
of an existing tower-based WCF, which increases the overall height of such WCF,
shall first obtain a permit from the Borough. Non-routine modifications and
modifications that substantially change the wireless support structure shall be
prohibited without a permit.
      (8)   Gap in Coverage. A WCF applicant for a tower-based WCF must
demonstrate that a significant gap in wireless coverage or capacity exists with
respect to all wireless operators in the applicable area and that the type of
WCF being proposed is the least intrusive means by which to fill that gap in
wireless coverage. The existence or non-existence of a gap in wireless coverage
shall be a factor in the Borough Zoning Hearing Board's decision on an
application for approval of tower-based WCF.
      (9)   Additional Antennae. As a condition of approval for all tower-based
WCF, the WCF applicant shall provide the Borough with a written commitment that
it will allow other service providers to co-locate antennae on tower-based WCF
where technically and economically feasible. To the extent permissible by law,
the owner of a tower-based WCF shall not install any additional antennae
without obtaining the prior written approval of the Borough.
      (10)   Wind. Any tower-based WCF structures shall be designed to
withstand the effects of wind gusts of at least 100 miles per hour in addition
to the standard designed by the American National Standards Institute as
prepared by the engineering departments of the Electronics Industry
Association, and Telecommunications Industry Association (ANSI/EIA/TIA-222, as
amended).

housing the receiving and transmitting equipment may be located on the site for
each unrelated company sharing commercial communications antenna(e) space on
the tower-based wireless communications facility.
      (13)   Public Safety Communications. No tower-based WCF shall interfere
with public safety communications or the reception of broadband, television,
radio or other communication services enjoyed by occupants of nearby
properties.
      (14)   Maintenance. The following maintenance requirements shall apply:
         A.   Any tower-based WCF shall be fully automated and unattended on a
daily basis and shall be visited only for maintenance or emergency repair.
         B.   Such maintenance shall be performed to ensure the upkeep of the
WCF in order to promote the safety and security of the Borough's residents, and
utilize the best available technology for preventing failures and accidents.
      (15)   Radio Frequency Emissions. A tower-based WCF shall not, by itself
or in conjunction with other WCFs, generate radio frequency emissions in excess
of the standards and regulations of the FCC, including but not limited to, the
FCC Office of Engineering Technology Bulletin 65 entitled “Evaluating
Compliance with FCC Guidelines for Human Exposure to Radio Frequency
Electromagnetic Fields,” as amended.
      (16)   Historic Buildings or Districts. A tower-based WCF shall not be

setback without endangering such adjoining uses and their occupants.
      (2)   Design Regulations.

determines is reasonably necessary or such shorter period in the case of an
emergency, an owner of tower-based WCF in the ROW shall, at its own expense,
temporarily or permanently remove, relocate, change or alter the position of
any WCF when the Borough, consistent with its police powers and applicable
Public Utility Commission regulations, shall determine that such removal,

(Ord. 2470. Passed 9-19-11.)
1482.18   IDENTIFICATION OF FLOODPLAIN AREAS.
   (a)   (1)   The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of the Borough
of Ellwood City, classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs)
dated January 18, 2012 and issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof, including all digital data
developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study.
      (2)   The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments are hereby adopted by the Borough and declared to be a part of
this chapter.
   (b)   Description. For the purposes of this chapter, the following
nomenclature is used in referring to the various kinds of floodplain areas:
      (1)   FW (Floodway Area).
         A.   The area identified as floodway in the FIS that represents the
channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in
order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water
surface elevation by more than one foot at any point. This term shall also
include floodway areas that have been identified in other available studies or
sources of information for those special floodplain areas where no floodway has
been identified in the FIS.
         B.   Any encroachment that would cause any increase in flood heights
shall be prohibited.
         C.   No new construction or development shall be allowed, unless a
permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection Regional
Office.
      (2)   FF (Flood-Fringe Area).
         A.   The areas identified as Zones AE and A1-30 in the FIS which are
subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood event determined by
detailed methods and have base flood elevations (BFEs) shown.
         B.   No new construction or development shall be located within the
area measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse, unless
a permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection Regional
Office.
         C.   In any FF without a designated floodway, no new development shall
be permitted unless it can be demonstrated that the cumulative effect of all
past and projected development will not increase the BFE by more than one foot.
      (3)   FA (General Floodplain Area).
         A.   The areas identified as Zone A in the FIS that are subject to
inundation by the 1% annual chance flood event determined using approximate
methodologies. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no
BFEs or flood depths are shown.
         B.   No new construction or development shall be located within the
area measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse, unless
a permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection Regional
Office.
         C.   When available, information from other Federal, State, and other
acceptable sources shall be used to determine the BFE, as well as a floodway
area, if possible. When no other information is available, the BFE shall be
determined by using a point on the boundary of the identified floodplain area
which is nearest the construction site in question.
         D.   In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant
to determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by
professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall
certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted
technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted
in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Borough.
(Ord. 2470. Passed 9-19-11.)
1482.19   CHANGES IN FLOODPLAIN AREA DELINEATIONS.
   The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Council
where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person documents
the need for such revision. However, prior to any such change, approval must be
obtained from the FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later
than six months after the date such information becomes available, a community
shall notify the FEMA of the changes by submitting technical or scientific
data.
(Ord. 2470. Passed 9-19-11.)
1482.20   DISPUTES.
   Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Planning Commission and any party

Management Chapter.
(Ord. 2458. Passed 11-15-10.)
1488.02   STATEMENT OF FINDINGS.
   The governing body of the Municipality finds that:
   (a)   Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of storm water resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flows and velocities,
contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of
streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public facilities to
carry and control storm water, undermines floodplain management and flood
control efforts in downstream communities, reduces ground water recharge,
threatens public health and safety, and increases non-point source pollution of
water resources.
   (b)   A comprehensive program of storm water management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff,
is fundamental to the public health, safety and welfare and the protection of
people of the Commonwealth, their resources and the environment.
   (c)   Storm water is an important water resource, which provides ground
water recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams, which protects and
maintains surface water quality.
   (d)   Federal and State regulations require certain Municipalities to
implement a program of storm water controls. These Municipalities are required
to obtain a permit for storm water discharges from their separate storm sewer
systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).
(Ord. 2458. Passed 11-15-10.)
1488.03   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
the Municipality and its watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing the
benefits described in Section
1488.02, through provisions designed to:
   (a)   Meet legal water quality requirements under State law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim and restore
the existing and designated uses.
   (b)   Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.
   (c)   Manage storm water runoff close to the source.
   (d)   Provide the minimum procedures and performance standards for storm
water planning and management.
   (e)   Maintain ground water recharge, to prevent degradation of surface and
ground water quality and to otherwise protect water resources.
   (f)   Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and stream beds.
   (g)   Provide proper operations and maintenance of all permanent Storm Water
Management Best Management Practices (BMPs) implemented within the
Municipality.
   (h)   Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.

   Projects occurring in the areas listed above and not previously bound to
such requirements (roadway restoration projects), are also required to achieve
the following targeted outcomes:
      (1)   For project areas within a release rate district, reduce the post-
construction runoff peak rate as required by the release rate district in this
chapter. For project areas not within a release rate district, reduce the post-
construction runoff peak rate to the pre-construction peak rate for the one-
year through 100-year storm events.
      (2)   Reduce the post-construction runoff volume to the pre-construction
runoff volume for the two-year, 24-hour storm event and smaller.

      (1)   Meet State water quality standards and requirements.
      (2)   Protect health, safety, and property.
      (3)   Meet special requirements for high quality (HQ) and exceptional
value (EV) watersheds.
   (c)   The Municipality will consider waiver requests in accordance with
Section
1488.09(c). If an applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the governing
body of the Municipality that any mandatory provision of this chapter is
unreasonable or causes unique or undue unreasonableness or hardship as it
applies to the proposed project, or that an alternate design may result in a
superior result within the context of Sections
1488.02 and
1488.03, the governing body of the Municipality upon obtaining the comments and
recommendations of the Municipal Engineer and conservation district may grant a
waiver or relief so that substantial justice may be done and the public
interest is secured; provided that such waiver will not have the effect of
nullifying the intent and purpose of this chapter.
   (d)   The applicant shall submit all requests for waivers in writing and
shall include such requests as a part of the plan review and approval process.
The applicant shall state in full the facts of unreasonableness or hardship on
which the request is based, the provision or provisions of this chapter that
are involved, and the minimum waiver or relief that is necessary. The applicant
shall state how the requested waiver and how the applicant's proposal shall
result in an equal or better means of complying with the requirements of this
chapter including but not limited to Section
1488.09.
   (e)   The Municipality shall keep a written record of all actions on waiver
requests. The Municipality may charge a fee for each waiver request, which
shall be used to offset the administrative costs of reviewing the waiver
request. The applicant shall also agree to reimburse the Municipality for
reasonable and necessary fees that may be incurred by the Municipal Engineer in
any review of a waiver request.
   (f)   In granting waivers, the Municipality may impose reasonable conditions
that will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the
standards or requirements that are to be modified.
   (g)   The Municipality may grant applications for waivers when the following
findings are made, as relevant:
      (1)   Requests must meet the provisions of Section
1488.11(g).
      (2)   That the waiver shall result in an equal or better means of
complying with the intent of this chapter.
      (3)   That the waiver is the minimum necessary to provide relief.
      (4)   That the applicant is not requesting a waiver based on cost
considerations.
      (5)   That existing down gradient storm water problems will not be
exacerbated.
      (6)   That runoff is not being diverted to a different drainage area.
      (7)   That increased flooding or ponding on off-site properties or
roadways will not occur.
      (8)   That potential icing conditions will not occur.
      (9)   That increases in peak flow or volume from the site will not occur.
      (10)   That erosive conditions due to increased peak flows or volume will
not occur.
      (11)   That adverse impact to water quality will not result.
      (12)   That increased 100-year floodplain levels will not result.
      (13)   That increased or unusual municipal maintenance expenses will not
result from the waiver.
      (14)   That the amount of storm water generated has been minimized to the
greatest extent allowed.
      (15)   That infiltration of runoff throughout the proposed site has been
provided where practicable and pre-development ground water recharge protected.
      (16)   That peak flow attenuation of runoff has been provided.
      (17)   That long-term operation and maintenance activities are
established.
      (18)   That the receiving streams and/or water bodies will not be
adversely impacted in flood-carrying capacity, aquatic habitat, channel
stability and erosion and sedimentation.
(Ord. 2458. Passed 11-15-10.)
1488.12   VOLUME CONTROLS.
   The low impact development practices provided in the PA BMP Manual shall be
used for all regulated activities to the maximum extent practicable. Water
volume controls shall be implemented using the design storm method in division
(a) or the simplified method in division (b) below. For regulated activity
areas equal or less than one acre that do not require hydrologic routing to
design the storm water facilities, this chapter establishes no preference for
either methodology; therefore, the applicant may select either methodology on
the basis of economic considerations, the intrinsic limitations on
applicability of the analytical procedures associated with each methodology,
and other factors.
   (a)   The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the PA BMP Manual (current version))
is applicable lo any size of regulated activity. This method requires detailed
modeling based on site conditions.
      (1)   Do not increase the post development total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the two-year, 24-hour duration precipitation.
      (2)   For modeling purposes:
         A.   Existing (pre-development) non-forested pervious areas must be
considered meadow or its equivalent.
         B.   Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present, shall
be considered meadow in the model for existing conditions.
   (b)   The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the PA BMP Manual (current version))
provided below is independent of site conditions and shall be used if the
design storm method is not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated
activities that disturb greater than one acre, or for projects that require
design of storm water storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
      (1)   Storm water facilities shall be sized to capture at least the first
two inches of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
      (2)   At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious surfaces
shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow - i.e. it shall not be
released into the surface waters of this Commonwealth. Removal options include
reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration.
      (3)   Wherever possible, infiltration facilities shall be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed runoff; however, in
all cases at least the first one-half inch of the permanently removed runoff
shall be infiltrated.
      (4)   This method is exempt from the requirements of Section
1488.13, Rate Controls.
(Ord. 2458. Passed 11-15-10.)
1488.13   RATE CONTROLS.
   (a)   Areas not covered by a Release Rate Map from an approved Act 167 Storm
Water Management Plan:
      Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the pre-development
discharge rates for the 1-, 2-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year storms. If it is
shown that the peak rates of discharge indicated by the post-development
analysis are less than or equal to the peak rates of discharge indicated by the
pre- development analysis for 1-, 2-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year, 24-hour
storms, then the requirements of this section have been met. Otherwise, the
applicant shall provide additional controls as necessary to satisfy the peak
rate of discharge requirement.
   (b)   Areas covered by a Release Rate Map from an approved Act 167 Storm
Water Management Plan:
      For the 1-, 2-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year storms, the post-development
discharge rates will follow the release rate maps in this chapter. For any
areas not shown on the release rate maps, the post-development discharge rates
shall not exceed the pre-development discharge rates.
   (c)   BMPs for Rate Controls: A list of BMPs for peak rate controls is
provided in the Appendices attached to Ordinance 2458.
(Ord. 2458. Passed 11-15-10.)
1488.14   CALCULATION METHODS.
   (a)   Storm water runoff from all project sites shall be calculated using a
generally accepted calculation technique that is based on the NRCS soil cover
complex method. Table 306-1 summarizes acceptable computation methods and the
method selected by the qualified professional shall be based on the individual
limitations and suitability of each method for a particular site.

Note: Successors to the above methods are also acceptable.
 
   (b)   All calculations consistent with this chapter using the soil cover
complex method shall use the appropriate design rainfall depths and intensities
for the various return period storms according to the approximate center of the
proposed development site, in accordance with the values obtained from the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Hydrometeorological
Design Studies Center Precipitation Frequency Data Server (PFDS) at the
following location for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania:
   http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/index.html
   Applicant shall provide documentation of PFDS data location (latitude and
longitude in degrees/minutes/seconds).
   (c)   All calculations using the Rational Formula shall use rainfall
intensities consistent with appropriate times-of-concentration for overland
flow and return periods from the NOAA, PFDS website, the design storm curves
from PennDOT Publication 13M, Design Manual Part 2, Chapter 10, and NOAA Atlas
14.
   (d)   Times-of-concentration for overland flow shall be calculated using the
methodology presented in Chapter 3 of Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
NRCS, TR-55 (as amended or replaced from time to time by NRCS). Times-of-
concentration for channel and pipe flow shall be computed using Manning's
equation. NRCS lag equation divided by 0.6 as acceptable method for Tc in
undeveloped areas.
   (e)   In order to reduce storm water runoff volumes from developed areas and
encourage ground water recharge, underground basin drains, infiltration
trenches, dry wells, and cisterns are permitted to which roof leaders may be
connected. These drains consist of stone-filled basins that temporarily store
and release water below ground surface. Plans for such facilities shall be
submitted to the Municipality for approval, and the basins shall be used only
in those areas where soils, geologic, and water table conditions permit.
   (f)   Runoff curve numbers (CN) for both existing and proposed conditions to
be used in the soil cover complex method shall be obtained from Table 2-2 of
the TR-55 manual.
   (g)   Runoff coefficients (C) for both existing and proposed conditions for
use in the rational formula are provided in the Appendices attached to
Ordinance 2458.
   (h)   All flow assumptions and source of supporting data shall be provided
as part of the overall plan. The Municipality reserves the right to reject any
submitted values, despite the source, and to provide a substitute source for
use by the applicant.
   (i)   Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning equation shall be used
for hydraulic computations, and to determine the capacity of open channels,
pipes, and storm sewers. Values for Manning's roughness coefficient (n) shall
be consistent with generally accepted values from a legitimate and verifiable
source. All flow assumptions and source of supporting data shall be provided as
part of the overall plan. The Municipality reserves the right to reject any
submitted values, despite the source, and to provide a substitute source for
use by the applicant. Full flow capacity shall be assumed for closed conduits.
Storm sewer systems consisting of more than three pipe junctions shall be
designed using hydraulic grade line computations.
   (j)   (1)   Outlet structures for storm water management facilities shall be
designed to meet the performance standards of this chapter using any generally
accepted hydraulic analysis technique or method.
      (2)   The design of any storm water detention facilities intended to meet
the performance standards of this chapter shall be verified by routing the
design storm hydrograph through these facilities using the Storage- Indication
Method. For drainage areas greater than 200 acres in size, the design storm
hydrograph shall be computed using a calculation method that produces a full
hydrograph (i.e. TR-20, TR-55, and HEC-HMS).
   (k)   Storm water management and related facilities shall be provided:
      (1)   To permit unimpeded flow of natural watercourses. Such flow may be
redirected as required, subject to the approval of the Pennsylvania Department
of Environmental Protection and the Municipality.
      (2)   To ensure adequate drainage of all street low points.
   (l)   Storm sewers and related installations:
      (1)   When located in undedicated land, they shall be placed within a
drainage easement not less than 20 feet wide as approved by the Municipality.
      (2)   The use of properly designed, graded, and vegetated drainage
channels is encouraged in lieu of storm sewers in commercial and industrial
areas and, where approved by the Municipality, in residential areas. Such
swales shall be designed to not only carry the required discharge without
excessive erosion, but also to increase the time of concentration, reduce the
peak discharge and velocity, and permit the water to percolate into the soil,
where appropriate. Criteria related to the use and design of drainage swales
are as follows:
         A.   The maximum encroachment of water on the roadway pavement along
roadside swales in cut areas shall not exceed half of a through traffic lane
during a ten-year frequency storm of five minute duration. Frequent and/or
sustained flooding of the sub-base shall be avoided.
         B.   The design of all vegetated channels shall, as a minimum, conform
to the design procedures outlined in the Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control
Program Manual (PA DEP). Inlets shall be provided to limit road shoulder
encroachment and water velocity.
         C.   The side slope for any vegetated drainage channel requiring
mowing of the vegetation shall have a maximum grade of three horizontal to one
vertical on those areas to be mowed. Maximum side slopes for any vegetated
drainage channel shall be two horizontal to one vertical.
         D.   Erosion prevention: All drainage swales shall be designed to
prevent the erosion of the bed and bank areas. Suitable temporary and/or
permanent stabilization during vegetative cover establishment shall be provided
to prevent erosion.
         E.   Storm sewers or drainage swales shall discharge to a detention or
retention basin to attenuate the peak rate and volume, respectively of storm
water runoff, except as provided in the plan.
      (3)   Storm inlet types and inlet assemblies shall conform to the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Standards for Roadway Construction as
approved by the Municipality.
      (4)   When evidence available to the Municipality indicates that existing
storm sewers have sufficient capacity as determined by hydrograph summation and
are accessible, proposed storm water facilities may connect to the existing
storm sewers so long as the peak rate of discharge does not exceed the amount
permitted by this chapter.
   (m)   Downstream Analysis.
      (1)   Where deemed necessary by the Municipal Engineer, the applicant
shall submit an analysis of the impacts of detained storm water flows on
downstream areas within the watershed, established with the concurrence of the
Municipal Engineer. The analysis shall include hydrologic and hydraulic
calculations necessary to determine the impact of peak discharge modifications
of the proposed development on critical locations such as dams, tributaries,
existing developments, undersized culverts, and flood- prone areas. Review and
comment of the analysis by the engineer of a downstream Municipality shall be
obtained as deemed necessary.
   (n)   Multiple Use Basins. The design and construction of multiple use storm
water detention facilities are strongly encouraged. In addition to storm water
management; where appropriate, facilities allow for recreational uses
including: ball fields, play areas, picnic grounds, etc. Provision for parking
facilities within basins and permanent wet ponds with storm water management
capabilities may also be appropriate. Prior approval and consultation with the
Municipality are required before design. Multiple use basins shall be
constructed so that potentially dangerous conditions are not created.
   (o)   Alternative Detention Facilities. Alternative storm water detention
facilities including roof top, subsurface basins or tanks and in-pipe detention
storage, or other approved alternative designs are permitted as determined by
the Municipality.
   (p)   Landscaping of Storm Water Management Facilities. Facilities
constructed with berms or earthen embankments shall not be landscaped along the
top of the impoundment berm, embankment, nor shall other facility areas
constructed from compacted fill materials be landscaped. Heavy vegetative cover
root penetration can cause soil weakening and damage to facility piping.
(Ord. 2458. Passed 11-15-10.)
1488.15   OTHER REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   All wet basins shall be designed in a manner that seeks to mitigate
the proliferation of mosquito breeding habitats and the potential spread of the
West Nile Virus. This can be accomplished through the following means:
      (1)   The design of a storm water wetland/wet basin must include the
selection of hydrophytic plant species for their pollutant uptake capabilities
and for not contributing to the potential for vector mosquito breeding. The
establishment of hydrophytic vegetation will promote the population of the
wetland/ wet basin by amphibians and other mosquito predators. In natural
wetlands, predatory insects and amphibians are effective at keeping mosquito
populations in check during the larval stage of development while birds and
bats prey on adult mosquitoes. Refer to Appendix B of the PA SWM BMP Manual
(current version) for hydrophytic native plant species lists.
      (2)   Aeration fountains and stocked fish can be added to keep larval
mosquito populations in check.
   (b)   The Municipality reserves the right to disapprove any design that
would result in the construction or continuation of a storm water problem area.
   (c)   When the elevation of any existing or proposed entrance to a
structure, including windows, is lower than the elevation of the public cartway
serving that site, a grading plan shall be submitted, reviewed and approved as
part of the SWM approval process for the proposed structure.
   (d)   No storm water detention facility shall be placed within 50 feet of a
special geologic feature. No subsurface storm water conveyance facility shall
be constructed within 50 feet of a special geologic feature, without written
permission of the Municipality.
   (e)   Storm water management facilities located outside of existing or
proposed public rights-of-way shall be located within and accessible by
easements granted to the Municipality as follows:
      (1)   Access easements. Where proposed storm water management facilities
are not adjacent to proposed or existing public right-of-ways or are not
accessible due to physical constraints, as determined by the Municipality, a
20-foot-wide access easement specifying rights of entry shall be provided
commensurate to need. Access easements shall provide for vehicle ingress and
egress on grades of less than 10% for carrying out inspection or maintenance
activities. A permanent 15-foot wide vehicular access road within the easement
(s) shall be provided around all SWM BMPs, such as ponds and infiltration
structures. The access roads shall connect to a public thoroughfare. The access
road (when applicable) will also provide access at a slope no greater than 20%
to the bottom of all ponds and associated outlet structures. The access road
shall be constructed of either gravel or pavement and maintained per the
maintenance agreement. The Municipality reserves the right to alter the design
of the access to any SWM BMP. Vehicle ingress and egress and access roads are
not required for SWM BMPs serving one Single-Family Residential lot and located
on the same lot they serve.
      (2)   Maintenance easements.
         A.   The maintenance easement must be located 20 feet outside of the
footprint for the storm water facility and appurtenances.
         B.   Maintenance easements are not required for SWM BMPs serving one
Single-Family Residential lot and located on the same lot they serve.
      (3)   Easements shall state that no trees, shrubs, structures,
excavation, placement of fill, or re-grading are to be performed within the
easement without written approval from the Municipality upon review by the
Municipal Engineer. Upon approval of the Municipality, such landscaping may be
placed in maintenance easements, provided it does not impede access.
      (4)   Whenever practicable, easements shall be parallel to width and
linked to property lines of the subdivision.
      (5)   All easement agreements shall be recorded with a reference to the
recorded easement indicated on the site plan. The format and content of the
easement agreement shall be reviewed and approved by the Municipality and
Solicitor.
   (f)   In order to promote overland flow and infiltration, roof drains shall
not discharge directly to streets or storm sewers. Roof drains may discharge
directly to streets or storm sewers when deemed necessary by the Municipality.
Under no circumstances shall roof drains discharge directly to sanitary sewer
systems.
   Projects that have the potential to discharge into surface waters that have
existing or designated HQ or EV uses (including EV wetlands), have impairments
due to storm water, are connected to combined sewer systems, or have the
potential to have an adverse effect on threatened or endangered species, or
critical habitat for such species, are subject to additional BMP measures that
must be considered and implemented for projects occurring in these more
environmentally-sensitive areas:
 
                                    Significant detention of peak flow rates
                                    is needed and the contributing drainage
Constructed wetlands/Wet ponds      area is large; retrofit existing detention
                                    basins or construct new in open median or
                                    interchange areas
Permeable pavement                  Limited to park-and-ride sites and parking
                                    lots
                                    Subsurface storage products are designed
                                    to temper peak runoff events through
                                    infiltration and/or discharge rate
                                    reduction. Storm sewer inlet structures or
Manufactured products: Subsurface   inserts are designed to minimize the
storage, water quality inlets, etc. discharge of solids, floatables, and oil/
                                    grease pollutants. Regular maintenance of
                                    these products is necessary and is an
                                    important factor in assessing the
                                    feasibility of using one of these
                                    products.
 
   Proposed infiltration BMPs within two miles on either side of surface water
supply areas or surface waters that have existing or designated HQ or EV uses
(including EV wetlands) must be designed and constructed to provide maximum
pollutant removal prior to the runoff being infiltrated or discharged to the
receiving stream. PADEP defines the following zones around such waters:
      (1)   Zone A. Represents a 1/4-mile buffer on either side of the river or
stream extending from the area 1/4 mile downstream of the intake upstream to
the five-hour time-of-travel (TOT) (Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection, 2006).
      (2)   Zone B. Represents a two-mile buffer on either side of the water
body extending from the area 1/4-mile downstream of the intake upstream to the
25-hour TOT. (Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, 2006).
      (3)   Zone C. The remainder of the watershed area (Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection, 2006).
   (g)   Ground Water Supply Protection.
      (1)   Zone 1. The innermost protective zone surrounding a well, spring,
or existing infiltrative gallery. Zone 1 is the area within a radius of 400
feet around a community or public water supply source unless information is
presented supporting a reduction of this requirement. Proposed infiltration
BMPs are not permitted within Zone 1 protection areas (Pennsylvania Department
of Environmental Protection, 2006).
      (2)   Zone 2. The capture zone that encompasses the area of the aquifer
through which it supplies water to a well, spring, or existing infiltration
gallery. Zone 2 is one-half mile radius around a community or public water
supply source unless more extensive hydrogeological testing is done. Extreme
care should be used when implementing infiltration BMPs in Zone 2 areas.
Pretreatment measures must be used to filter and diminish pollutants
(Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, 2006).
      (3)   Zone 3. The area outside Zone 2 that contributes significant
recharge to the capture zone aquifer in Zone 2 (Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection, 2006). Use of infiltration BMPs is not restricted.
      (4)   Infiltration BMPs are not permitted within a radius of 50 feet from
privately-owned wells and water sources serving non-community supply systems
(Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, 2006).
(Ord. 2458. Passed 11-15-10.)
1488.16   TIMBER HARVESTING/SILVICULTURE.
   It is not the intention for this section to serve as an ordinance or
regulatory document governing the practice of timber harvesting/silviculture
activities. However, the intent of this section and the included guidelines is
to address specific storm water management issues related to or caused by such
timber harvesting activities. These regulations shall not be considered a
timber-harvesting ordinance, nor do they relieve the applicant from meeting any
additional timber harvesting regulations already in place. The municipality, at
its own discretion, may choose to enact any new or enforce any existing
ordinance directly related to timber harvesting.
   (a)   Logging operators shall address and comply with all applicable
standards for erosion and sedimentation control and stream crossing regulations

   (a)   No insurance company, association or exchange (hereinafter referred to
as the insuring agent) doing business in the Commonwealth shall pay a claim of
a named insured for fire damage to a structure located within the Borough,
where the amount recoverable for the fire loss to the structure under all
policies exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000), unless the insuring agent is
furnished by the Borough Treasurer with a municipal certificate pursuant to
Section 508(B) of Act 98 of 1992, whereinafter, the insurance company,
association or exchange and the Municipality shall comply with the procedures
therein, and unless there is compliance with Section 508(C) and (D) of Act 98
of 1992 and the provisions of this chapter.
   (b)   Where, pursuant to Section 508(B)(l)(I) of Act 98 of 1992, the Borough
Treasurer issues a certificate indicating that there are no delinquent taxes,
assessments, penalties or user charges against real property, the insuring
agent shall pay the claim of the named insured, provided, however, that if the
loss that is agreed upon by the named insured and the insuring agent equals or
exceeds sixty percent of the aggregate limits of liability on all fire policies
covering the building restructure, the following procedures must be followed:
      (1)   A.   The insuring agent shall transfer from the insurance proceeds
to the designated officer of the Borough in the aggregate of two thousand
dollars ($2,000) for each fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) of a claim and for
each fraction of that amount of a claim. This section shall be applied so that
if the claim is fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) or less, the amount
transferred to the Borough shall be two thousand dollars ($2,000); or
         B.   If, at the time of a proof of loss agreed to between the named
insured and the insuring agent, the named insured has submitted a contractor's
signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or
other structure, the insuring agent shall transfer to the Borough from the
insurance proceeds the amount specified in the estimate.
      (2)   The transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all
companies, associations or exchanges insuring the building or other structure.
      (3)   After the transfer, the named insured may submit a contractor's
signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or
other structure, and the designated officer shall return the amount of the
funds transferred to the Borough in excess of the estimate to the named
insured, if the Borough has not commenced to remove, repair or secure the
building or other structure.
   (c)   Upon receipt of proceeds under this section, the Borough shall do all
of the following:
      (1)   The designated officer shall place the proceeds in a separate fund
to be used solely as security against the total costs of removing, repairing or
securing the building or structure which are incurred by the Borough. Such
costs shall include, without limitation, any engineering, legal or
administrative costs incurred by the Borough in connection with such removal,
repair or securing of the building or any proceedings related thereto.
      (2)   It is the obligation of the insuring agent, when transferring the
proceeds, to provide the Borough with the name and address of the named
insured. Upon receiving the transferred funds and the name and address of the
named insured, the designated officer shall contact the named insured, certify
that the proceeds have been received by the Borough and notify the named
insured that the procedures under this subsection shall be followed.
      (3)   When repair, removal or securing of the building or other structure
has been completed in accordance with all applicable regulations and orders of
the Borough, and the required proof of such completion has been received by the
designated officer, and if the Borough has not incurred any costs for such
repair, removal or securing, the funds shall be returned to the named insured.
If the Borough has incurred costs for repair, removal or securing of the
building or other structure, the costs shall be paid from the fund, and if
excess funds remain, the Borough shall transfer the remaining funds to the
named insured.
      (4)   To the extent that interest is earned on proceeds held by the
Borough pursuant to this section, and not returned to the named insured, such
interest shall belong to the Borough. To the extent that proceeds are returned
to the named insured, interest earned on such proceeds shall be distributed to
the named insured at the time that the proceeds are returned.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ability of the
Borough to recover any deficiency. Furthermore, nothing in this section shall
be construed to prohibit the Borough and the named insured from entering into
an agreement that permits the transfer of funds to the named insured if some
other reasonable disposition of the damaged property has been negotiated.
(Ord. 2267. Passed 6-19-00.)
1620.03   PROCEDURES AND REGULATIONS; FEES.
