provide as follows:
      3407.3 Special Requirements For Building Permits - Historic Resources:
The following special requirements shall apply to a building permit to demolish
a building, structure, or site listed on the Upper Dublin Historic Inventory,
Chapter A264. Terms set forth herein shall be as defined in
Chapter 127 and
Chapter 255.
      1.   Applicability of Special Requirements. No historic resource on the
Historic Resource Inventory,

in part, unless a building permit therefor is obtained from the Code
Enforcement Officer in accordance with the procedures and requirements of this
section.
      2.   Procedure for Obtaining Building Permit - Class II Resource.
         (a)   The applicant shall submit one copy of an application for a
building permit to the Code Enforcement Officer in a form acceptable to the
Township. If the Code Enforcement Officer determines that the permit request is
for the demolition of a building, structure, or site listed as a Class II
resource on the Historic Resource Inventory,
Chapter A264 of the Upper Dublin Township Code, he shall not issue the building
permit and the application shall be forwarded to the Historical Commission.
         (b)   Information to be Provided. In addition to the other
requirements of this section, an applicant seeking a permit to demolish an
historic resource on the Historic Resource Inventory shall provide the
following information:
            (i)   Name and address of owner of record.
            (ii)   Site plan showing all buildings and structures on the
property.
            (iii)   Recent photographs of the resource proposed for demolition.
(the applicant may request the Township to secure photographs provided
permission is given to enter the property for this purpose)
            (iv)   Reasons for the demolition.
            (v)   Proposed method of demolition.
            (vi)   Intended future use of the site and of the architecturally
significant materials from the demolished resource.
            (vii)   Where applicable, plans showing any proposed new
construction or reconstruction.
         (c)   The applicant or the Code Enforcement Officer shall, within 10
days from the filing thereof, post a notice on the property indicating that the
owner has applied for a permit to demolish an historic resource on the
property. The notice shall be posted on each street frontage of the premises
with which the notice is concerned and shall be clearly visible to the public.
Posting of a notice shall not be required in the event of an emergency which is
determined by the Code Enforcement Officer to require immediate action to
protect the health or safety of the public.
         (d)   Review by Historical Commission. Within 45 days of receipt of a
complete application from the Code Enforcement Officer, the Historical
Commission, at a regular or special meeting, shall review the application for
demolition. The applicant will be notified of such meeting at least 10 days
prior to its date and shall have the opportunity to present his reasons for
filing the application. The Historical Commission shall consider the following:
            (i)   The effect of demolition on the historical significance and
architectural integrity of the resource in question and neighboring historic
resources;
            (ii)   Whether the applicant has demonstrated that he has
considered all alternatives to demolition;
            (iii)   Economic feasibility of adaptive reuse of the resource
proposed for demolition;
            (iv)   Alternatives to demolition of the resource;
            (v)   Whether the resource in its current condition presents a
threat to public safety;
            (vi)   Whether the resource has been intentionally neglected;
            (vii)   Whether the retention of the resource would represent an
unreasonable economic hardship.
         (e)   Where the Historical Commission determines that additional
information is needed from the applicant in order to adequately address the
issues enumerated in Subsection 2(d) above, request for such information shall
be made in writing to the applicant prior to the expiration of the initial
thirty-day review period.
         (f)   Historical Commission recommendation. Within 30 days following
conclusion of the meeting and the receipt of additional requested information,
whichever is later, the Historical Commission shall set forth its
recommendations in a written report to the Board of Commissioners.
            (i)   Immediate approval. After reviewing the building permit
application with attachments, the Commission may recommend:
               (i.i)   Approval of the permit, as provided under Subsection (2)
(g)(i), below; or
               (i.ii)   Conditional approval subject to the applicant providing
appropriate documentation of the historical significance of the resource(s)
prior to demolition, in the same manner as provided in Subsection 2(h)(ii)
below.
            (ii)   Delay of demolition. Alternatively, the Commission may
recommend delay of demolition in accordance with Subsection 2(h) below.
         (g)   Approval of building permit or delay of demolition by the Board
of Commissioners.
            (i)   Within 30 days after receiving the recommendation from the
Historical Commission, the Board of Commissioners shall consider the
application, together with the recommendations of the Historical Commission,
and vote either to approve the application, approve the application with
changes and/or conditions, or defer their decision, affording a delay of
demolition for up to 90 days as set forth in Subsection 2(h) below. The
applicant shall be notified of the meeting of the Board at least 10 days prior
to its date, and shall have the opportunity to present his reasons for filing
the application. Within seven days after making its decision, the Board shall
provide written communication of its decision to the applicant, the Historical
Commission, the Commissioners Planning Committee and the Code Enforcement
Officer.
            (ii)   Issuance of building permit. Where the Board acts to approve
the application, it shall authorize the Code Enforcement Officer to issue the
permit. Where the approval is granted with conditions attached, the Code
Enforcement Officer shall be authorized to issue the permit subject to those
conditions.
         (h)   Delay of demolition.
            (i)   The specified period of delay up to 90 days shall be used to
provide an opportunity to engage in discussion with the applicant about
alternatives to demolition of an historical resource; to allow for appropriate
documentation of the resource pursuant to Subsection h(ii) as set forth below;
and/or for preparation of a financial analysis, as set forth below for Class I
only. The Historical Commission shall make every effort to communicate with the
applicant to inform him of the historical importance of the resource, its
significance to the Township, and alternatives to demolition.
            (ii)   Documentation of historic resources. When ordering the delay
of demolition, the Board of Commissioners may request the Historic Commission
to provide documentation of the resource proposed for demolition. Such
documentation may include, as available: historical data, surveys, and other
data provided by local, state, and federal historic preservation organizations
and agencies; photographs; floor plans; measured drawings; archaeological
surveys (if appropriate); and any other comparable form of documentation
recommended by the Historical Commission. The extent of documentation required
shall reasonably relate to the architectural quality and/or historical
significance of the resource(s). Where the Historical Commission determines
that additional information is needed from the applicant in order to adequately
address the issues enumerated above, request for such information shall be made
in writing to the applicant prior to the expiration of the initial thirty-day
review period. The Board of Commissioners may extend the stipulated 90 days
until the applicant has sufficiently satisfied the documentation requirements.
            (iii)   With respect to a Class II resource, the Historical
Commission shall provide its recommendation on issuance of the permit to the
Board of Commissioners not later than the end of the applicable one-hundred-
five-day review period, as it might be extended. The Board of Commissioners
shall approve the application for demolition of the resource(s) in accordance
with Subsection (2)(g)(i), above, within the applicable one-hundred-five-day
review period, whether it receives a recommendation from the Historical
Commission or not.
         (i)   Historical Commission recommendation.
            (i)   Once the delay of demolition has expired, the Historical
Commission shall review the application again together with any further
documentation requested by the Board of Commissioners at its next regular
meeting. The Commission may recommend to the Board of Commissioners approval of
the permit or, where the Commission does not believe that the applicant has
proven unreasonable economic hardship or the lack of a reasonable alternative,
recommend denial of the permit. The Commission shall consider the following in
making its recommendation:
               (i.i)   The effect of demolition on the historical significance
and architectural integrity of the resource in question and neighboring
historic resources;
               (i.ii)   Whether the applicant has demonstrated that he has
considered all alternatives to demolition;
               (i.iii)   The economic feasibility of adaptive reuse of the
resource proposed for demolition;
               (i.iv)   Alternatives to demolition of the resource;
               (i.v)   Whether the resource in its current condition presents a
threat to public safety;
               (i.vi)   Whether the resource has been intentionally neglected;
               (i.vii)   Whether the retention of the resource would represent
an unreasonable economic hardship.
            (ii)   The Commission shall communicate its recommendation in
writing to the Board of Commissioners within 30 days of the expiration of the
ninety-day delay period.
      3.   Procedure For Obtaining Building Permit - Class I Resource. The
procedure for obtaining a building permit to demolish a Class I Resource shall
be the same as that for a Class II resource, except as follows:
         (a)   No permit shall be issued for the demolition of a Class I
resource except in cases where the applicant specifically alleges that
demolition is necessary due to unreasonable economic hardship. In such cases,
the Board of Commissioners may, during the period of delay, request that the
applicant prepare and submit the basis for this allegation. This may include a
financial analysis to the Board containing some or all of the following
information, as applicable and available:
            (i)   Amount paid for the property;
            (ii)   Date of purchase and party from whom purchased, including a
description of the relationship, if any, whether business or familial, between
the owner and the person from whom the property was purchased;
            (iii)   Assessed value of the land and improvements thereon
according to the most recent assessment;
            (iv)   A pro forma financial statement prepared by an accountant or
broker of record;
            (v)   All appraisals obtained by the owner in connection with his
purchase or financing of the property, or during his ownership of the property,
if any;
            (vi)   Bona fide offers to sell or rent the property, the price
asked, and offers received, if any;
            (vii)   Any consideration by the owner as to profitable, adaptive
uses for the property, and any other practical uses; incentives which could be
offered by the Township to preserve the resource; and any input from local,
state, or federal historic preservation and architectural organizations or
agencies;
            (viii)   Where relevant, written estimates of the cost(s) of
restoration and/or renovation from at least two professional restoration
contractors.
         (b)   Approval or denial of building permit for Class I resources
after delay of demolition.
            (i)   At its next regular meeting after receiving the
recommendation from the Historical Commission, or at a special meeting if
necessary to comply with Subsection 3(b)(iii) below, unless an extension of
time has been granted by the Applicant, the Board of Commissioners shall again
consider the application, together with the recommendations of the Historical
Commission and any further documentation which had been requested, and vote
either to approve the application or to approve the application with changes as
set forth in Subsection (2)(g)(i) above, or to deny the application as set
forth below.
            (ii)   Denial of application. Where the Board acts to deny the
application, a notice of denial shall be sent to the applicant indicating what
changes in the plans and specifications, if any, would be sufficient to meet
the standards of this section.
            (iii) Action by the Board of Commissioners, including appropriate
notification to the applicant, shall occur within 60 days of the expiration of
the ninety-day delay period.

procedures shall not have the effect of waiving requirements specifically
provided for in the Code. [Amended 7- 14-2009 by Ord. No. 09-1214]
   B.   Applications and permits. The Code Official shall receive applications,
review construction documents and issue permits for the erection and

issues that arise, subject to the approval of the appointing authority.
   E.   Right of entry. Where it is necessary to make an inspection to enforce
the provisions of the Code, or where the Code Official has reasonable cause to
believe that there exists in a structure or upon a premises a condition which
is contrary to or in violation of the Code which makes the structure or
premises unsafe, dangerous or hazardous, the Code Official is authorized to
enter the structure or premises at reasonable times to inspect or to perform
the duties imposed by the Code, provided that if such structure or premises be

§ 73-9.   Construction documents.
   A.   Submittal documents. Construction documents, special inspection and
structural observation programs and other data shall be submitted in one or
more sets with each application for a permit. The construction documents shall
be prepared by a registered design professional where required by the statutes
of the jurisdiction in which the project is to be constructed. Where special
conditions exist, the Code Official is authorized to require additional
construction documents to be prepared by a registered design professional.
      (1)   Exception. The Code Official is authorized to waive the submission
of construction documents and other data not required to be prepared by a
registered design professional if it is found that the nature of the work
applied for is such that review of construction documents is not necessary to
obtain compliance with this code.
         (a)   Information on construction documents. Construction documents
shall be dimensioned and drawn upon suitable material. Electronic media
documents are permitted to be submitted when approved by the Code Official.
Construction documents shall be of sufficient clarity to indicate the location,

to the provisions of the Code and relevant laws, ordinances, rules and
regulations, as determined by the Code Official.
            [1]   Fire protection system shop drawings. Shop drawings for the
fire protection system(s) shall be submitted to indicate conformance with the
Code and the construction documents and shall be approved prior to the start of

sufficient detail the location, construction, size and character of all
portions of the means of egress in compliance with the provisions of this Code.
In other than occupancies in Groups R-2, R-3, as applicable in Section 101.2,
and I-1, the construction documents shall designate the number of occupants to
be accommodated on every floor and in all rooms and spaces.
         (c)   Exterior wall envelope.
            [1]   Construction documents for all buildings shall describe the
exterior wall envelope in sufficient detail to determine compliance with the
Code, The construction documents shall provide details of the exterior wall
envelope as required, including flashing, intersections with dissimilar
materials, corners, end details, control joints, intersections at roof, eaves
or parapets, means of drainage, water-resistive membrane and details around
openings.
            [2]   The construction documents shall include manufacturer's
installation instructions that provide supporting documentation that the
proposed penetration and opening details described in the construction
documents maintain the weather resistance of the exterior wall envelope. The
supporting documentation shall fully describe the exterior wall system which
was tested, where applicable, as well as the test procedure used.
   B.   Site plan. The construction documents submitted with the application
for permit shall be accompanied by a site plan showing to scale the size and
location of new construction and existing structures on the site, distances
from the lot lines, the established street grades and the proposed finished
grades and, as applicable, flood hazard areas, floodways and design flood
elevations; and it shall be drawn in accordance with an accurate boundary line
survey. In the case of demolition, the site plan shall show construction to be
demolished and the location and size of existing structures and construction
that are to remain on the site or plot. The Code Official is authorized to
waive or modify the requirement for a site plan when the application for permit
is for alteration or repair or when otherwise warranted.
   C.   Examination of documents. The Code Official shall examine or cause to
be examined the accompanying construction documents and shall ascertain by such
examinations whether the construction indicated and described is in accordance
with the requirements of this Code and other pertinent laws or ordinances.
      (1)   Approval of Construction documents. When the Code Official issues a
permit, the construction documents shall be approved, in writing or by stamp,
as "Reviewed for Code Compliance". One set of construction documents so
reviewed shall be retained by the Code Official. The other set shall be
returned to the applicant, shall be kept at the site of work and shall be open
to inspection by the Code Official or a duly authorized representative.
      (2)   Previous approvals. The Code shall not require changes in the
construction documents, construction or designated occupancy of a structure for
which a lawful permit has been heretofore issued or otherwise lawfully
authorized, and the construction of which has been pursued in good faith within
180 days after the effective date of this Code and has not been abandoned.
      (3)   Phased approval. The Code Official is authorized to issue a permit
for the construction of foundations or any other part of a building or
structure before the construction documents for the whole building or structure
have been submitted, provided that adequate information and detailed statements
have been filed complying with pertinent requirements of the Code. The holder
of such permit for the foundation or other parts of a building or structure
shall proceed at the holder's own risk with the building operation and without
assurance that a permit for the entire structure will be granted.

         (a)   General.
            [1]   When it is required that documents be prepared by a
registered design professional, the Code Official shall be authorized to
require the owner to engage and designate on the building permit application a
registered design professional who shall act as the registered design
professional in responsible charge. If the circumstances require, the owner
shall designate a substitute registered design professional in responsible
charge who shall perform the duties required of the original registered design
professional in responsible charge. The Code Official shall be notified in
writing by the owner if the registered design professional in responsible
charge is changed or is unable to continue to perform the duties.

the registered design professional in responsible charge who shall review them
and forward them to the Code Official with a notation indicating that the
deferred submittal documents have been reviewed and been found to be in general
conformance to the design of the building. The deferred submittal items shall
not be installed until the design and submittal documents have been approved by
the Code Official.
   D.   Amended construction documents. Work shall be installed in accordance
with the approved construction documents, and any changes made during
construction that are not in compliance with the approved construction
documents shall be resubmitted for approval as an amended set of construction
documents.

[Amended 7-14-2009 by Ord. No. 09-1214, § 1; 1-12-2010 by Ord. No. 10-1226, §
13; 2-13-2018 by Ord. No. 18-1340, § 1]
   A.   Payment of fees. A permit shall not be valid until the fees prescribed
by law have been paid, nor shall an amendment to a permit be released until the
additional fee, if any, has been paid.
   B.   Schedule of fees. Applicants for permits under the Code shall pay to
the Township at the time of application the fees, escrows, and deposits set
forth on the then-current fee schedule which shall have been adopted by
resolution or ordinance by the Board of Commissioners. When a permit fee,
escrow, or deposit is based on the cost of construction, the valuation of the
subject work shall be the fair market value of all the construction work. The
Code Official shall evaluate the accuracy of the estimate both initially and at
final completion should changes occur as the work progresses. [Amended 7-14-
2009 by Ord. No. 09-1214]
   C.   Work commencing before permit issuance. Any person who commences any
work on a building, structure, or electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing
system before obtaining the required permits shall be subject to a late fee for
each required permit. The late fee shall be paid in addition to the required
permit fee and shall be paid in an amount equal to the required permit fee up
to a maximum of $1,000. [Amended 7-14-2009 by Ord. No. 09-1214]
   D.   Related fees. The payment of the fee for the construction, alteration,
removal or demolition of work done in connection to or concurrently with the
work authorized by a building permit shall not relieve the applicant or holder
of the permit from the payment of other fees that are prescribed by law. One
such fee is a charge of $4.50 as a Uniform Construction Code fee which shall be
charged in addition to the payment of other fees upon application for any
Building, Plumbing, Electrical or HVAC permit. [Amended 1-12-2010 by Ord. No.
10-1226; 2-13-2018 by Ord. No. 18-1340, §1]

   A.   General. Construction or work for which a permit is required shall be
subject to inspection by the Code Official, and such construction or work shall
remain accessible and exposed for inspection purposes until approved. Approval
as a result of an inspection shall not be construed to be an approval of a
violation of the provisions of the Code or of other ordinances of the
jurisdiction. Inspections presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the
provisions of the Code or of other ordinances of the jurisdiction shall not be
valid. It shall be the duty of the permit applicant to cause the work to remain
accessible and exposed for inspection purposes. Neither the Code Official nor
the jurisdiction shall be liable for expense entailed in the removal or
replacement of any material required to allow inspection.
   B.   Required inspections. A list of the minimum required inspections shall
be on file with the Director of Code Enforcement for distribution upon request.

   E.   Approval required. Work shall not be done beyond the point indicated in
each successive inspection without first obtaining the approval of the Code
Official. The Code Official, upon notification, shall make the requested
inspections and shall either indicate the portion of the construction that is
satisfactory as completed, or notify the permit holder or his or her agent
wherein the same fails to comply with the Code. Any portions that do not comply
shall be corrected, and such portion shall not be covered or concealed until
authorized by the Code Official.
§ 73-12.   Certificate of occupancy.
   A.   Use and occupancy. No building or structure shall be used or occupied,
and no change in the existing occupancy classification of a building or
structure or portion thereof shall be made until the Code Official has issued a
certificate of occupancy therefor as provided herein. Issuance of a certificate
of occupancy shall not be construed as an approval of a violation of the
provisions of the Code or of other ordinances of the jurisdiction.
   B.   Certificate issued. After the Code Official inspects the building or
structure and finds no violations of the provisions of the Code or other laws
that are enforced by the Code Enforcement Department, the Code Official shall
issue a certificate of occupancy.
   C.   Temporary occupancy. The Code Official is authorized to issue a
temporary certificate of occupancy before the completion of the entire work
covered by the permit, provided that such portion or portions shall be occupied
safely. The Code Official shall set a time period during which the temporary
certificate of occupancy is valid.
   D.   Revocation. The Code Official is authorized to, in writing, suspend or
revoke a certificate of occupancy or completion issued under the provisions of
the Code wherever the certificate is issued in error, or on the basis of
incorrect information supplied, or where it is determined that the building or
structure or portion thereof is in violation of any ordinance or regulation or
any of the provisions of the Code.
§ 73-13.   Service utilities.
   A.   Connection of service utilities. No person shall make connections from

structure or system regulated by the Code and the codes referenced in case of
emergency where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to life or property.
The Code Official shall notify the serving utility, and, wherever possible, the
owner and occupant of the building, structure or service system of the decision
to disconnect prior to taking such action. If not notified prior to
disconnecting, the owner or occupant of the building, structure or service
system shall be notified in writing as soon as practical thereafter.

the Board of Commissioners. The Building Code Board of Appeals shall consist of
five voting members and two alternate members. An alternate member may
participate in any proceeding or discussion of the Building Code Board of
Appeals but shall not be entitled to vote as a member of the Building Code
Board of Appeals unless designated as a voting member. Each regular and
alternate member of the Building Code Board of Appeals shall serve for a term

Appeals with the designated fee using a form furnished by the Department of
Code Enforcement. Applicants and appellants, or their representatives, shall
have the right to a hearing on their application or appeal if such right is
requested on the form.
§ 73-15.   Violations.
   A.   Unlawful acts. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate a
provision of the Code or fail to comply with any of the requirements thereof or
use, erect, construct, alter, extend, repair, remove, demolish or occupy any
building, structure or equipment regulated by the Code, or cause the same to be
done, in conflict with or in violation of an approved plan or of a directive of
the Director of Code Enforcement or of a permit or certificate issued under the
provisions of the Code.
   B.   Violation penalties. Any person who violates a provision of the Code or
fails to comply with any of the requirements thereof or who commits an unlawful
act hereunder shall be liable to fines and penalties not exceeding $1,000,
which fines and penalties may be collected by suit or summary proceeding
brought in the name of the Township of Upper Dublin before any District Justice
in like manner as debts of a like amount are now by law recoverable. Each day
that a violation continues shall be deemed a separate offense.
   C.   Abatement of violation. The imposition of the penalties herein
prescribed shall not preclude the Township from instituting appropriate action
to prevent unlawful construction or to restrain, correct or abate a violation
or to prevent illegal occupancy of a building, structure or premises or to stop
an illegal act, conduct, business or use of a building or structure on or about
any premises.
   D.   Unlawful continuance. Any person who shall continue any work in or
about the structure after having been served with a stop-work order, except
such work as that person is directed to perform to remove a violation or unsafe
condition, shall be deemed to have committed a violation of the Code and shall
be subject to those penalties prescribed hereinabove in addition to such other
legal and equitable remedies as the township may seek.
   E.   Disregard of unsafe notice. Upon refusal or neglect of the person
served with an unsafe notice to comply with the requirements of the order to
abate the unsafe condition, the legal officer or the Director of Code
Enforcement shall be advised of all the facts and shall institute the
appropriate action to compel compliance.

§ 73-17.   Changes to Uniform Construction Code.
[Added 9-8-2009 by Ord. No. 09-1218, § 1; Amended 1-12-2010 by Ord. No. 10-
1226, § 14]
   A.   Intent. The intent of this section is to supplement and amend the
provisions of the Uniform Construction Code so that it better applies to the
Township and more fully satisfies the unique building code requirements of the
Township for the protection of health, safety, and welfare within the Township
as justified below:
      (1)   Established in 1701, Upper Dublin Township was originally a part of
a 1684 land grant from William Penn called “Dublin.” In its early years, the
Township was mostly farmland with population centers around the settlements of
Dreshertown, Fort Washington, Fitzwatertown, Jarrettown, Maple Glen, Rose
Valley and Three Tons. During the Revolutionary War the Continental Army
encamped within the Township in 1777 and the Township was witness to many
military movements and expeditions. Today, Upper Dublin Township occupies the
inner suburban ring around Philadelphia and is over 90% built-out as a near-
urban suburban community.
      (2)   The historic population centers of Dresher, Fort Washington,
Fitzwatertown, Jarrettown, and Maple Glen grew tremendously following World War
II, through the 1950's to the present. The vast majority of the 13 square miles
of Upper Dublin Township are now developed and committed to the following uses:
residential use (58%); commercial, office and industrial use (11%); and as
institutional and public use (27%). Only 4% of the land area of Upper Dublin
Township is currently undeveloped.
      (3)   As of the year 2000, Upper Dublin Township accommodated a
population of 25,878 persons. The Township's forecasted population in the year
2025 is 27,370. The population density of the Township in the year 2000 was
1,960 persons per square mile As a densely developed inner-ring suburban
community near Philadelphia, with distinct historic neighborhoods connected by
modern suburban housing and commercial development, the Township must address
complex health, safety and welfare issues, including environmental protection,
stormwater management, historic preservation, place identity, population
density, and redevelopment. These issues are experienced on a scale within the
Township that exceeds that of most other municipalities within the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania.
      (4)   As one consequence of the Township's size and extent of
urbanization, the Township is compelled by the Clean Water Act to obtain and
comply with a Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (“MS4"), National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permit for the management and discharge
of stormwater within the Township, the terms of which require increased
Township regulation of development and construction activities with respect to
stormwater runoff and the effects of such runoff on public health, safety,
welfare, and the environment.
      (5)   The Board of Commissioners of Upper Dublin Township finds that the
provisions of the Uniform Construction Code do not fully meet the building code
requirements of the Township of Upper Dublin and therefore must be supplemented
and amended to better apply to the Township.
   B.   The Uniform Construction Code standards as administered in Upper Dublin
Township shall be supplemented and amended with the addition of the following
standards:
      (1)   (Reserved)
      (2)   (Reserved)
      (3)   (Reserved)
      (4)   (Reserved)
      (5)   Section 403.26 related to Swimming Pools, shall have added the
following subsection (d) which reads: “(d) Completion guaranty. Before any
building permit shall be issued for the construction or installation of a
swimming pool, the Township shall be assured by means of a proper completion
guarantee in the form of a bond or the deposit of funds or securities in escrow
in the amount of 20% of the estimated cost of construction, as determined by
the Director of Code Enforcement, to assure that the required improvements
(i.e., fencing, electrical, grading, walls and drainage structures) will be
installed on or before a date specified in said bond or escrow agreement.”
[Added 1-12- 2010 by Ord. No. 10-1226]
      (6)   Swimming pools, spas, and hot tubs. In addition to the provisions
of 34 Pa.Code § 403.26, the provisions of the International Residential Code
and the provisions of the International Building Code relating to swimming
pools, the construction of all swimming pools, spas, and hot tubs shall comply
with the provisions of
Chapter 218, Swimming Pools, Article I, Construction Standards.
   C.   Commercial permits and inspections.
      (1)   As the Uniform Construction Code is administered in Upper Dublin
Township, 34 Pa.Code § 403.42(c)(1)(xiii) regarding permit exceptions shall be
amended to read, “except for Historic Resources, where the installation and
replacement of windows shall require a building permit.”
      (2)   As the Uniform Construction Code is administered in Upper Dublin
Township, 34 Pa.Code § 403.43(a) regarding the grant of a permit shall have
added a second sentence which reads: “When a grading permit has been applied
for in conjunction with proposed construction, the 30-day approval/denial time-
frame may be extended because the building permit shall not be issued until the
grading permit has been approved.”
      (3)   As the Uniform Construction Code is administered in Upper Dublin
Township, 34 Pa.Code § 403.43(g) regarding permit expiration shall read with
respect to permit expiration: “A permit is valid for one year from its issue
date and may be renewed annually for up to five years from its issue date.”
      (4)   As the Uniform Construction Code is administered in Upper Dublin
Township, 34 Pa.Code § 403.45(c) regarding inspections shall have added a
sentence which reads: “The owner or contractor shall provide a minimum of
twenty-four-hour notice to the Code Official for inspection.”

exclusions and exemptions, the Uniform Construction Code as administered in
Upper Dublin Township shall apply to all utility and miscellaneous use
structures that are accessory to one- and two-family dwellings and that are
greater than or equal to 120 square feet in building area, including, but not
limited to, carports, detached private garages, greenhouses, and sheds.

exclusions and exemptions, the Uniform Construction Code as administered in
Upper Dublin Township shall apply to all uncovered decks regardless of the
elevation of the deck floor above grade, and a permit shall be required for the
installation of an uncovered deck.
      (3)   Contrary to 34 Pa.Code §§ 403.1(b)(8) and 403.1(b)(9) regarding
alterations and repairs to residential buildings, the Uniform Construction Code
as administered in Upper Dublin Township shall apply to alterations and repairs
to residential buildings, including basement remodeling projects and the
installation and replacement of doors and windows in historic resources.
      (4)   As the Uniform Construction Code is administered in Upper Dublin
Township, 34 Pa.Code § 403.62(c)(8) shall be deleted. The Township shall
require a building permit for the installation of an uncovered deck regardless
of the height of the floor of the deck.
      (5)   As the Uniform Construction Code is administered in Upper Dublin
Township, 34 Pa.Code § 403.63 (a) regarding the grant of a permit shall have
added a second sentence which reads: “When a grading permit has been applied
for in conjunction with proposed construction, the 15-day approval/denial time-
frame may be extended because the building permit cannot be issued until the
grading permit has been approved.”
      (6)   As the Uniform Construction Code is administered in Upper Dublin
Township, 34 Pa.Code § 403.63 (g) regarding permit expiration shall read: “A
permit is valid for one year from its issue date and may be renewed annually
for up to five years from its issue date.”
      (7)   As the Uniform Construction Code is administered in Upper Dublin
Township, 34 Pa.Code § 403.64 (b) regarding inspections shall have added a

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 82-1.   Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Cable Communications
Regulatory Code."
§ 82-2.   Purpose.
   A.   The Township of Upper Dublin finds that the development of cable
television and communications systems has the potential of having great benefit
and impact upon the people of Upper Dublin. Because of the complex and rapidly
changing technology associated with cable television, the township further
finds that the public convenience, safety and general welfare can best be
served by establishing regulatory powers which should be vested in the township
or such persons as the township shall designate. It is the intent of this
chapter to provide for and specify the means to attain the best possible public
interest and public purpose in these matters, and any franchise issued pursuant
to this chapter shall be deemed to include this finding as an integral part
thereof.
   B.   Further, it is recognized that cable communications systems have the
capacity to provide not only entertainment and information services to the
township's residents, but can provide a variety of broadband, interactive
communications services to institutions and individuals. Many of these services
involve township agencies and other public institutions, by providing
governmental, educational or health care communications.
   C.   For these purposes, the following goals underlie the regulations
contained herein:
      (1)   Communications services should be provided to the maximum number of
township residents.
      (2)   The system should be capable of accommodating both the present and
reasonably foreseeable future communications needs of the township.
      (3)   The system shall be constructed and maintained during the franchise
term so that new components may be integrated with existing facilities to the
maximum extent possible.
      (4)   The communications system authorized by this chapter shall be
responsive to the needs and interests of the local community.

   B.   The franchise shall be granted under the terms and conditions contained
herein, consistent with the First Class Township Code 1 and/or other applicable

The term of any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be specified
in the franchise.
§ 82-10.   Franchise nonexclusive.
Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be nonexclusive. The
township specifically reserves the right to:
   A.   Grant at any time such additional franchises for a cable communications
system as it deems appropriate.
   B.   Build, operate and own such cable communications system or systems as
it deems appropriate.
§ 82-11.   Timeliness of actions.
Whenever this chapter shall set forth any time for an act to be performed by or
on behalf of a grantee, such time shall be deemed of the essence, and any
failure of a grantee to perform within the time allotted shall always be
sufficient ground for the township to invoke an appropriate penalty, including
possible revocation of the franchise pursuant to §
82-14 of this chapter.
§ 82-12.   Transfer of ownership or control.
   A.   Transfer of franchise. Any franchise granted hereunder shall not be
transferred without the prior consent of the township, and then only under such
reasonable conditions as the township may establish.
   B.   The grantee shall promptly notify the township of any actual or
proposed transfer.
   C.   For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to a transfer,
the township may inquire into the legal, financial, character, technical,
customer service and operations qualifications of the prospective controlling
party, and the grantee shall assist the township in any such inquiry. Failure
to provide all information reasonably requested by the township as part of said
inquiry shall be grounds for denial of the proposed transfer. If the township
finds the results of its inquiry are satisfactory, its consent to such transfer
shall not be unreasonably withheld.
   D.   Assumption of control. Any financial institution having a pledge of the
franchise or its assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/
or operation of the franchise shall have the right to notify the township that
it or its designees satisfactory to the township will take control and operate
the cable television system. Further, said financial institution shall also
submit a plan for such operation that will insure continued service and
compliance with all franchise obligations during the term the financial
institution exercises control over the system. The financial institution shall
not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding one (1) year,
unless extended by the township at its discretion, and during said period of
time it shall have the right to petition for transfers of the franchise to
another grantee. If the township finds that such transfer, after considering
the legal, financial, character, technical, customer service and operations
qualifications of the applicant, are satisfactory, the township will transfer
and assign the rights and obligations of such franchise as in the public
interest. The consent of the township to such transfer shall not be
unreasonably withheld.
   E.   The consent or approval of the township to any transfer of a grantee
shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the township in and
to the streets, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subject to
the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise.
   F.   In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the township will not
approve any transfer or assignment of the franchise prior to completion of
construction of the proposed system. This provision shall not apply to routine
line extensions.
   G.   Any approval by the township of transfer of ownership or control shall
be contingent upon the prospective controlling party becoming a signatory to
the franchise.
§ 82-13.   Franchise renewal.
   A.   Renewal discretionary. Upon or prior to completion of the term of any
franchise granted under this chapter, the township shall proceed with the
renewal process in accordance with the provisions of the Cable Act.
   B.   In the event that the Board deems it necessary, the township may hire
an independent consulting agency or consultant to advise the township with
regard to all the matters set forth hereinabove.
§ 82-14.   Franchise fees.
   A.   Fee imposed.
      (1)   Because the township finds that:
         (a)   The streets of the county, state and township to be used by a
grantee in the operation of its system within the boundaries of the franchise
area are valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the county,
state and township at great expense to its taxpayers;
         (b)   The grant of a right to use the public streets is a valuable
property right without which the grantee would be required to invest
substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions;
         (c)   The administration of this chapter and the franchise imposes
upon the township additional regulatory responsibility and expense;
      (2)   A grantee of any franchise hereunder shall pay to the township a
franchise fee in an amount as designated in the franchise, but in no event less
than five percent (5%) of gross annual revenues.
   B.   Franchise fee in addition to other tax or payment. This payment shall
be in addition to any tax, fee or assessment of general applicability,
including any tax, fee or assessment imposed on both utilities and cable
operators or their services. Payment of the franchise fee made by the grantee
to the township shall not be considered in the nature of a tax, but shall be in
addition to any and all taxes of general applicability which are now or may be
required hereafter to be paid by any federal, state or local law.
   C.   Acceptance by the township. No acceptance of any payment by the
township shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of
any claim the township may have for further or additional sums payable as a
franchise fee under this chapter or for the performance of any other obligation
of the grantee.
   D.   Failure to make required payment. In the event that any franchise
payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates specified
herein, the grantee shall pay as additional compensation an interest charge,
computed from such due date, at the annual rate equal to the commercial prime
interest rate of the township primary depository bank during the period that
such unpaid amount is owed.
   E.   Payments to be made quarterly. The franchise fee and any other cost or
damage assessed against the grantee shall be payable quarterly to the township
and shall commence as of the effective date of the franchise. The township
shall be furnished at the time of said payment with a statement certified by
the grantee's Accounting Manager reflecting the total amounts of quarterly
gross revenues and the above charges and computations for the period covered by
the payment. An annual statement of gross revenues shall be furnished to the
township by a certified public accountant. Said quarterly payments shall be
made to the township no later than forty-five (45) days following the end of
each calendar quarter. Quarterly computation dates are the last day in the
months of March, June, September and December.
   F.   Township's right of inspection. The township shall have the right to
inspect the grantee's income records and the right to audit and to recompute
any amounts determined to be payable under this chapter for a period of four
(4) years from the date of payment. Audits shall be at the expense of the
township unless the audit discloses an underpayment in any one (1) year of five
percent (5%) or more, in which case the costs of the audit shall be borne by
the grantee. Any additional amount due the township as a result of the audit
shall be paid within thirty (30) days following written notice to the grantee
by the township, which notice shall include a copy of the audit report, unless
written notice of disagreement is filed by the grantee with the township within
such time. In case of such dispute, the issue shall be resolved through binding
arbitration in accordance with the procedures of the American Arbitration
Association.
§ 82-15.   Revocation.
   A.   Grounds for revocation. The township reserves the right to revoke any
franchise granted hereunder and rescind all rights and privileges associated
with the franchise in the following circumstances, each of which shall
represent a default and breach under this chapter and the franchise grant:
      (1)   If the grantee shall default in the performance of any of the
material obligations under this chapter or under such documents, contracts and
other terms and provisions entered into by and between the township and the
grantee.
      (2)   If the grantee shall fail to provide or maintain in full force and
effect the liability and indemnification coverage or the performance bond as
required herein.
      (3)   If the grantee shall violate any lawful orders or rulings of any
regulatory body having jurisdiction over the grantee relative to this chapter
or the franchise.
      (4)   If the grantee practices any fraud upon the township.
      (5)   The grantee's construction schedule is delayed later than the
schedule contained in the franchise or beyond any extended date set by the
township.
      (6)   The grantee becomes insolvent, unable or unwilling to pay its debts
or is adjudged bankrupt.
      (7)   Failure to restore service after ninety-six (96) consecutive hours
of total system outage in forty percent (40%) or more of the system, except
when approval of such interruption is obtained from the township or is excused
pursuant to Subsection B.
      (8)   If the grantee transfers the franchise without the consent of the
township.
   B.   Effect of circumstances beyond control of the grantee. The grantee
shall not be declared in default or be subject to any sanction under any
provision of this chapter in any case in which performance of any such
provision is prevented by acts of God or other reasons beyond the grantee's
control. A default shall not be deemed to be beyond the grantee's control if
committed by a corporation or other business entity in which the grantee holds
a controlling interest, whether held directly or indirectly.
   C.   Pending litigation or any appeal to any regulatory body or court having
jurisdiction over the grantee shall not excuse the grantee from the performance
of its franchise fee obligations under this chapter or the franchise. Failure
of the grantee to perform such obligations because of pending litigation or
petition may result in forfeiture or revocation pursuant to the provisions of
this section. The township shall comply with any related court orders, unless
compliance is stayed by court order or agreement.
   D.   Procedure prior to revocation.
      (1)   The township shall make written demand that the grantee comply with
any such requirement, limitation, term, condition, rule or regulation or
correct any action deemed cause for revocation. If the failure, refusal or
neglect of the grantee continues for a period of forty-five (45) days following
such written demand, the township may place its request for termination of the
franchise upon a regular Board meeting agenda. The township shall cause to be
served upon such grantee, at least seven (7) days prior to the date of such
Board meeting, a written notice of this intent to request such termination and
the time and place of the meeting, notice of which shall be published by the
Township Secretary at least once, seven (7) days before such meeting in a
newspaper of general circulation within the township.
      (2)   The Board shall hear any persons interested therein and shall
determine, in its discretion, whether or not any failure, refusal or neglect by
the grantee was with just cause.
      (3)   If such failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just
cause, as determined by the Board, the Board shall direct the grantee to comply
within such time and manner and upon such terms and conditions as are
reasonable.
      (4)   If the Board shall determine such failure, refusal or neglect by
the grantee was without just cause, then the Board may, by resolution, declare
that the franchise of the grantee shall be terminated and the performance bond
forfeited.
   E.   Disposition of facilities. In the event that a franchise expires, is
revoked or otherwise terminated, the township may, in its sole discretion, do
any of the following:
      (1)   Order the removal of the system facilities from the township within
a reasonable period of time as determined by the township.
      (2)   Require the grantee to maintain and operate its system for a period
of up to eighteen (18) months or such further time as may be mutually agreed
upon. During any time a grantee continues to operate the system, it shall do so
pursuant to the terms of this chapter, and its franchise and shall be entitled
to received revenues from the system as provided by the franchise agreement.
   F.   Restoration of property. In removing its plant, structures and
equipment, a grantee shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation that
shall be made by it and shall leave all public ways and places in as good a
condition or better as that prevailing prior to a grantee's removal of its
equipment and appliances without affecting the electrical or telephone cable
wires or attachments. The township shall inspect and approve the condition of
the public ways and public places and cables, wires, attachments and poles
after removal. The liability, indemnity, insurance and performance bond as
provided herein shall continue in full force and effect during the period of
removal and until full compliance by a grantee with the terms and conditions of
this subsection, this chapter and the franchise.
   G.   Restoration by township; reimbursement of costs. In the event of a
failure by the grantee to complete any work within a public right-of-way or any
other work required by township law or ordinance within the time as may be
established and to the satisfaction of the township, the township may cause
such work to be done, and the grantee shall reimburse the township for the cost
thereof within thirty (30) days after receipt of an itemized list of such
costs, or the township may recover such costs through the performance bond,
letter of credit or security fund provided by the grantee. The township shall
be permitted to seek legal and equitable relief to enforce the provisions of
this section.
§ 82-16.   Receivership and foreclosure.
   A.   Termination by insolvency. Any franchise granted hereunder shall, at
the option of the township, cease and terminate one hundred twenty (120) days
after the appointment of a receiver or receivers or trustee or trustees to take
over and conduct the business of a grantee, whether in a receivership,
reorganization, bankruptcy or similar action or proceeding, unless such
receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of
said one hundred twenty (120) days, or unless:
      (1)   Such receivers or trustees shall have, within one hundred twenty
(120) days after their election or appointment, fully complied with all the
terms and provisions of this chapter and the franchise granted pursuant hereto
and the receivers or trustees within said one hundred twenty (120) days shall
have remedied all defaults under the franchise.
      (2)   Such receivers or trustees shall, within said one hundred twenty
(120) days, execute an agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction
in the premises, whereby such receivers or trustees assume and agree to be
bound by each and every term, provision and limitation of the franchise herein
granted.
   B.   Termination by judicial action. In the case of a foreclosure or other
judicial sale of the plant, property and equipment of a grantee or any part
thereof, including or excluding the franchise, the township may serve notice of
termination upon a grantee and the successful bidder at such sale, in which
event the franchise and all rights and privileges of a grantee granted
hereunder shall cease and terminate thirty (30) days after service of such
notice, unless:
      (1)   The township shall have approved the transfer of the franchise, in
the manner this chapter provides.
      (2)   Such successful bidder shall have covenanted and agreed with the
township to assume and be bound by all the terms and conditions of the
franchise.
§ 82-17.   Equal opportunity policy.
Equal opportunity employment shall be afforded by all the grantees to all
qualified persons, and no person shall be discriminated against in employment
because of race, color, religion, age, national origin, sex or physical
handicap. The grantee shall comply with all equal opportunity provisions
enacted by federal, state and local authorities, as well as all such provisions
contained in this chapter and the franchise.
§ 82-18.   Notices.
All notices from the grantee to the township pursuant to this chapter and the
franchise shall be to the Township Manager or his or her designee. The grantee
shall maintain with the township, throughout the term of the franchise, an
address for service of notices by mail. The grantee shall also maintain with
the township a local office and telephone number for the conduct of matters
related to the franchise during normal business hours. The grantee shall be
required to advise the township of such address(es) and telephone numbers and
any changes thereof.
ARTICLE IV
Regulation of Franchise
§ 82-19.   Regulatory authority.
   A.   The township shall exercise appropriate regulatory authority under the
provisions of this chapter and applicable law. This authority shall be vested

Manager or his designee in order to provide day-to-day administration and
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and any franchise granted
hereunder and to carry out the township's responsibilities with regard to cable
communications.
   B.   The township reserves the right to exercise the maximum plenary
authority, as may at any time be lawfully permissible, to regulate the cable
communications system, the franchise and the grantee. Should applicable
legislative, judicial or regulatory authorities at any time permit regulation
unilaterally by the franchising authority not presently permitted to the
township, the township may without the approval of the grantee engage in any
such additional regulation as may then be permissible, whether or not
contemplated by this chapter.

   A.   The grantee shall file with the township schedules which shall describe
all services offered, all rates and charges of any kind and all terms and
conditions relating thereto, on the effective date of the franchise and thirty
(30) days prior to any change. No rates or charges shall be effective except as
they appear on a schedule so filed. The grantee shall notify subscribers, in
writing, at least thirty (30) days prior to the implementation of any change in
services offered, rates, charges or terms and conditions related thereto. A
grantee's written notice shall include a comparison of old and new rates and
charges and shall be included in the customer's bill. A complete schedule of
the grantee's rates shall be mailed to subscribers annually.
   B.   The grantee shall establish rates that are nondiscriminatory within the
same general class of subscribers which must be applied fairly and uniformly to
all subscribers in the franchise area for all services. Nothing contained
herein shall prohibit the grantee from offering:
      (1)   Discounts to commercial and multiple-family dwelling subscribers
billed on a bulk basis.
      (2)   Promotional discounts.
      (3)   Reduced rates for subscribers who have multiple services. The
grantee's charges and rates for all services shall be itemized on subscriber's
monthly bills.
   C.   If the township is authorized by law, it may choose to regulate rates
to the extent permissible.
§ 82-22.   Performance evaluation.

the franchise at the request of the township.

applications of new technologies, judicial and FCC filings and line extensions.
   E.   During the review and evaluation by the township, a grantee shall fully
cooperate with the township and shall provide such current and historical
information and documents as the township may need to reasonably perform its
regulatory duties.
ARTICLE V
Bonds, Insurance and Indemnification
§ 82-23.   Performance bond; letter of credit.
   A.   Performance bond. Upon the effective date of a franchise which requires
a performance bond, a grantee shall obtain and maintain during the entire term
of the franchise and any extensions and renewals thereof, at its cost and
expense, and file with the township a corporate surety bond in the sum total of
seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000.) or in such other sum as specified in
the franchise agreement, to guarantee the faithful performance by a grantee of
all its obligations provided under this chapter and the franchise. Failure to
timely obtain, file and maintain said bond shall constitute a substantial
violation within the meaning of this section.
   B.   Conditions. The performance bond shall provide the following
conditions:
      (1)   There shall be recoverable by the township jointly and severally
from the principal and surety, any and all fines and liquidated damages due to
the township, as specified in the franchise, and any and all damages, losses,
costs and expenses suffered or incurred by the township resulting from the
failure of a grantee to faithfully comply with the provisions of this chapter
and the franchise; comply with all orders, permits and directives of any
township agency or body having jurisdiction over its acts or defaults; pay fees
due to the township; pay any claims, liens or taxes due the township which
arise by reason of the construction, operation, maintenance or repair of the
cable communication system. Such losses, costs and expenses shall include but
not be limited to attorney's fees and other associated expenses.
      (2)   The total amount of the bond shall be forfeited in favor of the
township in the event that the township revokes the franchise pursuant to §
82-15 for the two (2) following reasons:
         (a)   A grantee abandons the cable communication system at any time
during the term of the franchise or any extension thereto.
         (b)   A grantee assigns the franchise without the express written
consent of the township, provided that a grantee has been notified of such
noncompliance, in writing, by the township and has failed to cure the same
within thirty (30) days.
   C.   Reduction of bond. Upon written application by a grantee, the township
may, at its sole option, permit the amount of the bond to be reduced or waive
the requirements for a performance bond subject to the conditions set forth
below. Reductions granted or denied upon application by a grantee shall be
without prejudice to a grantee's subsequent applications or to the township's
right to require the full bond at any time thereafter. However, no application
shall be made by a grantee within one (1) year of any prior application.
   D.   Letter of credit. If requested by the township per the franchise
agreement in lieu of the performance bond required by this section, a grantee
shall obtain, maintain and file with the township an irrevocable letter of
credit from a financial institution licensed to do business in the state in an
amount specified in the franchise, naming the township as beneficiary. The form
and contents of such letter of credit shall be approved by the Township
Solicitor and shall be released only upon expiration of the franchise or upon
the replacement of the letter of credit by a successor the grantee. Failure to
obtain the letter of credit within the time specified herein shall constitute a
substantial violation within the meaning of this section.
   E.   Use of performance bond or letter of credit. Prior to drawing upon the
letter of credit or the performance bond for the purposes described in this
section, the township shall notify the grantee, in writing, specifying the item
for which payment is claimed and the date it was due. The grantee shall have 10
days from the receipt of such written notice to make a full and complete
payment. If the grantee does not make the payment within 10 days, the township
may withdraw the amount thereof, with interest and penalties, from the letter
of credit or the performance bond.
   F.   Notification. Within three days of a withdrawal from the letter of
credit or performance bond, the township shall deliver to the grantee, by
actual mail delivery, certified mail, registered mail or first class mail,
written notification of the amount, date and purpose of such withdrawal.
[Amended 2-8-2000 by Ord. No. 1021]
   G.   Replenishment of letter of credit or performance bond. No later than 30
days after delivery to the grantee of notification of a withdrawal pursuant to
Subsection F above, the grantee shall replenish the letter of credit or
performance bond in an amount equal to the amount so withdrawn. Failure to make
timely replenishment of such amount to the letter of credit or performance bond
shall constitute a substantial violation of this chapter. [Amemded 2-8-2000 by
Ord. No. 1021]
   H.   Nonrenewal, alteration or cancellation of letter of credit or
performance bond. The performance bond or letter of credit required herein
shall be in a form satisfactory to the township and shall require 30 days'
written notice of any nonrenewal, alteration or cancellation to both the
township and a grantee. The grantee shall, in the event of any such
cancellation notice, obtain, pay all premiums for and file with the township
written evidence of the issuance of replacement bond or policies within 30 days
following receipt by the township or a grantee of any notice of cancellation.
   I.   To offset the effects of inflation, the amounts of the bond or letter
of credit provided for herein are subject to reasonable increases at the end of
every three-year period of the franchise, applicable to the next three-year
period, upon the determination of the township.
§ 82-24.   Security fund.
   A.   Within 10 days after the acceptance of a franchise agreement that
requires a security fund, the grantee shall deposit with the grantor and
maintain on deposit through the term of this franchise the sum of $25,000, in
cash or in such other sum as specified in the franchise agreement, as security
for the payment of any fees, liquidated damages or penalties imposed under this
chapter. Said sum shall be placed by the township in an interest-bearing
account, and any interest accrued thereon shall be paid annually to a grantee.
   B.   Within 10 days after notice to a grantee that any amount has been
withdrawn from the security fund deposited pursuant to Subsection A of this
section, the grantee shall pay to or deposit with the township a sum of money
or securities sufficient to restore such security fund to the original amount
of $25,000 or such other sum as specified in the franchise agreement.
   C.   The security fund deposited pursuant to this section shall become the
property of the township in the event that this franchise is canceled by reason
of default of the grantee. A grantee, however, shall be entitled to the return
of such security fund or portion thereof as remains on deposit with the
township at the expiration of the term of the franchise, provided that there is
then no outstanding default on the part of the grantee.
   D.   The rights reserved to the township with respect to the security funds
are in addition to all other rights of the township, whether reserved by this
chapter or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right
with respect to such security funds shall affect any other right the township
may have.
§ 82-25.   Liability and insurance.
   A.   Within 60 days after the effective date of the franchise and thereafter
continuously throughout the duration of the franchise and any extensions or
renewals thereof, a grantee shall furnish to the township certificates of
insurance, approved by the township, for all types of insurance required under
this section. Failure to furnish said certificates of insurance in a timely
manner shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
   B.   Any insurance policy obtained by a grantee in compliance with this
section shall be filed and maintained with the Township Secretary during the
term of the franchise and may be changed from time to time to reflect changing
liability limits and/or to compensate for inflation. The grantee shall
immediately advise the township of any litigation that may develop that would
affect this insurance.
   C.   Neither the provisions of this section or any damages recovered by the
township hereunder shall be construed to or limit the liability of a grantee
under any franchise issued hereunder or for damages.
   D.   All insurance policies maintained pursuant to this chapter or the
franchise shall contain the following, or a comparable, endorsement:
      It is hereby understood and agreed that this insurance policy may not be
canceled by the insurance company nor the intention not to renew be stated by
the insurance company until 30 days after receipt by the Township Manager, by
registered mail, of a written notice of such intention to cancel or not to
renew.
   E.   All liability insurance policies maintained pursuant to this chapter or
the franchise shall name the township as an additional insured.
   F.   All insurance policies provided under the provisions of this chapter or
the franchise shall be written by companies authorized to do business in the
state and approved by the State Insurance Commission.
   G.   At any time during the term of the franchise, the township may request,
and the grantee shall comply with such request, to name the township, all
elected township officials and township employees with cable-related
responsibilities as additional named insureds for all general liability
insurance policies written under the provisions of this chapter or the
franchise.
   H.   General liability insurance. A grantee shall maintain and by its
acceptance of any franchise granted hereunder specifically agrees that it will
maintain throughout the term of the franchise general liability insurance
insuring the grantee a minimum of $2,000,000 for all damage, injury, accident
or death.
   I.   Such general liability insurance must include coverage for all of the
following: comprehensive form, premises-operations, explosion and collapse
hazard, underground hazard, products/completed operations hazard, contractual
insurance, broad form property damage and personal injury.
   J.   Automobile liability insurance. A grantee shall maintain and, by its
acceptance of any franchise granted hereunder, specifically agrees that it will

for owned, nonowned or rented vehicles in the minimum amount of:
      (1)   Two million dollars ($2,000,000.) for bodily injury and consequent
death per occurrence.
      (2)   One million dollars ($1,000,000.) for bodily injury and consequent
death to any one (1) person.

maintenance of the system.
   C.   The grantee's system and associated equipment erected by a grantee
within the township shall be so located as to cause minimum interference with
the proper use of streets, alleys and other public ways and places and to cause
minimum interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property
owners who adjoin any of the said streets, alleys or other public ways and
places. No pole or other fixtures placed in any public ways by the grantee
shall be placed in such a manner as to interfere with normal travel on such
public way.
   D.   The township does not guarantee the accuracy of any maps showing the
horizontal or vertical location of existing substructures. In public rights-of-

reasonably and economically feasible, provided that the average number of homes
per contiguous mile of aerial cable plant is fifteen (15) or greater or the
average number of homes per contiguous mile of underground cable plant is
twenty (20) or greater. Where installation requires a drop in excess of two
hundred (200) feet from the distribution cable to connection of services to
subscribers, the subscriber will be charged for time and material necessary to
extend the drop beyond two hundred (200) feet. Upon receipt of a request for

are placed underground, the grantee shall likewise place its services
underground. Where not otherwise required to be placed underground by this
chapter or the franchise, the grantee's system shall be located underground at
the request of a property owner, provided that the excess cost over the aerial
location shall be borne by the property owner making the request. All cable

own expense and with all due deliberate speed. In the event that any utility is
reimbursed for the same work, the grantee will be reimbursed on the same terms
and conditions.
   F.   Cooperation with building movers. The grantee shall, on the request of
any person holding a building moving permit issued by the township, temporarily
raise or lower its wire to permit the moving of buildings. The expense of such

trimming any trees in the right-of-way.
   H.   Easements. All necessary easements over and under private property

authority to compel the grantee to promptly test, analyze and report on the
performance of its system. The township may require additional tests, full or
partial repeat tests, different test procedures or tests involving a specific

maintain and repair all graded surfaces, anti-erosion devices, retaining walls,
drainage structures, pipes, culverts and other protective devices, plantings
and ground cover, installed or completed.
      (6)   All graded surfaces shall be permanently seeded, sodded, planted,
and/or otherwise protected from erosion immediately upon completion of the
earthmoving activities upon that surface, weather permitting, and shall be
tended and/or maintained until growth is well established. The disturbed area
and duration of exposure shall be kept to a minimum using temporary, erosion
and sediment control measures immediately, as outlined in the “Erosion and
Sediment Control Handbook, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.”
      (7)   Precautions shall be taken to prevent the unnecessary removal of
trees. All trees in areas where slopes exceed three to one shall be protected
with suitable tree wells, unless the necessity for removal is established. Any
grading around trees or any removal of trees must comply with the Township’s
Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.
      (8)   The permittee shall provide adequate provisions for dust control
measures. Any such measures must be deemed acceptable by the Township Engineer.
      (9)   All plans and specifications submitted for a grading permit shall
include provisions for both interim (temporary) and ultimate (permanent)
erosion and sediment control. The design, installation and maintenance of
erosion and sediment control measures shall be accomplished in accordance with
standards and specifications established by the Montgomery County Soil
Conservation District as adopted from standards and specifications of the
United States Soil Conservation Service, and as outlined in the “Erosion and
Sediment Control Handbook, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.”
      (10)   In connection with site grading for roads, driveways, building
areas or other site improvements, the lateral extent of cut or fill areas shall
not be more than 30 feet beyond the top of slope in fills or the toe of slope
in cuts, or extend closer than 50 feet to the bank of any watercourse, lake,
pond, or wetland.
      (11)   Wherever fill material is to be used, the person, firm, or
corporation using such fill shall be responsible for testing to determine its
dry density as per ASTM D1556. The density of each layer shall be not less than
95% of maximum density as determined by ASTM D1557.
         (a)   Inspection procedure shall follow the general procedure as
stated in §
99-10 below.
         (b)   Compaction test reports shall be kept on file at the site and

      (12)   If load-bearing fill is proposed, a soils investigation report
shall be submitted which shall consist of test borings, laboratory testing and
engineering analysis to correlate surface and subsurface conditions with the
proposed grading plan. The report shall include data regarding the nature,
distribution and supporting ability of existing soils and rocks on the site,
conclusions, and recommendations to ensure stable soil conditions and
groundwater control, as applicable. The Township may require such supplemental
reports and data as is deemed necessary by the Township Engineer.
   F.   All permits shall require the permittee to:
      (1)   Notify the Township Engineer within 48 hours of commencing any
earthmoving or stripping activity;
      (2)   Notify the Township Engineer of the completion of any control
measures within three days after their installation;
      (3)   Obtain permission from the Township in accordance with this chapter
prior to modifying the erosion and sedimentation control plan;
      (4)   Install all control measures as identified in the approved erosion
and sedimentation control plan prior to starting any earthmoving activities;
      (5)   Maintain all road drainage systems, stormwater drainage systems,
control measures and other facilities identified in the erosion and
sedimentation control plan;
      (6)   Repair any siltation or erosion damage to adjoining properties,
surfaces, and drainage ways resulting from earthmoving or stripping;
      (7)   Inspect the erosion and sedimentation control measures after each
rain of one-half inch or more and at least once each week and make needed
repairs;
      (8)   Allow the Township Engineer or other Township official to enter the
site for the purpose of inspecting compliance with the erosion and
sedimentation control plan or for performing any work necessary to bring the
site into compliance with the erosion and sedimentation control plan;
      (9)   Keep a copy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan on the
site;
      (10)   Provide, until the problem is corrected, additional stabilizing
measures to slopes that, in the judgment of the Township Engineer, are found to
be eroding excessively within one year of construction. Once such slopes are
stabilized by the additional measures, the permittee is responsible for
providing further additional stabilizing measures if the slopes continue to
erode excessively within one year of the installation of the additional
measures.
§ 99-6.   Grading plans.
Activities that require a grading permit must file a grading plan. The grading
plan must include the following information:
   A.   A site plan (plot plan) drawn at a suitable scale of not less than one

   B.   A stormwater management plan prepared in accordance with Upper Dublin
Township Stormwater Management Ordinance.
   C.   A statement, signed and sealed by a registered professional land
surveyor or engineer, licensed in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania indicating
that, to the best of his/her knowledge and belief, the proposed grading
activities shall not significantly increase stormwater runoff to, and/or
otherwise adversely impact, downstream properties except as may be part of an
approved stormwater runoff collection and management plan.
§ 99-7.   Erosion and sedimentation control plan.
An erosion and sedimentation control plan shall be submitted with all grading
permit applications, the erosion and sedimentation control plan shall show how
the erosion and sediment resulting from the earthmoving and stripping
activities will be controlled. Any proposed erosion and sedimentation control
measures to be used during construction shall strictly conform to the standards
and specifications of the Montgomery County Conservation District, all Township
Codes, and the Township’s Engineering and Construction Standards, Improvement
Procedures (“ECSIP”), as amended from time to time. (The ECSIP is found at
Appendix “B” which is attached to Ordinance 22-1378 and incorporated herein by
reference as if set out in full).
   A.   An erosion and sedimentation control plan shall include the following:
      (1)   The amount of site alteration proposed and all proposed erosion and
sedimentation control measures.
      (2)   A construction schedule indicating the anticipated starting and
completion dates of the development sequence; the expected date of completion
of construction of each protective measure provided for in the erosion and
sediment control plan and the stormwater management plan; the sequence of
earthmoving activities; and the time of exposure of each area prior to
completion of such measures.
      (3)   Provisions for maintenance of control facilities, including
operation and maintenance agreements, easements, and estimates of the cost of
maintenance.
      (4)   Seeding mixtures and rates, types of sod, method of seedbed
preparation, expected seeding dates, type and rate of lime and fertilizer
application, and kind and quantity of mulching for both temporary and permanent
vegetative control measures. See Appendix “C” (attached to Ordinance 22-1378
and incorporated herein by reference as if set out in full).
      (5)   Identification of the person(s) or entity(ies) which will have
legal responsibility for maintenance of the erosion and sedimentation control
structures and measures after development is completed.
   B.   Any erosion and sedimentation control plan shall incorporate the
following erosion and sediment control practices and principles:
      (1)   Development shall reflect the topography and soils of the site so
as to create the least potential for erosion. The smallest practical area of
land shall be exposed for the shortest practical time during development.
      (2)   Stripping of vegetation, regrading, or other earthmoving activities
shall be completed in a way that will minimize erosion and resulting
sedimentation. Wherever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained,
protected, and supplemented.
      (3)   Cut and fill operations shall be kept to a minimum. In the design
of cut and fill slopes, consideration must be given to the length and steepness
of the slope, the soil type, upslope drainage area, groundwater conditions and
other applicable factors. Areas of steep slopes where high cuts and fills may
be required shall be avoided wherever possible. Where unavoidable, cuts and
fills on steep slopes must be immediately seeded, and natural contours must be
followed as closely as possible.
      (4)   The disturbed earthen area and the duration of exposure shall be
kept to a practical minimum. All disturbed soils and topsoil stockpile areas
shall be stabilized as quickly as possible and, if necessary, seeded and
mulched immediately. Any stockpile areas located on sloping ground or near
waters of the Commonwealth shall be enclosed with silt fencing.
      (5)   Procedures for protecting soils or geologic structures with water
supply potential from contamination by surface water or other disruption by
earthmoving activity must be established to the satisfaction of the Township.
      (6)   Sediment basins, debris basins, desilting basins, silt traps or
filters shall be installed and maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters
from land undergoing development. All runoff from the site shall be collected
and diverted to these facilities for the removal of sediment. Sedimentation in
the runoff water shall be trapped and filtered by these facilities until the
disturbed area is stabilized to the satisfaction of the Township Engineer.
      (7)   All plans, wherein a sump pump or basement drain is proposed to be
installed, shall provide for discharge of the sump pump/drain to a natural
watercourse, drainage swale, stormwater easement, storm sewer system, or open
space area. No sump pump or basement drain discharge shall be permitted to a
grassed lawn area of residential or non-residential buildings, unless such area
is part of a stormwater easement or drainage swale.
      (8)   Provisions shall be made to minimize any runoff caused by changed
soil and surface conditions during and after development. All drainage
facilities shall be designed to carry surface water in such a manner as to
prevent erosion or overflow. Drainage facilities shall be designed and
constructed to withstand the expected velocity of flow from a ten-year
frequency storm without erosion. Stabilization adequate to prevent erosion must
also be provided at the outlets of all pipes and paved channels.
      (9)   Natural vegetation shall be retained, protected, and supplemented
wherever possible. Permanent vegetation shall be established on denuded areas
not otherwise permanently stabilized. Permanent vegetation and related
structures shall be installed as soon as practical. Permanent vegetation shall
not be considered established until a ground cover is achieved that is mature
enough to control the soil erosion satisfactorily and to survive severe weather
conditions to the Township Engineer’s satisfaction.
      (10)   Permanent or temporary soil stabilization must be applied to
denuded areas within one day after final grade is reached on any portion of the
site. Soil stabilization must also be applied immediately to denuded areas
which may not be at final grade but will remain dormant (undisturbed) for
longer than one day.
      (11)   Properties adjacent to the site of a land-disturbing activity
shall be protected from sediment disposition by preserving a well-vegetated
buffer strip around the lower perimeter of the land-disturbing activity; by
installing perimeter controls such as sediment barriers; filters, dikes,
interceptor drains or sediment basins; or by a combination of such measures.
         (a)   Vegetated buffer strips may not be used alone except where only
runoff in sheet flow is expected.
         (b)   Buffer strips shall be at least 20 feet in width and shall
contain preexisting, permanent vegetation, excluding trees and shrubs that
cover 95% of the ground within the buffer strip.
         (c)   If at any time, the Township Engineer finds that a vegetated
buffer strip alone is ineffective in preventing sediment movement onto adjacent
property, additional perimeter controls must be provided by the permittee or
then-owner of the property within a time period specified by the Township
Engineer.
      (12)   In the design of erosion control facilities and practices,
aesthetics and the requirements of continuing maintenance shall be considered.
   C.   The selection of erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be
based on assessment of the probable frequency of climatic and other events
likely to contribute to erosion, on an evaluation of the risks, costs and
benefits involved and in accordance with best management practices.
§ 99-8.   General grading requirements.
All earthmoving and/or stripping activities and/or building construction
wherein stripping, excavation, placement of fill, and/or grading activities are
performed shall conform to the following general requirements:
   A.   All erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be installed per
the approved plan prior to any earthmoving and/or stripping activities.
      (1)   Earthen structures such as dams. Dikes and diversions must be
seeded and mulched immediately after installation.
      (2)   All stormwater management basins shall be constructed, functional,
and stabilized prior to any additional site activity. An as-built plan of the
facility prepared by a registered professional land surveyor or engineer,
licensed in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, shall be submitted to the
Township for review to verify adequate stage/storage capacity prior to
commencement of other site activity.
      (3)   All temporary and permanent erosion and sedimentation control
measures must be maintained and repaired as needed to assure continued
performance of their intended functions.
      (4)   Each and every person, corporation, or other entity performing
grading and/or building activities shall be responsible for installing and
maintaining erosion and sedimentation control measures until the site is
stabilized to the satisfaction of the Township Engineer.
      (5)   The continuation of adequate topsoil on the land within the
Township is considered necessary for the general welfare of the Township in the
future development thereof. Thus the permanent removal of topsoil from the land
within the Township shall be prohibited. This prohibition shall not be
construed to prohibit an owner of land in removing topsoil for the purpose of
construction of a building and the regarding of the land surrounding the
building following construction; provided, however, that upon completion of
construction there remains an average depth of six inches of topsoil per lot.
   B.   No excavation or fill shall be made with a slope steeper than three
horizontal to one vertical, except under both of the following conditions:
      (1)   The material is sufficiently stable to sustain a steeper slope. A
sealed, written statement to that effect from an engineer licensed in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall be submitted to the Township Engineer. The
statement shall affirm that the site has been inspected and the deviation from
the slope restriction shall not result in injury to persons or damage to
property. A detail of the treatment of the slope (proposed grade, seeding,
erosion protection, etc.) shall be submitted with the application. All such
slopes shall be peg-sodded or seeded and covered with jute matting or similar
material.
      (2)   A concrete, masonry, or other approved retaining wall constructed
in accordance with acceptable engineering practice is provided to support the
slope of the excavation or fill.
   C.   The Township Engineer may require an excavation to be made with a cut
face flatter in slope that three horizontal to one vertical if he/she finds the
material in which the excavation is to be made is unusually subject to erosion,
or if other conditions exist which make such flatter cut slope necessary for
stability and safety.
   D.   Excavations shall not extend below the angle of repose or natural slope
of the soil under the nearest point of any footing or foundation of any
building or structure unless such footing or foundation is first properly
underpinned or protected against settlement.
   E.   Whenever a fill is to be made of materials other than clean soil or
earth, the grading permit shall be subject to the following additional
limitations and requirements:
      (1)   The fill shall be completed within a reasonable length of time; the
said time limit is to be determined by the Township Engineer and to be
specified on the grading permit.
      (2)   Clean soil or earth shall be placed over the top and exposed
surfaces of the fill to a depth sufficient to effectively conceal all
materials, other than clean soil or earth, within the fill. Where the Township
Engineer may require, clean soil or earth shall be placed over the top and
exposed surfaces of the fill to a depth sufficient to conceal all materials at
the end of each day’s operations.
   F.   Drainage: Adequate provisions shall be made to prevent stormwater and
surface waters from damaging the cut face of an excavation or the sloping
surface of a fill. All excavations and fills shall be made in accordance with
Chapter 206, Stormwater Management. Slopes of more than ten feet in vertical
height shall be separated by level berms of at least four feet in width. Berm
ditches shall be constructed where necessary to prevent erosion. All drainage
provisions shall be of such design as to carry stormwater and surface waters to
the nearest practical stormwater facility or natural watercourse approved by
the Township Engineer as a safe place to deposit and receive such waters. The
Township Engineer may require such drainage structures or pipes to be
constructed or installed which, in his/her opinion, are necessary to prevent
erosion damage and to satisfactorily carry off surface waters.
   G.   All lots, tracts, or parcels shall be graded to provide positive
drainage away from buildings and dispose of it without ponding, except where
ponding (detention basins, swales, etc.) is part of the stormwater management
plan for the site.
   H.   In no case shall grading be completed in such a manner as to divert
water onto the property of another landowner unless part of a stormwater
management plan.
      (1)   The top or bottom edge of slopes shall be at least three feet from
property of right-of-way lines or streets in order to permit the normal
rounding of the edge without encroaching on the abutting property. At property
lines where walls or slopes are steeper than one to one and six feet or more in
height, they shall be protected by a substantial fence three feet or more in
height.
      (2)   The owner of a property shall be responsible to protect and clean
up lower properties of silt and debris washing from his/her property as a
result of the regarding of his/her property.
      (3)   In order to prevent the denuding of the landscape, wherever
practicable, large trees and other natural features constituting important
physical, aesthetic and economic assets to existing or impending suburban
development shall be preserved.
      (4)   In all zoning districts, for those portions of sites having slopes
greater than 10%, based upon contour lines measured at vertical intervals of
two feet, the following standards shall apply for all proposed uses:
         (a)   Ten percent to 15%: No more than 40% of the total area of such
portions shall be regraded and/or stripped of vegetation.
         (b)   Fifteen percent to 25%: No more than 30% of the total area of
such portions shall be regarded and/or stripped of vegetation.
         (c)   Twenty-five percent or more: No more than 15% of the total area
of such portions shall be regraded and/or stripped of vegetation.
   J.   No person shall block, impede the flow of, alter, construct any
structure, deposit any material or thing, or perform any work that will affect
the normal or flood flow in any watercourse without having obtained prior
approval from the Township and/or Department of Environmental Protection,
whichever is applicable.
   K.   Each person that makes any surface changes to the site shall be
required to:
      (1)   Collect on-site surface runoff and control it to a point of
discharge into the drainage area watercourse, stormwater easement, or storm
sewer system.
      (2)   Control existing off-site runoff draining through the property by
designing it to discharge to the watercourse of the drainage area, stormwater
easement, or storm sewer system.
      (3)   Ensure that all on-site and off-site runoff is collected and
diverted to sediment basins, debris basins, desilting basins, silt traps or
filters for the removal of sediment until all disturbed areas are stabilized to
the satisfaction of the Township.
   L.   Adequate provision shall be made to prevent surface water from damaging
the cut face of excavation and the sloping surfaces of fills.
   M.   Concentration of surface water runoff shall be permitted only in
watercourses or detention basins. All drainage facilities shall be constructed
to carry surface water in such a manner as to prevent erosion or overflow. All
storm sewer inlets that are made operable during construction shall be
protected so that sediment-laden water will not enter the conveyance system
without first being filtered or otherwise treated to remove sediment.
   N.   Construction vehicles are to be kept out of watercourses, wetlands, and
other bodies of water. Where in-channel work is necessary, permits from
regulatory agencies must be secured and provided to the Township and
precautions must be taken to stabilize the work area during construction to
minimize erosion. The channel, including bed and banks, must be restabilized
immediately after in-channel work is completed.
   O.   Where a watercourse must be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction, a temporary stream crossing must be provided.
   P.   Sediment barriers shall be properly installed with silt fencing
trenched and hay bales staked.
   Q.   During all earthmoving and/or stripping operations, necessary measures
for dust control must be exercised. Wherever construction vehicle access routes
intersect paved public streets, provisions must be made to minimize the
transport of sediment onto the paved surfaces by runoff or vehicle tracking,
including but not limited to, the installation of tire cleaning areas at each
point of access to the site. These tire cleaning areas shall be constructed of
AASHTO #1 stone, and each shall be at least 50 feet in length. Where sediment
is transported onto a public street, the permittee shall clean the street
immediately. Sediment shall be removed from roads by shoveling or sweeping and
then transported to a sediment control area.
   R.   No grading equipment shall be permitted to be loaded, unloaded, or
stored on a public street. No grading equipment shall be permitted to travel on
or across a public street unless licensed for operation on public
thoroughfares.
   S.   The construction of underground utility lines involving installation,
maintenance or repair that disturbs more than 1,000 square feet shall be
subject to the following criteria:
      (1)   No more than 200 feet of trench is to be opened at one time.
      (2)   Where consistent with safety and space considerations, excavated
material is to be placed on the uphill side of trenches.
      (3)   Trench dewatering devices shall discharge in a manner that will not
adversely affect flowing streams, drainage systems or off-site property.
   Individual service connections, telephone and electric lines and underground
public utility lines under existing hard-surfaced roads, streets or sidewalks
are exempt from the above requirements, provided that such land-disturbing
activity is confined to the area which is hard-surfaced.
   T.   All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be disposed
of within 30 days after final site stabilization is achieved, unless otherwise
authorized by the Township Engineer. Trapped sediment and other disturbed soil
areas resulting from the disposition of temporary measures shall be permanently
stabilized to prevent further erosion and sedimentation.
   U.   Before granting occupancy permits for buildings, building lots shall be
finish graded so that drainage will not be concentrated onto adjacent lots.
Building lots must also be seeded or mulched. If it is not possible to
establish lawns due to the season of the year, or if exposed areas will result
in excess runoff onto adjoining properties because of the lack of ground cover,
the Township Engineer may require extra mulching, the installation of silt
barriers, and/or the construction of temporary sedimentation basins to control
excess runoff, in addition to a vegetation escrow to secure establishment of
ground cover.
   V.   First floor certifications. Construction of any structure requiring a
grading plan under this chapter shall not continue past the foundation stage
until the owner/builder has submitted certification that the first floor and
garage floor elevations of the proposed structure conforms to the plans
submitted with the grading permit application. The certification shall be
submitted to the Township Code Official on a form approved by the Township and
shall be signed and sealed by the responsible Registered Professional Land
Surveyor or Engineer, licensed in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. See
Appendix “D” (which is attached to Ordinance 22-1378 and incorporated herein by
reference as if set out in full).
§ 99-9.   Inspections.
   A.   The Township Engineer or Code Official shall make inspections as
hereinafter required and shall either approve that portion of the work
completed or shall notify the permittee in what manner or manners, if any, the
work fails to comply with the grading plan or the erosion and sedimentation
control plan, as approved. All plans, reports, and schedules required by and
approved under this chapter shall be maintained at the site during progress of
the work.
      (1)   To obtain inspections, the permittee shall notify the Township
Engineer or Code Official at least two working days before completion of:
         (a)   Stripping and clearing.
         (b)   Rough grading.
         (c)   Final grading.
         (d)   Final landscaping.
      (2)   If stripping, clearing, grading and/or landscaping are to be done
in phases or areas, the permittee shall give notice and request inspection at
the completion of each of the above work stages in each phase or area.
      (3)   Notification of the results of the inspection shall be given, in
writing, at the site.
   B.   The permittee shall make regular inspections of all erosion and
sedimentation control measures in accordance with the inspection schedule
outlined on the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan. The purpose of
such inspection will be to determine the condition and need for replacement or
repair of in-place control measures; the overall effectiveness of the plan; and
the need for additional control measures.
      (1)   All inspections shall be documented in written form and submitted
to the Township Engineer at the time interval specified in the erosion and
sedimentation control plan.
   C.   A final inspection shall be conducted by the Township Engineer to
certify compliance with this chapter. Satisfactory compliance with this chapter
shall be necessary before issuance of a use and occupancy permit.
   D.   The permittee shall bear all costs of inspections required or permitted
hereunder and shall deposit with the Township such sum as the Board of
Commissioners shall determine, to guarantee payment of the costs of such
inspections. The costs of inspections shall be in accordance with the
established schedule of fees and collection procedure for matters pertaining to
this chapter.
§ 99-10.   Responsibility.
The permittee shall not be relieved of responsibility for damage to persons or
property otherwise imposed by law, and the Township or its officials will not
be made liable for this damage, by:
   A.   The issuance of a grading permit in accordance with this chapter or
other applicable laws;
   B.   Compliance with the provisions of a permit or with conditions attached
to it;
   C.   Failure of Township officials to observe or recognize hazardous or
unsightly conditions; or
   D.   Failure of Township officials to deny or to recommend denial of a
permit.
§ 99-11.   Performance security.
Before the issuance of a grading permit for a project that exceeds 2,000 square
feet in area of disturbance, the applicant shall deposit with the Township
financial security in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of all erosion and
sedimentation control measures and other conditions specified in the permit,
within the time specified by this chapter, or within any extension thereof
granted by the Township Engineer. The amount of such financial security shall
be equal to 110% of the cost of the work for which the security has been
provided. The form of financial security, the method of cost calculation and
the release of the posted security shall be in conformity with those provisions
set forth in the Township Subdivision and Land Development
Chapter 212 with respect to public improvement guaranties.
§ 99-12.   Permit expiration and renewal.
Every grading permit issued hereunder shall expire at the end of six months
from the date of issuance. The permittee shall fully perform and complete all
of the work required to be done within the time limit specified in the permit.
If the permittee shall be unable to complete the work within the specified
time, he/she shall, within 30 days prior to expiration of the permit, present
in writing to the Township, a request for an extension of time, setting forth
therein the reasons for the requested extension. If, in the discretion of the
Township Engineer, such an extension is warranted, the Township Engineer may
grant additional time for the completion of the work. Where the Township
Engineer determines that the extension of time will require a substantial
modification of the erosion and sedimentation control plan and/or grading plan,
any extension of a permit shall be subject to approval of such revised plans in
accordance with the applicable procedure of this chapter.
§ 99-13.   Amendment of plans and additional conditions.
   A.   Amendments of the erosion and sedimentation control plan or grading
plan shall be submitted to the Township and shall be processed and approved or
disapproved in the same manner as the original plans. Field modifications of a
minor nature may be authorized by the Township Engineer and/or Code Official by
written authorization to the permittee.
   B.   If at any stage of the earthmoving and/or stripping activities, the
Township Engineer determines by inspection that the nature of the site is such
that further work authorized by an existing grading permit is likely to imperil
any property, public way, watercourse or drainage structure, the Township
Engineer may require, as a condition of allowing the work to continue,
reasonable special precautions be taken to avoid the likelihood of such peril.
Special precautions may include, but shall not be limited to, a more level
exposed slope; construction of additional drainage facilities; berms;
terracing; compaction; cribbing; installation of plant materials for erosion
control; and/or recommendations of a registered soils engineer and/or
engineering geologist regarding requirements for further work.
   C.   Where it appears that storm damage may result from incomplete grading
of any site, work may be stopped and the permittee required to install
temporary structures or take such other measures as may be necessary to protect
adjoining property or public safety. On a site of at least one acre or where
unusual site conditions prevail, and on all stream crossing projects, the
Township Engineer may specify the time of start of grading and time of
completion or may require that the operations be conducted in specific stages
to ensure completion of protective measures prior to the advent of seasonal
rains.
§ 99-14.   Violations.
   A.   Penalties. Any person who shall violate any provision of this chapter
shall be issued a summons and, upon conviction, the person, firm or corporation
violating any provision of this chapter shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not
more than $1,000, nor less than $500, plus all court costs, including
reasonable attorney’s fees incurred as a result of the prosecution. Each day
that a violation of this chapter continues shall constitute a separate offense.
   B.   Remedy of violation. In addition to the penalties as set forth in
Subsection A. above, any property subjected to earthmoving or stripping
activities performed in violation of this chapter shall be restored to its
previous condition, including replacement of excavated earth, removal of
illegally placed fill, and restoration of grades and planting. In order to
enforce this section the Township Solicitor may seek injunctive relief in
accordance with the rules of civil procedure.
   C.   Revocation or suspension of permit. Any permit issued under this
chapter, including those issued through approval of subdivision and land
development plans, may be revoked or suspended by the Board of Commissioners,
after notice to the permittee for:
      (1)   Failure to carry out the erosion and sedimentation control measures
described in the application and/or accompanying plans at the times specified
in the erosion and sedimentation control plan’s construction schedule or within
any extension that may be granted by the Township.
      (2)   Violation of any other condition of the grading permit.
      (3)   Failure to carry out the erosion and sedimentation control measures
described in the application and/or accompanying plans in a reasonable and
workmanlike manner.
      (4)   Violation of any provision of this chapter or any other applicable
law, ordinance, rule, or regulation relating to the earthmoving and/or
stripping activities.
      (5)   The existence of any condition or the doing of any acts
constituting or creating a nuisance, hazard or endangering human life or the
property of others, including, without limitation, the discharge of sediments
from the site or the failure of the control to prevent accelerated erosion or
waterborne sediment from leaving the site of construction.
   D.   Nonconforming work. If at any stage of construction, the earthmoving
and/or stripping activities do not conform to the grading permit to the
accompanying plans and specifications, including modifications thereof; or for
any violation of this chapter, a written notice to comply shall be given to the
permittee. Such notice shall set forth the nature of corrections required and
the time within which corrections shall be made.
      (1)   Upon failure to comply within the time specified, the permittee
shall be considered in violation of this chapter and shall be subject to the
following penalties and sanctions:
         (a)   The Township, upon recommendation of the Township Engineer and
following hearings thereon, may revoke or suspend the subdivision and land
development approval pursuant to which the work is being done, thereby
prohibiting the conveyance of any lot in the subdivision.
         (b)   The revocation of any building permit issued to the offending
permittee that has been issued pursuant to the grading permit and accompanying
plans.
         (c)   A prohibition on the issuance of any further building permits
for any lots.
         (d)   The financial security, if any, shall be forfeited and penalties
shall be imposed under Subsection A. above.
      (2)   The above-referenced sanctions shall be specified in the notice to
comply provided above. Any and all remedies are cumulative, and the exercise of
one shall not prohibit the exercise of any other remedies contained in either
this subsection, this chapter, or other applicable ordinances.
      (3)   In the case of any paving, filling, stripping, grading or
regrading; any disturbing, modifying, blocking or diverting the natural
overland subsurface flow of stormwater; or any construction, erection and
installation of any dam, ditch, culvert, drainpipe, bridge or any other
structure or obstruction affecting the drainage of any parcel in violation of
this chapter or any regulations made pursuant thereto, the proper Township
authorities, in addition to other remedies provided by law, may institute any
appropriate action or proceedings to prevent such unlawful activity; to
restrain, correct or abate such violation; to prevent the use of the applicable
premises; or to prevent any illegal act, conduct, business or use in or about
such premises. In addition, upon the failure of any permittee to complete the
control measures specified in the application, the Township may, after revoking
such permit, proceed to complete such measures itself and recover the cost
thereof from the permittee or its surety, and may file a municipal lien
therefore.
§ 99-15.   Exceptions to requirements.
   A.   If compliance with this chapter imposes severe hardship upon the
applicant (i.e., the applicant cannot develop the property as zoned), she/he
may apply to the Township for relief, which if granted, shall be the minimum
necessary to permit reasonable use of the site. Endeavoring to obtain approval
for as many units as possible shall not be considered a determining factor in
the Township’s evaluation of whether there is a severe hardship. The Board of
Commissioners may, in accordance with the following procedures, authorize
exceptions to any of the requirements and regulations set forth in this
chapter.
   B.   Application for any exception shall be made by a verified petition of
the applicant, stating fully the grounds of the petition and the facts relied
upon the applicant. Such petition shall be filed with the grading permit
application. In order for the petition to be granted, it shall be necessary
that the Board of Commissioners find all the following facts with respect to
the land referred to in the petition:
      (1)   That the site is of such shape or size or is affected by such
physical conditions or is subject to such title limitations of record that is
impossible or impractical for the applicant to comply with all the requirements
of this chapter;
      (2)   That the exception is necessary to prevent unreasonable and
unnecessary hardship;
      (3)   That such unnecessary hardship was not created by applicant;
      (4)   That the granting of the exception will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property in the vicinity of the subject
property; and
      (5)   That the exception, if granted, will represent the minimum
exception necessary to afford relief to the applicant.

such health hazard. If such corrective action has not been taken, the Board of
Health may take such action as may be necessary to protect the public health,

      (3)   Assisting owners of historic resources with nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places.
      (4)   Providing assistance to owners to make ownership of an historic
resource more affordable.
   C.   Discourage demolition of historic assets by:

alternatives with the owner.
      (2)   If demolition will occur, allowing time to document the historic
resource.
      (3)   Working with owners to prevent demolition of an historic resource
by neglect.
   D.   Deny demolition of highly significant resources in the Township while:
      (1)   Working with the owner to seek alternatives to demolition.

§ 158-11.   Odors.
[Added 5-13-1997 by Ord. No. 943]
   A.   Purpose. The Board of Commissioners, finding that excessive emission of
odor is detrimental to the physical, mental and social well-being of the
residents as well as to their comfort, living conditions, general welfare,
safety and well-being, and is therefore a public health and welfare hazard,
hereby finds it necessary to provide for the greater control and more effective
regulation of excessive odor and the sources of excessive odor within the
Township.
   B.   Prohibited odors. The emission of foul, offensive, gaseous or
nauseating odors in such quantities as to be offensive, a source of discomfort
or hazardous to health, at the boundary lines of the property on which the odor
originates, shall constitute a nuisance and shall be subject to enforcement by
the provisions of this chapter.
   C.   Prima facie violation. Credible testimony in a court of law from five
or more residents who are in general agreement as to the times and durations of
the odors and who reside in separate residences, including apartments and
condominiums, located across a property boundary line from the property on
which the source of the odor is generated, that the emission of prohibited
odors as described in Subsection B above, was a disturbance to their use,
occupancy and enjoyment of their property, shall be prima facie evidence of the
emission of a prohibited odor.
§ 158-12.   Noise.
[Added 5-13-1997 by Ord. No. 943; amended 7-12-2016 by Ord. No. 16-1320]

      (1)   The Board of Commissioners, finding that excessive levels by sound
are detrimental to the physical, mental and social well-being of the residents
as well as to their comfort, living conditions, general welfare, safety and
well-being and are therefore a public health and welfare hazard, hereby finds
it necessary to provide for the greater control and more effective regulation
of excessive sound and the sources of excessive sound within the Township.
      (2)   This section is intended to prohibit preventable and unnecessary
noise and is not intended, nor shall it be construed, to regulate the usual and
customary noise incidental to suburban life. This section may be applied to
commercial, industrial and institutional establishments, among others, but when
so applied to establishments properly located in commercial, industrial or
institutional zones, due consideration shall be given to the zone in which the
establishment is located. Further, the customary and natural noise incident to
the operation of business, industry or other facilities permitted in the area
zoned shall be considered so as not to create an undue hardship upon lawful
commercial, industrial, institutional or other establishments.
   B.   Noise disturbance prohibited. Any sound of such frequent repetition,
level or duration as to be or tend to be injurious to human health or welfare,
or which would unreasonably interfere with the enjoyment of life or property
throughout the Township or in any portions thereof, shall constitute a
nuisance.
   C.   Specific acts prohibited. Without in any way limiting the provisions of

   C.   Definitions. The following words and phrases, when used in this
section, shall have the meanings indicated:
      FOOTCANDLE — A common unit of light intensity used in the United States
and stated in lumens per square foot. It is measurable with a light meter.
(Note: LUX is the metric equivalent. There are approximately 10.7 lux per
footcandle.)
      FULL CUTOFF LUMINAIRE — A lighting unit in its mounted form that allows
no direct light or reflected source image from the lighting unit above a
ninety-degree plane, and no more than 10% of rated lamp output on an eighty-
degree plane, at any lateral angle around the fixture.
      FULLY SHIELDED — Providing internal and/or external shields and louvers
to prevent brightness from lamps, reflectors and lenses from causing glare at
normal viewing angles.
      GLARE — The sensation produced by direct lighting that causes an
annoyance, discomfort or loss in visual performance and visibility to the eye.
      ILLUMINANCE — The intensity of incident light at a point, measured in
footcandles or lux.
      LIGHT TRESPASS — Light emitted by a lighting installation which shines
beyond the boundaries of the property on which the installation is sited.
      LUMEN — A unit of measurement of light. One lumen is equal to one
footcandle falling onto one square foot of area.

Code.
         (b)   For lighting horizontal tasks such as private roadways,
sidewalks, entrances and parking areas, full cutoff luminaires shall be used.
         (c)   The use of floodlighting, spotlighting, wall-mounted fixtures,
internally illuminated decorative globes and spheres and other fixtures not
meeting "full cutoff" criteria shall be permitted only with the approval of the
Township, based upon acceptable justification and achievement of adequate glare
control.
         (d)   Luminaires shall be equipped with light directing and/or
shielding devices such as shields, visors, skirts or hoods to redirect
offending light distribution and/or to reduce direct or reflected glare.
         (e)   A NEMA-head fixture, a.k.a. "barn light" or "dusk-to-dawn
light," shall not be permitted where it is visible from a neighboring use or
property unless fitted with a reflector to render it full cutoff. In no case
shall the intensity of illumination cast by a source or sources regulated by
this section onto an adjacent residential property exceed 0.1 vertical
footcandle measured line-of-sight from anywhere on the adjacent residential
property.
      (3)   Control of nuisance and disabling glare.
         (a)   All outdoor lighting shall be aimed, located, designed, fitted
and maintained so as not to present a hazard to drivers or pedestrians by

   A.   The Board of Commissioners of the Township of Upper Dublin finds that
many new owners of properties in the Township are not aware of the zoning
classification of their property or of the requirements and limitations imposed
upon their property by the Code of the Township of Upper Dublin. This lack of
knowledge on the part of property owners may result in unsafe, unhealthy, and/
or nuisance properties.
   B.   In order to promote the public health, safety, and welfare, the Board
of Commissioners finds and declares that all sellers of property in the
Township shall be required to file with the Township and deliver to the
purchaser not later than the settlement date for the sale of the property, a
certification showing the zoning classification for the property and a
certification indicating the property’s compliance status with the requirements
of the Township Code relating to sidewalks, smoke alarms, house numbering, and
sump pumps.

As used in this Article, the following words and phrases shall have the
meanings indicated:
   OWNER—Any person, partnership, association, corporation, or fiduciary having
legal or equitable title or any interest in any real property. Whenever used in
any clause prescribing or imposing a penalty, the term “owner,” as applied to
partnerships and associations, shall mean the partners, or members thereof, and
as applied to corporations, the officers thereof.
   PROPERTY—All real property, or any interest therein, situated in Upper
Dublin Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.

§ 180-6.   Certification of zoning classification, use, and code compliance.
In Upper Dublin Township, it shall be unlawful for any owner to transfer his
property, or any interest therein, unless the owner shall first deliver to the
purchaser at or prior to the date of settlement or transfer the following
certifications, each of which must be dated within 90 days of the transfer,
signed by the owner and purchaser, or their agents, and a copy filed with the
Township within 7 days after the transfer:
   A.   Zoning and use classification. Upon application, the Township Zoning
Officer shall certify the zoning classification of the property to be sold and
whether the use of the property as represented by the applicant conforms to
Township Code.
      (1)   Application for certification statement. The application for
certification statement shall be made on forms provided by the Township and
shall set forth such information as the Zoning Officer may require including
the following: the address of the property; the name and address of the current
owners and proposed purchasers, if known, together with their authorized
agents, if any; a complete statement of the current use or uses to which the
property is being put.
   B.   Sidewalk certificate of good repair. Upon application, the Director of
Code Enforcement shall determine whether the sidewalks adjacent to a property
are in good repair as required by
Chapter 207 of the Township Code.
      (1)   The Director shall issue a certification if the sidewalks are in
good repair.
      (2)   If the sidewalks are not in good repair, the Director shall issue a
report within five business days of the inspection that clearly identifies the
Township Code violations and the remedial action required for compliance. Upon
correction of all violations so that the sidewalks are in good repair, the
applicant shall notify the Director, in writing, for a re-inspection to be
conducted within five days from such notification.
   C.   Smoke detectors. The owner shall certify that smoke detectors have been
installed and are functioning properly as required by
Chapters 57 and
73 of the Township Code and the Pennsylvania Construction Code Act and Uniform
Construction Code.
   D.   Building numbers. The owner shall certify that building numbers have
been conspicuously posted in such manner that they are visible and legible from
the street as required by
Chapter 76 of the Township Code.
   E.   Sumps and drains. The owner shall certify that all sumps and drains on
the property are installed and properly functioning as required by
Chapter 206,
Chapter 207, and
Chapter 218 of the Township Code.
§ 180-7.   Procedure to obtain certification.
   A.   Applications shall be submitted on forms provided by the Township,
shall be completely filled out and shall be accompanied by a fee, the amount of
which shall be set by the Board of Commissioners.
   B.   The application for a certificate under this section authorizes the
Township to inspect the premises being transferred. Such inspection shall not

made in the application for certification as the basis for issuance of a
certificate.
   C.   The Township shall respond to an application within 10 business days of
its receipt.
§ 180-8.   Violations and penalties.

Article, then in any action, at law, or in equity, instituted by a purchaser
against an owner, it shall be conclusively presumed that the owner, at the time
of the signing of such agreement, represented and warranted to the purchaser
that such property was being used in compliance with the then existing Township
Code provisions relating to the certifications required above.
   B.   Any person who submits a false application to the Township, or who
obtains a certification through misrepresentation, or who fails to provide the
certifications required by this Article and whose property at the time of
transfer was not in compliance with the then existing Township Code provisions
relating to the certifications required above, shall be guilty of violating the
provisions of this section and, upon conviction thereof in a summary
proceeding, shall be subject to payment of a civil fine of not more than $600
and costs of prosecution, in addition to such other remedies as may be provided
by law or equity.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 192-1.   Purpose and policy.
   A.   The purposes of these regulations are to:
      (1)   Set forth uniform requirements for direct and indirect
contributions to sanitary sewer systems within the boundaries of Upper Dublin
Township and to adjacent sanitary sewer systems, including the systems of
Ambler Borough, Abington Township, Bucks County Water and Sewer Authority,
Horsham Water and Sewer Authority, Springfield Township, and Upper Moreland
Hatboro Joint Sewer Authority.
      (2)   Enable the Township, adjacent municipalities, and sanitary sewer
operators to comply with the Clean Water Act, the Pennsylvania Clean Streams
Law, General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR 403), and other applicable
federal, state and local laws and regulations.
      (3)   Prevent the discharge of pollutants to sanitary sewer systems that
will:
         (a)   Interfere with the operation of the sanitary sewer systems.
         (b)   Contaminate resulting sludge from the sanitary sewer systems.
         (c)   Cause the sanitary sewer systems to violate their respective
NPDES discharge permits.
         (d)   Pass through the sanitary sewer systems, inadequately treated,
into receiving waters or the atmosphere.
         (e)   Be otherwise incompatible with the sanitary sewer systems.
         (f)   Improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and
sludge from the sanitary sewer systems.
         (g)   Protect the general public and sanitary sewer system personnel
who may be affected by sewage and sludge.
   B.   These regulations provide for the regulation of direct and indirect
users to the sanitary sewer systems within Upper Dublin Township through
enforcement of general requirements for all users; monitoring and enforcement
activities; and reporting and compliance activities.
   C.   These regulations shall apply to all users who discharge wastewater to
the sanitary sewer systems within the Township.
   D.   Portions of the sanitary sewer systems within the Township discharge
sewage to adjacent sanitary sewer systems for treatment. The Township may from
time to time, upon recommendation from the appropriate officials of the
sanitary sewer systems, adopt regulations by resolution or ordinance applicable
to users’ sewage treated by the respective sanitary sewer systems. However,
unless otherwise specified, the regulations set forth in this chapter shall
apply to all users in the Township who discharge sewage that is collected,
transported, and/or treated by the sanitary sewer systems, excepting those
instances where the regulations of the sanitary sewer systems are more
stringent than those set forth herein. Where the respective sanitary sewer
system regulations are more stringent, the more stringent regulations shall
apply.

   F.   System rehabilitation.
      (1)   A written notice of violation may be issued to any person who is
the owner of any property and/or any person utilizing the oil and grease
interceptor/trap system, which is found to be served by a malfunctioning oil
and grease interceptor/trap system or which is discharging oil and grease
without a permit.
      (2)   Within seven days of notification by the operator that a
malfunction has been identified, the property owner and/or the person utilizing
the oil and grease interceptor/trap system, must make application to the
operator for approval to repair or replace the malfunctioning system. Within 30
days of initial notification by the operator, construction of the permitted
repair or replacement must commence. Within 60 days of the original
notification by the operator, the construction must be completed unless
conditions mandate a longer period, in which case the operator may set an
extended completion date.
      (3)   In the event the modifications do not result in the elimination of
the malfunction of the existing oil and grease interceptor/trap system, the
person owning and/or making use of the interceptor system shall bear
responsibility for the continued malfunction of the system. The owner and/or
utilize of said system shall be required to take such action as necessary to
eliminate the malfunction.
   G.   Liens. The operator, upon notice that an imminent public health or
safety hazard exists due to failure of a proper owner and/or utilize to
maintain, repair or replace an oil and grease interceptor/trap system, shall
have the authority to contract to have the work performed. The owner of record
of the property will be charged for the work performed and, if necessary, a
lien will be entered therefore in accordance with the law.
   H.   Oil and grease disposal.
      (1)   All grease originating within the operator’s collection system
shall be disposed of in accordance with the requirements of the Solid Waste
Management Act (Act 97 of 1980, 35 P.S. § 6018.101 et seq.) and all other
applicable laws and at sites or facilities approved by DEP.
      (2)   Pumpers/haulers of oil and grease shall operate in a manner
consistent with the provisions of the Pennsylvania Solid Waste Management Act
(Act 97 of 1980, 35 P.S. §§ 6018.101–6018-1003) and all other applicable laws.
   I.   Violations. Should any person violate the provisions of this section,
the Township or the operator is authorized to pursue all legal remedies
available to it in order to effectuate compliance.
§ 192-27.   Additional pretreatment measures.
   A.   Pretreatment facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as
necessary to comply with these and the operator’s regulations and shall comply
with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits and the prohibitions
set out in these and the operator’s regulations within the time limitations
specified by EPA, the state, the operator or the Township, whichever is more
stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated
and maintained at the user’s expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities
and operating procedures shall be submitted to the operator for review and
shall be acceptable to the operator before such facilities are constructed. The
review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user
from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a
discharge acceptable to the operator under the provisions of these regulations.
   B.   Sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the
operator, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing
excessive amounts of sand or grit, except that such interceptors shall not be
required for residential users unless a residential user who is contributing
excessive amounts of sand or grit has first been given the opportunity to
reduce the discharge by other means. All interception units shall be of type
and capacity approved by the operator and shall be so located to be easily
accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected,
cleaned and repaired regularly, as needed, by the users at their expense, in
accordance with any procedure for the installation and maintenance of grease
traps as may be established from time to time by the Township or the operator.
   C.   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
   D.   Whenever deemed necessary, the operator may require users to restrict
their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be
discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of
discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams and such
other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the
user’s compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   E.   The operator may require any person discharging into a POTW to install
and maintain, on his/her property and at his/her expense, a suitable storage
and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater
discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.

ARTICLE VII
Reporting Requirements
§ 192-35.   Baseline monitoring reports.
   A.   Within either 180 days after the date of a categorical pretreatment
standard, or the final administrative decision on a category determination
under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), or as required by the operator, whichever is later,
existing categorical users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge
to a POTW shall submit to the operator a report which contains information as
requested by the operator. At least 90 days prior to commencement of their
discharge, or as required by the operator, new sources and sources that become
categorical users subject to the promulgation of an applicable categorical
standard shall submit to the operator a report which contains the information
as required by the operator. A new source shall report the method of
pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A new
source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of
pollutants to be discharged.
   B.   All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by
the operator, submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of
pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the
measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period.
All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with
the operator’s regulations.
   C.   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user’s discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly
operated, kept clean and maintained in good working order at all times. The
failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall
not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative
of its discharge.
   D.   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors
any pollutant more frequently than required by the operator, using the
procedures prescribed in these regulations, the results of this monitoring
shall be included in the report.
§ 192-36.   Reports of changed conditions.
Each user must notify the operator, at least 60 days before the change, of any
planned significant changes to the user’s operations or system which might
alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater.
§ 192-37.   Reports of potential problems.
   A.   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental
discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch
discharge or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for a POTW, the
user shall immediately telephone and notify the operator of the incident. This
notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste,
concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user,
along with the identity of the person or persons believed to be responsible for
the discharge.
   B.   Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the operator, submit a detailed written report describing the cause
(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent
similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to a POTW or natural resources, or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties
or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to these regulations.
   C.   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a
discharge described in Subsection A above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
§ 192-38.   Reports to unpermitted users.
All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide
appropriate reports to the operator as the operator may require.
§ 192-39.   Notice of violation; repeat sampling and reporting.
If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the
operator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall
also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat
analysis to the operator within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation.
§ 192-40.   Notification of discharge of hazardous waste.
   A.   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the operator, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director and state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into a sanitary sewer
system of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous
waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the
hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number and
the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the user discharges more
than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month, the notification also
shall contain the following information to the extent such information is
required by the operator: an identification of the hazardous constituents
contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such
constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an
estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be
discharged during the following 12 months.
   B.   Discharges are exempt from the requirements of Subsection A above
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of
hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in
40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of non-
acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a
one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more
than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional
notification.
   C.   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the operator,
the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director and state hazardous
waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the
effective date of such regulations.
   D.   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall
certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of
hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically
practical.
§ 192-41.   Recordkeeping.
Users subject to the reporting requirements of these regulations shall retain,
and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information
obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by these regulations
and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring
activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records
shall include the date, exact place, method and time of sampling, and the name
of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who
performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the
results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of
at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the
duration of any litigation concerning the user or the Township, or the
operator, or a POTW, or where the user has been specifically notified of a
longer retention period by the Township or operator.

ARTICLE VIII
Compliance Monitoring
§ 192-48.   Right-of-entry inspection and sampling.
   A.   The operator shall have the right to enter the premises of any user,
without notice, to determine whether the user is complying with the
requirements of these regulations and any wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder. Users shall allow the operator ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and
copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
   B.   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security personnel so that, upon
presentation of suitable identification, the operator will be permitted to
enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
   C.   The operator shall have the right to set up on the user’s property, or
require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/
or metering of the user’s operations.
   D.   The operator may require the user to install monitoring equipment as
necessary. The facility’s sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained
at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own
expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be
calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
   E.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user
at the written or verbal request of the operator and shall not be replaced. The
costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user.
   F.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the operator access to the user’s
premises shall be a violation of these regulations.
   G.   When it would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user to
situate the monitoring facility on the user’s premises, the Township may allow
the facility to be constructed in a public street or sidewalk area and located
so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. There
shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow
accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility,
sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and
proper condition at the expense of the user.
§ 192-49.   Search warrants.
If the operator has been refused access to a building, structure or property,
or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that
there may be a violation of these regulations, or that there is a need to
inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of
the operator designed to verify compliance with these regulations or any permit
or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and
welfare of the community, then the Township and the operator may seek issuance
of a search warrant from the District Justice in whose jurisdiction the
property is situate.
§ 192-50.   Public access to information.
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits and monitoring
programs, and from the operator’s inspection and sampling activities, shall be
available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically
requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the operator, that
the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods
of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state
law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the
information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a
report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately
upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or
pretreatment program and in enforcement proceedings involving the person
furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other
“effluent data” as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as
confidential information and will be available to the public without
restriction.
§ 192-51.   (Reserved).
ARTICLE IX
Enforcement Remedies
§ 192-52.   Surcharge in lieu of enforcement remedy.
With respect to conventional pollutants, the operator may, from time to time
and at its discretion, adopt a policy whereby certain specifically identified
conventional pollutants are permissibly discharged to a POTW for removal at the
plant, with the cost of such removal to be borne by the discharger. The
operator may expand or limit the list of conventional pollutants to which this
surcharge system applies based upon the plant’s capacity/ability to effectively
remove particular conventional pollutants. In the event that a conventional
pollutant is within the scope of the surcharge system as it exists at the time
of discharge, then such conventional pollutant discharge shall not be
considered a violation of these regulations. However, any failure to pay the
surcharge cost for the plant’s removal of the pollutant shall itself be
considered a violation of these regulations and subject to enforcement action,
in addition to all generally held rights of collection.
§ 192-53.   Administrative remedies.
   A.   Notification of violation. When the Township or the operator find that
a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of these
regulations, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Township or the operator may
serve upon that user a written notice of violation. When the notice of
violation includes a plan for satisfactory correction and prevention of the
violation, submission of such plan in no way relieves the user of liability for
any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Township or the
operator to take any action, including emergency action or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
   B.   Consent orders. An operator may enter into consent orders, assurances
of voluntary compliance or other similar documents establishing an agreement
with any user responsible for noncompliance Such documents will include
specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a
time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same
effect as the administrative orders authorized elsewhere in these regulations
and shall be judicially enforceable.
   C.   Compliance order. When the Township or the operator finds that a user
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of these regulations, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, the Township or the operator may issue an order to the
user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance
within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the
time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly
operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A
compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a
pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the
user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation.
Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user.
   D.   Cease and desist orders.
      (1)   When the Township or the operator find that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of these regulations, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, or that the user’s past violations are likely to recur, the
Township or the operator may issue an order to the user directing it to cease
and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
         (a)   Immediately comply with all requirements.
         (b)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
      (2)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against or
a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.
   E.   Administrative fines.
      (1)   When the Township or the operator find that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of these regulations, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the Township or the operator may fine such user in an amount
permitted by law. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day
basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits,
fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
      (2)   Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall be assessed a penalty as
specified by the operator, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate
determined by the operator. A lien against the user’s property may be sought
for unpaid charges, fines and penalties.
      (3)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request
for the Township or operator to reconsider the fine along with full payment of
the fine amount within 20 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request
has merit, the Township or the operator may convene a hearing on the matter. In
the event that the user’s appeal is successful, the payment, together with any
interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The costs of
preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, may
be added to the fine.
      (4)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against or a
prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.
   F.   Emergency suspensions.
      (1)   The operator may immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after
informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
operator may also immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after notice and
opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of a
POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
      (2)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
operator may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance
of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to a POTW or its
receiving stream or endangerment to any individuals. The operator may allow the
user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the operator that the period of endangerment has passed, unless
the termination proceedings in these regulations are initiated against the
user.
      (3)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the operator prior to the date of any show
cause or termination hearing described elsewhere in these regulations.
      (4)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
   G.   Termination of discharge.
      (1)   In addition to the provisions in these regulations, any user who
violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:
         (a)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions.
         (b)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge.
         (c)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge.
         (d)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling.
         (e)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in these regulations.
      (2)   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause why the proposed action
should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the operator shall not be a bar
to or a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.
§ 192-54.   Judicial enforcement remedies.
   A.   Injunctive relief. When the operator determines that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of these regulations, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the operator may petition the Court of
Common Pleas of Montgomery County for the issuance of a temporary or permanent
injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance
of the wastewater discharge permit, order or other requirement imposed by these
regulations on activities of the user. The operator may also seek such other
action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a
requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for
injunctive relief shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking any
other action against a user.
   B.   Civil penalties. In the event that the operator is required to seek
court redress for violations of these regulations, then all amounts recoverable
elsewhere herein as administrative fines shall be recoverable as civil
penalties; attorney’s fees, court costs and related expenses shall also be
recoverable. Filing suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against or a
prerequisite for taking any other action against a user.
   C.   Criminal prosecution. In the event that any discharge or other
violation of these regulations constitutes a violation of any criminal or penal
statute, then, in addition, to all enforcement remedies described elsewhere in
these regulations, the Township shall have the unfettered right to initiate
and/or assist in any state or federal criminal proceedings as a result of such
violation. Examples of criminal conduct in connection with a violation include,
but are not limited to, knowing or intentional introduction of any substance
into the wastewater system which causes injury to persons or property,
otherwise undertaking any act or failing to undertake any act which recklessly
endangers the well-being of the community or plant personnel, falsification of
documents required to be filed pursuant to these regulations, and tampering
with or otherwise rendering inaccurate a monitoring device or similar
equipment.
   D.   Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in these regulations
are not exclusive. The operator may take any, all or any combination of these
actions and those actions specified by the operator’s regulations against a
noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in
accordance with an enforcement response plan if same is adopted by the
operator. However, the operator may take other action against any user when the
circumstances warrant. Further, the operator may take more than one enforcement
action against any noncompliant user.
§ 192-55.   Supplemental enforcement action.
   A.   Performance bonds. The operator may decline to issue or reissue a
wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any
provision of these regulations, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the operator, in a
sum not to exceed a value determined by the operator to be necessary to achieve
consistent compliance.
   B.   Liability insurance. The operator may decline to issue or reissue a
wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any
provision of these regulations, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances
sufficient to restore or repair damage to a POTW caused by its discharge.
   C.   Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to
violate any provision of these regulations, a wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the
user’s expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
   D.   Public nuisances. A violation of any provision of these regulations, a
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement may separately be declared as a public
nuisance to the extent that it constitutes such nuisance as defined by
Pennsylvania law or the Township Code.
ARTICLE X
Affirmative Defenses to Discharge Violations
§ 192-56.   Upset.
   A.   For the purposes of this section, “upset” means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, and lack of preventive maintenance or careless or
improper operation.
   B.   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of Subsection C below are met.
   C.   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence, that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset.
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures.
      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the operator
within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided
orally, a written submission must be provided within five days):
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance.
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue.
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   D.   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   E.   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   F.   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
§ 192-57.   Prohibited discharge standards.
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in these regulations
or the specific prohibitions in these regulations if it can prove that it did
not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction
with discharges from other sources, would cause pass-through or interference
and that either:
   A.   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass-through or
interference.
   B.   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when the operator was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit and, in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
§ 192-58.   Bypass.
   A.   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of Subsections C and D of this section.
      (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the operator at least 10 days before the date of the
bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the operator of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the
time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be
provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The
written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the
duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has
not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps
taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
The operator may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral
report has been received within 24 hours.
   B.   Notice and report.
      (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the operator at least 10 days before the date of the
bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the operator of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the
time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be
provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The
written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the
duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times and, if the bypass has
not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps
taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
The operator may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral
report has been received within 24 hours.
   C.   Exceptions.
      (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the operator may undertake an enforcement
action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury or severe property damage.
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance.
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under Subsection C of
this section.
      (2)   The operator may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering
its adverse effects, if the operator determines that it will meet the three

ARTICLE XII
Ambler Wastewater Treatment Plant
§ 192-60.   General provisions.
This Article XII applies to users within the Township that discharge wastewater
to the Ambler Wastewater Treatment Plant (“AWTP”), for which Ambler is
primarily responsible.
§ 192-61.   Jurisdiction.
   A.   With regard to direct and indirect contributions of wastewater from
within the boundaries of the Township which contributions are ultimately
discharged to the AWTP, the operator is responsible for enforcement of this
chapter and its own regulations in the first instance, but the AWTP and Ambler
share the duty to enforce this chapter to the extent necessary to assure
compliance by Ambler and the AWTP with the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the
General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR 403), along with all applicable state
and federal laws and permits.
   B.   Neither Ambler nor the AWTP have any jurisdiction or authority to
enforce this chapter or any ordinance with regard to users whose discharge does
not enter the AWTP.
   C.   With regard to users whose discharge enters the AWTP, the provisions of
this chapter as outlined above apply to Ambler and the AWTP as well as to the
Township and the operator. In addition, with regard to users whose discharge
enters the AWTP, the following provisions also apply to Ambler and the AWTP.
§ 192-62.   National categorical pretreatment standards.
The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR, Chapter I, Subchapter
N, Parts 405–4471, are hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth fully
herein.
   A.   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of
either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, AWTP may
impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6
(c).
   B.   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed
with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, AWTP shall impose an
alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
   C.   A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard
if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in
40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally
different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical
pretreatment standard.
   D.   A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.
§ 192-63.   Right of revision.
   AWTP reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater
discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to
the AWTP.
§ 192-64.   Wastewater analysis.
When required by AWTP, a user must submit information on the nature and
characteristics of its wastewater within five days of the request. AWTP is
authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically require
users to update this information.
§ 192-65.   Regulation of waste received from other jurisdictions.
   A.   Pursuant to the Pennsylvania Pretreatment Works Penalty Law (Act 9 of
1992), the AWTP reserves the right to regulate waste entering the POTW
regardless of its point of origin.
   B.   Whenever possible, the enforcement of this chapter shall be a joint and
cooperative effort between the Township, the operators, and AWTP and/or Ambler,
which has primary responsibility for plant operations. In the event that the
Township and the operator fail or refuse to enforce its sewer regulations after
the AWTP or Ambler has made a determination that such enforcement is necessary,
then the AWTP and Ambler reserve all rights which they may have to either
undertake enforcement pursuant to the Pennsylvania Pretreatment Works Penalty
Law and/or to seek enforcement of any intermunicipal agreement which may
require the cooperation of the Township or the operator.
§ 192-66.   Enforcement remedies.
The Borough of Ambler and the AWTP, in conjunction with the operator, are fully
empowered to undertake all enforcement remedies set forth herein in order to
assure user compliance with state and federal laws and regulations.
§ 192-67.   Show-cause hearing.
   A.   In addition to the administrative enforcement remedies outlined above,
AWTP may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this Article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before
the AWTP and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the
meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a
request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not
be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered
mail at least 10 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any
authorized representative of the user. A show-cause hearing shall not be a bar
against or prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.
   B.   At any hearing held pursuant to this Article, testimony taken must be
under oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript, so recorded, will be
made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon
payment of the usual charges thereof.
   C.   After a hearing, an order may be issued as authorized directing that,
following a specified time period, the sewer service be discontinued unless
adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances shall
have been installed or existing treatment facilities, devices or other related
appurtenances are properly operated. Further orders and directives, as are
necessary and appropriate, may be issued.
   D.   Any user aggrieved by the enforcement of this chapter may take an
appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, in
accordance with the provisions of the Local Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S.A. § 105 et
seq., and have a hearing thereon if the appeal is taken within 15 calendar days
of the user’s receipt of any order or notice under the applicable section.

causing glare to traveling motorists on a public street or access drive used by
the public.

footcandles at a distance of eight feet from the center line of the sign. When
illuminated, light or pale colors and the color white shall not exceed 50% of

lights permitted in conjunction with signs shall be equipped with restraining
hoods to concentrate the illumination upon the area of the sign to prevent
glare upon a street or adjoining property.
   F.   All outside lighting, including sign lighting, shall be arranged,
designed and shielded or directed so as to protect an adjoining property or

Single Use Plastic Regulations
[Adopted 3-12-2024 by Ord. No. 24-1389]
§ 203-48.   Purpose and findings.
   A.   Purpose.
      (1)   The purpose of this article is to reduce the use of single-use
plastic bags by retail establishments within the Township.
      (2)   To curb litter on the streets, in the parks, and in the trees,
protect the local streams, rivers, waterways and other aquatic environments,
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reduce solid waste generation, promote the use
of reusable, compostable, and recyclable materials within the Township, and to
preserve the natural, scenic, historic, and esthetic values of the Township.
      (3)   To relieve the pressure for landfills and resource recovery
facilities to manage the disposition of single-use products.
   B.   Findings.
      (1)   The use of single-use plastic bags has severe environmental
impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions, litter, harm to wildlife and
aquatic life, ground level ozone formation, atmospheric acidification, water
consumption, and solid waste generation.
      (2)   There are numerous retail establishments within the Township which
provide single-use plastic bags to their customers.
      (3)   The majority of such single-use plastic bags are made from plastic
or other material that does not readily decompose.
      (4)   Approximately one hundred billion single-use plastic bags are
discarded by United States consumers each year. Given the difficulty of
recycling these materials, less than 1 percent of single-use plastic bags are
returned for recycling in the United States and in the Township, such bags are
not curbside recyclable.
      (5)   Numerous studies have documented the prevalence of single-use
plastic bags littering the environment, blocking storm drains, entering local
waterways, and becoming stuck in or upon natural resources and public property.
      (6)   The taxpayers of the Township pay the costs related to the cleanup
of single-use plastic bags from the roadways, trees, sewers, waters, and parks
within the Township.
      (7)   From an overall environmental and economic perspective, the best
alternative to single-use plastic bags is a shift to reusable bags or
recyclable paper bags.
      (8)   There are several alternatives to single-use plastic bags readily
available in and around the Township.
      (9)   An important goal of the Township is to procure and use sustainable
products and services.
      (10)   An important goal of the Township is to preserve the natural,
scenic, historic, and esthetic values of the Township.
      (11)   It is the Township’s desire to conserve resources, reduce the
amount of greenhouse gas emissions, waste, litter, water pollution, and to
protect the public health and welfare, including wildlife and aquatic life, all
of which increases the quality of life for the Township’s residents and
visitors to the Township.
      (12)   As required by the Environmental Rights Amendment to the
Pennsylvania Constitution, the Board seeks to preserve the natural, scenic,
historic, and aesthetic values of the Township.
      (13)   It is the Board’s desire to conserve resources, reduce the amount
of greenhouse gas emissions, waste, litter, water pollution and to protect the
public health and welfare, including wildlife and aquatic life, all of which
increases the quality of life for the Township’s residents and visitors.

[HISTORY: Adopted by the Board of Commissioners of the Township of Upper Dublin
1-11-1994 as Ord. No. 863. Amendments noted where applicable.]
§ 205-1.   Findings.
The Board of Commissioners of Upper Dublin Township hereby finds that the
emission of particulate matter, mist, spray or droplets onto property without
the permission of the owner thereof creates a high level of concern over the
detrimental nature of such products due to the possibility of such emissions
having toxic, noxious or hazardous characteristics. Those affected by such
emissions are without power to determine the potential harmful effects thereof
and are thus justifiably placed in a position of anxiety and fear. The Board of
Commissioners has determined, therefore, that any such emission which causes
perceptible quantities of particulate matter, mist, spray or droplets to fall
or otherwise be deposited on the property of another without such person's
permission is a public nuisance.
§ 205-2.   Prohibited actions.
No device emitting particulate matter, mist, spray or droplets may be used in
such manner as to allow such emission in perceptible quantities to fall, drift
or otherwise be deposited on another's property without that person's
permission.
§ 205-3.   Enforcement.
The Township Code Enforcement Director, or his duly authorized representative,
or any officer of the Upper Dublin Township Police Department shall have the
power to inspect and investigate conditions relating to the enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter, to enforce the provisions of this chapter and to
write citations for any violation of this chapter.
§ 205-4.   Violations and penalties.
Any person, firm, association or corporation, or employee or representative
thereof, who violates any provision of this chapter, upon conviction thereof,
shall be subject to a fine or penalty not exceeding six hundred dollars ($600.)
for each and every offense. Such fines or penalties shall be collected as like
fines or penalties are now collected by law and shall be in addition to any
other penalty provided herein.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 206-1.   Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Upper Dublin Township
Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 206-2.   Statement of findings.
The Board of Commissioners of the Township of Upper Dublin finds that:
   A.   Stormwater runoff from lands modified by human activities threatens
public health and safety by causing decreased infiltration of precipitation,
increased runoff flow volume and increased runoff flow velocity, which overtax
the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers resulting in flooding, and
greatly increases the cost to the public to manage stormwater.
   B.   Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from
land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed harms surface water
resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns, accelerating stream
flows (which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and streambanks thereby
elevating sedimentation), destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic
pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy
metals and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted through loss of
recharge.
   C.   A program of stormwater management, including reasonable regulation of
land development and redevelopment that causes loss of natural infiltration, is
fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare and the protection of the
people of the Township and all the people of the commonwealth, their resources
and the environment.
   D.   Stormwater is an important water resource that provides groundwater
recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams, which also protects and
maintains surface water quality.
   E.   Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
   F.   Federal and state regulations require the Township to implement a
program of stormwater controls. The Township is required to obtain a permit for
stormwater discharges for its municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) under
the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).
   G.   Nonstormwater discharges to MS4s contribute to pollution of waters of
the commonwealth.
§ 206-3.   Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote public health, safety and welfare
within the Township and its watersheds by minimizing the harms and maximizing
the benefits described in §
206-2 of this chapter, through provisions designed to:
   A.   Manage stormwater runoff impacts at their source by regulating
activities that cause the problems.
   B.   Provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
   C.   Properly use and preserve existing drainage systems and watercourses.
   D.   Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source through reliance
on natural processes and a minimum of structures.
   E.   Maximize infiltration of stormwater to maintain groundwater recharge,
to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality, to otherwise protect
water resources, and to promote the natural hydrologic regime.
   F.   Maintain and improve existing flows and quality of streams and
watercourses.
   G.   Meet legal water quality requirements under Pennsylvania law, to
protect and maintain existing uses and maintain the level of water quality to
support those uses in all streams, and to protect and maintain water quality in
special protection streams.
   H.   Prevent scour and erosion of streambanks and streambeds.
   I.   Provide for proper operations and maintenance of all stormwater
management facilities within the Township.
   J.   Provide a mechanism to identify controls necessary to meet NPDBS
requirements.
   K   Implement an illicit discharge detection and elimination program to
address nonstormwater discharges into the Township's MS4 and watercourses
within the Township.
§ 206-4.   Statutory authority.
The Township is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect
stormwater and water quality by the authority of the First Class Township Code
and the Municipalities Planning Code.
§ 206-5.   Applicability.
   A.   This chapter applies to all activities within the Township and all
stormwater runoff entering into the Township's MS4.
   B.   Regulated activities include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   Land development or redevelopment.
      (2)   Land subdivision.
      (3)   Development, construction or reconstruction of impervious,
semipervious or pervious surfaces.
      (4)   Construction of new buildings or structures and additions to
existing buildings or structures.
      (5)   Stormwater discharges to the Township's MS4 or watercourses.
      (6)   Installation or construction of stormwater management structures,
facilities, and appurtenances thereto.
      (7)   Property maintenance, grading and landscaping.
      (8)   Alteration of existing vegetation or land cover.
   C.   Earth disturbance activities and associated stormwater management
controls are also regulated under existing federal and state law and
implementing regulations. This chapter shall operate in coordination with those
parallel requirements; the requirements of this chapter shall be no less
restrictive than federal or state law.
§ 206-6.   Compatibility with other requirements.
   A.   Approvals issued and actions taken under this chapter do not relieve
the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for
activities regulated by any other code, law, regulation or ordinance.
   B.   To the extent that this chapter is inconsistent with or imposes more
rigorous or stringent requirements than any other ordinance or regulation of
the Township, the specific requirements contained in this chapter shall be
followed.
   C.   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to affect any of the
Township's requirements regarding stormwater matters which do not conflict with
the provisions of this chapter, such as local stormwater management design
criteria (e.g., inlet spacing, inlet type, collection system design and
details, outlet structure design, etc.). Conflicting provisions in other
municipal ordinances or regulations shall be construed to retain the
requirements of this chapter addressing state water quality requirements.
§ 206-7.   Severability.
In the event that any section or provision of this chapter is declared invalid
by a court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the
validity of any of the remaining provisions of this chapter.

activities must be designed to protect and maintain existing uses and maintain
the level of water quality necessary to protect those uses in all streams and
to protect and maintain water quality in special protection streams.
   C.   Water quality is a function of the chemical, biological and physical
characteristics of surface water bodies. After regulated earth disturbance
activities are complete, these characteristics can be impacted by addition of
pollutants, such as sediment, and changes in habitat through increased flow
volumes and/or rates as a result of changes in land surface area from those
activities. Therefore, permanent discharges to surface waters must be managed
to protect the streambank, streambed and structural integrity of the waterway

by any means into two or more lots, tracts, parcels or other divisions of land,
including changes in existing lot lines for the purpose, whether immediate or
future, of lease, partition by the court for distribution to heirs or devisees,
transfer of ownership or building or lot development; provided, however, that
the subdivision by lease of land for agricultural purposes into parcels of more

ARTICLE III
Stormwater Management for Water Quality
§ 206-31.   General requirements for stormwater management.
   A.   All regulated activities within the Township shall be designed,
implemented, operated and maintained to meet the purposes of this chapter,
through these two elements:
      (1)   Erosion and sediment control during earth disturbance and
construction activities (e.g., during construction).
      (2)   Water quality protection measures after completion of earth
disturbance and construction activities, including operations and maintenance.
These measures are also known as "postconstruction stormwater management."
   B.   No regulated activities within the Township shall commence until the
requirements of this chapter are met.
   C.   Erosion and sediment control during regulated activities shall be
addressed as required by §
206-33.
   D.   Postconstruction water quality protection shall be addressed as
required by §
206-34. Operations and maintenance of permanent stormwater BMPs shall be
addressed as required by Article IV and Article V of this chapter.
   E.   All BMPs used to meet the requirements of this chapter shall conform to
the state water quality requirements, and any more stringent requirements as
determined by the Township.
   F.   Techniques for low-impact development practices described in Article XI
of this chapter are encouraged because they reduce the impacts on development
and promulgate compliance with the requirements of this chapter and the state
water quality requirements.
   G.   The standards referred to in this article shall apply as minimum design
standards; however, federal and state regulations may impose additional
standards subject to their jurisdiction.
   H.   
Chapter 240 and the following requirements apply to existing watercourses and
natural drainage features:
      (1)   Whenever a watercourse is located within a development site, it
shall remain open in a natural state to maintain pre-development conditions.
This requirement may be waived on a case-by-case basis by the Board to limit
enclosure and disturbance in furtherance of public health, safety and welfare.
      (2)   The existing points of natural drainage discharge onto adjacent
property shall not be altered without the written approval of the affected
landowners and the grant of a permanent drainage easement by the landowners.
      (3)   No stormwater runoff or natural drainage shall be so diverted as to
overload existing drainage systems (including existing stormwater management
facilities) or create flooding.
      (4)   The Township may require a developer to grant to the Township a
permanent drainage easement along any watercourse located within or along the
boundary of any property being subdivided or developed. The purpose of any such
easement shall be for the maintenance of the channel of any watercourse. The
terms of the easement shall prohibit the placing of fill or structures and any
alterations which may adversely affect the watercourse. The required width of
any such easement shall be determined by the Township Engineer, and in no case
shall such easement be less than 50 feet in width. The developer will retain
maintenance responsibility for the easement until such time as the following
are accomplished:
         (a)   The easement is offered for dedication by the developer and
accepted by the Township; and
         (b)   If an easement acceptable to the Township is established and
officially entered upon the deeds of those properties affected by the easement
by the Montgomery County Office for the Recording of Deeds, the maintenance
shall then be the responsibility of the individual lot owners over whose
property the easement passes. For land developments, the maintenance shall then
be the responsibility of the lot owner upon which the watercourse traverses; or
         (c)   A homeowners' association or other approved legal entity,
approved by the Township, assumes responsibility for the maintenance of the
development, including the watercourse easement.
   I.   Developers shall construct and/or install stormwater management
facilities, on and offsite, as necessary to:
      (1)   Prevent erosion damage and to satisfactorily carry off, detain or
retain and control the rate and volume of stormwatcr discharge.
      (2)   Manage the anticipated peak discharge from property being developed
and existing runoff being contributed from all land at a higher elevation in
the same watershed.
      (3)   Manage volume of runoff. Postdevelopment conditions shall not
exceed predevelopment conditions.
      (4)   Convey stormwater along or through the property to an outfall.
         (a)   If diffused flow is proposed to be concentrated and discharged
onto an adjacent property, the developer must document that adequate downstream
conveyance facilities exist to safely transport the concentrated discharge or
otherwise prove that no erosion, sedimentation, flooding or other harm will
result from the concentrated discharge.
         (b)   An outfall shall have sufficient capacity to receive stormwater
without deterioration of the facility and without adversely affecting property
in the Township. This outfall may be a stream or other drainage facility so
designated by the township.
         (c)   Roof runoff.
            [1]   Roof runoff shall be conveyed into watercourses on the
property or to a storm drainage system of the Township. However, a direct
connection of roof drains to watercourses and storm drainage systems is
prohibited unless approved by the Township Engineer. Discharge from roof drains
over a sidewalk, into a driveway, over a parking area or into gutters will not
be permitted.
            [2]   Compliance with groundwater recharge requirements requires
that roof runoff generated by the groundwater recharge design storm be
infiltrated on-site. Infiltration can be achieved locally (e.g., dry wells,
french drain) or in conjunction with other on site BMP's (e.g., infiltration
trench, bioretention area, porous pavement sand filter).
            [3]   Where conditions are not suitable for groundwater recharge,
roof drains are required to discharge onto a vegetated surface (e.g., lawn,
filter strip, swale, grassed waterway). The minimum length of the flow path
between the drain outlet and the point of discharge to a watercourse or storm
sewer inlet shall be 20 feet.
            [4]   Unsuitable groundwater recharge conditions must be documented
to the satisfaction of the Township Engineer.
            [5]   Roof runoff discharge points shall be no closer than 20 feet
to an adjoining property.
         (d)   Water originating from other than natural sources, such as air-
conditioning units, sump pumps or other dry weather flow, wherever practicable,
shall be discharged to infiltration areas or negative BMPs at the direction of
the Township Engineer. Discharge from sump pumps shall be no closer than 20
feet to an adjoining property.
         (e)   Water from swimming pools or similar uses containing chlorine
shall be pretreated to remove chlorine to acceptable limits prior to discharge.
   J.   A horizontal riparian corridor buffer area shall be established between
the top of bank or high water mark of a water body and a line one foot above
the one-hundred-year base flood elevation or from the top of bank or high water
mark of a water body and a line 50 feet from the top of bank or high water mark
of the water body, whichever distance is greater. The riparian corridor may be
part of any lot to meet minimum lot area and minimum yard requirements. No
building or structure of any kind or any work, such as earth disturbance or
excavation, shall be permitted within the riparian corridor except as permitted
within the Floodplain Conservation District under
chapter 255, Article XXII, Floodplain Conservation District.
   K.   Where applicable, construction of stormwater management facilities
shall comply with the requirements of chapter 102 (Erosion Control), chapter
105 (Dam Safety and Waterway Management) and chapter 106 (Flood Plain
Management) of Title 25, Pa Code, Rules and Regulations of DEP. Inquiries
regarding dam safety permit requirements or other concerns shall be addressed
to DEP. Copies of any correspondence to and from DEP must be provided to the
Township.
   L.   Stormwater management facilities which are located in, adjacent to or
that will discharge to a state highway right-of-way shall be subject to the
approval of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT). Copies of
any correspondence to and from PennDOT must be provided to the Township.
   M.   Stormwater management facilities located within or affecting any
floodplain shall be subject to the requirements of applicable DEP codes and the
Township Code which regulates construction and development within areas which
are subject to flooding. See
Chapter 255, Zoning, Article XXII, Floodplain Conservation District.
   N.   A permanent access easement to stormwater management facilities for
maintenance purposes shall be granted to the Township for maintenance and
operation of the facilities. Accessways shall be cleared and stabilized to a
minimum of 20 feet wide, with an all-weather surface suitable for access for
maintenance equipment and personnel. Proximity of facilities to public rights-
of-way shall be encouraged in order to minimize the length of accessways.
Multiple accessways shall be encouraged for major or regional facilities. The
owner of the servient property shall be responsible for maintenance of the
easement. A deed restriction to the satisfaction of the Township Solicitor
shall be submitted to provide for maintenance, to authorize the Township to
take corrective maintenance measures if necessary and to lien the cost of the
work against the property should corrective measures not be performed by the
homeowner, association or entity owning the property.
0. Additional studies and higher levels of control than the minimum provided in
the requirements and criteria of this chapter may be required by the Board of
Commissioners to ensure adequate protection of life and property and
preservation of water quality.
   P.   A drainage release or easement, in a form approved by the Township
Solicitor, may be required by the Township for discharges to adjoining
properties and watercourses.
   Q.   Landowners shall comply with any future requirements promulgated by the
Township in order to conform with any local, county, state or federal watershed
management plans adopted in the future.
§ 206-32.   Permit requirements by other government entities.
The following permit requirements may apply to certain activities and must be
met prior to commencement of earth disturbance activities, construction or
modifications as applicable:
   A.   All earth disturbance activities subject to permit requirements by DEP
under regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102.
   B.   Work within natural drainageways subject to permit by DEP under 25 Pa.
Code Chapter 105.
   C.   Any stormwater management facility that would be located in or adjacent
to surface waters of the commonwealth, including wetlands, subject to permit by
DEP under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105.
   D.   Any stormwater management facility that would be located on a state
highway right-of-way, or that would require access from a state highway, shall
be subject to approval by PennDOT.
   E.   Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must pass
or convey flows from the tributary area and any facility which may constitute a
dam subject to permit by DEP under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105.
§ 206-33.   Erosion and sediment control during regulated activities.
   A.   No regulated activities within the Township shall commence until the
Township approves an erosion and sediment control plan for construction
activities and a permit is issued.
   B.   DEP has regulations that require an erosion and sediment control plan
for any earth disturbance activity of 5,000 square feet or more, under 25 Pa.
Code § 102.4(b).
   C.   In addition, under 25 Pa. Code chapter 92, a DEP NPDES construction
activities permit is required for regulated earth disturbance activities on
sites one acre or greater in area.
   D.   Evidence of any and all necessary permit(s) for regulated earth
disturbance activities from DEP or the County Conservation District must be
provided to the Township prior to final approval or commencement of earthmoving
activities.
   E.   A copy of the approved erosion and sediment control plan and narrative,
and any required permit, as required by DEP regulations, shall be available at
the project site at all times.
§ 206-34.   Water quality requirements after regulated activities are complete.
   A.   No regulated activities within the Township shall commence until the
Township approves a plan which demonstrates compliance with state water quality
requirements after construction is complete.
   B.   BMPs must be designed, implemented and maintained to meet state water
quality requirements and any other more stringent requirements as published by
the Township.
   C.   To control postconstruction stormwater impacts from regulated
activities, state water quality requirements can be met by BMPs, including site
design, which provide for replication of preconstruction stormwater
infiltration and runoff conditions, so that postconstruction stormwater
discharges do not degrade the physical, chemical or biological characteristics
of the receiving waters. As described in the DEP Comprehensive Stormwater
Management Policy (No. 392-0300-002, September 28, 2002), this shall be
achieved by the following:
      (1)   Infiltration: replication of preconstruction stormwater
infiltration quantities.
      (2)   Treatment: use of water quality treatment BMPs to ensure filtering
out of the chemical and physical pollutants from the stormwater runoff.
      (3)   Streambank and streambed protection: management of volume and rate
of postconstruction stormwater discharges to prevent physical degradation of
receiving waters (e.g., from scouring).
   D.   DEP has regulations that require municipalities to ensure design,
implementation and maintenance of BMPs that control runoff from new development
and redevelopment after regulated earth disturbance activities are complete.
These requirements include the need to implement postconstruction stormwater
BMPs with assurance of long-term operations and maintenance of those BMPs.
   E.   Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for earth disturbance activities
must be provided to the Township.
   F.   BMP operations and maintenance requirements are described in Article IV
of this chapter.
§ 206-35.   Water quality requirement.
   A.   One of the major objectives of this chapter is to maintain and, if
possible, improve existing water quality by preventing discharge of stormwater
runoff pollutants. In considering issues such as ease of implementation and
cost-effectiveness, the following minimum water quality criteria are
established to meet the objective of this chapter.
   B.   Stormwater detention facilities shall include provisions to detain, for
extended periods of time, runoff from the water quality design storm (one-year,
twenty-four-hour rainfall event), using methodology appropriate for the
drainage area under consideration and approved by the Township Engineer.
   C.   Release of detained stormwater can begin at the start of the storm
(i.e., the stormwater detention facility will not permanently retain a portion
of the runoff). The design of the facility shall consider and minimize the
chances of clogging and sedimentation potential.
   D.   When detention basins are used to satisfy the water quality
requirement, the invert of the water quality orifice may be placed at the
invert of the basin. Because the standard for water quality may result in a
fairly small outlet orifice in detention basins, the Township Engineer will
determine the minimum standard diameter orifice as part of the stormwater
management plan review. In soils nonconducive to infiltration, the addition of
an underdrain is required, although this requirement can be waived upon
determination by the Township Engineer that conditions warrant such a waiver.
   E.   All stormwater management facilities must implement the water quality
requirement of this section. The water quality objective can be obtained
through a variety of approved BMP's or combinations thereof, including
retention basins, detention basins and bioretention areas.
   F.   Below-grade detention facilities may not be used to satisfy the water
quality requirement. Examples include below-grade infiltration beds or
galleries and below-grade detention chambers. In these instances, approved
water quality BMP's which supplement the below-grade stormwater detention
facilities shall be installed. Examples include water quality inlets (including
oil/water separators), filter strips and sand filters. All such water quality
BMP's must be designed to treat runoff derived from the water quality design
storm (one-year, twenty-four-hour rainfall event).
   G.   Unless derived from roofs associated with known or suspected
contamination, roof runoff is exempt from the water quality requirement.
However, this exemption applies only to roof runoff before it is combined with
runoff from other sources.
   H.   Commercial and industrial properties and establishments must
demonstrate compliance with the NPDES (40 CFR, Chapter 1, Part 122), as
administered by DEP. Copies of stormwater pollution prevention plans (SWPPP)
and monitoring reports shall be provided to the Township.
§ 206-36.   Groundwater recharge requirement
   A.   BMP's shall be provided to retain all runoff generated by the
groundwater recharge design storm (seventy-five-hundredths-inch, twenty-four-
hour rainfall event) for infiltration.
   B.   BMP's shall be designed to infiltrate retained runoff within a forty-
eight-hour period. Infiltration rates shall be based on field measurements
using a method approved by the Township Engineer. Tests shall be conducted at
the proposed depth of the bottom of the infiltration device. A factor of safety
of 3, or greater. shall be used when computing infiltration potential of a BNP
from field measurements of infiltration rate.
   C.   Compliance by lot owners; exceptions.
      (1)   Lot owners must comply, individually, with the groundwater recharge
requirement. However, groundwater recharge BMP's will not be required on
properties where:
         (a)   Average slopes for the property exceed 10%.
         (b)   Seasonal high water table is shallower than four feet below
final grade.
         (c)   Soil or bedrock conditions will not permit efficient percolation
(nominal infiltration rate of less than 0.2 inches/hour).
         (d)   Site configuration will require that runoff must be infiltrated
within:
            [1]   One hundred feet of a known or suspected sinkhole.
            [2]   Fifty feet of a water supply well.
            [3]   Fifty feet of a perennial stream.
            [4]   Twenty feet of a basement wall.
            [5]   Fifty feet of a septic system.
      (2)   The groundwater recharge objective can be obtained through a
variety of approved BMP's or combinations thereof, including bioretention
areas, dry wells, french drains, infiltration trenches, porous pavement and
some types of sand filters. Community (multilot) groundwater recharge BMP's may
be approved by the Township Engineer. However, the total upgradient drainage
areas served by any groundwater recharge BMP may not exceed five acres.
   D.   The storage volume of detention basins or retention basins may not be
used to satisfy the required retention volume for groundwater recharge.
   E.   Potentially contaminated runoff may not be infiltrated without
appropriate pretreatment. The Township Engineer will determine whether
contaminated runoff can be satisfactorily treated to permit infiltration. Sites
which generate contaminated runoff must segregate uncontaminated runoff (e.g.,
roof runoff). Measures shall be introduced to infiltrate uncontaminated runoff
generated by a property during the groundwater recharge design storm (e.g.,
roof runoff).
   F.   Above-grade groundwater recharge BMP's which incorporate biofiltration
are required for the infiltration of untreated runoff from public, commercial
or industrial parking lots. Runoff from private or institutional parking lots
may utilize below-grade devices (e.g., infiltration trenches, porous pavement).
   G.   Direct runoff from public roads is exempt from the groundwater recharge
requirement. However, privately owned and maintained roads must comply with
this requirement.
   H.   Procedures used to predict runoff must use standard and accepted
calculation methodology and be satisfactory to the Township Engineer.
   I.   Groundwater recharge BMP's shall be designed to provide storage equal
to 100% of the required retention volume.
§ 206-37.   Stormwater design standards and criteria.
   A.   The design and construction requirements for stormwater management and
stormwater conveyance systems, described in Article VI of this chapter, are
hereby established as indicated in said article.
   B.   Runoff control measures or BMPs.
      (1)   Any selected BMP must meet the required water quality and runoff
peak rate requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   Developers shall consider the use of innovative BMP's (e.g.,
infiltration techniques, wet ponds, riparian buffers, bioretention areas,
underground detention, seepage beds, artificial wetlands), if appropriate, to
provide for water quality improvement and groundwater recharge. Guidelines for
the selection and design of a wide variety of BMP's are available in the
Pennsylvania Handbook of Best Management Practices for Developing Areas
(Pennsylvania Association of Conservation Districts, 1998) and its successor
document or documents when available Other design guides, approved by the
Township, may also be used in preparing stormwater management plans. In
selecting the appropriate BMP's or combinations thereof, the following must be
considered:
         (a)   Contributing drainage area served by the BMP.
         (b)   Hydraulic conductivity of soils and bedrock.
         (c)   Depth to seasonal high water table and bedrock.
         (d)   Erodibility of soils.
         (e)   Land availability and topographic constraints.
         (f)   Existing natural resources which require conservation or
enhancement.
         (g)   Other factors as may be identified by the Township Engineer,
MCCD, DEP, EPA or other state and federal agencies.
      (3)   Exemptions.
         (a)   Any regulated activity specified in Article IV which meets the
stormwater management plan exemption criteria is exempt from meeting the water
quality requirements of §
206-35. This exemption shall apply to the total proposed development even if
development is to take place in stages. Exemption shall not relieve the
applicant from providing adequate stormwater management to meet the purpose of
this chapter. Nevertheless, the following control techniques are encouraged
where appropriate:
            [1]   Small on-site bioretention areas, providing detention
storage, with grassed overflow.
            [2]   Oversized storm sewers with flow constrictions (reduced
orifice) at discharge.
            [3]   Stream channel preservation and protection of vegetation;
energy reduction spillways.
            [4]   Reduction of maintained landscaped areas.
            [5]   Preservation of existing vegetation, especially native
plantings and woodland.
            [6]   Planting of wetland species along drainage swales and
depressions.
            [7]   Fertilization practices minimized/eliminated.
            [8]   Site design criteria which prevent significant alteration of
existing topography.
            [9]   Sites that have suitable soils are encouraged to incorporate
on-site infiltration methods, such as grassed waterways, shrub filter strips,
and french drains and trenches, into the design of the development.
         (b)   All sites with suitable conditions must comply with the
groundwater recharge requirement. The groundwater recharge requirement may be
satisfied using a variety of BMP's.
      (4)   Subregional (combined site) storage.
         (a)   Traditionally, the approach to stormwater management has been to
control the runoff on an individual site basis. However, there is a growing
commitment to finding cost-effective comprehensive control techniques which
both preserve and protect the natural drainage system. In other words, two
developers developing sites adjacent to each other could pool their capital
resources to provide for a community stormwater management facility in the most
hydrologically advantageous location or locations,
         (b)   The goal is the development and use of the most cost effective
and environmentally sensitive stormwater runoff controls which significantly
improve the capability and flexibility of land developers and communities to
control runoff.
         (c)   An advantage to combining efforts is to increase the opportunity
to utilize stormwater management facilities to meet other community needs and
safety considerations. For example, certain stormwater management facilities
could be designed so that recreational facilities, such as ball fields, open
space, sand volleyball courts, etc., could be incorporated. Natural or
artificial ponds and lakes could serve both recreational and stormwater
management objectives.
         (d)   To take this concept a step further, there is also the
possibility that the stormwater could be managed off site; that is, in a
location off the property(s) in question. There could be a regional detention,
retention, lake, pond or other physical facilities to serve multiple
developments. Any such facility shall have a construction, ownership and
maintenance program, in a recordable form.
      (5)   All stormwater management facility designs shall conform to the
applicable standards and specifications of the following governmental and
institutional agencies:
         (a)   American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM).
         (b)   Asphalt Institute (Al).
         (c)   Montgomery County Conservation District. (MCCD).
         (d)   Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).
         (e)   National Crushed Stone Association (NCSA).
         (f)   National Sand and Gravel Association (NSGA).
         (g)   Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).
         (h)   Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT).
         (i)   United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources
Conservation Service, Pennsylvania (USDA, NRCS, PA)
         (j)   Montgomery County Planning Commission. (MCPC).
         (k)   Environmental Protection Agency. (EPA).
         (l)   Federal Emergency Management Agency. (FEMA).
         (m)   U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE).
      (6)   If special geological hazards or soil conditions, such as carbonate
derived soils, are identified on the site, the developer's engineer and
geologist shall consider the affect of proposed stormwater management measures
on these conditions. In such cases, the Township may require an in-depth report
by a competent registered professional engineer and/or geologist.

landowner as a performance guaranty for stormwater management facilities in
accordance with improvement guaranty provisions outlined in § 509 of the
Municipalities Planning Code or any amendment thereto.
   B.   Maintenance responsibility and guaranties.
      (1)   The maintenance responsibilities for permanent stormwater
management facilities shall be determined based upon the type of ownership of
the property that is occupied by the facilities.
         (a)   Single entity ownership. Where the permanent stormwater
management facilities designed to manage runoff from property in a single
entity ownership, the maintenance responsibility for the stormwater management
facilities shall be with the single entity owner. The stated responsibilities
of the entity related to owning and maintaining the facilities shall be
submitted with the stormwater management operations and maintenance plan for
determination of their adequacy. Approval of the stormwater management plan
shall depend upon the approval of these terms. These terms shall be in writing,
shall be in recordable form and shall, in addition to any other terms deemed
necessary by the Board of Commissioners, contain a provision permitting
inspection at any reasonable time by the Township Engineer or other Township
officials of all such facilities deemed critical to the public welfare
consistent with current Township practices.
         (b)   Municipal ownership. Where the Board of Commissioners has
accepted an offer of dedication of the permanent stormwater management
facilities, the Township shall be responsible for maintenance. Upon approval of
the stormwater management facilities by the Board of Commissioners, the
developer shall provide a financial security, in a form approved by the
Township Solicitor for maintenance guaranties, as follows:
            [1]   Construction maintenance bond. The Board of Commissioners may
require the posting of a maintenance bond to secure the structural integrity
and functioning of said facilities, in accordance with the design and
specifications as depicted on the approved stormwater management plan for a
term not to exceed 18 months from the date of acceptance of dedication. Said
financial security shall be the same type as required in accordance with the
improvement guaranty provisions in the Municipalities Planning Code or any
amendment thereto, and the amount of the financial security shall not exceed
10% of the actual cost of installation of said facilities. A cash contribution
can be used as the financial security in lieu of a maintenance bond, although
the contribution must be equivalent to the amount that would be estimated for
the maintenance bond.
            [2]   Operation and Maintenance Fund. Long-term maintenance shall
be secured through a payment to the Township stormwater management operation
and maintenance fund in an amount equal to the present worth of maintenance of
the facilities for a ten-year period. This amount shall be determined by the
Township Engineer.
            [3]   Documentation.
               [a]   The terms of the maintenance guaranties shall be
documented as part of the stormwater management plan.
               [b]   For certain types of facilities, the Board of
Commissioners may benefit by transferring the maintenance responsibility to an
individual or group of individuals residing within the controlled area. These
individuals may have the permanent stormwater management facilities adjacent to
their lots or otherwise have an interest in the proper maintenance of the
facilities. In these instances, the Board of Commissioners and the individual
(s) may enter into a formal agreement for the maintenance of the facilities
whereby the Township shall maintain ownership of the facilities and be
responsible for periodic inspections.
               [c]   Individual lot ownership. Where any stormwater management
facility is located on an individual lot, and maintenance thereof is the
responsibility of that landowner, a description of the facility or systems and
the terms of the required maintenance shall be noted on the record plan and
incorporated as a part of the deed to the property. The deed shall be recorded
with the Montgomery County Office for the Recording of Deeds within 90 days
following the Board of Commissioners approval. In addition, the Board of
Commissioners may require as a condition of approval that a deed conveying any
interest in such lot contain language indicating that the conveyance is subject
to an express covenant by the grantee that the grantee will maintain the
stormwater management facility.
               [d]   Multientity ownership. In cases where property is in
multiple ownership (i e , many individual interests in various portions of the
property on which stormwater facilities are located), the developer(s) shall
enter into an agreement with the Township to determine the maintenance of the
permanent stormwater facilities. If maintenance is prescribed for each
individual lot owner, the requirements above for single-entity ownership shall
apply.
      (2)   The failure of any person, individual lot owner or private entity
to properly maintain any stormwater management facility shall be construed to
be a violation of this chapter and is declared to be a public nuisance, subject
to penalties as set forth in this chapter.
   C.   Liability insurance. If, in the opinion of the Board of Commissioners
based upon a recommendation from the Township Engineer, the nature of the work
is such that it may create a hazard to human life or endanger adjoining
property or streets, the Board of Commissioners shall, before issuing the
stormwater management permit, require that the applicant file a certificate of
insurance showing that there exists insurance against claims for damages for
personal injury, bodily injury and property damage, including damage to the
Township by surface water flow which has been altered on the site. The
liability insurance shall be to the amount prescribed by the Board of
Commissioners in accordance with the nature of risks involved and include the
Township of Upper Dublin as an additional insured. Such insurance shall be
written by a company licensed to do business in the commonwealth. Neither
issuance of the stormwater management permit nor compliance with the provisions
hereto or any conditions imposed by the Township shall relieve any person from
any responsibility for damage otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability
upon the Township or its officers and employees for damages to persons or
property.

Design Schedules
§ 206-101.   Schedule I: General Performance Standards.
All erosion and sedimentation controls are to be in place prior to the start of
construction. Measures used to collect and convey stormwater on any site shall
be designed to meet the following minimum performance standards:
   A.   Prevent erosion damage and satisfactorily convey and control the rate
and volume of discharge of stormwater to waters of the commonwealth.
   B.   When soil conditions are suitable, require runoff control measures to
infiltrate the stormwater into the ground to aid in the recharge of
groundwaters and the preservation of baseflow.
   C.   Control/accommodate not only the anticipated peak discharge from the
on-site disturbed area, but also the existing runoff being contributed from all
land at a higher elevation in the same watershed.
   D.   Maintain the adequacy of the natural stream channels. Accelerated bank
erosion shall be prevented by controlling the rate and velocity of runoff
discharged to these watercourses so as to avoid increasing the occurrence of
streambank overflow.
   E.   Preserve the adequacy of existing culverts and bridges by suppressing
the new flood peaks created by the new earth disturbances and new increased
imperiousness.
   F.   If, in the course of preparing or reviewing the stormwater management
plan, the Township Engineer determines that off-site improvements are necessary
to satisfactorily control the stormwater from the site, the applicant shall be
responsible for such off-site improvements.
   G.   All stormwater detention and retention facilities shall be in place and
functioning prior to the creation of any impervious surface.
   H.   Whenever a watercourse, stream or intermittent stream is located within
a grading site, it shall remain open in its natural state and location and
shall not be piped unless permitted by DEW and the Township Board of
Commissioners. See Upper Dublin
chapter 240 for activity in and near a watercourse,
   I.   The existing points of natural drainage discharge from and onto
adjacent properties shall not be altered without the written approval of and a
drainage easement from the affected upstream and downstream landowners.
   J.   No stormwater runoff or natural drainage shall be so diverted as to
overload existing drainage systems or create flooding or the need for
additional drainage structures on other private properties or public lands.
§ 206-102.   Schedule II: Detention Facility Design.
   A.   Stormwater detention facilities. Stormwater detention facilities
include all structural measures which can reliably and predictably achieve the
peak discharge requirements of this chapter. Stormwater detention facilities
include, but are not necessarily limited to, detention basins, retention
basins, bioretention areas, open (at-grade) sand filters, closed (below-grade)
sand filters, water quality inlets, dry wells, below-grade detention chambers
and rooftop detention.
   B.   Peak discharge design storms. The design storm criteria to be used in
calculations for the watershed is to limit the post-development runoff for the
one-, two-, ten-, fifty- and one-hundred-year storms to the corresponding
predevelopment rates. Any stormwater detention facilities required by this
chapter and subject to the water quality requirements and stormwater runoff
peak rate requirements herein shall meet the applicable water quality and peak
rate requirement for the one-, two-, ten-, fifty- and one-hundred-year return
period runoff events (design storms) consistent with the standard and accepted
calculation methodology and engineering standards and be satisfactory to the
Township Engineer.
   C.   Runoff calculation methodology.
      (1)   Any stormwater runoff calculation involving drainage areas greater
than 20 acres, including on- and off site areas, shall use a generally accepted
calculation technique that is based on the NRCS soil cover complex method. It
is assumed that all methods will be selected by the design professional based
on the individual limitations and suitability of each method for a particular
site.
      (2)   All calculations consistent with this chapter using the soil cover
complex method shall use the appropriate design rainfall depths for the various
return periods cited.
      (3)   For purposes of predevelopment flow rate determination, undeveloped
land shall be considered as meadow, in good condition, unless the natural
ground cover generates a lower curve number or Rational C value. Landowner is
to use the lower runoff coefficient value.
      (4)   All calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall
intensities consistent with appropriate times of concentration for overland
flow and return periods from NCRS Methodology. Time of concentration for sheet
flow (maximum 150 feet) and concentrated flow shall both be calculated using
NRCS methodology. Times of concentration for channel and pipe flow shall be
computed using Manning's Equation or NCRS Methodology.
      (5)   The design of any stormwater detention facilities intended to meet
the performance standards of this chapter shall be verified by routing the
design storm hydrograph through these facilities using accepted methods of
practice. The Township Engineer may approve the use of any generally accepted
reservoir routing technique which shall use a total runoff volume that is
consistent with the volume from a method that produces a full hydrograph. The
computer routing program used must take into account the tailwater effect of
the discharge pipe on the outlet design as well as the submergence of the
discharge pipe outlet.
      (6)   Outlet structures for stormwater management facilities shall be
designed to meet the performance standards of this chapter using any generally
accepted hydraulic analysis technique or method approved by the Township
Engineer.
   D.   Stormwater detention and retention facilities, Stormwater detention and
retention facilities shall meet the following minimum design/construction
standards:
      (1)   Detention basins shall be designed to allow regular maintenance,
mowing and periodic silt removal and reseeding. Shallow broad basins are
preferred to steep sided basins.
      (2)   The maximum slope of the basin embankment shall be 3 to 1. Whenever
possible, the side slope and basin shape shall conform to the natural
topography.
      (3)   Unless approved as a conditional use, detention basins shall not be
located within riparian corridors, floodplains nor within areas of floodplain
or alluvial soils.
      (4)   Detention basins shall be designed so they return to normal
conditions within approximately 24 hours after termination of the storm, unless
the Township Engineer finds that downstream conditions may warrant other design
criteria for stormwater release.
      (5)   If retention basins are used, the applicant shall demonstrate that
such ponds are designed to protect public health, safety and welfare.
      (6)   Fences may be required for any detention or retention basins where
there is a permanent water surface or conditions warrant.
      (7)   The minimum top width of a basin berm shall be 10 feet. A cut-off
trench (keyway) of relative impervious material shall be provided beneath all
embankments requiring fill material. The keyway shall be a minimum 8 feet wide,
minimum three feet deep and have 1 to 1 side slopes.
      (8)   Unless designed to be a naturalized basin, in order to ensure
proper drainage on a basin bottom, a minimum grade of 2% shall be maintained
for sheet flow. If deemed necessary by the Township Engineer, an underdrain
shall be placed in the basin floor to help dry the basin.
      (9)   All basin embankments shall be placed in eight-inch maximum lifts
to a minimum dry density of 95%. Prior to proceeding to the next lift,
compaction shall be checked by the Township Engineer or an approved soils
engineer who shall provide the Township Engineer with a written report.
Compaction tests shall be performed using the modified proctor method in
accordance with ASTM D-1557. Compaction tests shall be run on the leading and
trailing edge as well as the top of the berm.
      (10)   Emergency overflow facilities shall be provided for facilities to
accommodate runoff in excess of design flows. Emergency spillways for basins
shall be constructed on undisturbed ground. If the emergency spillway is
constructed on filled ground, the emergency spillways shall be constructed of
concrete payers, gabions or other similar materials approved by the Township
Engineer. All emergency spillways shall be constructed so that the detention
basin berm is protected against downstream embankment erosion if the basin berm
is overtopped. The minimum capacity of the emergency spillways shall be the
peak flow rate of the one-hundred-year design storm after development. The
construction material of the emergency spillway shall extend along the upstream
and downstream berm embankment slopes. The upstream edge of the emergency
spillway shall be a minimum of three feet below the spillway crest elevation.
The downstream slope of the spillway shall, as a minimum, extend to the toe of
the berm embankment. The emergency spillway shall not discharge over earthen
fill or easily erodible material.
      (11)   The minimum freeboard shall be one foot as measured from the top
of the post-development one-hundred-year flood elevation over the spillway and
the top of the berm.
      (12)   Antiseep collars shall be installed around the pipe barrel within
the normal saturation zone of the detention basin berms. The antiseep collars
and their connections to the pipe bands shall be watertight. The antiseep
collars shall extend a minimum of two feet beyond the outside of the principle
pipe barrel. The maximum spacing between collars shall be 14 times the minimum
projection of the collar measured perpendicular to the pipe. A minimum of two
antiseep collars shall be installed on each outlet pipe.
      (13)   All outlet pipes through a basin berm shall be reinforced concrete
pipe, designed to withstand the loading caused by a fully saturated berm and
shall have watertight joints using 0-ring joint pipe. Outlet pipes shall be
backfilled with material similar to the core material (semi-impervious).
      (14)   The invert of the inlet pipe(s) into a basin shall be above the
basin floor or lining so that it can adequately drain after rainstorms. Inlet
pipe(s) shall discharge to areas of the basin that slope toward the outlet
structure, having the minimum slope as prescribed in Subsection D(8) above.
      (15)   Energy dissipaters and/or level spreaders shall be installed at
points where pipes or drainageways drain to or from the basin. Energy
dissipaters shall comply with criteria in Hydraulic Engineering Circular No. 15
- Design of Stable Channels with Flexible Linings, published by the Federal
Highway Administration of the United States Department of Transportation or the
Engineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices, NCRS energy dissipating
device calculations shall be submitted for township review and approval.
      (16)   Inlet and outlet structures shall be located at a maximum distance
from one another in order to promote water quality benefits. The Township
Engineer may require a rock filter or rock-filled gabion for entrapping
sediments carried in stormwater if sufficient separation of inlet and outlet
structures cannot be achieved. The use of forebays as a sediment removal
feature is encouraged for all basins.
      (17)   A perforated riser or similar sediment control device shall be
provided at each outlet of all detention basins during construction for
sediment control. The riser shall be constructed of metal or concrete. The
riser shall extend to a maximum elevation of two feet below the crest elevation
of the emergency spillway. The perforated riser shall be designed so that the
rate of outflow is controlled by the pipe barrel through the basin berm when
the depth of water within the basin exceeds the height of the riser. Circular
perforations with a maximum diameter of one inch shall be spaced 12 inches
vertically. The horizontal spacing shall be in accordance to DEP Soil Erosion
and Sedimentation Control Manual Specifications. The perforations shall be
cleanly cut and shall not be susceptible to enlargement. All metal risers shall
be suitably coated to prevent corrosion. A trash rack or similar appurtenance
shall be provided to prevent debris from entering the pipe. All risers shall
have a concrete base attached with a watertight connection. The base shall be
of sufficient weight to prevent flotation of the riser. An antivortex device
consisting of a thin vertical plate normal to the base and berm shall be
provided at the top of the riser. Unless this structure is part of the
permanent outlet control, it shall be removed from the site when it has been
adequately stabilized as determined by the Township Engineer.
      (18)   All drainage channels shall be designed to prevent erosion of the
bed and banks. The maximum permissible flow velocity shall not exceed the
design requirements outlined in the current Soil Erosion and Sedimentation
Control Manual, published by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection. Suitable stabilization shall be provided where required to prevent
erosion of the drainage channels. The design procedure used shall be that
contained in the current Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Program Manual,
published by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.
      (19)   Any vegetated drainage channel requiring mowing of the vegetation
shall have a maximum grade of three horizontal to one vertical on those areas
to be mowed.
      (20)   Because of the critical nature of vegetated drainage channels, the
design of all vegetated channels shall, as a minimum, conform to the design
requirements outlined in the current Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control
Program Manual, published by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection.
§ 206-103.   Schedule 111: Stormwater Conveyance System.
   A.   General.
      (1)   Storm sewers, culverts, bridges and related installations shall be

govern the spacing of inlets.
      (3)   If the capacity of the shoulder, swale, curb section or depressed
median section is less than the inlet capacities, then the shoulder, swale,
curb section or depressed section capacity shall govern the spacing of inlets.
§ 206-104.   Schedule IV: Water Quality and Groundwater Recharge Stormwater
Management Facilities.
   A.   Development, which increases runoff, poses a significant threat to the
environmental resources of Pennsylvania's groundwater, streams and wetlands.
Therefore, attention is being turned to methods of increasing infiltration and
groundwater recharge to offset the loss of infiltration and increased runoff
due to development.
   B.   All stormwater management facilities shall be designed to satisfy the
following requirements.
      (1)   All facilities shall be provided with the capability to withstand
the discharge associated with the one-hundred-year return rainfall event,
without failing or resulting in damage to downstream areas. Some nondetention
facilities may be designed to bypass stormwater discharges which are in excess
of the appropriate design storm. In this case, conveyance must be provided to
transport the one-hundred-year surcharge flow to a downstream facility, natural
watercourse or storm drainage system inlet.
      (2)   All groundwater recharge devices shall be protected from
sedimentation. Areas designated for recharge shall not receive runoff until the
contributory drainage areas have achieved final stabilization.
      (3)   Groundwater recharge requirement. The recommended criterion for
addressing groundwater recharge is to maintain the annual volume of total
runoff at predevelopment levels. This approach is implemented by requiring that
a minimum retention volume be completely infiltrated on the site during every
storm. The retention volume for Upper Dublin Township is 0.75 inches.
Therefore, all rainfall events of less than 0.75 inches of rainfall should be
completely retained on the site and infiltrated. If an analysis shows that
runoff from the site will be negligible during this event, then the groundwater
recharge requirement is satisfied. Controlling runoff from the groundwater
recharge design storm is the only requirement for preserving the overall water
budget for the watershed.
   C.   For design of BMPs, refer to the Pennsylvania Handbook of Best
Management Practices for Developing Areas, or its successor document.

ARTICLE XI
Low-Impact Development Practices For Managing Stormwater Runoff
§ 206-111.   General guidelines for low-impact development.
   A.   Natural hydrologic conditions may be altered unnecessarily by poorly
planned development practices, such as introducing unneeded impervious
surfaces, destroying existing drainage swales, constructing unnecessary storm
sewers and changing local topography. A traditional approach has been to remove
runoff from a site as quickly as possible and capture it in a detention basin.
This leads ultimately to the degradation of water quality as well as
expenditure of additional resources for detaining and managing concentrated
runoff at some downstream location.
   B.   Developers shall use design practices that minimize postdevelopment
runoff rates and volumes, which minimize artificial conveyance and storage
facilities and which simulate predevelopment hydrologic conditions. Forced
infiltration is often necessary to offset the loss of infiltration by creation
of impervious surfaces.
   C.   Preserving natural hydrologic conditions requires careful alternative
site design practices that include preserving natural drainage features,
minimizing impervious surface area, reducing the hydraulic connectivity of
impervious surfaces, and protecting natural depression storage.
   D.   A careful consideration of the existing topography and implementation
of a combination of the above-mentioned techniques mentioned in this section
may avoid construction of costly stormwater management facilities. Other
benefits include reduced potential of downstream flooding, water quality
degradation of receiving streams/water bodies and enhancement of aesthetics and
reduction of development costs. Beneficial results include more stable
baseflows in receiving streams, improved groundwater recharge, reduced flood
flows, reduced pollutant loads and reduced costs for conveyance and storage.
§ 206-112.   Protecting natural drainage features and depression storage areas.
   A.   Natural drainage features, particularly vegetated drainage swales and
channels, shall be protected because of their ability to infiltrate and
attenuate flows and to filter pollutants. Runoff and pollutants generated from
impervious surfaces shall not flow directly into storm sewers with no
opportunity for attenuation, infiltration or filtration. Developments shall be
designed to fit site topography and minimize the amount of grading on site.
   B.   Depressional storage areas have no surface outlet or drain very slowly
following a storm event. They can be commonly seen as ponded areas in farm
fields during the wet season or after large runoff events. The volume and
release-rate characteristics of depressions should be protected in the design
of the development site. The depressions shall be protected by simply avoiding
the depression or by incorporating its storage as additional capacity in
required detention facilities.
§ 206-113.   Avoiding introduction of impervious areas.
Site planning shall consider reducing impervious coverage to the maximum extent
possible. Building footprints, sidewalks, driveways and other features
producing impervious surfaces shall be evaluated to minimize impacts on runoff.
Porous pavement and open graded pavers are two alternate methods.
§ 206-114.   Reducing the hydraulic connectivity of impervious surfaces.
Impervious surfaces shall not be directly connected to an impervious conveyance
system (such as storm sewer). Roof runoff shall be directed over lawns and
infiltrated where appropriate, and the use of storm sewers shall be minimized.
Site grading shall promote increasing travel time of stormwater runoff and
shall reduce concentration of runoff to a single point in the development.
§ 206-115.   Routing roof runoff over lawns.
Roof runoff shall be routed over lawns. Direct connections of downspouts to
storm sewers or parking lots is discouraged. The practice also discourages
sloping driveways, and parking lots shall be minimized. Driveways shall be
crowned direct to run off to lawn areas.
§ 206-116.   Reducing the use of storm sewers.
The use of storm sewers for draining streets, parking lots and backyards shall
be minimized to reduce the potential for accelerating runoff from the
development.
§ 206-117.   Reducing street widths.
Street widths may be reduced by either eliminating on-street parking or by
reducing roadway or cartway widths. Developers who desire to reduce street
widths should consult with the Township Engineer prior to application for
subdivision/land development approval regarding any waivers or deviations from
the requirements of
chapter 212 that may be needed for reduced street widths.
§ 206-118.   Limiting sidewalks to one side of the street.
A sidewalk on one side of the street may be considered in low-traffic
neighborhoods. The deleted sidewalk may be replaced with bicycle/recreational
trails that follow back-of-lot lines. Where appropriate, backyard trails should
be constructed using pervious materials. Developers who desire to reduce
sidewalks should consult with the Township Engineer prior to application for
subdivision/land development approval regarding any waivers or deviations from
the requirements of
chapter 212 that the Board of Commissioners may need to grant for limited
sidewalks.
§ 206-119.   Using permeable paving materials.
These materials include permeable interlocking concrete paving blocks or porous
bituminous concrete. Such materials should be considered as alternatives to
conventional pavement surfaces, especially for low-use surfaces such as
driveways, overflow parking lots and emergency access roads.

and industrial districts), the subdivision of the land must provide adequate
service and parking facilities, etc., in keeping with the minimum requirements
of
Chapter 255, Zoning, for each lot and cumulatively for all lots in the
subdivision . No subdivision will be approved in such instances if the
servicing and/or parking facilities, etc., attendant to the existing structure
are deemed inadequate or would be considered to become inadequate with the
development of the now-vacant lands. Any new structures contemplated on the
newly subdivided parcels shall be in conformity with the existing structures in
the immediate vicinity to the extent possible in regards to height , bulk,
building material and architectural character, and the subdivision  plans shall

         (a)   There has been a plan approved by the Board of Commissioners
that provides for minimizing erosion and sedimentation consistent with this
section and an improvement bond or other acceptable securities are deposited
with the Township in the form of an escrow guaranty which will insure
installation and completion of the required improvements ; or
         (b)   There has been a determination by the Township Engineer that a
plan for minimizing erosion and sedimentation is not necessary.
      (4)   Any development which creates a significant change in the
characteristics of the watershed, thus increasing volume and velocity of
surface water runoff, due to the decrease in retention and infiltration of
stormwater shall not be permitted until guaranties are made of improvements
that will reduce the likelihood of erosion , sedimentation , inundation and
water drainage from peak periods of precipitation and provide for controlled
disposal of excess surface water. Such improvements must satisfy the
requirements and regulations of the Pennsylvanian Department of Environmental
Resources.
      (5)   Plans for the control of erosion and to reduce sediment shall meet
the standards and specifications of the Montgomery County Soil and Water
Conservation District. The plans shall be submitted to the Montgomery County
District for its review and comment and shall be approved by the Township
Engineer .

done in such a way that will minimize erosion .
      (2)   Development plans shall preserve salient natural features, keep cut
-fill operations to a minimum and ensure conformity with topography so as to
create the least erosion potential and adequately handle the volume and
velocity of surface water runoff .
      (3)   Wherever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected
and supplemented.
      (4)   The disturbed area and the duration of exposure shall be kept to a
practical minimum.
      (5)   Disturbed soils shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable.
      (6)   Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect

structurally retarded.
      (9)   Sediment in the runoff water shall be trapped until the disturbed
area is stabilized by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps or
similar measures.
   C.   Grading for drainage . In order to provide more suitable sites for
building and other uses , to improve surface drainage and to control erosion ,
the following requirements shall be met: [Amended 9-14-2004 by Ord. No. 1139]
      (1)   All lots , tracts or parcels shall be graded to provide proper
drainage away from buildings and dispose of it without ponding, and all land
within a development shall be graded to drain and dispose of surface water
without ponding, except where approved by the Board .
      (2)   All drainage provisions shall be of such design to adequately
handle the surface runoff and carry it to the nearest stormwater management
facility. Where drainage  swales are used to divert surface waters away from
building , they shall be sodded or planted as required and shall be of such
slope , shape and size as to conform to the requirements of the township.
      (3)   Excavations and fills .
         (a)   Cut and fill  slopes shall not be steeper than 3:1 unless
stabilized by a retaining wall or cribbing, except as approved by the Board
when handled under special conditions. [Amended 6-14-2011 by Ord. No. 11-1240]
         (b)   Adequate provisions shall be made to prevent surface water from
damaging the cut face of excavations or the sloping surfaces of fills .
         (c)   Cuts and fills shall not endanger adjoining property.

         (f)   Fills placed adjacent to watercourses and other water bodies
shall have suitable protection against erosion .
         (g)   Grading will not be done in such a way so as to divert water
onto the property of another landowner without the expressed consent of the
property owner and the Board .
         (h)   During grading operations, necessary measures for dust control
will be exercised.
         (i)   Grading equipment will not be allowed to cross through
watercourse . Provisions will be made for the installation of culverts or

   G.   Preservation and Protection of Existing Trees .
      (1)   All subdivisions and land developments shall be laid out in such a
manner so as to preserve the healthy trees and shrubs on the site , whenever
possible. Special care must be taken to preserve trees over 20 inches in
diameter and trees standing in groves. Special care shall include avoiding
woodland fragmentation, protecting native species, and removing invasive plant
species. The Township may refuse approval of any plan showing the unnecessary
destruction of healthy trees and shrubs , particularly those for which special
care is required. Financial benefit to the developer will not constitute a
sufficient reason to avoid compliance with this subsection.
      (2)   During the construction of any site , trees and shrubs , as defined
herein, shall be protected by temporary fencing to ensure that there is no
encroachment or disturbance within the area of their dripline by changing grade
, trenching, stockpiling of building materials or topsoil or compacting the
soil and roots by any equipment. In addition, the following regulations shall
apply:
         (a)   Existing trees where the root zone (dripline) has been
encroached upon are not to be counted as preserved.
         (b)   Existing trees where trunks are within five feet of proposed
sidewalks, walkways or driveways , or within 10 feet of proposed roadways are
not to be counted as preserved.
         (c)   At the direction of the Township staff or consultants, existing
trees which have not been adequately protected or have been significantly
damaged are to be removed.
         (d)   Standing trees that are confirmed by the Township staff or
consultants as dead or substantially in decline or stressed or invasive species
that are undesirable for the site or site conditions will not be counted as
preserved and shall be removed.
      (3)   The foregoing requirements for trees in Subsection F(1), (2), (3),
(4) and (8) (street  trees , softening buffers , screen buffer , parking area,
and watercourse  buffers ) shall be met by preserving existing healthy, native
trees . To that end, the number of trees required by these subsections may be
reduced by a credit for approved preserved trees as follows:
         (a)   Approved preserved trees eight inches or greater in diameter
remaining on an individual lot may offset the requirements as noted herein on a
ratio set forth in Subsection (d). For example, if two eight-inch healthy
native shade trees are preserved on a lot , two trees may be deducted from the
calculated requirements.
         (b)   A preserved tree may not be used to offset more than one
landscape code requirement.
         (c)   Transplanting plant material within the subject property may be
permitted when unusual or unique conditions exist, such as crowding, a change
in site conditions or prior planting conditions (e.g., nursery.)
         (d)   Credits for approved preserved trees to offset landscape code
requirements shall be calculated as follows:
 
Diameter of Trunk of Approved Preserved Tree (inches) Number of Tree Credits
37 or greater                                         5
25 to 36                                              4
13 to 24                                              2
8 to 12                                               1

   H.   Replacing Trees Destroyed by Development.
      (1)   Where more than 25% of the existing trees have been removed, every
remaining tree , eight inches in diameter or more, which is destroyed because
of site  improvements shall be replaced. It is intended that tree replacement
be the initial steps towards re- establishing woodland and reforestation.
Replacement shall be according to the following formula:
         (a)   One-third of the required replacement trees shall be shade trees
at a ratio of one shade tree to one removed tree (1:1).
         (b)   One-third shall be flowering trees and evergreen trees at a
ratio of two flower ing/evergreen trees to one removed tree (2:1).
         (c)   One-third shall be shrubs at a ratio of ten shrubs to one
removed tree (10:1), or, all or some part of this third may be groundcover at a
ratio of 40 groundcover plants to one removed tree (40:1).
      (2)   Replacement plant material shall be positioned, spaced and planted
to replicate a native woodland or forest and near other woodland where possible
to expand existing woodland areas. All species are to be selected from
Subsection I, Recommended Plant List.
         (a)   Such new plant material shall be planted in addition to that
required in Subsection F above.
         (b)   Replacement trees must be planted in common areas within and
between lots rather than as foundation plantings around individual structures .
         (c)   Recommended sizes and species of shade trees , evergreen trees ,
flowering trees , shrubs and groundcovers are listed in Subsection I.
      (3)   Calculation and estimation of existing trees before construction
shall be performed based on the following procedure:
         (a)   Healthy trees over eight inches in diameter standing alone will
be documented individually and noted on the landscape plan . Dead trees or
trees in severe decline shall be omitted.
         (b)   The quantity of large trees standing in masses of over 10 trees
shall be estimated by the following method:
            [1]   Three 100 by100-foot square areas will be staked out in
locations acceptable to the owner/developer and the Township staff or
consultants.
            [2]   The quantity of trees in each area will be counted and the
totals averaged to determine the average number of trees per 10,000 square feet
of wooded area.
            [3]   This average quantity per area shall serve as a
representative sample and will be used to determine both the quantity of trees
being removed and the quantity of trees to remain in large masses.
      (4)   Calculation and estimation of existing trees remaining after
construction shall be prepared by the applicant and confirmed by Township staff
or consultants based on the procedure noted above.
      (5)   Calculations of the required replacements for existing trees eight
inches or more in diameter removed during construction shall be submitted by
the applicant and confirmed by Township staff or consultants based on the
following formula:
         (a)   Twenty-five percent of the total number of existing trees on the
site may be removed without the need for replacement.
         (b)   If more than 25% but less than 75% of the total number of
existing trees are to be removed, the replacement quantity shall be based on a
1:1 ratio and the plant material selected based on woodland replacement
criteria as stated above in Subsection H(1).
         (c)   If 75% or more of the existing trees are to be removed, the
calculation of replacement trees for the last 25% of the trees removed shall be
at a ratio of 2:1; two new two and one half inch caliper shade trees for each
existing tree removed. The replacement plant material shall be based on the
woodland replacement criteria as stated above in Subsection H(1).
      (6)   The total number of trees on site before construction, the total
number of trees proposed to be removed and the total quantity of required
replacement trees are to be listed on the landscape plan .

§ 212-35.1.   Transportation impact study.
[Added 4-13-1999 by Ord. No. 995]
   A.   Whenever a transportation impact study is required, it is anticipated
that the study will enable the Township to assess the impact of a proposed
development on the local transportation system. Its purpose is to ensure that
proposed developments do not adversely affect the transportation network and to
identify any traffic problems associated with access from the site to the
existing transportation network. The study’s purpose is also to delineate
solutions to potential problems and to present improvements to be incorporated
into the proposed development. The study shall assist in the protection of air
quality, the conservation of energy and the encouragement of public
transportation use .
   B.   Subdivisions and land developments for which a study is required.
      (1)   A transportation impact study shall be required for all
subdivisions and land developments that meet one or more of the following
criteria:
         (a)   Residential: 20 or more dwelling units .
         (b)   Commercial: a commercial building or buildings consisting of
15,000 square feet or more of gross floor area or when the Zoning Code (
Chapter 255) requires 60 or more parking spaces for the proposed use .
         (c)   Office: a development consisting of 15,000 square feet or more
of gross floor area or when the Zoning Code (
Chapter 255) requires 60 or more parking spaces for the proposed use .
         (d)   Industrial: a development consisting of 25,000 square feet or
more of gross floor area or when the Zoning Code (
Chapter 255) requires 40 or more parking spaces for the proposed use .
         (e)   Institutional: a development consisting of 25,000 square feet or
more of gross floor area or when the Zoning Code (
Chapter 255) requires 100 or more parking spaces for the proposed use .
         (f)   Other: fast-food or drive-through restaurants; convenience
stores; drive-in movie theatres; gas stations; car wash.
      (2)   The Board of Commissioners, at its discretion, may require the
preparation of a transportation impact study for any other subdivision or land
development or other major change of use of property.
      (3)   The developer shall reimburse the Township for reasonable fees and
expenses incurred by the Township Traffic Engineer for the review of the
developer's transportation impact study and plans .
   C.   A transportation impact study shall be provided for a given study area.
The boundaries of the study area to be analyzed shall include those
intersections which may be affected by the proposed subdivision or land
development . If there is any dispute as to whether an intersection may be
affected or not, the final discretion shall rest with the Township Traffic
Engineer .
   D.   The transportation impact study shall contain, but not be limited to,
the following information:
      (1)   General site description. The site description shall include the
size, location, proposed land uses , construction staging and completion date
of the proposed land development . If the development is residential, types of
dwelling units and number of bedrooms shall also be included. A brief
description of other major existing and proposed land developments within the
study area shall be provided. The general site description shall also include
probable characteristics of potential site users to the extent that they may
affect the transportation needs of the site (e.g., number of senior citizens).
      (2)   Transportation facilities description.
         (a)   The description shall contain full documentation, including
plans , of the proposed internal transportation system. This description shall
include proposed internal vehicular, bicycle, pedestrian and other intermodal
circulation, all proposed ingress and egress locations, all internal roadway
widths and rights-of-way , parking conditions, traffic channelizations and any
traffic signals or other intersection control devices within the site . The
site design shall be shown to maximize potential public transportation usage to
and from the development, such as providing adequate turning radii at all
access points to allow a bus to enter the development. Bus shelter and sign
locations shall be designated where appropriate.
         (b)   The report shall describe the entire external roadway system
within the study area. Driveways adjacent to or across from proposed site
access points shall be identified. Major intersections in the study area shall
be identified and mapped. All existing and proposed public transportation
services and facilities within a one-mile radius of the site shall also be
documented. All future highway improvements , including proposed construction
and traffic signalization, shall be noted. This information shall be obtained
from the Twelve-Year Highway Capital Program for the Delaware Valley Region and
from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Any proposed roadway
improvements resulting from proposed surrounding developments shall also be
recorded.
      (3)   Existing traffic conditions.
         (a)   Existing traffic conditions shall be measured and documented for
all streets and intersections in the study area. Traffic volumes shall be
recorded for existing average daily traffic, existing peak hour traffic and for
the subdivision's peak hour traffic. Complete traffic counts at all
intersections in the study area shall be conducted, encompassing the peak
highway and development-generated hour(s), and documentation shall be included
in the report. A volume capacity analysis based upon existing volumes shall be
performed during the peak hour(s) and the peak development-generated hour(s)
for all roadways and major intersections in the study area. A volume capacity
analyses based upon existing volumes shall be performed, using the procedures
of the current Highway Capacity Manual, during the peak hour(s) and the peak
development-generated hour(s) for all roadways and major intersections in the
study area. Levels of service shall be determined for each location.
         (b)   This analysis will determine the adequacy of the existing
roadway system to serve the current traffic demand. Roadways and/or
intersections experiencing levels of service E or F shall be noted as
congestion locations.
      (4)   Transportation impact of the development. Estimation of vehicular
trips to result from the proposal shall be completed for both the street system
and the development-generated peak hour(s). These development-generated traffic
volumes shall be provided for the inbound and outbound traffic movements as
estimated. Acceptable source(s) and methodology shall be followed. These
generated volumes shall be distributed to the study area and assigned to the
existing streets and intersections throughout the study area. Documentation of
all assumptions used in the distribution and assignment phase shall be
provided. Traffic volumes shall be assigned to all access points. Pedestrian
volumes shall also be calculated, if applicable. If school crossings are to be
used, pedestrian volumes shall be assigned to each crossing. Any
characteristics of the site that will cause unusual trip generation rates and/
or traffic flows shall be noted.
      (5)   Analysis of transportation impact.
         (a)   The total future traffic demand based on full occupancy of the
proposed subdivision or land development shall be calculated. This demand shall
consist of the combination of the existing traffic expanded to the completion
year, the development-generated traffic, background growth and the traffic
generated by other proposed developments in the study area. A volume/capacity
analysis shall also be conducted using the total future demand and the future
roadway capacity. If staging of the proposed development is anticipated,
calculations for each stage of completion shall be made. This analysis shall be
performed using the peak highway hour(s) and peak development-generated hour(s)
for all streets and major intersections in the study area. Volume/capacity
calculations shall be completed for all major intersections. Levels of service
for all streets and intersections shall be listed.
         (b)   All access points and pedestrian crossings shall be examined as
to the feasibility of installing traffic signals. This evaluation shall compare
the projected traffic and pedestrian volumes to the warrants for traffic signal
installation.
      (6)   Conclusions and recommended improvements .
         (a)   All streets and/or intersections showing a level of service
below D shall be considered deficient, and specific recommendations for the
elimination of these problems shall be listed. Highway capacity evaluations
shall consider not only the overall intersection level of service, but also
each approach and movement to identify any substandard values which need to be
improved. The listing of recommended improvements might include but not be
limited to the following elements: internal circulation design; site access
location and design; external street and intersection improvements ; traffic
signal installation and operation, including signal timing, signal upgrade,
signal coordination through time-based, hardwire interconnection or intelligent
traffic systems; transit design improvements ; and improvements to facilitate
transit service.
         (b)   At locations where the level of service for the design year is
deficient without the proposed development, determine improvements which would
not only provide a level of service and delay no worse than conditions without
development but which would improve such level of service and delay.
         (c)   Existing and/or future public transportation service shall also
be addressed. A listing of all actions to be undertaken to increase present
public transportation usage and improve service, if applicable, shall be
included.
         (d)   The listing of recommended improvements for both streets and
transit shall include, for each improvement , the party responsible for the
improvement , a preliminary cost estimate and funding of the improvement and
the phase of development during which the improvement must be completed.
         (e)   The Board of Commissioners shall review the transportation
impact study or have its own consulting Traffic Engineer review the impact
study at the applicant's expense, to analyze its adequacy in solving any
traffic problems that will occur due to the land development or subdivision and
make recommendations to the Board of Commissioners.
         (f)   The Board of Commissioners may decide that certain improvements
contained in the study on or adjacent to the site or at other locations
impacted by the traffic generated by the development of the site are required
for preliminary plan approval and may attach those conditions to the plan
approval.
         (g)   The roadway and signal improvement  plans shall not be submitted
to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation until such plans are approved
by the Board of Commissioners or the Montgomery County Department of Roads and
Bridges. This submittal to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation shall
be accompanied by comments of the Board of Commissioners and the Montgomery
County Planning Commission.

§ 221-1.   Policy and purpose.
The Board of Commissioners of Upper Dublin Township has determined that the
practice of utilizing invasive cosmetic procedures (ICP) for decorative and
cosmetic micropigmentation, commonly known as "body piercing," "tattooing" and/
or "branding," is on the increase with little regulation in place to protect
against illness and injury that may occur from such practices and with no
accounting requirements for operators. The governing body deems it to be in the
best interest of the residents of Upper Dublin Township and for the public
health, safety and welfare to adopt regulation and licensing provisions to that
end, and to provide for licensing fees to cover the costs of investigating,
administering and enforcing such provisions.
§ 221-2.   Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
   BOARD OF HEALTH — The Upper Dublin Township Board of Health.
   BODY PIERCING — Piercing of the skin for the express purpose of insertion of
any object, including but not limited to jewelry; provided, however, that the
piercing of the lobes of the ears shall be specifically excluded from the
purview of this chapter. The practice of branding, the marking of the human
skin by the intentional application of a hot object, shall be included in this
definition, and all regulations pertaining thereto shall apply to such practice
as applicable.
   CERTIFICATE OF SANITATION — A certificate issued to the owner or proprietor
of a body piercing or tattooing shop under the provisions of this chapter.
   HEALTH OFFICER — The Health Officer appointed by the Board of Commissioners
of Upper Dublin Township.

where body piercing or tattooing is performed.
   PRACTITIONER — Any person who performs the procedure or engages in the
practice of body piercing or tattooing or branding.
   TATTOO or TATTOOING — To mark or color the skin by pricking or by
subcutaneous introduction of nontoxic dyes or pigments so as to form indelible
marks or figures or by production of scars.
   TATTOO PARLOR — Any premises where an operator does tattooing for a fee or
other consideration.
§ 221-3.   License and inspection certificate required.

operator where the procedure takes place has been issued a license by the
Department of Health and the premises has a current inspection certificate.
§ 221-4.   Application for license.
   A.   The operator where body piercing or tattooing is performed shall apply
to the Health Officer for a premises license, in writing, on forms supplied by
the Health Department for said purpose, which form shall be duly verified by
the applicant. The application must be accompanied by the license fee provided
for in the Township fee schedule, which fee shall include the cost of
inspection. The license application shall set forth such information as the

      (6)   Federal employer identification number if the applicant is a
corporation, partnership or firm; social security number if the applicant is a
proprietorship.
      (7)   A certification that the applicant is a citizen of the United
States or, if not, is the holder of documentation authorizing the alien to be
employed in the United States, such as an alien registration card issued by the
United States Immigration and Naturalization Service on Form No. I-151, I-155,
I-94, with an endorsement authorizing employment in the United States, or the
like.
      (8)   If the applicant is a partnership, firm or corporation, all
information required by the application shall apply not only to the
partnership, firm or corporation, but also to each officer, director or holder
of 10% of the issued stock (if a corporation), and to all members of a
partnership or firm.
      (9)   Proof of public liability/bodily injury and property damage
insurance and professional liability insurance in the amount of $100,000 each,

health hazard which requires immediate action to protect the public health, it
may, without notice or hearing, issue a written order citing the existence of
such an emergency and the conditions violating this chapter or regulations
adopted pursuant thereto which require corrective action to remove such health
hazard. If such corrective action has not been taken, the Board of Health may
take such action as may be necessary to protect the public health, including
complete shutdown. Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter, such order
shall be effective immediately, but, upon petition to the Board of
Commissioners, shall be afforded a hearing as soon as possible, but in any case
not later than five days after the petition was filed. After such hearing,
depending upon its finding as to whether or not the provisions of this chapter
and of the regulations adopted pursuant thereto have been complied with, the

§ 224-10.   Exemptions.
   A.   Exempt parties. The United States, the Commonwealth or any of their
instrumentalities, agencies or political subdivisions shall be exempt from
payment of the tax imposed by this article. The exemption of such governmental
bodies shall not, however, relieve any other party to a transaction from
liability for the tax.
   B.   Excluded transactions. The tax imposed by §
224-3 shall not apply to the following:
      (1)   A transfer to the commonwealth or to any of its instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions by gift, dedication or deed in lieu of
condemnation or deed of confirmation in connection with condemnation
proceedings or a reconveyance by the condemning body of the property condemned
to the owner of record at the time of condemnation, which reconveyance may
include property line adjustments, provided that said reconveyance is made
within one year from the date of condemnation.
      (2)   A document which the commonwealth is prohibited from taxing under
the Constitution or Statutes of the United States.
      (3)   A conveyance to a municipality, Township, school district or county
pursuant to acquisition by the municipality, Township, school district or
county of a tax delinquent property at Sheriff’s sale or Tax Claim Bureau sale.
      (4)   A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration which corrects or
confirms a transfer previously recorded, but which does not extend or limit
existing record legal title or interest.
      (5)   A transfer of division in kind for no or nominal actual
consideration or property passed by testate or intestate succession and held by
cotenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in value than
their undivided interest, tax is due on the excess.
      (6)   A transfer between husband and wife, between persons who were
previously husband and wife who have since been divorced, provided that the
property or interest therein subject to such transfer was acquired by the
husband and wife or husband or wife prior to the granting of the final decree
in divorce, between parent and child or the spouse of such child, between
brother or sister or spouse of a brother or sister and brother or sister or the
spouse of a brother or sister and between a grandparent and grandchild or the
spouse of such grandchild, except that a subsequent transfer by the grantee
within one year shall be subject to tax as if the grantor were making such
transfer.
      (7)   A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration of property
passing by testate or intestate succession from a personal representative of a
decedent to the decedent’s devisee or heir.
      (8)   A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration to a trustee of
an ordinary trust where the transfer of the same property would be exempt if
the transfer were made directly from the grantor to all of the possible
beneficiaries, whether or not such beneficiaries are contingent or specifically
named. No such exemption shall be granted unless the Recorder of Deeds is
presented with a copy of the trust instrument that clearly identifies the
grantor and all possible beneficiaries.
      (9)   A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration from a trustee to
a beneficiary of an ordinary trust.

      (11)   A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration between
principal and agent or straw party; or from or to an agent or straw party
where, if the agent or straw party were his principal, no tax would be imposed
under this article. Where the document by which title is acquired by a grantee
or statement of value fails to set forth that the property was acquired by the
grantee from or for the benefit of his principal, there is a rebuttable
presumption that the property is the property of the grantee in his individual
capacity if the grantee claims an exemption from taxation under this
subsection.
      (12)   A transfer made pursuant to the statutory merger or consolidation
of a corporation or statutory division of a nonprofit corporation, except where
it is reasonably determined that the primary intent for such merger,
consolidation or division is avoidance of the tax imposed by this article.
      (13)   A transfer from a corporation or association of real estate held
of record in the name of the corporation or association where the grantee owns
stock of the corporation or an interest in the association in the same
proportion as his interest in or ownership of the real estate being conveyed
and where the stock of the corporation or the interest in the association has
been held by the grantee for more than two years.

purpose of manufacturing, fabricating, compounding, processing, publishing,
research and development, transportation, energy conversion, energy production,
pollution control, warehousing or agriculture; and
         (b)   The agency or authority has the full ownership interest in the
real estate transferred.
      (16)   A transfer by a mortgagor to the holder of a bona fide mortgage in
default in lieu of a foreclosure or a transfer pursuant to a judicial sale in
which the successful bidder is the bona fide holder of a mortgage, unless the
holder assigns the bid to another person.
      (17)   Any transfer between religious organizations or other bodies or
persons holding title for a religious organization if such real estate is not
being or has not been used by such transferor for commercial purposes.
      (18)   A transfer to a conservancy which possesses a tax-exempt status
pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 [68A Stat.
3, 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3)] and which has as its primary purpose preservation of
land for historic, recreational, scenic, agricultural or open-space
opportunities.

may be limited to an explanation of the reason such document is not subject to
tax under this article.

   DOMICILE — The place where one lives and has his permanent home, and to

“Domicile” is the voluntary fixed place of habitation of a person, not for a
mere special or limited purpose, but with the present intention of making a
permanent home, until some event occurs to induce him to adopt some other
permanent home. In the case of businesses or associations, the “domicile” is
the place considered as the center of business affairs and the place where its
functions are discharged.
   EARNED INCOME — Salaries, wages, commissions, bonuses, incentive payments,
fees, tips and other compensation received by a person or his personal
representative for services rendered, whether directly or through an agent, and
whether in cash or in property; not including, however, wages or compensation
paid to persons on active military service, periodic payments for sickness,
disability other than regular wages received during a period of sickness,
disability or retirement or payments arising under workers’ compensation acts,
occupational disease acts and similar legislation or payments commonly
recognized as old age benefits, retirement pay or pensions paid to persons
retired from service after reaching a specific age or after a stated period of
employment compensation payments by any governmental agency or payments to
reimburse expenses or payments made by employers or labor unions for wage and
salary supplemental programs, including but not limited to programs covering
hospitalization, sickness, disability or death, supplemental unemployment
benefits, strike benefits, social security and retirements.
   EMPLOYER — A person, partnership, association, corporation, institution,
governmental body or unit or agency or any other entity employing one or more
persons for a salary, wage, commission or other compensation.
   INCOME TAX OFFICER OR OFFICERS — The person, public employee or private
agency designated by the governing body to collect and administer the tax on
earned income and net profits.
   LESSOR — Any individual or individuals, corporation, partnership or other
entity which owns, leases or otherwise possesses or controls any real property,
condominium unit or rental unit, including residential, commercial, office,
institutional or industrial real property, condominium unit or rental unit, and
in turn leases or subleases such real property to any other individual or
individuals, corporation, partnership or other entity. For the purposes of this
article, "lessor" shall include any agent, manager, condominium association or
other entity which acts on behalf of the owner of the real property,
condominium unit or rental unit. [Amended 12-12-1989 by Ord. No. 775]
   NET PROFITS — The net income from the operation of a business, profession or
other activity, except corporations, after provisions for all costs and
expenses incurred in the conduct thereof, determined either on a cash or
accrual basis in accordance with the accounting system used in such business,
profession or other activity, but without deduction of taxes based on income.

person’s employer pursuant to the Township’s regulations affirming that the
person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits from all
sources within the Township of less than $12,000 in the calendar year for which
the exemption certificate is filed. The exemption certificate shall have
attached to it a copy of all the employee’s last pay stubs or W-2 forms from
employment within the Township for the year prior to the fiscal year for which
the employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax. Upon receipt of the
exemption certificate and until otherwise instructed by the Township or except
as required by Subsection B(2) of this section the employer shall not withhold
the tax from the person during the calendar year or the remainder of the
calendar year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall
ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to employees
at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a form at the time of
hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be the uniform form provided by
the Township.
      (2)   With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the person or
by the Township that the person has received earned income and net profits from
all sources within the Township equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that
calendar year or that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption
for that calendar year, or upon an employer’s payment to the person of earned
income within the Township in an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in

person under Subsection B(3).

the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under Subsection B(2)
of this section, the employer shall withhold the tax for the remainder of that
calendar year. The employer shall withhold from the person, for the first
payroll period after receipt of the notification under Subsection B(2) of this
section, a lump sum equal to the amount of tax that was not withheld from the
person due to the exemption claimed by the person under this subsection, plus
the per payroll amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax
withheld per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that calendar
year shall be the same amount withheld for other employees. In the event the
employment of a person subject to withholding of the tax under this subsection
is subsequently severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for
any outstanding balance of tax due, and the Township may pursue collection
under this article.
      (4)   Except as provided in Subsection B(2), it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating exemption

refund claims for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption,
which procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the general municipal
law relating to refunds of overpayments and interest on overpayments. Refunds
made within 75 days of a refund request or 75 days after the last day the
employer is required to remit the tax for the last quarter of the calendar
year, whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest. No refunds shall be
made for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do not exceed $1. The
Collector shall determine eligibility for exemption and provide refunds to
exempt persons.

by him or performing for him within the Township and making a return and
payment thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby authorized
to deduct this tax for each employee in his or her employ, whether said
employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and whether or not all such
services are performed within the Township.
   B.   A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro
rata share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person for a
payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax levied for
the calendar year by the number of payroll periods established by the employer
for the calendar year. For purposes of determining the pro rata share, an
employer shall round down the amount of the tax collected each payroll period
to the nearest one- hundredth of a dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made
on a payroll period basis for each payroll period in which the person is
engaging in an occupation, except as provided in Subsection D of this section,

withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement from a
principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the length of the
payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a statement from the
employee that the pay statement is from the employee’s principal employer and
the employee will notify other employers of a change in principal place of
employment within two weeks of its occurrence. The employee’s statement shall
be provided on the form approved by Pennsylvania Department of Community and
Economic Development.
   E.   The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person maybe employed. The Township shall provide a taxpayer a receipt of
payment upon request by the taxpayer.
   F.   No employer shall he held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for
the payment of the withheld tax money to the Township if the failure to
withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the employee as
to the employee’s place or plates of employment, the employee’s principal
office or where the employee is principally employed. Further, an employer
shall not be liable for payment of the local services tax in an amount
exceeding the amount withheld by the employer if the employer complies with the
provisions of Subsection B of §
224-30 of this article and this section and remits the amount so withheld in
accordance with this article.
   G.   Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year. tax, whether or not the
employer makes collection thereof from the employee’s salary.

Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the tax
on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer fails
to file the return and pay the wages or commissions paid by him or her to an
employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer shall be
responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had been
originally levied against the employer.
§ 224-35.   Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted and paid
over to the Collector on or before the thirtieth day following the end of each
calendar quarter of each such tax year.
§ 224-36.   Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind or
engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of employment
within the Township shall be required to comply with this article and pay the
pro rata portion of the tax due to the Collector on or before the thirtieth day
following the end of the first quarter or any subsequent quarter in which they
become self-employed within the Township. For purposes of determining the pro-
rata share, self-employed individuals shall be deemed to have one pay period
per year and the pro- rata share shall be deemed to be $52.
§ 224-37.   Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or employed in more
than one political subdivision.
   A.   The sites of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day
the person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the event
a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is, concurrent
employment, or an occupation which requires the person working in more than one
political subdivision during a payroll period, the priority of claim to collect
the local services tax shall be in the following order:
      (1)   First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
      (2)   Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
      (3)   Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person’s home. In case of
dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar year declaring
that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes prima facie certification
of payment to all other political subdivisions.

business outside of the Township but who perform services of any type or kind
or engage in any occupation or profession within the Township do, by virtue
thereof, agree to be bound by and subject themselves to the provisions,
penalties and regulations promulgated under this article with the same force
and effect as though they were residents of the Township. Further, any
individual engaged in an occupation within the Township and an employee of a
nonresidential employer may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a
self-employed person, and in the event his or her tax is not paid, the Township
shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer or employee for
the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 224-39.   Administration of tax.

this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount received by him from
each employer or self-employed person, together with the date the tax was
received.
   B.   The Collector is hereby charged with the administration and enforcement
of this article and is hereby charged and empowered, subject to approval of the
Board of Commissioners, to proscribe, adopt and promulgate rules and
regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the administration and
enforcement of this article, including provisions for the examination of
payroll records of any employer subject to this article, the examination and
correction of any return made in compliance with this article and any payment
alleged or found to be incorrect or as to which overpayment is claimed or found
to have occurred. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Collector shall
have the right to appeal the Collector’s decision pursuant to the Township’s
procedures under the Local Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights as in other cases
provided.

records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return made by

is hereby directed and required to give the Collector the means, facilities and
opportunity for such examination.

due date of the tax and a penalty of 10% shall be added to the flat rate of
such tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery of this
tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable therefor
shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of collection.
§ 224-41.   Violations and penalties.
   A.   Whoever makes any false or untrue statement on any return required by
this article, or whoever refuses inspection of the books, records or accounts
in his or her custody and control setting forth the number of employees subject
to this tax who are in his or her employment, or whoever fails or refuses to
file any return required by this article or whoever fails to collect or
withhold or, having collected and withheld, fails to pay the tax due, shall,
upon conviction thereof, be sentenced to pay a fine or penalty to the Township

enforce the penalty herein prescribed may be instituted against any person in
charge of the business of any employer who shall have failed or who refuses to
file a return required by this article and shall include self-employed
individuals.
   B.   Any employee or individual who submits false statements regarding
eligibility for exemption or submits a false exemption certificate shall be

held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of the

§ 233-23.1.   Parking permit program.
[Added 8-13-1996 by Ord. No. 912]
   A.   Purpose. The Commissioners of the Township of Upper Dublin deem it to
be in the interest of the citizens of the Township to provide for the
establishment of a parking permit program to ensure primary access to available
parking spaces by adjacent property owners as well as to alleviate potentially
hazardous traffic conditions and to relieve streets and roads overburdened by
traffic.
   B.   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following terms shall
have the following meanings designated for each:
      COMMUTER VEHICLE — A motor vehicle parked in a parking permit area by a
person who is not the owner of adjacent property.
      OWNER — A person who owns or leases real property within a permit parking
area and who maintains either a voting address, bona fide occupancy at or
ownership of that address, including any individual 18 years of age or older
who resides at such property.
      PARKING PERMIT — A parking permit authorized by this section.
      PERMIT PARKING AREA—A contiguous area containing public highways
primarily abutting residential property or residential and nonbusiness property
such as schools, churches, parks and nursing homes.
   C.   Designation of permit parking areas.
      (1)   The Board of Commissioners may designate permit parking areas when
it determines that owners in a proposed parking area are adversely affected by
entries into the area and curbside parking by nonowners and/or by Township
parking regulations. In making this determination, the Board shall consider the
following:
         (a)   The difficulty experienced by owners in the proposed area to
obtain curbside parking for themselves and their invitees reasonably accessible
to their residences or properties.
         (b)   The desire of the owners in the proposed permit area for the
institution of a permit parking system.
         (c)   The availability of off-street parking facilities for the use of
commuter vehicles.
      (2)   Permit parking areas enumerated. The following shall be permit
parking areas during the times indicated:
         (a)   Until June 30, 2002, parking without a permit shall be unlawful
between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., Mondays through Fridays, except
on legal holidays, on Loch Alsh Avenue, north side, from Fort Washington Avenue
to the 309 Expressway Overpass. [Amended 8-12-1997 by Ord. No. 945; 6-9-1998 by
Ord. No. 970; 5-11-1999 by Ord. No. 997; 7-11-2000 by Ord. No. 1038; 10-9- 2001
by Ord. No. 1069]
   D.   Regulations. It shall be unlawful and a violation of this section for a
vehicle to park in a designated parking area during the times such parking is
prohibited, unless the vehicle displays a parking permit authorized by this
section. A parking permit shall only authorize the stopping or standing or
parking of a vehicle in a designated permit parking area when posted with
official signs.
   E.   Issuance of permits. The Township Police Department shall issue parking
permits to the owners of property adjacent to public streets in a designated
parking area for each curbside parking space available and may adopt
regulations for the issuance and use of such permits. Any person to whom a
permit has been issued who violates any provision of this section or the
regulations promulgated hereunder shall be subject to revocation of such
permit.
§ 233-24.   Penalties for parking violations.
[Amended 5-8-2010 by Ord. No. 10-1232, § 1]
Any person who violates any provision of this article shall, upon conviction,
be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $50 and costs; provided, however,
that it shall be the duty of the police officers and of parking enforcement
personnel of the Township to report to the Chief of Police all violations of
any provision of this article, indicating, in each case, the section violated,
the license number of the vehicle involved in the violation, the location where
the violation took place and any other facts that might be necessary in order
to secure a clear understanding of the circumstances attending the violation.
The police officer or other person making the report shall also attach to or
place upon every such vehicle a notice stating that the vehicle was parked in
violation of this article. The notice shall contain instructions to the owner
or driver of the vehicle that if he will report to the Township Finance
Department and pay the sum of $20 within 10 days of the notice, that act will
save the violator from prosecution and from payment of the fine and costs
prescribed in the first sentence of this section.

§ 240-1.   Maintenance of property; maintaining free flow of water.
   A.   It shall be the obligation of every property owner to maintain his
property in such manner so as to permit at all times the free flow of water
through any drain, ditch, stream, swale, stormwater management facility or
watercourse, whether natural or man-made, occupying such land, including the
removal of any trees, bushes, undergrowth, tree limbs, trash or debris which
might interfere with the free flow of water in the event of a storm. [Amended
9-14-2004 by Ord. No. 1140]
   B.   No person shall permit surface water or drainage to be directed or
redirected onto the property of another without that person's permission, nor
shall any person interfere with the natural flow of surface water or drainage
so as to block it from flowing off of the property of another.
§ 240-2.   Permit required.
[Amended 9-14-2004 by Ord. No. 1140]
It shall be unlawful for the owner of any land to stop, fill up, confine, pave
or otherwise interfere with or change the course of any drain, ditch, stream,
swale, stormwater management facility or watercourse in Upper Dublin Township
without first obtaining from the Township Engineer a permit authorizing such
work to be performed; and no drain, ditch, stream, swale, stormwater management
facility or watercourse shall be stopped, filled up, confined, paved or
otherwise interfered with or the course thereof changed except in strict
accordance with the terms and conditions of such permit and the plans and
specifications submitted therewith.
§ 240-3.   Application for permit.
[Amended 9-14-2004 by Ord. No. 1140]

application and plans and specifications, the Township Engineer shall notify
the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection or other agency
overseeing permits relating to watercourses and all municipalities which are
adjacent to the Township of the occurrence and contents of the filings.
   B.   The plans and specifications shall show the exact nature of the work to
be performed; the course, structure and capacity of all drains, ditches,
streams, stormwater management facilities and watercourses; the method of
drainage of the adjacent or contiguous territory; and any other necessary and
explanatory details required by the Township.
   C.   The delineation of the identified floodplain area may be revised by the
Township where natural or man-made changes have occurred and/or more detailed
studies conducted or undertaken by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, a
River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or individual documenting the
necessity for such changes. However, prior to any such changes, approval must
be obtained from the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA).
§ 240-4.   Approval procedure.
[Amended 9-14-2004 by Ord. No. 1140]
   A.   The application and plans and specifications shall be filed in
triplicate with the Township Engineer. The Township Engineer may require
alterations, changes or modifications in the plans and specifications which it
deems necessary and may refuse a permit until such alterations, changes and
modifications have been made.
   B.   If the Township Engineer shall disapprove the plans and specifications
submitted and refuse a permit, the reasons therefor will be set forth in
writing and given to the applicant, who may, within 30 days thereafter, appeal
to the Board of Commissioners. Before acting upon such appeal, the Board of
Commissioners may, in its discretion, arrange for a public hearing after giving
such notice as it deems desirable.
§ 240-5.   Commencement of work.
The Township Engineer shall be notified at least 24 hours in advance of the

§ 244-2.   Permit required.
It shall be unlawful for any person to locate, drill or have drilled any well,

§ 244-3.   Supervision and regulation.
The supervision and regulation of the drilling of wells and the use of
underground waters is vested in the Department of Health of Upper Dublin

materially increase drilling costs.
§ 244-5.   Certificate of compliance required.
No new well and its related powered pumping system shall be placed in

(10,000) gallons per day, or where close spacing of wells in an area so
dictates, in taking action on applications, the Department of Health shall have
the authority to impose such conditions and make such requirements and
limitations as may be necessary to protect the people of the township and the
applicant and may issue limited or revocable permits for such wells.
§ 244-7.   Report.
All well drillers shall, upon completion of the drilling of any well, file a
report in the form to be supplied by the Department of Health.
§ 244-8.   Fees.

disposal of domestic or industrial wastes.
§ 244-10.   Abandoned wells.
The owner of any well shall, upon abandonment of any existing well or test
hole, effectively seal and fill such wells and test holes in accordance with
the rules prescribed by the Department of Health. A well not in operation for
three (3) or more years, or improperly maintained to prevent contamination, may
be deemed to have been abandoned.

hundred dollars ($600.) in the discretion of the Justice of the Peace, together
with costs of prosecution, and whenever such person or persons shall have been
notified by the Department of Health or by service of a summons in prosecution,
or in any other way, that he is committing such violation, each day thereafter
that he continues and persists in such violation shall constitute a separate
offense. 1
   B.   All prosecutions for violation of this chapter shall be by summary

groundwater and surface waters.
   G.   Improve surface water quality by reducing the amount of nutrients,
sediment, organic matter, pesticides, and other harmful substances that reach
watercourses , wetlands, subsurface, and surface water bodies by using
scientifically proven processes including filtration, deposition, absorption,
adsorption, plant uptake, and denitrification, and by improving infiltration,
encouraging sheet flow, and stabilizing concentrated flows.
   H.   Improve and maintain the safety, reliability, and adequacy of the water
supply for domestic, agricultural, commercial, industrial, and recreational
uses along with sustaining diverse populations of aquatic flora and fauna.
   I.   Preserve and protect areas that intercept surface water runoff,
wastewater, subsurface flow, and/or deep groundwater flows from upland sources
and function to remove or buffer the effects of associated nutrients, sediment,
organic matter, pesticides, or other pollutants prior to entry into surface
waters, as well as provide wildlife habitat, moderate water temperature in
surface waters, attenuate flood flow, and provide opportunities for passive
recreation
   J.   Work with floodplain , steep slope , and other requirements that
regulate environmentally sensitive areas to minimize hazards to life, property,
and riparian features.
   K.   Recognize that natural features contribute to the welfare and quality

of plans and data to verify the calculations: [Added 8-12-1997 by Ord. No. 947]
      (1)   Developable acreage calculations.
         (a)   From the gross acreage of the site, subtract the following:
            [1]   Existing road  ultimate right-of-way .
            [2]   Noncontiguous land .
            [3]   Floodplain land: 100%.
            [4]   Wetlands: 100%.
            [5]   Ponds or lakes: 100%.
            [6]   Slopes from 15% to 25%: 50%.
            [7]   Slopes over 25%: 85%.
            [8]   Existing utility rights-of-way: 50%.
         (b)   The balance constitutes the total developable acreage .
         (c)   In the calculations above, the following shall apply:
            [1]   Land separated by roads or railroads or land where the
connecting link is less than 50 feet wide is noncontiguous land .
            [2]   The calculated 100-year floodplain shall be used where
available, otherwise alluvial soils shall be used.
            [3]   Where two or more categories overlap, the overlapping acreage
shall be counted only once using the most restrictive classification.
            [4]   Utility corridors owned in fee simple by the utility shall
not be counted towards the applicant’s land area.
      (2)   Density calculation. To determine the number of units permitted on
a given site, multiply the developable acreage by 1.68 dwelling units per
developable acre .

   A.   The purpose of establishing planned office center districts shall be to
encourage the logical and timely development of land for office purposes in
accordance with the objectives, policies and proposals of this chapter; to
discourage any land use which would interfere with the use of the District as
an employment and service center and to assure suitable design to protect the
residential environment of adjacent and nearby neighborhoods . It is further
hereby declared to be the intent of the Township to provide the office center
with a minimum of traffic congestion, overcrowding of land, noise, glare and
pollution, so as to lessen the danger to the public safety. The protective
standards contained in this article are intended to minimize any adverse effect
of the office center on nearby property values and to provide for safe and
efficient use of the office center itself. [Amended 1-10-1995 by Ord. No. 879]
   B.   The governing body shall make a determination prior to the
establishment of an Office Center District that there is a need for
diversification of land use to support new and improved municipal service and
facilities, that said Office Center District is integrated in a general plan of
land use and that the density of population within an Office Center District
will not have an adverse effect on the overall employee and/or density of
population in the Township.
§ 255-59.   Authorization.
The governing body may authorize as an amendment to the Zoning Map the
designation of an area as an OC Office Center District for the location of an
integrated office center, subject to the regulations of this and any pertinent
article of this chapter, as amended.

legislation (Ord. 25-1400, passed 3-11-2025). The text of the amendment will be
incorporated below when the amending legislation is codified.
The general plan for an office center shall be executed in accordance with the
following essential conditions:
   A.   The development shall consist of a harmonious selection of uses and
groupings of buildings , service and parking areas, circulation and open
spaces, planned and designed as an integrated unit, in such a manner as to
constitute a safe, efficient and convenient office center.

overall plan and shall be designed with complementary architectural concepts
and with appropriate landscaping.
   C.   The total lot area shall be not less than 25 acres.
   D.   All buildings shall be arranged in a well-related manner.
   E.   The maximum building coverage shall be 20% of the square foot area of
the lot , plus 2.5% per acre multiplied by the lot area in acres, not to exceed
40%. For example: lot area of two acres: 20% plus 5% (2 times 2.5) equals 25%.
Impervious surface : the maximum impervious surface of a lot shall not exceed
60%. [Amended 9-14-2004 by Ord. No. 1138]
   F.   The maximum height of any building or structure erected or enlarged in
an OC Office Center District shall be 65 feet. The height of a building shall
be a building's vertical measurement from the mean level of the ground abutting
the building to a point midway between the highest and the lowest points of the
main roof levels. Said height may be increased by parapets, but not in excess
of three feet; and by chimneys and housings for equipment, provided that said
housings for equipment shall not be in excess of 15 feet in height and provided
that they shall not occupy more than 10% of the roof area. Building units
constructed with continuous walls and joined on several floor levels shall be
considered one building in calculating building height.
   G.   Adequate areas shall be provided for loading and unloading of delivery
trucks and other vehicles, servicing of offices by refuse collection, fuel,

screened from view from any abutting roadway and from within the parking area.
   H.   Provision shall be made for safe and efficient ingress and egress to
and from public streets and highways servicing the office center without undue
congestion to or interference with normal traffic flow. The governing body
shall satisfy itself as to the adequacy of the thoroughfares to carry the
additional traffic engendered by the office center. The developer shall obtain
from the governing body permission to determine and locate the access to the
abutting highways. Should the concerned governing body require as a condition
of approval the erection and maintenance of a traffic control system, the
required system shall be erected at the cost of the developer.
   I.   No building may be located closer than:
      (1)   Two hundred feet to a public highway or right-of-way , except as
provided in Subsection I(3) herein;
      (2)   One hundred fifty feet to any property line, except as provided in
Subsection I(3) herein;
      (3)   One hundred feet to any toll or controlled public highway; and (4)

   J.   No parking area may be located closer than:
      (1)   Two hundred feet to a public highway or right-of-way except as
provided in Subsection J(3) herein;
      (2)   Fifty feet to any property line or any residential zoned district;
and (3) Fifty feet to any toll or controlled public highway.
   K.   No service area may be located closer than 100 feet to a residential
zoned district. A service area shall include the area provided for the loading
and unloading of delivery trucks and other vehicles and the servicing of
offices by refuse collection, fuel, fire and other service vehicles.
   L.   No driveway may be located closer than 25 feet to a side or rear
property line adjacent to an agricultural or residential zoned district.
   M.   Adequate off-street parking shall be provided in accordance with the
requirements of Article XIX, §
255-135C(5) of this chapter.
   N.   Where parking areas and/or buildings in an office center are located
within 200 feet of an abutting residential district, there shall be a buffer
area along that portion of the residential district line which is within 200
feet of said parking area and/or buildings , which buffer area shall be at
least 25 feet measured from the residential district line, and said buffer area
shall be used for no purpose other than planting and landscaping. There shall
be a twenty-five-foot buffer area along street frontage occupied by an OC
Office Center District, which area shall be used for no purpose other than
planting and landscaping.
   O.   Parking, loading or service areas used by motor vehicles shall be
located entirely within the lot lines of the office center and shall be
physically separated from public streets .
   P.   All utility lines within the lot lines of the office center district
shall be placed underground.
   Q.   All materials, including trash, supplies, rubbish, refuse, etc., shall
be stored within the buildings . They shall not be handled so as to give rise
to smoke, odor or litter. An odor violation will be determined in accordance
with
Chapter 158 of this Code. [Amended 5-13-1997 by Ord. No. 943]
   R.   Lighting facilities shall be arranged in a manner which will protect
the highways and neighboring properties from unreasonable direct glare or
hazardous interference of any kind.
   S.   No office center permitted in an office center district shall be
erected or used that is not adequately served with both public sanitary sewers
and public water. This section shall not be interpreted to exclude the use of
water obtained from the surface or ground, provided that such sources can be
developed on the premises without impairment to similar services on adjacent or
nearby properties or to public water supplies. No on-site sanitary sewer
disposal system shall be permitted.
   T.   For the purpose of calculating the minimum area lot dimension and yard
requirements established by this section, a single planned office center
district cannot lie on two sides of a public street or highway. Any area
designated as being an OC Office Center District and lying on both sides of a
public street or highway shall be deemed to be two Office Center Districts, and
all minimum requirements shall be met by buildings on each side of said public
street or highway as separate districts. The OC Office Center District shall be
unified and contiguous in shape.
   U.   The governing body may prescribe particular requirements or any further
reasonable conditions deemed appropriate with respect to the suitability of the
office center in harmonious relationship to surrounding areas.

quality and quantity of surface and subsurface water supplies adjacent to and
underlying areas subject to flooding and to promote safe and sanitary drainage.
      (4)   Permit only those uses which can be appropriately located in a
floodplain area as herein defined and which will not impede the flow or storage
of floodwaters or otherwise cause danger to life and property at, above or
below their locations along the floodplain .
      (5)   Protect adjacent landowners and those both upstream and downstream
from damages resulting from development within a floodplain and the consequent
obstruction or increase in flow of floodwaters.
      (6)   Protect the entire Township from individual uses of land in a
floodplain area which may have an effect upon subsequent expenditures for
public works and disaster relief and adversely affect the economic well-being
of the Township.

wildlife, vegetation and marine life, dependent upon watercourses and water
areas.
      (8)   Protect other municipalities within the same watershed from the
impact of improper development and the consequent increased potential for
flooding.
      (9)   Provide areas for the deposition of flood -borne sediment.
      (10)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods be developed so as to be
protected from flood damage in accordance with the requirements of the Federal
Flood Insurance Program.
§ 255-161.   Overlay district.
   A.   The Floodplain Conservation District (also referred to as “Floodplain
District”) as defined and described by this chapter shall be deemed an overlay
district where applicable on any zoning district now or hereafter delineated on
the Township Zoning Map.
   B.   Should the Floodplain Conservation District (“FCD”) be declared
inapplicable to any parcel of land by reason of action by the Township Zoning
Officer, the Zoning Hearing Board, or any court of competent jurisdiction, the
zoning applicable to such parcel shall be deemed to be the district in which
the parcel is located, without consideration of the Floodplain Conservation
District.
   C.   Should the zoning of any parcel or any part thereof over which the
Floodplain Conservation District is located be changed through any legislative
or administrative actions or judicial discretion, such change shall have no
effect on the Floodplain Conservation District unless such change was made with
respect to the Floodplain Conservation District.
   D.   It shall be unlawful for any person , partnership, business or
corporation to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or
development anywhere within Upper Dublin Township unless the proposed work has

buildings or structures .
§ 255-162.   Establishment; boundaries.
[Amended 7-13-2021 by Ord. No. 21-1371, § 2]
   A.   The Floodplain Conservation District is established as those areas of
the Township subject to flooding as defined in the following enumerated
subsections, with the most extensive of those areas described in the following
subsections determining the outermost boundary of the Floodplain Conservation
District:
      (1)   Floodplain Area. Those areas of the Township classified as Special
Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) and subject to inundation by the waters of the one-
hundred-year flood as identified in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and
delineated on the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) for Upper
Dublin Township and Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, dated March 2, 2016,
prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and all subsequent
revisions thereto, including all digital data developed as part of the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) . Said floodplain areas shall be comprised of
subdistricts as follows:
         (a)   Floodway (FW). That portion of the Floodplain Conservation
District identified as “Floodway” in the AE Zone in the Flood Insurance Study
prepared by FEMA. The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified as Floodway
on the FIRM as well as those floodway areas which have been identified in other
available studies or sources of information for those special floodplain areas
where no floodway has been identified in the FIS. The floodway represents the
channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be preserved to
discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface
elevation by more than one foot at any point.
            (i)   Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill,
new construction , substantial improvements , or other development shall be
permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
            (ii)   Within any floodway area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed unless a permit is obtained from the Pennsylvania Department
of Environmental Protection.
         (b)   Floodway Fringe (FF). Those portions of land within the
Floodplain Conservation District subject to inundation by the 100-year flood ,
lying beyond the floodway in areas where detailed study data and profiles are
available.
         (c)   Approximated Floodplain (FA). Those portions of land within the
Floodplain Conservation District subject to inundation by the 100-year flood ,
where a detailed study has not been performed, but where a 100-year floodplain
boundary has been approximated. When available, information from other federal,
state and other acceptable sources shall be used to determine the 100-year-
flood elevation, as well as a floodway area, if possible. When no other
information is available, the 100-year elevation shall be determined by using a
point on the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site in question.
      (2)   The AE Area/District without floodway consists of those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and
for which base flood elevations have been provided in the FIS but no floodway
has been delineated.
         (a)   In the AE Area/District without floodway , no new construction ,
development , use or activity shall be permitted unless it can be demonstrated
that the cumulative effect of all past and projected development will not
increase the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) by more than one foot.
         (b)   No permit shall be granted for any construction , development ,
use , or activity within any AE Area/District without floodway unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development would not,
together with all other existing and anticipated development , increase the BFE
more than one foot.
         (c)   No new construction or development shall be located within the
area measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse , unless
the appropriate permits are obtained from the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection.
      (3)   The A Area/District shall be the areas identified as an A Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no 1% annual chance
flood elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and floodway
information from other federal, state, or other acceptable source shall be used
when available. Where other acceptable information is not available, the
elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary
of the Floodplain Conservation District which is nearest the construction site.
      (4)   The Shallow Flooding Area District shall be those areas identified
as Zones AO and AH on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject to
inundation by 1%-annual chance of shallow flooding where average depths are
between one and three feet. In Zones AO and AH, drainage paths shall be
established to guide floodwaters around and away from structures on slopes.
      (5)   Areas containing soils with a frequency of flooding of 1% or
greater per year, as determined by the Natural Resources Conservation Service,
United States Department of Agriculture Web-Based Soil Survey (available online
at http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov), including the following soils:
         (a)   Bowmansville-Knauers (Bo)
         (b)   Buckingham Silt Loam (BwA)
         (c)   Cordorus (Ch)
         (d)   Hatboro (Ha)
         (e)   Rowland (Rt)
         (f)   Rowland (RwA)
         (g)   Rowland (RwB)
         (h)   Urban Land (UgB)
      (6)   Areas containing hydric soils as determined by the following Hydric
Soil Boundary Short Procedure. A landowner, upon executing an agreement with
the Township Board of Commissioners, may submit detailed soil profiles and a
report to the Township Engineer for purposes of determining hydric soil
classification and the boundary of the Floodplain Conservation District. If the
Township Engineer and the landowner agree that the site specific information
supplied by the landowner indicates an accurate classification of the soils,
then the Township Board of Commissioners will accept the extent of hydric soil
as the boundary of the Floodplain Conversation District if not in conflict with
the Floodplain Area and the Community Identified Flood Hazard Areas.
      (7)   Community Identified Flood Hazard Areas shall be those areas where
Upper Dublin Township has identified local flood hazard or ponding areas, as
delineated and adopted on a “Local Flood Hazard Map” using best available
topographic data and locally derived information such as floods of record,
historic high water marks, soils or approximate study methodologies.
      (8)   Areas not reflected above, but which may be subject to inundation.
These areas shall be identified by field survey and by hydrologic and hydraulic
calculation and shall be subject to the review and approval of the Township
Engineer, who shall make the determination as to the outermost boundary.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional
engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the
technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the Township.
   B.   The boundaries of the Floodplain Conservation District may be revised
or modified by the Board of Commissioners from time to time upon recommendation
by the Township Engineer after application and presentation of detailed
engineering studies where studies or information provided by a qualified agency
or person documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such
change, approval must be obtained from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as
practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, the Township will notify FEMA of the changes by submitting
technical or scientific data.
   C.   The Flood Insurance Studies (FISs) used to establish the boundaries of
the Floodplain Conservation District and the Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs)
will be available in the Township Municipal Building for review and reference.
    D.   Whenever there is a difference between any map setting forth the
Floodplain Conservation District or a portion thereof and the data contained in
the studies, the data contained in the studies shall determine the boundary of
the Floodplain Conservation District.
§ 255-163.   Boundary disputes.
   A.   Should a dispute with respect to the boundaries of the Floodplain
Conservation District arise, an initial determination of the boundaries shall
be made by the Township Zoning Officer after review and comment on the boundary
dispute by the Township Engineer.
   B.   Any party aggrieved by a decision of the Township Zoning Officer as to
the boundaries of the Floodplain Conservation District may appeal the decision
to the Zoning Hearing Board as provided by this chapter. The burden of proof in
such an appeal shall be on the appellant.
   C.   Insofar as various natural conditions, including the Floodplain
Conservation District, may change, such changes may be determined by detailed
on-site survey techniques and hydrologic and hydraulic studies. The Zoning
Hearing Board shall determine whether a proposed use is within the Floodplain
Conservation District upon appeal from a decision of the Township Zoning
Officer. The Zoning Hearing Board may consider the findings of a detailed on-
site survey and hydrologic and hydraulic studies presented by the landowner
and/or applicant, and other evidence presented by the landowner and/or
applicant and other parties recognized by the Zoning Hearing Board who may
support or oppose the decision of the Township Zoning Officer.
   D.   All changes to the boundaries of the Floodplain Conservation District
are subject to the review and approval of the Federal Insurance Administrator.
§ 255-164.   Permitted uses.

and/or the Montgomery County Conservation District at least 30 days prior to
the hearing on the application for conditional use or variance.
   B.   The Board of Commissioners and Zoning Hearing Board shall exercise
discretion in allowing only those uses which are substantially in accord with
the stated intent of this chapter and Article. An applicant shall demonstrate
to the Board of Commissioners, in considering conditional uses , and the Zoning
Hearing Board, in considering variance applications, the following:
      (1)   The effect of the use shall not substantially alter the cross-
section profile of the watercourse and floodplain at the location of the
proposed use .
      (2)   Lands abutting the watercourse , both upstream and downstream,
shall not be unreasonably adversely affected by the proposed use .
      (3)   The general welfare or public interest of Upper Dublin Township or
other municipalities in the same watershed shall not be adversely affected.

this Article would create undue hardship by denying a reasonable use of an
existing lot which is situated either wholly or partially in the Floodplain
Conservation District.
   C.   An affirmative decision shall not be issued by the Board of
Commissioners or the Zoning Hearing Board for an application within the
designated floodway unless the effect of such proposed activity on flood
heights is fully offset by accompanying stream improvements .
   D.   The Board of Commissioners or the Zoning Hearing Board shall notify the
applicant, in writing, that the issuance of a decision to allow construction of
a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium
rates for flood insurance, and such construction below the base flood elevation
increases risk to life and property.
   E.   The Township shall maintain a record of all decisions and
notifications, including jurisdiction for their issuance and the Township shall
report such decisions to the appropriate agencies.
   F.   Elevation and floodproofing of structures .
      (1)   Any new structures permitted by conditional use or by variance
shall be constructed and placed on the land so as to offer the minimum
obstruction to the flow of water and shall be designed to have a minimum effect
upon the watercourse flow and base flood elevation . Such structures shall be
elevated in accordance with the provisions contained in this Article, and
Chapter 73, Building Construction, as amended.
      (2)   Any new structure permitted as a conditional use or by variance
shall be floodproofed in accordance with the provisions contained in this
Article, and
Chapter 73, Building Construction, as amended.
         (a)   All new structures shall be firmly anchored in accordance with
accepted engineering practices to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement.
         (b)   All new structures shall be constructed so as to prevent the
entrance of floodwaters into the water supply and waste treatment systems as
well as other utility and facility systems. In addition, waste treatment
systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate discharges from the systems
into the floodwaters.
      (3)   Any additions to existing structures permitted as a conditional use
or by variance shall be elevated to the greatest extent possible according to
the provisions contained in this Article, and Chapter 73, Building
Construction, as amended. However, any portion of the structure not so elevated
shall be floodproofed in accordance with the provisions contained in this
Article, and
Chapter 73, Building Construction, as amended.
      (4)   Any new structure permitted as a conditional use or by variance
shall be provided with two means of access across the property to the structure
, one of which shall serve as an alternate vehicle access outside of the
Floodplain Conservation District.
      (5)   For any new structure permitted as a conditional use or by variance
shall have filed with the Township Fire Services Department and other
appropriate disaster preparedness authorities an evacuation plan indicating
alternate vehicular access to and escape routes from the structure .
§ 255-169.   Variances.
   A.   If compliance with the elevation or floodproofing requirements stated
in this chapter would result in an exceptional hardship for a prospective
builder, developer or landowner, the Zoning Hearing Board may, upon request,
grant relief from the strict application of the requirement. Relief issued
shall conform to the following conditions:
      (1)   If granted, a variance shall involve only the least modification
necessary to provide relief.
      (2)   In granting any variance, the Zoning Hearing Board shall attach
reasonable conditions and safeguards necessary to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare of the Township and to achieve the objectives of this
Article.
      (3)   Whenever a variance is granted, the Zoning Hearing Board shall
notify the applicant in writing that:
         (a)   The variance may result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance.
         (b)   The variance may increase risks to life and property.
      (4)   In considering any request for a variance, the Zoning Hearing Board
shall consider, at a minimum, the following:
         (a)   That there is good and sufficient cause for the variance,
including:
            (i)   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or
exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions
and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of
the zoning ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located.
            (ii)   That because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity
with the provisions of the zoning ordinance and that the authorization of a
variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
            (iii)   That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
            (iv)   That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the
essential character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or
development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
         (b)   That failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant.
         (c)   That the granting of the variance will:
            (i)   Neither result in an unacceptable or prohibited increase in
flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public
expense;
            (ii)   Nor create nuisances, cause fraud on, or victimize the
public, or conflict with any other applicable state or local ordinances and
regulations.

§ 255-173.   Powers and duties.
The Board shall have the following powers:
   A.   Appeals and interpretations. To hear and decide appeals where it is
alleged that there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or
determination made by any administrative official in the enforcement of said
Act or of this chapter adopted pursuant thereto. To interpret upon the words,
terms, rules, regulations, provisions and restrictions of this chapter where
there is doubt as to the meaning thereof, including determination in specific

a variance, special exception or any other challenge brought before it in
accordance with this chapter or the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,
40 the Board shall, among other things: [Amended 1-10-1995 by Ord. No. 879]
      (1)   Consider the suitability of the property for the use desired;
assure itself that the proposed change is consistent with the spirit, purpose
and intent of this chapter.
      (2)   Determine that the proposed change will not substantially injure or
detract from the use of neighboring property or from the character of the
neighborhood and that the use of the property adjacent to the area included in
the proposed change or plan is adequately safeguarded.
      (3)   Determine that the proposed change will serve the best interests of
the Township, the convenience of the community (where applicable) and the
public welfare.
      (4)   Consider the effect of the proposed change upon the logical,
efficient and economical extension of the public service and facilities such as
public water, sewers, police and fire protection and public schools .
      (5)   Consider the suitability of the proposed location of an industrial
or commercial use with respect to the probable effects upon highway traffic and
assure adequate access arrangements in order to protect major streets from
undue congestion and hazard.
      (6)   Be guided in its study, review and recommendation by sound
standards of subdivision practice, where applicable.
      (7)   Determine that there are special circumstances or conditions fully
described in the findings applying to the land or buildings for which the
variance is sought, which circumstances or conditions are such that the
application of the provisions of this chapter should deprive the applicant of
the reasonable use of such land or building .
      (8)   Determine that the unique circumstances for which the variance is
sought were neither created by the owner of the property nor were due to or the
result of general conditions in the district in which the property is located.
   B.   Conditions should be increased greatly in detail, especially when
reviewing special exceptions . The Board should state the methods of plan
preparation, review and approval (Planning Commission and Commissioners) and
what zoning ordinances and/or subdivision regulations apply and impose such
conditions, in addition to those required, as are necessary to assure that the
intent of this chapter is complied with, which conditions may include but are
not limited to harmonious design of buildings , planting and its maintenance as
a sign or sound screen, the minimizing of noxious, offensive or hazardous
elements and adequate standards of parking and sanitation.

ARTICLE XXXII
JT Jarrettown Village District
[Added 4-19-2005 by Ord. No. 1150]
§ 255-237.   Legislative intent.
The Jarrettown Village District is intended and designed to:
   A.   Apply only to properties that contain existing historic resources as
determined by the Board of Commissioners.
   B.   Require the preservation of existing historic buildings by permitting
their renovation and adaptive reuse for a variety of residential and
nonresidential uses and by providing a variety of incentives to preserve
existing historic buildings .
   C.   Provide for the creation of a pedestrian-friendly village center
composed of limited commercial and office uses as well as residential uses ,
all of which are compatible with the existing residential neighborhood .
   D.   Provide regulations that permit infill development at a scale and
intensity that is appropriate for surrounding neighborhoods , in an
architectural style that is compatible with existing historic buildings .
   E.   Require building additions to be to the rear or side of existing
structures and to reflect the design elements of existing structures with
respect to massing, texture, building materials, color, and fenestration.
   F.   Require buffering and landscaping to protect adjacent residential
neighborhoods .
§ 255-238.   Applicability.
   A.   The Jarrettown Village District shall be deemed an overlay on any
zoning district now or hereafter applicable to any lot located within the
District, provided that lot contains a historic resource , as determined by the
Board of Commissioners.
      (1)   The Jarrettown Hotel, situated at the intersection of Jarrettown
Road and Limekiln Pike, was built in 1847. It served the community as a hotel
for more than 125 years and currently operates as a restaurant . It is an
established and familiar visual feature within Jarrettown. This well known
landmark has significant character, interest and value as part of the
development , heritage and cultural character of Upper Dublin Township.
Therefore, the Board of Commissioners designates the Jarrettown Hotel as the
primary historic resource on North Limekiln Pike. As such, any development of
this parcel under the provisions of this overlay district must retain and
preserve this structure in its entirety.
      (2)   According to historic records, just east of the Jarrettown Hotel on
the same property there was barn barn or large shed. In 1896, a tornado
severely damaged the original structure , collapsing a wall and the roof. The
existing stone stable/barn is larger than the original structure and is
believed to have been rebuilt after that time. Therefore, the Board of
Commissioners designates the existing barn /stable as a contributing resource
on North Limekiln Pike. As such, any development of this parcel under the
provisions of this overlay district must retain and preserve the facade of the
structure visible from the public right-of-way , that being the northeast and
northwest facades.
   B.   Criteria for designation. A building , structure or site, or a complex
of the same, may be placed on the Historic Resource Inventory if it meets any
three or more of the following criteria:
      (1)   Has significant character, interest or value as part of the
development , heritage or cultural characteristics of the Township, county,
region, commonwealth or nation, or is associated with the life of a person
significant in the past;
      (2)   Is associated with an event of importance to the history of the
Township, county, region, commonwealth or nation;
      (3)   Embodies an icon associated with an era characterized by a
distinctive architectural style;
      (4)   Embodies distinguishing characteristics of an architectural style
or engineering specimen;
      (5)   Is the noteworthy work of a designer, architect, landscape
architect or designer, or engineer whose work has significantly influenced the
historical, architectural, economic, social, or cultural development of the
Township, county, region, commonwealth or nation
      (6)   Contains elements of design, detail, materials or craftsmanship
which represent a significant innovation;
      (7)   Is part of or related to a commercial center, park, community or
other distinctive area which should be preserved according to a historic,
cultural or architectural motif;
      (8)   Owing to its unique location or singular physical characteristic,
represents an established and familiar visual feature of the neighborhood ,
community or Township;
      (9)   Has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in
pre-history or history; or
      (10)   Exemplifies the cultural, political, economic, social or
historical heritage of the community.

ARTICLE XXXIII
FW Ft. Washington Village District
[Added 2-13-2007 by Ord. No. 1182]
§ 255-243.   Legislative intent.
In addition to the purpose set forth in §
255-2 of Article I of this chapter, this article is intended to recognize the
unique characteristics of a portion of the Ft. Washington area of Upper Dublin
Township, designated in this Code as the FW Ft. Washington Village District
(FWVD). The FWVD lies between Pennsylvania Avenue, a primary, state owned
arterial, on the south, and a quiet, single-family residential neighborhood on
the north. Within this area lies one of the oldest properties in the Township
as well as several other colonial era buildings . The Fort Washington train
station, an express stop along the commuter rail line leading into
Philadelphia, is one block south of the FWVD in Whitemarsh Township. The vision
for the Fort Washington station area is for it to become a pedestrian-oriented
mixed-use village center. Therefore, to remain vital, the provisions of the
FWVD must take advantage of and compliment the train station area and serve as
a transitional zone, buffering the adjacent residential neighborhood to the
north from the major transportation corridor existing along Pennsylvania
Avenue. More specifically, the intent of this overlay district is to:
   A.   Use scale, building orientation and landscaping to establish community
identity.
   B.   To allow and encourage a mix of residential and appropriate commercial
uses within a structure , property or a single development .
   C.   Encourage the preservation and reuse of the historic structures in the
district.
   D.   Establish appropriate design standards to protect the quality and
character of the surrounding neighborhood .
   E.   Help foster bicycle and pedestrian accessible development , reflecting
a pedestrian oriented village center rather than an auto-oriented commercial
strip.
   F.   Prohibit retail/commercial uses that are typically high volume traffic
generators, contain excessive amounts of paved areas and numerous access
points, and do not contribute to the historic character of the district.
   G.   Provide incentives that encourage shared access points, parking areas
and public-spaces.
   H.   Protect, to the greatest extent possible, the natural features of the
district including the open space, steep slopes and large trees.
§ 255-244.   District established.
[Amended 8-11-2020 by Ord. No. 20-1361, § 2]
   A.   The FWVD shall be deemed an overlay on any zoning district now or
hereafter applicable to any lot located within the District. The regulations,

   A.   Intent. The following design regulations apply to the construction and
alteration of any structure in the FWVD. It is the intent of this ordinance to
encourage pedestrian oriented design and facilitate the placement of buildings
to enhance the visual character and functionality of the space for pedestrians.
Auto oriented, suburban strip development in this area will exacerbate traffic
problems. It may also result in the loss of the historic integrity and reduce
the viability of the surrounding residential neighborhood .

the edge of the right-of-way to the place of service.
      (3)   Drive-through facilities are prohibited for all uses within the
district.
      (4)   Driveways, parking areas and traffic circulation patterns shall be
designed as shared facilities whenever feasible. The design of these elements
shall create a unified site plan between lots . The goal is to gain parking
efficiencies, reduce the number of access points and improve internal and
external vehicular circulation patterns.
      (5)   The design of newly constructed facilities shall conform to the
architectural style and scale of surrounding structures .
      (6)   Multiple dwellings unit buildings used exclusively for residential
purposes shall be designed and built to appear similar to a single-family
dwelling .

building .
         (d)   Rooflines shall be similar or complimentary to those of the
existing building .
         (e)   The applicant shall submit architectural drawings for evaluation
of the proposed principal building expansion, including building elevations and
colored renderings. The Board of Commissioners may approve expansion different
from the existing building , provided that the Board determines in approving
the land development plan that the expansion conforms in architectural style
and scale with the existing building and the intent of this article.
      (2)   Historic buildings from elsewhere are encouraged to be relocated to
this district. The Board of Commissioners may, by conditional use , relax the
requirements for exterior materials and building style to allow for such a
building relocation to this district.

      (3)   Massing. The mass of a building or buildings shall be de-emphasized
in a variety of ways, including the use of projecting and recessed elements
such as porches, windows and roof dormers. The intent is to reduce the apparent
overall bulk and volume of a structure , to enhance visual quality and
contribute to human-scaled development . Such breaks in the facades and roof
lines shall occur not more frequently than every 25 feet nor less frequently
than every 50 feet.
         (a)   Building length: If there are multiple principal buildings on a
lot the lengths of such buildings shall vary, and their average length most
closely parallel to the front yard shall not exceed 120 feet.

[Amended 8-11-2020, by Ord. No. 20-1361, § 6]
   A.   Required parking and loading. When there is more than one building on a
lot and/or within a development , the total amount of required parking shall be
divided into discreet sections. The buildings shall be directly accessible to
pedestrians from all parking areas. Entrance drives leading into a parking area
shall be multi-functional, serving for both pedestrian and vehicular access and
providing a limited amount of parking when feasible.
      (1)   Minimum parking requirements shall be calculated utilizing the
standards set forth in Article XIX, except for in a Mixed Use development where
residential units require 1.5 spaces per unit.
      (2)   Two way parking aisle widths may be reduced to a minimum of 22
feet, by conditional use , provided emergency, service and delivery vehicles
can safely service buildings on the property as determined by the Township
Engineer.
      (3)   Areas used for loading or trash receptacle purposes proximate to
residential uses /zoning districts shall be screened from view. Noise, sound
and odors associated with these uses shall not be discernable at the property
line.
      (4)   Buildings and structures , excluding parking structures , must
provide adequate area for loading/unloading entirely within the property lines
of the premises.
      (5)   Bicycle storage. Sufficient area for the storage of bicycles shall
be provided as approved by the Township Engineer, including racks or other
permanently affixed storage devices to accommodate one bicycle for each five
required vehicular parking spaces , at a minimum. Bicycle storage facilities
may be held in reserve upon approval of the Township Engineer upon a finding
that the requirements set forth herein exceed the foreseeable need therefor.
   B.   Shared access. In an effort to reduce the total number of curb cuts
within the district, as well as to enhance internal vehicular circulation,
promote traffic safety and reduce congestion on adjacent public roads ,
applicants shall as part of any proposed development , either eliminate two or
more existing curb cuts by the merger of properties, or allow for future access
to adjacent properties with the FWVD by seeking agreements for shared vehicular
access.
      (1)   When two or more abutting lots share an access driveway, that
driveway shall be designed as the main access to those lots .
      (2)   Shared access may be located entirely on one lot or be split across
a common lot line .

mechanisms shall be submitted to the Board of Commissioners with the
application for land development approval.
      (4)   Impervious cover limits may be increased by 5% over the percentage
limit applicable to each parcel that is party to a shared access agreement.
   C.   Shared parking. Required parking may be located on an abutting lot and
along or across a common lot line , provided both properties are commercially
zoned and/or are developed in accordance with the FWVD regulations.
      (1)   The required aggregate parking capacity may be reduced up to 50% by
the Board of Commissioners and held in reserve, where shared parking allows
greater efficiency for the uses proposed, subject to review and recommendation
by the Township Engineer.
         (a)   Regardless of the number of spaces actually developed, the
parking area shall be designed to accommodate the aggregate number of parking
spaces normally required. The area which is proposed to be left undeveloped
shall be shown on the land development plan as “reserved parking area.” This
area shall be planted with vegetative cover and integrated into the site’s
landscaping plan. Such area shall be developed as designed if and when the
Zoning Officer determines the spaces are needed.
   D.   Parking location.
      (1)   Surface parking lots shall be located behind or to the side of the
principle buildings .
      (2)   If surface parking is visible from the street frontage, then a
fence, wall or plantings shall be provided to maintain the street edge and to
buffer views of the parked cars. (§
255-252.B)
         (a)   In no case shall surface parking lots occupy more than of the
parcel’s frontage along a pedestrian oriented street or street segment.

ARTICLE XXXV
Alternative Energy
[Added 5-14-2013 by Ord. No. 13-1275]
§ 255-259.   Intent.
The purpose of this article is to promote and regulate the safe, effective and
efficient use of alternative energy sources and to encourage the reduction of
on-site consumption of utility supplied energy while protecting the health,
safety and welfare of the public and adjacent and surrounding land uses .
§ 255-260.   Definitions.
   A.   As used in this article, the following electricity and energy terms
shall have the meanings indicated:
      ALTERNATING CURRENT (AC) — An electric current whose direction reverses
cyclically, as opposed to direct current (DC) , whose direction remains
constant. AC is the form of consumer electricity that is delivered to a home or
business.
      ALTERNATIVE ENERGY — As used in this chapter, the term “alternative
energy” shall include geothermal energy, solar energy , wind energy, and
biomass energy sources. Alternative energy sources may at times be referred to
as renewable energy sources.
      DIRECT CURRENT (DC) — The constant flow of electric current in one
direction. DC electricity always flows in the same direction, which
distinguishes it from alternating current (AC) .
      ELECTRIC METER — A device used to measure and record the amount of
electricity used or generated.
      INTERCONNECTION — Interfacing an on-site electricity generator, to the
electric distribution system (i.e., the grid). This configuration allows an on-
site electricity generating system to operate in parallel with the grid. For
small systems, the point of interconnection is through a circuit breaker of the
main electric service panel on-site, or it could be a supply tap on the service
line just before the main electric service panel.
      INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENT — A legal document between a customer and an
electric utility authorizing the connection of the customer’s on-site
electricity generating system to the utility’s electric grid.
      INVERTER — A device that converts direct current (DC) electricity into
alternating current (AC) electricity that can be used in a home or building .
      LOAD — The amount of power carried by a utility system or the amount of
power consumed by an electric customer at a specific time. Base load is the
minimum constant level of electricity required by utility customers; peak load
is the amount of electricity required at the time of greatest demand.
      NET METERING — An approach for interconnecting and metering on-site
electricity generating facilities. The means of measuring the difference
between electricity supplied by an electric utility, electric distribution
company, or electric generation supplier and the electricity generated by a
customer-generator using alternative energy sources. Net metering allows
customers to use excess on-site generated electricity to offset utility-
purchased electricity on a monthly or annual basis.
      NET METERING AGREEMENT — An agreement with a customer-generator and an
electric utility, electric distribution company, or electric generation
supplier and the electricity generated by a customer generator that allows
customers to receive a credit at the retail price of electricity for surplus
electricity generated on-site. Under net metering agreement, a bidirectional
electric meter is used to measure and record the flow of electricity in both
directions from and to the customer-generator.
      POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENT (PPA) — A contract to purchase energy. A PPA is
usually established between a party that generates electricity and a party that
purchases electricity. A PPA may also be a contract written between a building
owner that wants to generate electricity on site and a third-party developer
who will install, maintain and own the system used to generate the electricity,
and then sell the electricity produced by the system to the building owner at a
pre-determined rate.
      TIME-OF-USE (TOU) METER — An electric meter that measures and records the
times when a customer consumes or generates electricity during utility defined
on-peak and off- peak periods. This type of meter is used for customers who are
on time-of-use rates .
      TIME-OF-USE (TOU) RATES — Electricity prices that vary depending on the
time period in which the energy is consumed or produced. In a time-of-use rate
structure , higher prices are charged during utility peak-load times. Such
rates can provide an incentive for consumers to curb power use during peak
times.
      TONNAGE — A measure of cooling power. One ton of cooling power is
produced by one ton of ice. One ton of cooling power is equal to 12,000 Btu/hr
or 3.51 kW. In the United States, heat pumps and air conditioners are rated on
tonnage. A typical U.S. residence of 2,000– 2,400 square feet will require a
three to four ton cooling unit.
      WATT — A unit of electric power measurement.
         KILOWATT (kW) — A unit of electric power equal to 1,000 watts , which
constitutes the basic unit of electric demand. The watt is a measurement of
power (not energy) and is the rate (not the duration) at which electricity is
used. One thousand kW is equal to one megawatt (MW).
         KILOWATT—HOUR (kWh) — A unit of electric energy, equivalent to the use
of one kilowatt of electricity for one full hour. One kilowatt-hour (kWh) = the
amount of electricity required to burn a 100 watt light bulb for 10 hours.
Utilities measure customers’ electric energy usage on the basis of kilowatt-
hours , and electricity rates are most commonly expressed in cents per
kilowatt-hour.
         MEGAWATT (MW) — Unit of electric power equal to 1,000 kW, or 1,000,000
watts .
      WATT-HOUR (Wh) — A unit of energy measurement, equal to one watt of power
used for one hour.
   B.   As used in this article, the following geothermal energy terms shall
have the meaning indicated:
      GEOTHERMAL BOREHOLE or BOREHOLE — A hole drilled or bored into the earth
into which piping is inserted for use in a closed vertical loop geothermal
system .
      GEOTHERMAL ENERGY SYSTEM — An alternative energy system serving as a
mechanism for heat exchange that uses the Earth’s thermal properties in
conjunction with electricity to provide greater efficiency in the heating and
cooling of buildings . The most common form of geothermal energy in
Pennsylvania comes from shallow bore heat pumps, which capitalize on the
constant temperature within the Earth’s upper crust. A fluid in a system of
tubes is used to transfer energy to and from the Earth to provide cooling in
the summer and warmth in the winter. Boreholes are drilled and pipes are buried
in the ground. Fluid is circulated through the system. In summer, the fluid
takes heat from a building and moves it to the Earth. In winter, the fluid
absorbs heat from the Earth and transfers it to the building . Geothermal heat
pumps come in two basic configurations: closed loop and open loop systems.
      CLOSED HORIZONTAL LOOP GEOTHERMAL SYSTEM — A mechanism for heat exchange
that consists of the following basic elements: underground loops of piping;
heat transfer fluid; a heat pump; and an air distribution system. An opening is
made in the Earth. A series of pipes are installed into the opening and
connected to a heat exchange system in the building . The pipes form a closed
loop and are filled with a heat transfer fluid. The fluid is circulated through
the piping from the opening into the heat exchanger and back. This type of
geothermal system is usually the most cost effective when trenches are easy to
dig and the available land area is adequate. Workers use a backhoe to dig the
trenches three to six feet below the ground in which they lay a series of
parallel plastic pipes. A typical horizontal loop will require 400–600 feet of
tubing per ton of heating and cooling capacity.
      CLOSED VERTICAL LOOP GEOTHERMAL SYSTEM—This type of geothermal mechanism
for heat exchange is used where there is little available land area, when
surface rocks make digging impractical, or when disruption to the landscape is
to be avoided. Vertical boreholes approximately 100 to 450 feet deep are bored
into the ground, and a single loop of pipe with a U-bend at the bottom of the
borehole is inserted before the borehole is filled. The pipes are connected to
the heat exchanger and heat transfer fluid is circulated through the pipes.
      OPEN HORIZONTAL LOOP GEOTHERMAL SYSTEM — Water is pumped from a water-
well or surface water source into a heat exchanger located in a building . The
water drawn from the Earth or water body is then pumped back into the ground or
discharged to the water body. In the heating mode, cooler water is returned to
the Earth or water body, and in the cooling mode, warmer water is returned to
the Earth or water body.
      STANDING COLUMN WELL GEOTHERMAL SYSTEM — A standing column well
geothermal system is a specialized type of open loop system. It is a
groundwater heat pump system that uses groundwater drawn from wells in a semi-
open loop arrangement. The ground heat exchanger in such systems consists of a
vertical borehole that is filled with groundwater up to the level of the water
table. Water is circulated from the well through the heat pump in an open-loop
pipe circuit. Water is drawn from the bottom of a deep rock well, passed
through a heat pump, and returned to the top of the well, where traveling
downwards it exchanges heat with the surrounding bedrock.

module makes from the horizontal) and the azimuth .
      PASSIVE SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM — A solar energy collection system that
captures light or heat from the sun through use of materials with favorable
thermal mass or light dispersing properties. Passive solar energy systems are
demand side systems and may be used to heat water, air, other building mass, or
to direct sunlight into a building for illumination purposes.
      SOLAR ACCESS — The ability of sunlight to shine on a property owner’s

greater than two square feet, the purpose of which is to convert solar energy
into electrical or thermal energy.
      SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) SYSTEM — Solar energy system that uses a
semiconductor to convert sunlight directly into electricity. A solar cell, or
photovoltaic (PV) cell, converts sunlight into electric current using the
photoelectric effect. A flow of direct current (DC) electricity is produced
when sunlight strikes solar cells containing a photovoltaic material. The DC
energy produced by the modules is then fed into an inverter that converts DC
power into AC power, which in turn is fed into a main electrical panel to power
a home or business. A PV solar cell produces a small amount of power. To
produce more power, PV cells (about 40) may be interconnected to form PV panels
or PV modules . If more power is needed, several PV modules may be installed in
a rack to form a PV array .
      SOLAR RELATED EQUIPMENT — Items including a solar photovoltaic cell,

or an antifreeze solution, or to heat a gas, such as air. Solar thermal systems
are most commonly utilized for heating domestic hot water systems, though they
are also used for space heating, heating swimming pools, and even space
cooling.

outdoors to transfer heat to building interiors. It often resembles a small
shed with a smokestack on top. An outdoor wood-fired boiler works by heating a
water jacket that surrounds the firebox. The heated water is then used to
transfer heat to a heating system in a building . An outdoor wood-fired boiler
is designed to:
         (a)   Burn clean wood or other fuels specifically tested and listed
for use by the manufacturer.

§ A261-38.1.   Early retirement benefit.
[Added 1-9-2001 by Ord. No. 1054]
   A.   There is hereby established an early retirement benefit which shall be
available to a member of the police force with 20 or more years of continuous
service who terminates employment prior to the completion of superannuation
retirement age and service requirements and who files a written application for
an early retirement benefit with the Upper Dublin Township Board of
Commissioners (“Board”).
   B.   The early retirement benefit shall become effective as of the date the
application is filed with the Board or the date designated on the application,
whichever is later, and shall be the actuarial equivalent of a partial
superannuation retirement benefit calculated as follows:
      (1)   A partial superannuation retirement benefit shall be determined by
applying the percentage that the member’s years of service bear to the years of
service that the member would have rendered had the member continued to be
employed until his superannuation retirement date to the gross pension amount
calculated using the monthly average salary during the appropriate period prior
to his termination of employment.
      (2)   The actuarial equivalent of the partial superannuation retirement
benefit shall be determined by actuarially reducing the partial superannuation
retirement benefit to reflect that it will commence on the effective date of
the early retirement rather than on the date on which the member would have
completed superannuation age and service requirements. The actuarial reduction
shall be calculated using the actuarial assumptions reported in the last
actuarial valuation report filed with the Public Employee Retirement Commission
under the act of December 18, 1984 (P.L. 1005, No. 205), known as the
“Municipal Pension Plan Funding Standard and Recovery Act” or “Act 205,” 53
P.S. § 895.101 et seq.
§ A261-39.   Preretirement survivor’s benefit.

township as a police officer and satisfied the eligibility requirements for a
normal retirement benefit as described in §
A261-31 shall be eligible for a preretirement survivor’s benefit.
   A.   Survivor. “Survivor” means:
      (1)   The surviving spouse of a member; or
      (2)   If no surviving spouse, the surviving minor children of a member.
   B.   Amount. The preretirement survivor’s benefit shall be equal to the
benefit such survivor would have received if the member:
      (1)   Had terminated his employment prior to his death;
      (2)   Had elected to receive a fifty-percent joint and survivor benefit
as described in §
A261-37B(2); and
      (3)   Had died the following day.
   C.   Duration. The preretirement survivor’s benefit shall be a monthly
benefit commencing on the first day of the month following the month in which
the member died, and terminating as follows:
      (1)   As of the date the surviving spouse remarries or dies; or
      (2)   If applicable, when the last of the surviving minor children
obtains age 18 or dies, whichever event shall occur first.
§ A261-40.   Disability retirement benefit.
A member shall be eligible for a disability retirement benefit on his
disability retirement date. No minimum years of service are required for
eligibility.
   A.   Disability retirement date. A member’s disability retirement date shall
be the day that the member is totally disabled as a result of a service-
connected disability. No disability retirement benefits shall be payable to a
member who has suffered a non-service-connected disability.
   B.   Amount. A member’s disability retirement benefit shall be equal to 50%
of the member’s final average salary. However, the disability retirement
benefit shall not be reduced by the amount of any payments for which the member
shall be eligible under the Act of June 2, 1915 (P.L. 736, No. 338), known as
the “Pennsylvania Workers’ Compensation Act,” 4  or the Act of June 21, 1939
(P.L. 566, No. 284) known as the “Pennsylvania Occupational Disease Act.” 5
   C.   Form of benefit. The disability retirement benefit shall be a monthly
pension for life commencing on the first day of the month following the month
in which the member became totally disabled.
   D.   Pension Committee. The Pension Committee shall have discretion to
determine.
      (1)   Whether a member has a total disability, based on consultations
with a medical examiner, who shall have the right to make such physical
examinations and other investigations as may be reasonably required to
determine total disability; and
      (2)   Whether a member’s total disability is a service-connected
disability or a non-service- connected disability.
   E.   Total disability. A member has a total disability if he is permanently
unable to perform the normal duties of a police officer by reason of physical
or mental impairment.
   F.   Service-connected disability. A service-connected disability is a
permanent injury that occurs in the course of, or results from, a member’s
performance of his duties as a police officer.
   G.   Non-service-connected disability. A non-service-connected disability is
a disability that does not occur in the course of, or result from, a member’s
performance of his duties as a police officer. A member with a non-service-
connected total disability shall be entitled to the following, at his option:

contributions as defined in §
A261-50 on the date he terminates employment with the township; or
      (2)   Vesting of his normal retirement benefit in accordance with §
A261-44, provided that the member satisfies the years of service requirement
for such vesting on the date of his termination of employment.

5. Editor’s Note; See 77 P.S. § 1201 et seq.
§ A261-41.   Cost-of-living allowance.
   A.   Subject to the limitations described in Subsection B, a member
currently receiving a normal retirement benefit or an accrued normal retirement
benefit shall receive an annual cost-of- living allowance. The Pension
Committee shall determine the amount of the cost-of-living adjustment based on
the percentage increase or decrease in the consumer price index for the
immediately preceding calendar year and applied as the Acts of the Commonwealth
proscribe.
   B.   Amount. A member’s disability retirement benefit shall be equal to 50%
of the member’s salary at the time the disability was incurred, reduced by the
amount of Social Security disability benefits received for the same injury.
      (1)   No cost-of-living allowance shall exceed the percentage increase in
the consumer price index from the year in which the member terminated his
employment with the township as a police officer.
      (2)   The maximum annual cost-of-living adjustment for any year shall be
3%.
      (3)   No cost-of-living allowance may increase a member’s normal
retirement benefit or accrued normal retirement benefit to an amount that would
exceed 30% of the final average salary used to compute the member’s benefit.
[Amended 1-9-2001 by Ord. No. 1054]

allowance would impair the actuarial soundness of the pension fund.
§ A261-42.   Temporary service.
Retired police officers shall be subject to temporary service from time to
time, as a police reserve in cases of riot, tumult or preservation of the
public peace, until unfitted for such service, when they may be finally
discharged by reason of age or disability.
§ A261-42.1.   Killed in service benefit.
[Added 7-13-2004 by Ord. No. 1133; Amended 5-11-2010 by Ord. No. 10-1231]
   A.   Effective April 17, 2002, if a member is killed in the line of duty for
the Township, and he or she dies survived by a spouse or dependent child or
children, then a monthly pension benefit of 100% of the member’s monthly salary
at the time of his or her death shall be paid to the surviving spouse until the
surviving spouse dies. If there is no surviving spouse or if the surviving
spouse subsequently dies, then the child or children of the Member shall be
entitled to receive a monthly survivor’s benefit equal to 100% of the member’s
monthly salary at the time of his or her death. Such survivor’s benefit to the
child or children shall continue until the child or children reach the age of
18, or until age 23, if the child is “attending college.” At the time at which
any surviving spouse has died and any dependent children have reached age 18,
or age 23, if the child is attending college, the benefit created under this
section shall terminate. No other pension benefit shall be paid by the Township
to the surviving spouse or dependent child(ren) of an officer who is killed in
the line of duty.
   B.   For purposes of this section, the phrase “attending college” shall mean
being enrolled in an institution of higher learning and carrying a minimum
course load of seven credits per semester.
   C.   Effective January 1, 2010, the surviving family of an officer who is
killed in the line of duty shall receive the benefits provided for and subject
to the terms of Act 51 of 2009, which benefits are paid exclusively by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. With the exception of any pension benefit to
which the officer was entitled prior to the officer’s death, solely by virtue
of the officer’s age and service as a Township police officer, and any other
non- pension, contractual benefits to which the officer and/or the officer’s
family may have been entitled prior to the officer’s death, the Township shall
not be obligated to pay any benefit to the family of an officer as the result
of the officer’s death, including, but not limited to, the killed in service
pension benefit which previously existed under Act 600 prior to the passage of
Act 51 of 2009.

member's years of service and the denominator of which is 10.
§ A261-71. Determination of years of service.
   A.   For purposes of determining a member's years of service for the
adjustment to the dollar limitation of §
A261-62A required by §
A261-69A, the member shall be credited with a year of service (computed to
fractional parts of a year) for each computation period for which the following

A261-70A shall be applied separately with respect to each change in the benefit
structure of the pension plan
§ A261-76. Other employee contributions.
Any contributions made by a member other than those described in Article VIII
shall be deemed to constitute a separate defined contribution plan. The benefit
subject to the limit of §§
A261-62 through
A261-75 shall not include any benefit attributable to such employee
contributions. The portion of the benefit attributable to employer
contributions and subject to §§
A261-62 through

contribution plans sponsored by the township, the annual benefit referred to in
§§
A261-79 and
A261-80 shall be reduced, if necessary, so that the sum of the fractions
described in §§
A261-79 and
A261-80 do not exceed 1.0 for such limitation year.
§ A261-79. Defined benefit fraction.
   A.   "Benefit fraction" is a fraction, the numerator of which is the
member's projected annual benefit under the defined benefit plans sponsored by
the township in which he has participated, determined as of the close of the
limitation years of such plans, and the denominator of which is the lesser of:
      (1)   One and twenty-five hundredths x $90,000 (as adjusted by the
Internal Revenue Service to reflect cost-of-living increases); or
      (2)   One hundred forty percent of the member's highest average
limitation compensation over any three consecutive calendar years.
   B.   In calculating the adjustments required by §
A261-69 for purposes of determining the denominator of the defined benefit
fraction for any limitation year, the years of service that are used shall
include future years occurring before the member's normal retirement age. For
purposes of the preceding sentence, years of service may include the future
year which includes the date on which the member will reach normal retirement
age, provided that it can be reasonably anticipated that the member will
receive a year of service for such year. In projecting years of service for
future years, it may be assumed that a member is a full-time employee if he is
currently a full-time employee.
§ A261-80. Defined contribution fraction.
" Contribution fraction" is a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of
the annual additions to the member's accounts under all defined contribution

limitation year of service with the township:
   A.   One and twenty-five hundredths x $30,000; or
   B.   Thirty-five percent of the member's limitation compensation for such
limitation year.

employment until his normal retirement date under such plan and if his
compensation for the purpose of such plan had continued at the same rate.
   ANNUAL ADDITION — Annual additions to a member's accounts under any defined
contribution plan for any limitation year means the sum of employer
contributions, forfeitures and the member's own after-tax contributions. A
defined benefit plan sponsored by the township to which nondeductible employee
contributions are made is considered to be a separate defined contribution
plan, to the extent that the employee contributions constitute annual additions
in the current and prior limitation years.
   PLAN YEAR — The calendar year.
   LIMITATION YEAR — The calendar year.
   LIMITATION COMPENSATION —
   A.   The member's wages, salary, fees for professional services and other

permanent and total disability.
   B.   Limitation compensation shall exclude the following:
      (1)   Contributions made by an employer to a qualified plan to the extent
that, before the application of Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code to
that plan, the contributions are not includable in the gross income of the
member for the year in which contributed.
      (2)   Employer contributions on behalf of an employee to a simplified
employee pension plan.
      (3)   Any distributions from a plan of deferred compensation, except that
any amounts received by an employee pursuant to an unfunded nonqualified plan
may be included in the year that such amounts are included in gross income.
      (4)   Other amounts which receive special tax benefits, such as premiums
for group term life insurance to the extent not includable in gross income, or
contributions made by an employer toward the purchase of an annuity contract
described in Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.
   C.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this pension plan, the annual
additions for any limitation year beginning before January 1, 1987, shall not

living adjustment after July 1, 1982, shall be taken into account.
   B.   The dollar limitations described in §§
A261-61 through
A261-81 shall not reduce any benefit which was accrued by a member under the
pension plan prior to the first day of its limitation year beginning in 1987,
using the applicable maximum dollar limitations then in effect; provided,
however, that this sentence shall not apply to any member unless he was a

The township may elect to apply §
A261-83A with respect to any plan year ending after December 31, 1982, by

the plan year ending in 1981.
§ A261-85. Limitation years ending after December 31, 1986.
The township may elect to apply §
A261-80 with respect to any limitation year ending after December 31, 1986, by
adjusting the numerator under §
A261-80 by using an alternate amount for all limitation years beginning on or
before December 31, 1986. The adjustment is to subtract permanently from the
numerator of the defined contribution fraction an amount equal to the product
of Subsections A and B below:
   A.   The sum of the defined contribution fraction and the defined benefit
fraction as of the determination date, minus 1.0; times

§ A261-97.   Benefit Calculation.
For all retirement fund purposes, the length of service of a police officer
participating in DROP shall remain as it existed on the effective date of
commencement of participation in the DROP. Service thereafter shall not be
recognized or used for the calculation or determination of any benefits payable
by the Upper Dublin Township Police Pension Fund. The monthly average salary of
the police officer for pension calculation purposes shall remain, as it existed
on the effective date of commencement of participation in the DROP. Earnings,
increases in earnings and length of service increments after the DROP election
date or increases in earnings thereafter shall not be recognized or used for
the calculation or determination of any benefits payable by the pension fund.
§ A261-98.   Payments to the DROP account.
The monthly retirement benefits that would have been payable to the police
officer had the member elected to cease employment and receive a normal
retirement benefit, shall, upon the member commencing participation in DROP, be
paid into an account established to receive the participant’s monthly pension
payments. This account shall be designated the DROP account.
§ A261-99.   DROP account.
The Township shall establish a DROP account as an interest-bearing ledger
account in its police pension trust fund. The DROP account balance shall be
accounted for separately but shall not be physically segregated from other
pension trust fund assets. Interest shall be credited into the DROP account
monthly and shall be equal to the police pension fund’s actual interest earned
each month, but not less the 0% or more than 4.5% annually.
§ A261-100.   Accrual of non-pension benefits.
After a police officer elects to participate in the DROP, all other contractual
benefits shall continue to accrue with the exception of those provisions
relating to the police pension plan and those provisions listed in §
A261-96 above.
§ A261-101.   Payout.
Upon the resignation date set forth in the police officer’s DROP option notice
or such date as the Township separates the officer from employment, the
retirement benefits payable to the officer or officer’s designated beneficiary,
if applicable, shall be paid to the officer or beneficiary and shall no longer
be paid to the officer’s DROP account. Within 30 days following termination of
an officer’s employment pursuant to their participating in the DROP, the total
accumulated benefits in the officer’s DROP account shall be calculated and paid
out of the Upper Dublin Police Pension Fund to the officer in a single lump sum
payment or at the member’s option, in any fashion permitted by law. By
participating in the DROP, each officer must agree to hold the Township
harmless for any tax or other consequences flowing from the officer’s
disposition of the payout under this article.
§ A261-102.   Disability during DROP.
If a police officer becomes temporarily disabled during his/her participation
in DROP, that officer shall continue to participate in the DROP as if fully
employed. The officer shall receive disability pay in the same amount as
disabled officers that are not participating in DROP. In no event shall an
officer on temporary disability have the ability to draw from his DROP account.
However, notwithstanding any other provision in this section, if an officer is
disabled and has not returned to work as of his/her required resignation date,
then such resignation shall take precedence over all other provisions herein
and said officer shall be required to resign.
If an officer becomes permanently disabled during the DROP period, the officer
shall be honorably discharged from employment after the injury that prevents
the DROP participant from performing full police duties is deemed to be
permanent. On the date that the officer is deemed to be permanently disabled,
the officer shall, within 30 calendar days, obtain the contents of his/her DROP
account and, thereafter, commence receiving his/her normal pension benefit. An
officer who is participating in DROP must waive any claim to a disability
pension benefit should the officer become permanently disabled during the DROP
period.
§ A261-103.   Death during DROP.
If a DROP participant dies before the DROP account balances are paid, the
participant’s designated beneficiary shall have the same rights as the police
officer to withdraw or direct the DROP account balance. If a DROP participant
is killed in the line of duty, the participant’s survivors shall receive the
killed-in-service benefit pursuant to Act 51 of 2009. All amounts in the
participant’s DROP account at the time of his/her death shall be paid to the
participant’s survivors.
§ A261-104.   Forfeiture of benefits.
Notwithstanding an officer’s participation in the DROP, an officer who is
convicted or pleads guilty to engaging in criminal misconduct which constitutes
a “crime related to public office or public employment,” as that phrase is
defined in Pennsylvania’s Pension Forfeiture Act, 43 P.S. §§ 1311–1314, shall
forfeit his right to receive a pension, including any amounts currently
deposited in the DROP account. In such a case, the member shall only be
entitled to receive the contributions, if any, made by the member to the fund,
without interest.
§ A261-105.   Effect of qualified domestic relations order.
Rights under this plan shall be subject to attachment in favor of an alternate
payee as set forth in a qualified domestic relations order.
§ A261-106.   Construal of provisions.
An officer’s election to participate in the DROP shall in no way be construed
as a limitation on the Township’s right to suspend or terminate an officer for
just cause or to grant the officer an honorable discharge based upon a physical
or mental inability to perform his or her duties.
ARTICLE XIV
Non-Intervening Military Buy Back
§ A261-107.   Non-intervening military service time buy back. [Added 12-10-2024
by Ord. No. 24-1399]
The pension plan provides full-service credit for each year of active-duty
military service or fraction thereof based on the member’s Form DD214, not to
exceed five years, to a member who was not employed by the Township prior to
such military service, payable by the member.
The member shall pay the amount for the purchase of credit for military service
other than intervening military service that shall be computed by applying the
average normal cost rate for the pension plan as based upon the most recent
actuarial valuation, but not to exceed ten per centum, to the member’s average
annual rate of compensation over the first three years of service with the
Township and multiplying the result by the number of years and fractional part
of a year of creditable non-intervening military service being purchased,
together with interest at the rate of four and three-quarters per centum
compounded annually from the date of initial entry into service to the date of
payment. The members must pay for the purchase of non-intervening military
service time as a lump-sum deposit to the pension plan.
A member of the pension plan shall be eligible to receive service credit for
intervening or non-intervening military service provided that he is not
entitled to receive, eligible to receive then or in the future, or is receiving
retirement benefits for such service under a retirement system administered and
wholly or partially paid for by any other governmental agency with the
exception of a member eligible to receive or is receiving military retirement
pay earned by a combination of active duty and non-active duty with a reserve
or national guard component of the armed forces which retirement pay is payable
only upon the attainment of a specified age and period of service under 10
U.S.C. Ch 67 (relating to retired pay for non-regular service).

Age; provided that the pension attributable to the Period of Reemployment shall
be offset by the Actuarial Equivalent of any prior distributions made to a

§ A262-9. Maximum benefit payments.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Pension Plan to the contrary, a
Member's annual benefit, together with the Member's annual benefit under any
other plan(s) required to be aggregated with the Pension Plan under Code

Section 415. In the event that the Code Section 415 limitations are exceeded in
any calendar year for a Member, such Member's benefits shall be reduced under
this Pension Plan to the extent necessary to satisfy the applicable Code
Section 415 annual limitations. If a Member's benefits are reduced under the

Section 415 limitations are subsequently increased, such Member's benefits also
shall be increased to the extent permitted under the increased Code Section 415
limitations.

Administrator, if applicable. After a Member commences receipt of benefit
payments under the Pension Plan, the Member shall not be permitted to elect a
different form of payment at a later date.
§ A262-17. Small benefit cash-out.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, if the
Actuarial Equivalent lump sum value of a Member's vested Accrued Pension is
$5,000 or less as of the Member's Benefit Commencement Date, payment shall be
made in a single lump sum (or deemed to have been made in a single lump sum if
zero) as soon as administratively practicable following his termination of
employment; provided that a Member shall have the opportunity to elect a Direct
Rollover of such lump sum payment in accordance with §
A262-19 below.
§ A262-18. Payment of Death Benefits.
As soon as administratively practicable after a Member's death, the Actuarial
Equivalent lump sum value of the Member's Death Benefit shall be paid to the
Member's Survivor in a single lump sum payment; provided that, if the Member's
Survivor is the Member's spouse, such Member's spouse shall have the
opportunity to elect a Direct Rollover of such lump sum payment in accordance
with §
A262-19 below.
§ A262-19. Direct rollovers.
A Member or a Member's spouse may elect a Direct Rollover of lump sum payments
distributed under the Pension Plan pursuant to §§

ARTICLE XI
Miscellaneous
§ A262-30. Payments to be free from all claims.
No benefits payable under the Pension Plan shall be subject to the debts or
liabilities of a Member or a Survivor, and any attempt to alienate, sell,
transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber any such benefit, whether
presently or thereafter payable, shall be void, and no benefit under the
Pension Plan shall be subject in any manner to attachment, garnishment or
encumbrance of any kind.
§ A262-31. Incompetency; minors.
Every person receiving or claiming benefits under the Pension Plan shall be
conclusively presumed to be mentally competent and of age until the date on
which the Nonuniformed Pension Board receives a written notice, in a form and
manner acceptable to the Nonuniformed Pension Board, that such person is
incompetent or a minor, for whom a guardian or other person legally vested with
the care of the person or estate has been appointed. However, if the
Nonuniformed Pension Board finds that any person to whom a benefit is payable
under the Pension Plan is unable to care for his or her affairs because of
incompetency, or is a minor, any payment due (unless a prior claim therefor
shall have been made by a duly appointed legal representative) may be paid to
the spouse, a child, a parent or other person who is eligible to receive
payment from the Pension Plan for the account of such person. To the extent
permitted by law, any such payment so made shall be a complete discharge of any
liability therefor under the Pension Plan.
§ A262-32. Missing persons.
If the Nonuniformed Pension Board is unable to make payment because the
identity or whereabouts of a Member or his Survivor(s) is unknown, the Member's
Accrued Pension shall be forfeited and all further benefits with respect to
such person shall be discontinued, and all liability for the payment thereof
shall terminate. In the event of the subsequent reappearance of the Member or
his Survivor prior to termination of the Pension Plan, the benefits which were
due and payable and which such person missed shall be paid in a single sum, and
any future benefits due such person shall be reinstated in full. The amount
payable to such person shall be equal to the benefit forfeited, without
interest on such amount for the period commencing on the date such benefit was
forfeited and ending on the date of the claim.
§ A262-33. Amendment and termination.
The Pension Plan and Pension Fund established herein may be discontinued,
modified, altered, terminated or repealed according to law, through an
appropriate ordinance or resolutions adopted by the Board of Commissioners;
provided, however, that any such amendment or action shall not reduce the
vested rights of any Member in his benefits under the Pension Plan. In the
event that the Board of Commissioners terminates the Pension Plan or otherwise
causes the discontinuance of contributions to the Pension Plan, all Members
(including both actively employed Members and terminated Members entitled to,
or receiving, benefits under the Pension Plan), to the extent not vested, shall
become fully vested in their Accrued Pensions upon the occurrence of any such
event.
§ A262-34. Employment rights.
Nothing contained in the Pension Plan or any modification of the Pension Plan
shall be construed as a guaranty of employment or shall enlarge, diminish or
otherwise affect a Nonuniformed Employee's right, or lack thereof, with respect
to his or her employment with the Township.
§ A262-35. Severability.
In the event that any provision of the Pension Plan shall be held illegal or
invalid for any reason, such illegality or invalidity shall not affect the
remaining parts of this Pension Plan, and it shall be construed and enforced as
if such illegal or invalid provision had never been included.
§ A262-36. Applicable law.
Except to the extent superseded or preempted by federal law, the Pension Plan
and all rights hereunder shall be governed, construed and administered in
accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

advertised twice in a newspaper in general circulation in the Township. These
rules and regulations and any amendments thereto shall be made available to the
public for distribution or inspection.
§ A263-2. Tree trimming and removal operations.
   A.   Statement of policy.
      (1)   Severe tree trimming poses a significant threat to the health of
street trees in the Township, endangers the welfare and property of those using
public rights-of-way and creates adverse aesthetic effects which denigrate the
quality of life in the community and negatively impact property values.
      (2)   Healthful trees constituting the urban forest can aid in the
conservation of vital energy resources and natural resources in the Township.
      (3)   Healthful trees are a valuable amenity to the urban environment,
creating greater human comfort by providing shade, cooling the air through
evaporation, restoring oxygen to the atmosphere, reducing glare, reducing noise
levels, providing an ecological habitat for songbirds and other animal and
plant species, providing for more effective transitions between different land
uses and breaking the monotony of urbanized development.
      (4)   While it is recognized that the public rights-of-way are shared by
the Township, the traveling public, the owners of adjacent properties, public
utility companies and others using them with permission, it is the Shade Tree
Commissiou's obligation to assure that all using the public rights-of-way do so
in a manner which respects, preserves and enhances that portion of the urban
forest made up of street trees growing within or adjacent to such rights-of-
way.
      (5)   The most effective way the Shade Tree Commission can fulfill its
obligation is to carefully regulate the activities of those using the public
rights-of-way and to assure that they do so responsibly by the promulgation and
enforcement of these regulations.
   B.   Permits.
      (1)   Any person or entity seeking to cut, trim, prune or remove all or
part of any tree in the public right-of-way shall first apply for and receive a
permit therefore from the STC. The application fee shall be $10 per tree or
$500 for a blanket permit. Applications shall be submitted on a form available
from the Secretary of the STC and from the Township Director of Public Works.
The Secretary may reject any application which is not accompanied by all of the
information requested on the form.
      (2)   No permit shall be required to remove all or part of any tree
constituting an immediate hazard to life or property or to those using or
occupying the public-right-of-way or where such removal is necessitated by
reason of damage to the tree from storm, wind, earthquake, fire or accident.
The STC may waive the requirement for a permit in cases of hardship or where
the public interest requires.
      (3)   Permits may be granted outright or granted subject to conditions
consistent with the provisions of the Township Code and these regulations.
Unless specifically set forth on the permit, no permit shall be valid for a
period greater than 90 days after the date of its issuance. No permit shall be
granted unless the following minimum conditions are met (in all cases where the
STC is referenced, that shall be taken to mean the STC, or its authorized
representative):
         (a)   The STC has determined that there is a need for the proposed
work on the tree; and
         (b)   The STC is satisfied that the persons who are to perform the
work are qualified to do so, although the issuance of the permit shall not be
construed as a warranty of the qualifications of such person; and
         (c)   The STC has determined that any potential detriment to the
Township tree population entailed by the proposed work is justified in the
individual case. In making this determination, the STC shall consider factors
such as the probability that the proposed work will destroy or seriously injure
the tree, the tree's health, the desirability of that species as a street tree,
whether the tree's condition and size threaten serious damage to life or
property, the condition and number of other street trees in the vicinity and
whether there are other less onerous means of accomplishing the applicant's
goals, and other criteria derived from the application of the policy statement
set forth hereinabove to the individual application.
      (4)   The STC may condition any permit granted for the removal of a shade
tree on the permitee replacing the tree with one of a size and specie approved
by the STC. The cost of removal and the cost of replacemeut, if required, shall
be borne by the permitee.
      (5)   No work pursuant to a permit may be performed where the permitee is
not the owner of the property adjacent to the public right-of-way where the
work is to performed unless a sign has been posted in a prominent location
adjacent to the work site and visible from the public right-of-way for a period
of not less than five days beforehand. Where work is to be performed on or
adjacent to several properties in the same block, only one sign per block must
be posted. The sign must state that tree trimming work is to be performed, the
approximate date when it will be performed, the name of the entity performing
it or on whose behalf it is being performed and a telephone number where
interested parties may call a representative of the permitee to discuss the
work. In lieu of such a sign, the permitee may provide the owners of property
abutting the work with actual written notice, containing this same information,
no less than five days beforehand A copy of the notice, when posted or written,
shall be forwarded to the STC and the Township Manager.
      (6)   Public utility companies subject to the jurisdiction of the
Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) are subject to this permitting
requirement. Utilities may apply for a blanket permit to prune around utility
lines, the fee for which shall be $500. Public utilities may perform such
pruning as is necessary to comply with the safety regulations of the PUC and to
maintain a safe operation of their facilities, provided they shall comply with
the provisions of these regulations, including the notification provisions and
the specific pruning standards set forth herein. The Shade Tree Commission will
modify such specific pruning standards, upon application, where the public
utility company demonstrates to its satisfaction that such pruning standards
will not permit it to comply with the PUC's safety regulations for a period of
three years of normal tree growth following completion of such pruning.
   C.   Trimming standards. The primary aim of trimming is to preserve the
health, beauty and longevity of trees Trimming for such purpose will also make
trees safer, more functional and valuable. Practices such as stub cuts, random
branch removal and topping (stubbing back the entire crown) defeat the primary
aim, create hazards and drastically reduce the monetary value of trees.
Therefore, such practices shall not be employed. The following standards
identify trimming methods which will give maximum benefits to both trees and
people and must be employed when trimming and pruning within the public right-
of-way:
      (1)   Types of cuts.
         (a)   Removal of laterals.
            [1]   Shoulder cuts. The final cut in removing a lateral branch
should be immediately beyond the branch bark ridges, preserving the branch
collar. Do not make stub cuts (an inch or more beyond the branch collar). Do
not make flush cuts (through the branch collar).
            [2]   Triple cuts. For any branch too large to be held while being
cut, remove by means of the following cuts:
               [a]   Undercut the branch four inches to 10 inches beyond the
base.
               [b]   Cut off the branch beyond the undercut.
               [c]   Remove the remaining stub via a shoulder cut as described
above.
         (b)   Removal of terminals (tip thinning and drop crotching).
            [1]   Thinning "Lace out" the terminal portions of branches by
cutting the terminals back to the laterals. (The basal diameter of the
remaining lateral should be V3 the diameter of the terminal being removed.)
Remove numerous small terminals and laterals rather than taking out a few large
ones.
            [2]   Size reduction. To take out portions of the crown for
reducing height, remove the terminals back to the laterals. Each lateral should
be suitably situated to serve as the new terminal, thus establishing the crown
at a lower level. The basal diameter of a lateral should be at least 1/3 the
basal diameter of the terminal being removed. (Laterals smaller than this
cannot function effectively as new terminals, and the effect is then similar to
a stub cut.)
      (2)   Pruning functions. Not all of the following procedures will apply
to any one tree, and two or more may be performed more or less simultaneously.
In most cases, however, trimming done in the following general sequence will be
more efficient and will help avoid unnecessary trimming.
         (a)   As a rule, not more than 1/4 of the total foliage mass should be
removed at one trimming. Exceptions are:
            [1]   Extreme thinning of heavy crowns of brittle trees, and
            [2]   Severe thinning of crowns to prevent blow-down when root
pruning is done.
         (b)   Remove branches as needed and redirect new growth to clear
utility lines, pedestrian and vehicular traffic areas, buildings, streetlights,
walls and other objects, as well as trees and shrubs. Do not make stub cuts. Do
not cut terminals back to very small laterals. Retain a screen effect as much
as possible.
         (c)   Remove dead, broken, diseased or markedly unthrifty brauches.
         (d)   Remove crossing branches and those which will become crossing
branches (such as suckers, water sprouts and branches growing vigorously into
the interior of the crown).
         (e)   Remove sharp-angled branches. Remove most branches arising at
angles of less than 30°, with the exception of species which fuse at branch
bases. If a narrow- angled branch needs to be retained for the sake of form, it
should be lightened and restricted in growth to reduce the danger of wind
breakage.
         (f)   Remove parallel branches. If two branches within a foot or so of
each other run parallel for several feet along their main stems, the less
desirable one should be taken out.
         (g)   Trim for balance and form. To maintain the natural shape, if a
tree grows in an unbalanced manner which is atypical and unattractive, or which
poses a potential hazard, remove such branches as may need to be eliminated to
restore more typical form or to minimize the perceived hazard.
         (h)   Trim to reduce wind resistance. If a tree is shallow rooted or
has a high or heavily foliaged crown, such that it is susceptible to blow-down
or limb breakage in high winds, trim more frequently. It does not call for
topping; beheading tall or dense trees ruins their form and vitality and
intensifies wind hazards in subsequent years. This type of thinning should be
done by removing a large number of small branches rather than a few large
branches. The end effect should maintain most of the original form, but with a
lacy openness.
         (i)   Exceptions. The STC may approve trimming trees in a manner not
typical of the natural form of the tree specie. Such approval shall be based
upon a finding that the resulting shape is necessary for the public health and
safety or the health and safety of the tree.
      (3)   Severe tree trimming is prohibited. "Severely trimmed" shall mean
the cutting of the branches and/or trunk of a tree in a manner which will
substantially reduce the overall size of the tree area so as to destroy the
existing symmetrical appearance or natural shape of the tree in a manner which
results in the removal of main lateral branches leaving the trunk of the tree
in a stub appearance.
      (4)   Other prohibited activities. Those activities set forth in the
Upper Dublin Township Code, §
195-10, are considered prohibited activities, and, in addition, the following:
         (a)   Damaging or cutting the roots of a shade tree;
         (b)   Anchoring heavy equipment to a shade tree;
         (c)   Dropping or lowering any object or tree section through the
canopy of a shade tree, except such as are securely fastened to ropes to
control damage.
      (5)   Utility line clearance standards. The STC recognizes that public
utilities provide a service to the public, that such service should not be
subject to interruption, and that the trimming of street trees is necessary to
forestall such interruption. The STC also recognizes that public utilities can
trim street trees and accomplish the utility's goals while adhering to the
standards set forth in these regulations. It is expected that public utilities
will maintain a schedule of line clearance that will minimize interruptions
while at the same time minimizing the clearance distances required from tree
branches. It is the STC's view that repeating line clearance activities no less
frequently than every three years is a reasonable expectation, and that the
clearances set forth on the following chart represent an appropriate
accommodation to the needs of public utilities if such a schedule is adhered
to. Pruning to accomplish greater line clearances than are set forth below will
be considered a violation of these regulations (Note: all measurements are in
feet):

§ A263-3. Enforcement.
   A.   The STC will consider a violation of the trimming and removal standards
set forth in these regulations to constitute a public nuisance. Upon finding
that any person or entity has caused such a violation, the STC shall give
notice to the violator to immediately cease and desist from further violations.
If the nature of the violation is that a tree has been severely trimmed, the
permit or, in the case of a public utility, the privilege to trim in the public
right-of-way shall immediately be suspended until such time as the violator
removes the damaged tree and replaces it with a suitable species of comparable
maturity, or as nearly so as reasonably possible. The STC, in its sole
discretion, and in lieu of the violator replacing the damaged tree, can accept
from the violator the payment of a sum of money which the STC determines to be
required to accomplish the same purpose, plus an additional payment of 10% for
administration expenses.
   B.   The STC reserves the right to seek such further legal and equitable
remedies as it deems appropriate to remedy the violation and/or to prevent
further violations.
   C.   Any person or entity objecting to an enforcement decision or action of
the STC, including the STC's determination of the cost of replacement of any
tree, may, within 30 days of receipt of notice from the STC, appeal to the
Board of Commissioners which shall hold a hearing thereon within 30 days and
promptly render a decision.
