finally discharged by reason of age or disability upon written notice from the
Board.

employment, except that such amount shall be included only upon attainment of

plan shall be set forth in Part V-1 of the Joinder.
   D.   If the employer or the Commonwealth shall have contributed monies
raised by taxation to a pension plan established by a private organization or

amount set forth in subsection (2), and, if elected, to the service increment
amount set forth in subsection (3). The amount of such cost-of-living increase
shall be specified in Part V-3(B) of the Joinder, along with any special
conditions or requirements associated with such cost-of-living increase.
Provided, however, that such cost-of-living increase shall not exceed the
percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (as specified in the Joinder)
from the year in which the participant was last employed by the employer.
Provided further, that in no case shall the total pension benefit payable under
this plan, exceed 75% of the participant's final monthly average salary; and,
further provided, that the total cost-of-living increase applied to a
participant's retirement benefit shall not exceed 30%. No cost-of-living
increase shall be granted hereunder, if such increase would impair the
actuarial soundness of the plan.
5.   Late Retirement. A participant may continue to work beyond his normal
retirement date subject to the employer's rules and regulations regarding

shall continue to work beyond his normal retirement date, there shall be no

and extending over the life of such participant or over the lives of such
participant and a designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond
the life expectancy of such participant, or the joint life expectancies of such
participant and a designated beneficiary).
If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this plan dies prior to the
date when his entire interest has been distributed to him after distribution of
his benefits has begun in accordance with subsection (2) of this subsection,
the remaining portion of such benefit shall be distributed at least as rapidly
as under the method of distribution being used under subsection (2) of this
subsection as of the date of his death.
   B.   If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this plan dies
before distribution of his benefit has begun, the entire interest of such
employee shall be distributed within 5 years of the death of such employee,
unless the following sentence is applicable. If any portion of the employee’s
interest is payable to (or for the benefit of) a designated beneficiary, such
portion shall be distributed over the life of such designated beneficiary (or
over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such beneficiary),
and such distributions begin not later than 1 year after the date of the
employee’s death or such later date as provided by regulations issued by the
Secretary of the Treasury, then for purposes of the 5-year rule set forth in
the preceding sentence, the benefit payable to the beneficiary shall be treated
as distributed on the date on which such distributions begin. Provided,
however, that notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the designated
beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the participant, then the date on which
distributions are required to begin shall not be earlier than the date upon
which the employee would have attained age 70½ and, further provided, if the
surviving spouse dies before the distributions to such spouse begin, this
subsection shall be applied as if the surviving spouse were the employee.
   C.   For purposes of this Section, the following definitions and procedures
shall apply:
      (1)   “Required beginning date” shall mean April 1 of the calendar year

      (2)   The phrase “designated beneficiary” shall mean any individual
designated by the employee under this plan according to its rules.
      (3)   Any amount paid to a child shall be treated as if it had been paid
to the surviving spouse if such amount will become payable to the surviving
spouse upon such child’s reaching majority (or other designated event permitted
under regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury).

and/or the employee’s spouse (other than in the case of a life annuity) may be
redetermined but not more frequently than annually.
8.   Killed-in-Service Death Benefit and Survivor Benefit.
Killed-in-Service Death Benefit. If an active participant is killed on or after
April 17, 2002, while performing police services for the employer, the

the case of multiple eligible children, the benefit payable shall be divided
equally among the children. Payment shall cease upon the earlier of death or
the attainment of age 18 (or under or attaining the age of 23, if attending
college). Child shall include adopted child of the participant.
The participant’s spouse cannot waive receipt of this benefit. In the case of
an unmarried participant who has no children under the age of 18 (or under or
attaining age 23, if attending college), no death benefit shall be payable
under this Section.

§ 420. DISABILITY RETIREMENT.
1.   Election of Disability Benefits. If the employer elects in Part VI-1(A) of
the Joinder to provide disability benefits under the plan, such benefits shall
be provided in accordance with this Section.
2.   Disability Retirement Benefits. For any participant who retires due to a
“total and permanent disability” such participant shall be deemed to have
retired as of his disability retirement date. The disability retirement benefit
shall be a monthly amount equal to the amount specified in Part VI-1(C) of the
Joinder, and shall be subject to any conditions or restrictions therein set
forth. Such amount may be offset by the amount of any other disability benefits
provided by the employer. If a disabled participant is later reemployed by the
employer, his aggregate service shall be determined in accordance with Part VI-
1(D) of the Joinder.
3.   Payment of Disability Benefits. Disability retirement payments shall be
made monthly as of the end of each month. The first installment of any
retirement benefit payable to a disabled participant shall be payable as of the
last day of the month next following the disability retirement date. However,
under certain circumstances, the employer may permit a participant to commence
receiving his disability retirement payments as of the first of each month and
continue to receive such payments as of such date in accordance with the
provisions of this Section.
4.   Verification of Disability Benefits. Disability benefits awarded because
of total and permanent disability shall be terminated:
   A.   If the employer shall determine, on the basis of a medical examination
by a physician acceptable to the employer, that the participant, prior to
normal retirement date, has sufficiently recovered to return to regular,
gainful employment;
   B.   If the participant refuses to undergo a medical examination prior to
normal retirement date, which may be ordered by the employer or the
Administrator; provided, that the participant may not be required to undergo a
medical examination more often than once every 12 months; or
   C.   If the participant is employed in any capacity as a full-time employee
of the employer.
(Ord. 253, 2/3/1997, Master Trust Document, Art. VI)
§ 421. DEATH BENEFITS.
1.   Death Benefits. If the employer elects not to provide death benefits under
Part VII-1 of the Joinder, the benefit payable upon the death of a participant
prior to retirement or other termination of employment shall be limited to a
refund of his accumulated contributions, as set forth in
§ 422(2). If the employer elects, in Part VII-2 of the Joinder, to provide
death benefits under the plan, such death benefits shall be provided in
accordance with this Section.
2.   Preretirement Death Benefits Payable Beneficiary. If the employer elects,
under Part WI-2(A) of the Joinder, to provide the death benefit set forth in
this subsection, then such benefit shall be payable in the event of the death
of a participant who is killed in service prior to the time when he would
otherwise be eligible to retire and receive retirement benefits hereunder. In
the event such a benefit becomes payable, the designated beneficiary of the
participant, or, if no designated beneficiary survives, the participant's
estate shall receive a benefit in an amount agreed to and authorized by the
employer and specified in Part VII-2 of the Joinder. Such death benefit shall
be in lieu of any refund of accumulated contributions to which the deceased
participant may have been entitled; provided, however, that in the event the
amount of the participant's accumulated contributions exceeds the amount of
death benefit payable in accordance with the preceding sentence, then such
participant's death benefit shall be equal to the amount of his accumulated
contributions. In no event will a participant or his beneficiaries be eligible
to receive both the benefit described in this subsection and the benefit
described in subsection (3), below.
3.   Surviving Spouse Benefit. If the employer elects, under Part VII-2(B) of
the Joinder, to provide the survivors benefit set forth in this subsection,
then such benefit shall be payable in the event of the death of a participant
who is eligible to receive or is receiving retirement benefits under the plan.
In such event, the spouse of the deceased participant, or, if no spouse
survives or if the spouse survives and subsequently remarries, then the child
or children of the participant who are under the age of 18, shall, during the
spouse's lifetime (or so long as the spouse does not remarry in the case of the
spouse) or until reaching the age of 18 in the case of a child or children,
receive a monthly income calculated at the rate of 50% of the monthly
retirement benefit which the participant was receiving or would have been
receiving had he been retired at the time of his death. In no event will a
participant or his beneficiaries be eligible to receive both the benefit
described in this subsection and the benefit described in subsection (2),
above.
4.   Payment of Survivor Benefits. Survivor payments shall be made monthly as
of the first day of each month. The first installment of any benefit payable to
a survivor shall be payable on the first day of the month next following the
date of death.
(Ord. 253, 2/3/1997, Master Trust Document, Art. VII)
§ 422. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.
1.   Rights of Terminated Employees. If a participant shall cease to be an
employee except as otherwise hereinbefore provided, his interest and rights
under the plan shall be limited to those contained in the following subsections
of this Section.
2.   Refund of Accumulated Contributions. If a participant whose employment
with the employer has been terminated for any reason prior to his normal or
disability retirement date, and he is neither eligible for a pension under the
plan nor has he elected to vest his benefit, such participant or his
beneficiary shall be entitled to receive a refund of his accumulated
contributions to the plan. Upon receipt of such accumulated contributions, said
participant and his or her beneficiary shall not be entitled to any further
payments from the plan. Notwithstanding the preceding, if a participant's
survivors or beneficiaries shall be entitled to a preretirement death benefit
in accordance with
§ 421, such benefit shall be paid in lieu of a refund of the participant's
accumulated contributions, provided, however, that if the amount of the
participant's accumulated contributions exceeds the value of such preretirement
death benefits, the difference shall be refunded to the participant's
beneficiary in addition to the payment of the death benefit.
3.   Election of Vested Benefits. If the employer elects to provide vested
benefits in Part VIII-1 of the Joinder, such vested benefits shall be provided
in accordance with this subsection. In lieu of receiving a refund of his
accumulated contributions, a participant who has completed the period of
aggregate service set forth in Part VIII-1 of the Joinder and who ceases to be
an employee of the employer for any reason other than death, retirement or
total and permanent disability shall vest at the option of the participant.
Such vesting option must be exercised by the participant by filing a written
notice of his intention to vest with the Administrator within 90 days of the
date he ceases to be an employee of the employer. A participant who exercises
such an option shall be eligible, upon attainment of what would have been his
normal retirement date, had he continued to be an employee of the employer, to
a vested retirement benefit equal to his accrued benefit. If a participant
elects to vest his benefit but dies prior to the commencement thereof, the
beneficiary of such participant shall be entitled to a refund of the
participant's accumulated contributions in accordance with the terms of this
subsection.

(Ord. 253, 2/3/1997, Administrative Provisions, Chapter 1, Art. II)
§ 428. THE TRUST FUND.
1.   Establishment and Acceptance of Trust. The trust will consist of all funds
held by the trustee under the Master Plan, including contributions made
pursuant to the provisions of the separate Plans of each participating
employer, and the investments, reinvestments and proceeds thereof. The trust
shall be held, managed and administered in trust pursuant to the terms hereof.
The trustee hereby accepts the trust created hereunder and agrees to perform
the duties assigned to it hereunder. Except as otherwise expressly provided
for, the trustee has exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control
the trust assets. The duties, powers and responsibilities reserved to the
trustee may be allocated among the trustees (if there be more than one) so long
as such allocation is pursuant to action taken by the plan sponsor, or by
written agreement executed by the trustee and approved by the plan sponsor, in
which case no trustee shall have any liability, with respect to any duties,
powers or responsibilities not allocated to him, or for the acts or omissions
of any other trustee.
2.   Powers and Duties of Trustee. With respect to the trust, the trustee shall
have the following powers, rights and duties, in addition to those vested in it
elsewhere herein or by law:
   A.   To retain in cash so much of the trust as it deems advisable and to
deposit any cash so retained in any bank or similar financial institution
(including any such institution which may be a trustee hereunder), without
liability for interest thereon.
   B.   To invest and reinvest the principal and income of the fund and keep
said fund invested, without distinction between principal and income, in
securities which are at the time legal investments for fiduciaries under the
applicable laws of the Commonwealth.
   C.   To sell property held in the fund at either public or private sale for
cash or on credit at such times as it may deem appropriate; to exchange such
property; to grant options for the purchase or exchange thereof.
   D.   To consent to and participate in any plan of reorganization,
consolidation, merger, extension or other similar plan affecting property held
in the fund; to consent to any contract, lease mortgage, purchase, sale or
other action by any corporation pursuant to any such plan.
   E.   To exercise all conversion and subscription rights pertaining to
property held in the fund.
   F.   To exercise all voting rights with respect to property held in the fund
and in connection therewith to grant proxies, discretionary or otherwise.
   G.   To cause any securities or other property held as part of the trust
fund to be registered in its own name or in the name of one or more of its
nominees, without designating the same as trust property, and to hold any
investments in bearer form, but the books and records of the trustee shall at
all times show that all such investments are part of the trust fund.
   H.   Generally, to do all such acts, execute all such instruments, take all
such proceedings and exercise all such rights and privileges with relation to
property constituting the trust fund as if the trustee were the absolute owner
thereof.
   I.   If bonds, preferred stocks or other securities shall be purchased at a
premium, it shall not be necessary for the trustee to set aside a sinking fund
from the earnings to retire or absorb the premium.
   J.   To place money at any time in a deposit bank deemed by the trustee to
be appropriate for the purposes of this trust no matter where situated. Such
deposits may be for such duration as the trustee, in its sole discretion, may
determine.
   K.   In addition to the foregoing powers, the trustee shall also have all of
the powers, rights and privileges conferred upon trustees by the applicable
laws of the Commonwealth, and the power to do all acts, take all proceedings
and execute all rights and privileges, although not specifically mentioned
herein, as the trustee may deem necessary to administer the trust fund and to
carry out the purposes of this trust.
   L.   To invest the assets or some portion of the assets of the trust in any
collective commingled trust fund maintained by a bank or trust company,
including any bank or trust company which may hereafter be appointed to act as
a trustee hereunder. In this connection, the commingling of the assets of the
trust with assets of other eligible, participating trusts through such a medium
is hereby specifically authorized. Any assets of the trust which may be so
added to such collective trusts shall be subject to all of the provisions of
the applicable declaration of trust, as amended from time to time, which
declaration, if required by its terms or by applicable law, is hereby adopted
as part of the plan, to the extent of the participation in such collective or
commingled trust fund by the trust.
   M.   To make any payment or distribution directed by the Administrator or
otherwise required or advisable to carry out the provisions hereof.
   N.   To compromise, contest, arbitrate, enforce or abandon claims and
demands.
   O.   To retain any funds or property subject to any dispute without
liability for the payment of interest thereon, and to decline to make payment
or delivery thereof until final adjudication is made by a court of competent
jurisdiction.
   P.   After advance notice to the plan sponsor, to pay, and to deduct from
and charge against the trust, any taxes which may be imposed upon the trust,
the income, property or transfer thereof, or upon or with respect to the
interest of any person therein, which the trustee is required to pay; to
contest, in its discretion, the validity or amount of any tax, assessment,
claim or demand which may be levied or made against or in respect of the trust,
the income, property or transfer thereof, or in any matter or thing connected
therewith, provided the trustee is indemnified to its satisfaction.
3.   Management Authority. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2),
above, the powers granted the trustee thereunder shall be exercised in the
discretion of the trustee; however, the plan sponsor may at any time
affirmatively direct the trustee with regard to the investment of the trust, or
direct the trustee to obtain the plan sponsor's approval before exercising any
of the powers granted the trustee. Any such direction may be of a continuing
nature or otherwise, may be revoked at any time, and shall be complied with as
promptly as possible by the trustee. The trustee shall not be liable for any
loss or depreciation in value of the trust, or any adverse effect upon the
exempt status of the trust under the Internal Revenue Code, resulting from
actions taken in accordance with the plan sponsor's affirmative direction or
from the failure or refusal of the plan sponsor to give any required approval,
nor shall the trustee be obliged to review the assets of the trust acquired at
the direction of the plan sponsor or accepted on behalf of any participating
employer hereunder.
4.   Successor Trustee. Pending the appointment of any successor trustee and
the
acceptance of such appointment, the existing trustee or trustees shall have
full power to take any action hereunder. Each successor or additional trustee
shall have all rights and powers, as well as duties and liabilities, vested in
the original trustee without the signing or filing of any further instrument,
but any resigning or removed trustee shall execute all documents and do all
acts necessary to vest title of record to any assets of the trust in any
successor trustee, or in the remaining trustee or trustees. With the approval
of the plan sponsor, a successor trustee may accept the account rendered and
the property delivered to it by a predecessor trustee as a full and complete
discharge of the predecessor trustee, without incurring any liability or
responsibility for so doing.
5.   Common Investments. The trustee shall not be required to make separate
investments for individual employers participating in the trust, nor shall it
be required to maintain separate investments for each participant's account,
but may invest contributions and any profits or gains therefrom in common
investments.
6.   Compensation and Expenses of Trustee. The trustee shall be entitled to
such reasonable compensation as shall from time to time be agreed upon by the
plan sponsor and the trustee, unless such compensation is prohibited by law.
Such compensation, and all expenses reasonably incurred by the trustee in
carrying out its functions, shall constitute a charge upon the trust fund or
upon the employers participating thereunder, which charge may be executed at
any time after thirty (30) days written notice to the plan sponsor. The plan
sponsor shall be under no obligation to pay such costs and expenses, and, in
the event of the failure of participating employers to do so, the trustee shall
be entitled to pay the same, or to reimburse themselves for the payment
thereof, from the trust and such charges shall be appropriately prorated to the
interests of participating employers thereunder.
7.   Immunity and Liability of Trustee.
   A.   The trustee shall not be liable for the making, retention or sale of
any investment or reinvestment made by it, as herein provided, nor for any loss
to, or diminution of, the trust fund, unless due to its own intentional or
willful misconduct, lack of good faith or gross negligence.
   B.   The trustee shall be fully protected in acting upon any instrument,
certificate or paper believed by it to be genuine and to be signed or presented
by the proper person or persons, and the trustee shall be under no duty to make
any investigation or any inquiry as to any statement contained in any writing,
but may accept the same as conclusive evidence of the truth and accuracy of the
statements therein contained.
   C.   The trustee shall not be liable for the proper application of any part
of the trust if payments are made in accordance with the directions of the
Administrator as herein provided, and the trustee shall not be obliged to
inquire as to whether any payee is entitled to any payment or distribution,
pursuant to such directions, or as to whether any payment or distribution,
pursuant to such directions, is proper or within the terms of the plan. The
trustee shall not be required to make any investigation to determine the
identity or mailing address of any person entitled to benefits under the plan
and shall be entitled to withhold making any payments or deliveries upon
instructions from the Administrator.
   D.   The trustee shall not be responsible for the adequacy of the trust to
meet and discharge any and all payments and liabilities under the plan. The
trustee shall be responsible only for such sums as shall actually be received
by it as trustee, hereunder, and it shall not be the duty of the trustee to
collect, or to ascertain the correctness of the amount of, any sum receivable
or received from any participating employer.
   E.   The trustee shall discharge its duties with respect to the assets of
the trust solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries,
administering the assets of the plan with the care and diligence, under the
then prevailing circumstances, that a prudent man acting in like capacity and
familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of like
character and with like aims.
8.   Financial Records. The trustee shall maintain records and accounts
reflecting all receipts and disbursements made by it under the terms of the
Master Plan and showing such other items and information as the plan sponsor
from time to time may specify. The trustee's records and accounts shall be open
to the inspection of the participating employers at all reasonable times, and
may be audited from time to time by such person or persons as the plan sponsor
may specify.
9.   Periodic Accounting. The trust will be evaluated monthly, or at more
frequent intervals, by the trustee and a written accounting rendered as of each
fiscal year end of the trust, and as of the effective date of any removal of
resignation of the trustee, and such additional dates as requested by the plan
sponsor, showing the condition of the trust and all receipts, disbursements and
other transactions effected by the trustee during the period covered by the
accounting, based on fair market values prevailing as of such date. Any such
accounting shall be due within 90 days after the date thereof, to the extent
permitted by law, upon the expiration of 180 days from the filing of such
accounting, the trustee shall be forever released, remised and discharged from
all liability and accountability to anyone with respect to the propriety of its
accounts and transactions shown in such accounts except with respect to any
such accounts or transactions as to which the plan sponsor shall within such
180 day period file written exceptions. All determinations as to the value of
the assets of the trust, and as to the amount of the liabilities thereof, shall
be made by the trustee, whose decisions shall be final and conclusive and
binding on all parties hereto, including the employers participating hereunder,
and the participants, beneficiaries and their estates. In making any such
determination, the trustee shall be entitled to seek and rely upon the opinion
of or any information furnished by brokers, appraisers and other experts, and
the trustee shall also be entitled to rely upon reports as to sales and
quotations, both on security exchanges and otherwise as contained in newspapers
and in financial publications.
10.   Rights of Trustee. The rights and interest of any participant on whose
life or in whose name a contract is issued shall not be expanded by such an
investment and any and all rights provided under the contract or permitted by
the insurer shall be reserved to the trustee. Such rights shall include the
right to surrender, reduce or split the contract, the right to name and change
the payee to receive thereunder on the happening of any contingency specified
in the contract, the right to exercise any loan provisions to pay premiums or
for any other reason, and such other rights as may be reserved to the owner of
the policy. Notwithstanding the preceding, if any participating employer under
the trust uses plan assets to purchase contracts or policies and fails to
inform the trustee of the existence of such contracts or policies, the trustee
shall have no liability whatsoever with respect to such policies and shall not
be held responsible for valuing same as a part of Plan assets, nor shall the
trustee be held responsible for payment of any benefits attributable to said
contracts or policies.
11.   Actions of Insurer. No Insurer, which may issue a policy for the purpose
of this plan, shall be required to take or permit any action contrary to the
provisions of said policy nor shall the Insurer be required to look into the
terms of this plan, or question any action as authorized by the trustee in the
application for a policy or changes in an existing policy.
12.   Insurer Not a Party to Plan. The Insurer shall not be deemed to be a
party to this plan and trust for any purpose nor shall it be responsible for
the validity of this plan and trust.
13.   Authorized Investments. The trustee shall not, in any case, be required
to accept as assets hereunder any contracts or policies which are not
permissible investments for retirement plans subject to the Act; moreover, the
trustee shall have no duty or obligation to inquire into the nature of any such
contracts or policies, nor to assess the appropriateness of such contracts or
policies as investments of plan assets under the Act.
(Ord. 253, 2/3/1997, Administrative Provisions, Chapter 1, Art. III)
§ 429. AMENDMENT.
1.   Right to Amend the Plan. The plan sponsor shall have the limited right to
amend this plan at any time without the consent of any employer or of any
participant or his beneficiaries hereunder. Such amendments shall be restricted
to those necessary to conform this plan to mandatory provisions of Federal or
State law, regulations or rulings, and to those which add such additional
elective provisions as may be deemed necessary or desirable hereunder. Elective
provisions shall not be deleted retroactively without the acknowledgment and/or
consent of the employers hereunder who have elected such provisions. Any such
amendment by the plan sponsor shall be stated in an instrument executed by the
plan sponsor in the same manner and form as this plan, and each employer
participating hereunder shall be given a copy thereof. Upon execution of such
an amendment to the Master Plan, the plan of each participating employer which
is affected by the terms of such amendment shall be deemed to have been amended
in the manner therein set forth, and the employer and the participants and
beneficiaries covered by such Plan shall be bound thereby.
Each participating employer shall have the right to amend its Joinder Agreement
at any time. Any such amendment by the employer shall be made by execution of a
revised Joinder Agreement executed on behalf of the employer by a duly
authorized official and by transmitting said Agreement to the Administrator for
approval and acceptance hereunder; provided, however, in the case of any plan
maintained pursuant to Chapter II, and where local or State law so requires, no
such amendment shall be executed unless adopted by resolution or ordinance on
the part of the employer. Upon execution and filing of such amendment with the
Administrator, the plan and the Joinder Agreement of the employer shall be
deemed to have been amended in the manner therein set forth and the employer
and all participants and beneficiaries thereunder shall be bound thereby.
2.   Restrictions on Amendments. Notwithstanding the preceding, the right of
any party to amend the plan shall be subject to the following restrictions:
   A.   No amendment shall deprive any participant or any beneficiary of a
deceased participant of any of the benefits to which he is entitled under this
trust with respect to contributions previously made; and
   B.   That no amendment shall provide for the use of funds or assets held
under this trust other than for the benefit of employees and no funds
contributed to this trust or assets of this trust shall, except as provided in
§ 430(5), ever revert to or be used or enjoyed by the plan sponsor or any of
the employers participating hereunder; and
   C.   That no amendment to the trust which provides for a benefit
modification shall be made unless the cost estimate described in
§ 431(3) has been prepared and presented to the employer in accordance with the
Act.

§ 430. PLAN TERMINATION.
1.   Termination of the Plan and Trust. The plan sponsor intends to continue to
sponsor the Master Plan and trust indefinitely but shall have the right, at any
time, to terminate its sponsorship of the Master Plan and to distribute the
assets of the trust to the participating employers in accordance with their
appropriate shares as of the date of such distribution. Any such dissolution of
the trust shall terminate the relationship between the trustee and the
participating employers but shall not be deemed to constitute the termination
of any participating employer's plan for its employees, absent formal action
taken by such employer.
2.   Termination of an Employer's Participation in the Master Plan and Trust.
It shall be the present intention of each participating employer to maintain
its plan indefinitely. Nevertheless each employer reserves the right, at any
time, to permanently discontinue further contributions to the trust or to
terminate its entire participation under the Master Plan and trust by a written
instrument filed with the Administrator. Such action shall not necessarily
constitute a termination of the plan of the employer, but if such a Plan
termination occurs, then the provisions of subsection (4) of this Section shall
apply.
3.   Automatic Termination of Contributions. Subject to the provisions of the
Act governing financially distressed municipalities, the liability of the
employer to make contributions to the trust shall automatically terminate upon
liquidation or dissolution of the employer, upon its adjudication as a
bankrupt, or upon the making of a general assignment for the benefit of its
creditors.
4.   Distribution Upon Termination. In the event of the termination or partial
termination of the plan of a participating employer, all amounts of vested
benefits accrued by the affected participants as of such date of such
termination, to the extent funded on such date, shall be nonforfeitable
hereunder. (With respect to a defined contribution plan, the preceding sentence
shall be interpreted to mean that all vested amounts allocated to a
participant's Account as of the date of termination shall be nonforfeitable).
In the event of termination of the plan, the employer shall direct either (A)
that the trustee continue to hold the vested accrued benefits of participants
in the trust fund in accordance with the provisions of the plan (other than
those provisions related to forfeitures) without regard to such termination
until all funds have been distributed in accordance with such provisions, or
(B) that the trustee immediately distribute to each participant an amount equal
to his vested accrued benefit to such date. If there are insufficient assets in
the trust to provide for all vested accrued benefits as of the date of plan
termination priority shall first be given to the distribution of any amounts
attributable to mandatory or voluntary employee contributions before assets are
applied to the distribution of any vested benefits attributable to other
sources hereunder.
All other assets attributable to such terminated plan shall be distributed and
disposed of in accordance with the provisions of applicable law and the terms
of any instrument adopted by the employer which effects such termination.
5.   Residual Assets. If all liabilities to vested participants and any others
entitled to receive a benefit under the terms of such a terminated plan have
been satisfied, and there remain any residual assets in the trust fund
attributable to such plan, the residual assets remaining in the trust fund
shall be returned to the employer insofar as such return does not contravene
any provision of law, and, any remaining balance, in excess of employer
contributions, shall be returned to the Commonwealth.
(Ord. 253, 2/3/1997, Administrative Provisions, Chapter 1, Art. V)
§ 431. PROVISIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE MUNICIPAL PENSION PLAN FUNDING STANDARD
AND RECOVERY ACT OF 1984.
1.   Actuarial Valuations. The plan's actuary shall perform an actuarial
valuation at least biennially unless the employer is applying or has applied
for Supplemental State Assistance pursuant to
§ 603 of the Act, whereupon actuarial valuation reports shall be made annually.
      Such biennial actuarial valuation report shall be made as of the
beginning of each plan year occurring in an odd-numbered calendar year,
beginning with the year 1985.
      Such actuarial valuation shall be prepared and certified by an approved
actuary, as such term is defined in the Act.
2.   Reporting Requirements. Such actuarial reports shall be prepared and filed
under the supervision of the Chief Administrative Officer of the municipality
or of an association of municipalities cooperating pursuant to the
Intergovernmental Cooperation Act.
      The Chief Administrative Officer of the pension plan shall determine the
financial requirements of the pension plan on the basis of the most recent
actuarial report and shall determine the minimum obligation of the employer
with respect to funding the plan for any given plan year. The Chief
Administrative Officer shall submit the financial requirements of the plan and
the minimum obligation of the employer to the employer (or its governing body)
annually and shall certify the accuracy of such calculations and their
conformance with the Act.
3.   Benefit Modifications. Prior to the adoption of any benefit plan
modification by the employer, the Chief Administrative Officer of the plan
shall provide to the employer a cost estimate of the proposed benefit plan
modification. Such estimate shall be prepared by an approved actuary, which
estimate shall disclose to the employer the impact of the proposed benefit plan
modification on the future financial requirements of the plan and the future
minimum obligation of the employer with respect to the plan.
(Ord. 253, 2/3/1997, Administrative Provisions, Chapter 1, Art. VI)
§ 432. MISCELLANEOUS.
1.   Incapacity of Pensioner. If any pensioner shall be physically or mentally
incapable of receiving or acknowledging receipt of any payment of pension
benefits hereunder, the trustee, upon the receipt of satisfactory evidence
accepted by the Administrator that such pensioner is so incapacitated and that
another person or institution is maintaining him and that no guardian or
committee has been appointed for him, may provide for such payment of pension
benefits hereunder to such person or institution so maintaining him, and any
such payments so made shall be deemed for every purpose to have been made to
such pensioner.
2.   Benefits for a Deceased Participant. If any benefit shall be payable under
the plan to or on behalf of a participant who has died, if the plan provides
that the payment of such benefits shall be made to the participant's estate,
and if no administration of such participant's estate is pending in the court
of proper jurisdiction, then the trustee, at its sole option, may pay such
benefits to the surviving spouse of such deceased participant, or, if there be
no such surviving spouse, to such participant's then living issue, per stirpes;
provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prevent the trustee from
insisting upon the commencement of estate administration proceedings and the
delivery of any such benefits to a duly appointed executor or administrator.
3.   Liability of Officers of the Plan Sponsor and/or Participating Employers.
Subject to the provisions of the Act, no past, present or future officer of the
plan sponsor nor of any participating employer shall be personally liable to
any participant, beneficiary or other person under any provision of the plan or
trust, or any policy or contract issued pursuant thereto.
4.   Assets in Trust Fund Owned by Trustee, Not Participants. Nothing contained
herein shall be deemed to give any participant or his beneficiary any interest
in any specific property of the trust or any right except to receive such
distributions as are expressly provided for under the plan in which he is a
participant.
5.   Employment Rights Not Affected by the Plan. Participation in this plan
shall not give any right to any employee to be retained in the employ of any
employer participating hereunder, nor shall it interfere with the right of any
employer to discharge any employee and to deal with him without regard to the
effect that such treatment might have upon him as a participant in this plan.
6.   Trust Fund for Sole Benefit of Participants. The income and principal of
the trust fund are for the sole use and benefit of the participants covered
hereunder, and, to the extent permitted by law, shall be free, clear and
discharged from and are not to be in any way liable for debts, contracts or
agreements, now contracted or which may hereafter be contracted, and from all
claims and liabilities now or hereafter incurred by any participant or
beneficiary.
7.   Meaning of Certain Words. As used herein the masculine gender shall
include the feminine gender and the singular shall include the plural in all
cases where such meaning would be appropriate. Headings of Articles and
Sections are inserted only for convenience of reference and are not to be
considered in the construction of the plan.
8.   Information to be Furnished by the Employer. Each participating employer
shall furnish to the Administrator and the trustee information in the
employer's possession as the Administrator and the trustee shall require from
time to time to perform their duties under the Master Plan and the trust.
9.   Spend Thrift. To the extent permitted by law, no payment to any person
under any contract, nor the right to receive such payments, nor any interest in
this plan and trust, shall be subject to assignment, alienation, transfer or
anticipation, either by voluntary or involuntary act of any participant or
beneficiary or by operation of law, nor shall such payment or right or interest
be subject to the demands or claims of any creditor of such person, nor be
liable in any way for such person's debts, obligations or liabilities.
10.   Action by Employer. Whenever, under the terms of this plan, a
participating employer is permitted or required to take some action, such
action may be taken by an officer of the employer who has been duly authorized
by the employer.
11.   Construction of Agreement. The validity of this Master Plan and trust or
any of its provisions shall be determined under and construed according to the
laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. If any provision of this Master Plan
and trust shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, such determination
shall not affect its remaining provisions, and it shall be construed as if such
illegal or invalid provision had never been included.
12.   Disputed Payments. If a dispute arises as to the proper recipient of any
payment, or delivery of any contracts, the Administrator in its sole discretion
may withhold or cause to be withheld such payment or delivery until the dispute
shall have been settled by the parties concerned or shall have been determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction.
13.   Inconsistency/Conflict of Prior Ordinances or Resolutions. Any ordinances
or resolutions with an effective date prior to the plan and which are
inconsistent or conflicting with the plan shall be repealed. It is the
employer's intention to have a Plan which contains inseparable provisions. If
any court of competent jurisdiction declares the language or a provision of the
plan to be invalid, such ruling shall not effect any other language or any
other provisions of the plan not specifically included in the court ruling.
14.   Compliance with Legislative Changes. Each participating employer intends
to comply with the interpretations of P.L. 1804, as amended, 53 P.S. § 767,
(Act 600), issued by the judicial and regulatory bodies of the Commonwealth of

Part arise from the need to limit, regulate, restrict and control garage and
yard sales. It is not the intent of this Part to change or amend the Zoning

Chapter 3 - PROCEDURES
§ 3.01 INTENT
The procedures established in this Chapter are intended to define the steps by
which a developer shall design, make an application, record plats, and
construct improvements, and by which the Planning Department may review, make
recommendations, approve plans and otherwise administer these regulations and
this Ordinance.
For those subdivisions hereinafter classified as minor subdivisions, a sketch
plan and abbreviated final plan procedure is established. For all others, which
are classified as major subdivisions or land developments, a preliminary plan
and final plat procedure is established. See the Appendix for sample plans.
§ 3.02. PRE-APPLICATION
The Planning Department shall make available to developers copies of this
subdivision and land development ordinance, the zoning code, the thoroughfare
and other adopted plans, street maps, and other information which may affect
the development of the property under consideration. Applications for approval
of a subdivision or land development shall be in accord with these regulations,
other codes and plans as adopted and information furnished.
Prior to the formal submission of a subdivision or land development plan for
review and approval, the subdivider is urged to submit a sketch plan to the
Planning Department for advice on the requirements necessary to achieve
conformity to the standards of these regulations as well as to alert the
subdivider as early as possible to factors which must be considered in the
design of a subdivision, such as pertinent elements of any County or Municipal
land use, thoroughfare or other community plans. Review of a sketch plan is an
informal, advisory process to guide the subdivider in eventual preparation of a
faunal preliminary or final plan.
Sketch plans and subsequent official minor and major subdivision and land
development plans should be accompanied by any letters of transmittal or
development details necessary to explain existing or proposed site conditions
which are not self-explanatory on the actual sketch, minor or major subdivision
or land development plan.
§ 3.03. MINOR SUBDIVISION OR LAND DEVELOPMENT
A.   Classification - A division of land to facilitate a lot addition or a land
exchange or a division of land which adjoins an existing public street and does
not involve the opening, widening, extension or improvement of any street or
the installation of any public utility outside the frontage road and does not
involve more than five (5) lots or dwelling units (except that subdivision of
lots from a property after five (5) or more lots have been previously
subdivided is a major subdivision).
Dedication or establishment of an unimproved right-of-way or easement shall be
a minor subdivision. Replatting, resubdivision or revision of five (5) lots or
less shall also be considered a minor subdivision. Multi-family, commercial,
industrial and mobilehome park development shall be a major, not minor,
subdivision or land development, regardless of the number of lots or units
created.
B.   Application - A final plat complying with the requirements set forth in
this Ordinance shall be prepared for each minor subdivision or land development
and approval of said plat shall be requested from the Planning Department.
When filing an application for approval of a minor subdivision or land
development, the subdivider shall submit to the Planning Department one (1)
mylar or original, one (1) clothback print, and eight (8) blue line paper
prints of the proposal on 18" X 24" sheets.
C.   Review - Upon receipt of the minor subdivision or land development plan,
the Planning Department shall begin to review the final plan for compliance
with this Ordinance. Where applicable, the plan may be forwarded to the County
Engineer, the Soil Conservation Service or other agencies for review and
comment. After initial review, the final plan may be forwarded to the
municipality in which the development is to occur to provide the municipal
planning commission and governing body an opportunity for review and comment.
Review comments, conditions and findings of the municipality may be used as
substantiation for plan approval or disapproval. After completion of the review
process, the final plan shall be approved or disapproved by the Planning
Department.
Review and report of plans by the Planning Department for the municipalities
that have adopted their own subdivision and land development ordinance shall be
forwarded to the said municipalities within thirty (30) days from the date the
application was forwarded to the Planning Department.
D.   Approval or Disapproval - After an application for approval of a plat of a
minor subdivision or land development has been filed with the Planning
Department, together will all maps, necessary data, and fees, the plan shall be
reviewed and processed. The subdivider or developer shall pay required review
fees at the time of official submission of the plat and official submission
shall not be deemed to have been made until receipt of all the required review
fees. The Planning Department shall complete the review and either approve or
disapprove the plat not later than ninety (90) days after such application
submission is filed. The decision shall be in writing and shall be communicated
to the applicant personally or mailed to him at his last known address not
later than fifteen (15) days following the decision.
When the application is approved, it shall be appropriately signed and dated
and copies shall be distributed according to §
3.03(E) of this Ordinance. When the application is disapproved, the decision
shall specify the defects found in the application and describe the
requirements which have not been met and shall, in each case, cite to the
provisions of the Ordinance relied upon. A disapproved copy of the subdivision
or land development plan shall be retained by the Planning Department, one copy
shall be sent to the municipality and the remaining copies shall be returned to
the subdivider, developer and his agent.
Failure of the Planning Department to render a decision and communicate it to
the applicant within the time and in the manner required herein shall be deemed
approval of the application in the terms as presented, unless the applicant has
agreed in writing to an extension of time or change in the prescribed manner of
presentation of communication of the decision in which case, failure to meet
the extended time or change in manner of presentation of communication shall
have like effect. However, removal or withdrawal of the subdivision or land
development plan from the approval process by the subdivider, developer and/or
his agent shall be considered withdrawal of plan application, shall not
obligate the Planning Department to approve or disapprove the plan within the
herein described timetable and shall not result in a deemed approval when
ninety (90) days have elapsed. Upon knowledge of plan withdrawal, the Planning
Department shall notify, in writing, the subdivider or land developer than plan
withdrawal has disrupted the approval process and no approval or disapproval
will be rendered unless the subdivision or land development plan is resubmitted
as a new application.
E.   RECORDING - After approval of a minor subdivision or land development plat
by the Planning Department, the mylar copy shall be placed on record in the
Planning Department office and the clothback print shall be filed and recorded
in the office of the County Recorder of Deeds, said recording to occur within
ninety (90) days of the final or deemed approval date of the plan or the
approval shall be null and void. Whenever such plat approval is required by
this Ordinance, the Recorder of Deeds shall not accept any plat for recording
unless such plat officially notes the approval of the Planning Department.
Likewise, whenever plan review and comment by the Planning Department is
required by municipal ordinance (§ 3.03(C)), the Recorder of Deeds shall not
accept any plat for recording unless such plat officially notes the review of
the Planning Department.
Copies of an approved plat shall be sent to the applicant and the municipality
where the development is planned. Additional copies may be distributed to the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, County Emergency Management Agency,
County Assessment Office, Metropolitan Edison Company, Pennsylvania Power and
Light Company, Bell of Pennsylvania, Bethel and Mt. Aetna Telephone Company or
other utility or related agency making timely request for copies.
§ 3.04. MAJOR SUBDIVISION OR LAND DEVELOPMENT - PRELIMINARY PLAN
A.   Classification - Any subdivision or land development involving more than
five (5) lots or dwelling units; or any subdivision or land development on a
property after five (5) or more lots or dwelling units have previously been
subdivided from that property; or any subdivision or land development proposing
the opening, widening, extension or improvement of a street shall be deemed to
be a major subdivision or land development. Multi-family, mobilehome park,
commercial and industrial development shall be considered major subdivision or
land development, regardless of the number of lots or units created.
B.   Application - A preliminary plat complying with the requirements set forth
in this Ordinance shall be prepared for each major subdivision or land
development and an approval requested from the Planning Department.
When filing an application for preliminary approval of a major subdivision or
land development, the subdivider shall submit to the Planning Department six
(6) blue line prints of the proposal. As part of the submission, the subdivider
shall also submit six (6) paper prints of the improvement plan (if not
contained on initial sheet) containing details of the physical site
improvements (roadways, utilities, etc.) Proposed for the subdivision or land
development. All sheets shall be 18" X 24" or 24" X 36."
C.   Review - Upon receipt of the preliminary plan (and improvement plan, if
separate), the Planning Department shall begin to review the plan for
compliance with this Ordinance. The preliminary plan shall be examined for
suitable relationship to adjoining subdivisions or undeveloped land,
feasibility of the program for improvements, and provide an opportunity for
advice, suggestions, and adjustments to meet ordinance requirements before the
plan becomes rigid. The submission of alternate plans is recommended.
Where applicable, the plan may be forwarded to the County Engineer, Soil
Conservation Service, or other appropriate agency for review and comment. After
initial review, the preliminary plan, plus any applicable improvement plan, may
be forwarded to the municipality in which the development is to occur to
provide the municipal planning commission and governing body an opportunity for
review and comment. Review comments, conditions and findings of the
municipalities may be used as substantiation for plan approval or disapproval.
After completion of the review process, the preliminary plan and improvement
plan shall be approved or disapproved by the Planning Department.
Review and report of plans by the Planning Department for the municipalities
that have adopted their own subdivision and land development ordinance shall be
forwarded to the said municipalities within thirty (30) days from the date the
application was forwarded to the Planning Department.
D.   Approval or Disapproval - After an application for preliminary approval of
a plat of a major subdivision or land development has been filed with the
Planning Department, together with all improvement plans, maps, necessary data
and fees, the Planning Department shall complete the review and either approve
or disapprove the plan in accordance with the procedure outlines in §
3.03(D).
E.   Recording - After approval of a preliminary plan for a major subdivision
or land development plat by the Planning Department, recording of the
preliminary plan is not authorized.
Approval of the preliminary plan shall assure the subdivider for a period of
five (5) years from the date of approval that:
   1.   The general layout of streets, lots, and other features are approved
and shall be the basis for the preparation of the final plan; and
   2.   The general terms and any special conditions under which the approval
of the plan was granted will not be changed; and
   3.   The subdivider may install improvements in accordance with the approved
preliminary plan and other requirements contained in this Ordinance and those
ordinances of local municipalities where the subdivision is located.
Approval of a preliminary plan does not constitute approval of the final plan,
and therefore, does not authorize the recording of the subdivision or land
development plan or the sale or transfer of lots. After a period of five (5)
years, approval of the preliminary plan shall expire.
§ 3.05. MAJOR SUBDIVISION OR LAND DEVELOPMENT - FINAL PLAN
A.   Classification - Any subdivision or land development involving more than
five (5) lots or dwelling units; or any subdivision or land development on a
property after five (5) or more lots or dwelling units have previously been
subdivided from that property; or any subdivision or land development proposing
the opening, widening, extension or improvement of a street shall be deemed to
be a major subdivision or land development. Multi-family, mobile home park,
commercial and industrial development shall be considered major subdivision or
land development, regardless of the number of lots or units created.
B.   Application - Within five (5) years after the approval of the preliminary
plat, a final plat with all necessary supplemental data shall be officially
submitted to the Planning Department with a request for approval. Failure to
submit a final plan within five (5) years of the date of an approval of the
preliminary plat shall void the preliminary approval, unless extended in
writing by the Planning Depar intent. Said expired or voided preliminary plan
shall not be used as a basis for any development or construction. Any
subsequent development shall be preceded by a new preliminary plan.
When filing an application for a final approval of the major subdivision or
land development, the subdivider or developer shall submit to the County
Planning Department one (1) mylar copy or original, one (1) clothback print,
and eight (8) blue line paper prints of the proposal on 18" X 24" sheets.
The subdivider or developer may apply for final approval of: 1) only a portion,
section or phase of the entire subdivision or land development as preliminarily
approved; or 2) the entire subdivision or land development.
C.   Review - Upon receipt of the final plan, the Planning Department shall
begin to review the plan for compliance with this Ordinance. The final plan
shall be examined for conformity to the preliminary plan, for design and detail
of required site improvements and for adherence to other standards of this
Ordinance. The plan shall also be examined to determine if the required site
improvements have been installed or, in lieu thereof, a bond or financial
security has been submitted. Where applicable, the plan may be forwarded to the
County Engineer, the Soil Conservation Service or other agencies for review and
comment. After initial review, the final plan may be forwarded to the
municipality in which the development is to occur to provide the municipal
planning commission and governing body an opportunity for review and comment.
Review comments, conditions and findings of the municipality may be used as
substantiation for plan approval or disapproval. After completion of the review
process, the final plan shall be approved or disapproved by the Planning
Department.
Review and report of plans by the Planning Department for the municipalities
that have adopted their own subdivision and land development ordinance shall be
forwarded to the said municipalities within thirty (30) days from the date the
application was forwarded to the Planning Department.
D.   Approval or Disapproval - After an application for final approval of a
plat of a major subdivision or land development has been, filed with the
Planning Department, approval or disapproval shall be granted in accordance
with §
3.03(D) of this Ordinance.
However, no plat shall be finally approved unless the streets on such plat have
been improved as may be required by ordinance, and any walkways, curbs,
gutters, street lights, fire hydrants, shade trees, landscaping, water mains,
sanitary sewers, storm sewers, storm water management facilities, and other
site improvements as may be required by this Ordinance and any applicable
municipal requirements have been installed in accordance with such
requirements. In lieu of the completion of any site improvements required as a
condition for the final approval of a plat, a financial security shall be
deposited by the subdivider /developer with the municipality and/ or county in
an amount to cover the costs of any site improvements which may be required by
ordinance. Such financial security shall provide for and secure to the public,
the completion of any site improvements which may be required for the
subdivision or land development. Financial improvement guarantees shall further
be subject to the requirements of §
5.14 of this Ordinance and §§
5.09 -
5.11 of Act 247.
2.   Recording - After approval of a final plat for a major subdivision or land
development by the Planning Department, the plat shall be recorded and copies
distributed in the manner prescribed in §
3.03 (E) of this Ordinance.
Recording shall entitle the subdivider to sell, transfer or develop the land
shown on the plat in accordance with the approved plat, subject to any
conditions attached thereto. Where final plans are approved for only a portion,
section or phase of the entire subdivision or land development, sale, transfer
or development may proceed only on that approved portion, section or phase.
When a final plat has been approved, no subsequent change or amendment in
zoning, subdivision or other governing ordinance shall be applied to affect
adversely the right of the subdivider or land developer to commence and
complete any aspect of the approved development in accordance with the terms of
such approval within five (5) years from such approval. Where final approval is
preceded by preliminary approval, the aforesaid five-year period shall be
counted from the date of the preliminary approval.
When the subdivider or land developer has failed to substantially complete
development of the approved plan within five (5) years of the aforesaid
approval date and when changes in a zoning, subdivision, or other governing
ordinance have occurred which affect the design of the approved plat, the
subdivision or land development shall be subject to the changes in the zoning,
subdivision, or other governing ordinance. The Planning Department shall
notify, in writing, the subdivider or land developer that approval has expired
and submission and approval of a revised preliminary and final plan (as
necessary to detail changes), illustrating compliance with the revised
ordinance, is required prior to further development or lot transfer.

Chapter 5 - REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS AND DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 5.01. INTENT
The design standards established in this Chapter are intended to be fundamental
requirements to be applied with professional skill in the subdividing and
planning of land so as to produce attractive and harmonious neighborhoods,
convenient and safe streets, and economical layouts of residential and other
land development. The design standards are further intended to encourage and
promote flexibility and ingenuity in the layout and design of subdivisions and
land developments, in accordance with modern and evolving principles of site
planning and development.
It is also the intent of this Chapter to require subdividers and developers to
follow all applicable codes, regulations, and standard adopted by the
municipality or the County relative to improvements to the subdivision or
development site. In all cases, the codes, regulations and standards of the
municipality shall be followed and the improvements shall be approved by the
municipal governing body before the final plan is approved. In cases where
development codes, regulations, and standards do not exist at the municipal
level, the requirements of this Chapter shall be followed and approved by the
Planning Department. All improvements as specified in this Chapter or in
applicable municipal ordinances shall be installed before the final plat is
approved or, in lieu thereof, a guarantee of installation shall be provided by
the subdivider or developer prior to final plat approval. The guarantee shall
assure the responsible body (Municipality or County) that the required
improvements will be installed in accordance with the subdivision or land
development plan.
During the design and approval of subdivision and land development plans the
Planning Department, the municipal planning agency and governing body, and the
developer shall give primary consideration to all thoroughfare plans, water
plans, sewer plans, community facility plans, and official maps as may be in
effect in the municipality.
§ 5.02. GENERAL STANDARDS
In addition to the standards contained elsewhere in these regulations, the
following general standards shall be observed.
A.   Existing utilities and improvements shall be utilized wherever possible.
New roads and extended utility services shall be discouraged if existing
services and facilities may be utilized. Scattered urban development shall be
avoided.
B.   Development designs shall minimize street lengths necessary to serve
developed properties.
C.   Side lot lines should be substantially at right angles or radial to street
lines, unless the purpose of lot line orientation is to obtain greater solar
access.
D.   Depth of residential lots should be not less than one (1) nor more than
two and a half (2-1 /2) times the lot width.
E.   Every lot shall abut a street. Lot frontage or access shall be physically
accessible by standard vehicle in existing condition or the Planning Department
shall require illustration of the site improvements planned and necessary to
alter steep banks, flood plains, visibility limitations, etc., to a condition
that will facilitate safe and adequate access. The Planning Department may also
require that lots be arranged to reserve a right-of-way for street access to
future lots.
F.   Double or reverse frontage lots may be preferred or required when lot
access to an adjoining street is not permitted or separation from the street is
desired because of topographic, orientation, aesthetic, congestion, safety or
high noise level considerations.
G.   Adequate easements or rights-of-way shall be required for drainage and
utilities.
Easements shall be a minimum of twenty (20) feet in width and, whenever
possible, shall be centered on side or rear lot lines. No structure or
buildings shall be erected within such easements.
H.   Additional lot areas beyond minimum size may be required:
   1.   On slopes in excess of 15%.
   2.   To control erosion or storm water runoff.
   3.   To provide sufficient area for sewage disposal.
I.   Lots shall be suitably shaped to encourage and facilitate use and
maintenance of all portions of the lot. Accordingly, lots shall be square or
generally rectangular in shape. Lot configurations which result in flag lots
and L-shaped, T-shaped, triangular or otherwise inappropriately shaped lots
shall be avoided.
J.   Site design and development shall include reasonable efforts to save
existing trees and vegetation.
K.   The standards of this Ordinance shall apply to all lots being subdivided
or developed and residual land which is created by the subdivision or land
development activity.
L.   Subdivision of property with existing dwellings or development shall be
regulated by the following:
   1.   Each dwelling or use shall be serviced by separate utility connections.
   Shared sewage systems are not permitted.
   2.   Each dwelling or use subdivided shall be on sufficient land area to
satisfy minimum lot area and yard setback requirements. Where adequate land
area is not available to satisfy minimum standards, subdivision may be
permitted when:
      a.   Each dwelling or principal building is in good structural condition.
      b.   Mobile homes are not involved.
      c.   An equitable distribution of land is proposed between the existing
uses or buildings.
M.   Lot additions, land exchanges, agricultural use only lands, and any other
specific or special purpose subdivision or land development shall include
prominent plan notes to avoid misinterpretation of the intent of the
subdivision or land development plan. Applicable deed restrictions may be
required.
N.   Deeds filed subsequent to subdivision or land development approval shall
accurately and correctly describe the property therein. Deeds shall be in
complete compliance with all plan notes and conditions.
Recording a deed which omits or contradicts the information on an approved
subdivision or land development plan shall be a violation of this Ordinance.
§ 5.03. ENERGY CONSERVATION STANDARDS
Conservation of energy shall be an important principle in the design of
subdivisions and land developments. Plans shall facilitate the energy efficient
placement of homes and buildings on lots. Whenever the following criteria are
found to be appropriate to a site, development design be in accordance with the
standards contained herein.
A.   Orientation
   1.   Lots shall be designed for energy efficient siting of buildings with
respect to slopes and existing trees.
   2.   Southerly exposure should be utilized for development. North slopes,
especially those over 10% slope, should be avoided because the long shadows
created severely restrict solar access.
   3.   New lots and new residences shall be oriented to make maximum effective
use of passive solar energy. The long axis (depth) of each lot should run
North-South, with a possible East-West variation of 22-1/2 degrees. Lot design
should provide for lots of adequate width, depth, and slope for solar
orientation. Lot layout should facilitate solar access by at least 75% of the
proposed dwellings or buildings within a development.
   4.   The largest yard setback should be stipulated on the south side of
proposed buildings. Buildings should be situated to the North end of the lot to
permit maximum on-lot control of solar skyspace.
B.   Streets
   1.   Streets should be oriented along an East-West axis, with maximum North-
South deviations of 30 degrees. This should be required to the maximum extent
possible, although size, configuration or orientation of the property; nature
of the surrounding development; circulation patterns; existing physical
features such as topography and vegetation (trees); and improved design
potential may be considered to determine the feasibility of this requirement
for a given site.
   2.   Street system shall be design to reduce overall lengths and facilitate
traffic flow (minimum number of intersections).
C.   Vegetation and Wind
   1.   Site design shall emphasize the preservation of all beneficial natural
features of the site, such as existing slope, naturally wooded areas, and water
courses. The site design should also avoid requiring removal of large isolated
trees and desirable woods and other vegetation, particularly those existing
plant materials which serve as wind barriers and aid in energy conservation.
   2.   Developments shall be designed to maximize wind buffering and/or breeze
channelization capabilities of vegetation, topography and structure layouts.
Wind breaks and buffers should utilize evergreens to protect both and
northwesterly exposure. Cooling breezes from the southwest should be channeled
past buildings. Deciduous trees shall be located in areas which will enable
them to shade buildings from the summer sun, but still allow penetration of the
winter sun.
§ 5.04. TOPOGRAPHY
Subdivisions shall be planned to take advantage of the topography of land in
order to: utilize the natural contours, economize in the construction of
drainage facilities, reduce the amount of grading, and minimize destruction of
trees and topsoil. The natural features and other distinctive characteristics
of the site shall be integrated into the plan to create functional variations
in the neighborhoods.
Additionally, environmental safeguards may be mandated on slopes in excess of
15%. On steep slopes (in excess of 15%), site and lot design shall be adjusted,
where necessary, to mitigate the detrimental effects of development on steeper
slopes. The following topographic considerations shall be utilized in design of
subdivisions and land developments:
A.   Streets - Land which is relatively flat or of very gentle slopes should be
planned so that the streets follow the natural drainage courses and as many
lots as possible shall be above the street grade. On more irregular topography,
streets shall be designed to avoid extensive cuts and fills and follow the
ridges or be planned approximately parallel to contour lines, and adjusted,
however, so that lots on one (1) side of the street will not be excessively
below the street grade.
B.   Natural Drainage - Subdivisions shall be designed, particularly on land of
very gentle slopes, to take every advantage of natural grades so that all the
land can be drained without excessive grading. Unless water courses or drainage
ways are enclosed, the plan shall be adjusted so that rear lot lines shall be
approximately parallel to the natural or straightened course, and only where
such plan is not possible, should side lot lines be arranged parallel to an
open drainage course. Easements for drainage ways and low- lying land which are
subject to flooding may be included as part of a lot but shall not be used as
building sites or included in calculating the required lot area or width.
C.   Natural Features - Natural features, irregularities, changes in level,
brooks, lakes, hilltops, and other focal points within the site, and distant
views outside the subdivision shall be integrated in the design to obtain
variations and interest in each neighborhood and more attractive building
sites. Trees, topsoil, and other natural resources shall be preserved and
utilized in the development of the subdivision.
D.   Driveways - Private driveways shall be designed to furnish safe and
convenient access, with reasonable clear sight distance at intersection with
the street. Steep slopes shall be traversed diagonally to minimize grades.
Driveway grades shall not exceed 15% slope. The Planning Department may require
paving of driveways exceeding 10% slope to minimize erosion.
§ 5.05. GRADING
The developer shall grade each subdivision or land development to establish
street grades, floor elevations of buildings, and lot grades in proper relation
to each other and to existing topography. However, grading shall be kept to a
minimum to avoid loss of topsoil and erosion potential. Lots shall be graded to
secure drainage away from buildings. The grading shall facilitate collection of
storm water in designated areas and avoid concentration of water in the sewage
system location.
The grading of the roadway shall extend the full width of the cartway, shoulder
and swale area, if applicable. Were possible, grass strips or channels between
the curb or shoulder and right-of-way line should be graded 3:1 slope; however,
when unusual topographic conditions exist, good engineering shall prevail.
§ 5.06. LOT SIZES AND STANDARDS
The minimum lot size and lot width requirements established by municipal zoning
ordinance shall be utilized as minimum subdivision standards. All lots shall
satisfy the municipal zoning standard for lot width and lot size at the time of
subdivision. Additionally, the building setback lines established by the
municipal zoning ordinance shall be applicable and shall be noted on each
subdivision or land development plan. Additionally, each subdivision or land
development plan shall satisfy all other applicable zoning standards, unless
variance thereto has been granted.
In cases where zoning standards have not been enacted or might otherwise be
determined not to be valid, the following uniform standards shall apply for new
building lots:
 
                           Minimum        Minimum   Minimum Setbacks
Available Utilities*       Lot Size       Lot Width Front Side Rear
On-lot Well & Sewage       1 Acre         150'      40'   15'  40'
Public Water/On-lot sewage 30,000 sq. ft. 135'      40'   15'  40'
On-lot Well/Public Sewer   20,000 sq. ft. 120'      35'   10'  35'
Public Water & Sewer       10,000 sq. ft. 100'      30'   10'  30'
 
*Public also includes approved community water and sewage systems.
§ 5.07. STORM WATER MANAGEMENT AND DESIGN CRITERIA
A.   Scope - A Storm Water Management Plan shall be required for each
subdivision or land development plan (except single family residential lots
meeting the criteria of §
5.07A.1.) at both the preliminary and final submittal stage. As an integral
part of the Storm Water Management Plan, erosion and sedimentation control
measures shall be included. For the purpose of this section of the Ordinance,
any expansion or construction where such development occupies an area in excess
of 20,000 square feet (combined building and paved parking area) shall be
considered a land development plan and also require a Storm Water Management
Plan in accordance with the applicable regulations of this Section. The 20,000
square foot requirement applies on individual large projects, projects which
exceed a cumulative total of 20,000 square feet after the Ordinance effective
date (September 13, 1979), and any projects occurring after the 20,000 square
feet level has been reached. A Storm Water Management Plan must be approved as
per paragraph C of this Section before construction of any expansion may
proceed.
   1.   Exception - Single family residential lots may be exempted from the
mandatory design and installation of certain storm water management facilities
when the lot improvements (house, driveway, regrading, etc.) on the proposed
subdivision plan document to the satisfaction of the Planning Department and
the County Engineer that the lot improvements will not result in detrimental
storm water discharges within the lot(s) or upon adjoining lands, roads,
waterways or other areas. Exemption may be granted by the Planning Department
provided all of the following criteria are satisfied:
      (a)   The subdivision plan shall meet all of the criteria for a minor
subdivision; and
      (b)   The minimum lot area shall be two (2) acres; and
      (c)   The slope of the lot shall not exceed 4% in the lot improvement
area and slopes in excess of 8% shall not exist within fifty feet (50') of the
lot improvement area; and
      (d)   Streams, waterways and ecologically sensitive areas shall not exist
within one hundred feet (100') of the lot improvement area; and
      (e)   The proposed lot improvements shall be a minimum of fifty feet
(50') from side and rear lot lines, unless site conditions or other
requirements necessitate greater setback.
      (f)   Plan notes shall document that the soils within the lot improvement
area are in the hydrologic soil group A, B or C, as published in the current
edition of TR-55, Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds; and
      (g)   Storm water discharges shall not endanger or potentially damage the
lot improvements, adjoining lands, roads or otherwise pose a threat to the
health, safety or welfare of the public; and
      (h)   No unique or adverse lot conditions shall exist which warrant
refusal of the exemption request; and
      (i)   The exemption request shall be submitted in writing with the
subdivision application and shall address all the criteria cited herein; and
      (j)   Subdivision application shall be accompanied by standard
application and inspection fees to assure evaluation of lot(s) for compliance
with the exemption criteria at the design, construction and inspection stages;
and
      (k)   Subdivision plans containing any lots which have received storm
water management design and installation exemptions in accordance with these
provisions shall contain a prominent plan note explaining the exemption and the
lot development restrictions applicable thereto; and
         (1)   Any lot receiving a storm water management installation
exemption and subsequently found to be developed, or under development,
contrary to the approved subdivision plan, contrary to these exemption
provisions or otherwise evidencing a storm water runoff problem shall forthwith
be subject to the following:
         Corrective action shall be taken in the lot development to eliminate
the noncompliance.
         Submission of a revised subdivision plan shall be required, depicting
necessary storm water management facilities, in accordance with standard plan
processing procedures.
         Lot owner(s), developer(s) or other responsible person(s) who fail to
take corrective lot development action or fail to submit a required revised
plan shall be guilty of a violation of this Ordinance, punishable as provided
by §
8.06 of this Ordinance.
B.   Content - The Storm Water Management Plan shall contain the following:
   1.   A general description of the proposed subject.
   2.   Project location on a 7.5 minute U.S.G.S. map or equivalent.
   3.   Topographic features of the site and adjacent lands that are considered
to impact upon the Storm Water Management design. Flow direction arrows should
be utilized to indicate the direction of storm water flow on site.
   4.   Runoff calculations for the entire watershed and related design
computation necessary to substantiate the proposed temporary and permanent
storm water management facilities. A minimum affected drainage area of one (1)
acre shall be used to calculate required storm water storage, unless otherwise
justified by site topography illustrated on the plan.
   5.   Design and specifications of temporary and permanent storm water
management facilities. The volume of storm water detention required per lot
shall be noted on the plan, as well as approximate dimensions of the proposed
facility. An estimated construction cost should also be provided.
   6.   Staging or implementation schedule for constructing the proposed storm
water control system. A plan note shall be added to grant county and municipal
officials and employees thereof the right of access to the property for
inspection of a storm water management facilities and, in the event of default
by the subdivider, installation of the storm water management facilities.
   7.   Maintenance and ownership provisions.
C.   Review and Approval - All Storm Water Management Plans shall be reviewed
by the County Engineer prior to County approval. A set of design plans shall be
maintained on file at the site during construction, as record drawings.
Observations of construction shall be the responsibility of the County Engineer
or his designated representative and shall be conducted to certify compliance
with this Ordinance. Upon completion of the storm water management installation
for a subdivision or land development of more than one (1) lot or unit with an
estimated storm water management facilities construction costs in excess of
$3,000.00, the developer/subdivider shall proved a certification of completion
from a registered engineer or surveyor verifying that storm water management
facilities have been constructed in compliance with the approved plans. Changes
to the approved plans shall be authorized only with the written approval of the
County Engineer.
D.   Design Standards - Computations for determining storm water runoff and for
the design of storm water management facilities shall be based upon the current
U.S.D.A., SoilCover-Complex Method described in TR-55, Urban Hydrology for
Small Watersheds; the United States Department of Agriculture, Soil
Conservation Service National Engineering Handbook, § 4.
The Storm Water Management Plan shall effectively demonstrate the control of
post- development peak discharge rates to pre-development peak discharge rates
based on the following standards:
   1.   All pre-development calculations, unless is woodland, shall be based
upon the assumption of grass or pasture cover in good hydrologic condition, and
pre- development storm water runoff shall be calculated for a two (2) year
storm event. Where the site contains existing impervious surface, up to 50% of
the impervious area may be considered as an existing pre-development condition.
   2.   Storage structures and peak flow from subdivision or land development
shall be designed such that post-development five-year peak discharge will not
exceed the pre-development two-year peak discharge for the primary outlet
structure and from the development.
   3.   All storage structures shall be designed with emergency spillways. The
minimum design capacity of the emergency spillway shall be the 25 year post-
development peak discharge while maintaining a minimum of 1.0 foot freeboard.
   4.   Culverts, pipes and other water carrying structures shall be designed
to handle the peak discharge from the ten year post-development storm event.
   5.   The storm water management plan shall include calculations indicating
velocities of flow, grades, sized, and capacities of the detention structures
and sufficient design information to construct such facilities.
   6.   Storm water runoff shall be based on the following 24-hour storm
events:
 
STORM FREQUENCY INCHES OF RAINFALL
2 Years         3.0 Inches
5 Years         4.0 Inches
10 Years        4.8 Inches
25 Years        5.3 Inches
50 Years        6.0 Inches
100 Years       6.7 Inches
 
   7.   Maximum permitted average velocities are as follows:
      (a)   Three feet (3') per second where only sparse vegetation can be
established.
      (b)   Four feet (4') per second under conditions where vegetation is to
be established by seeding.
      (c)   Five feet (5') per second where dense, vigorous sod can be quickly
established or where water can be temporarily diverted during establishment of
vegetation.
      (d)   Six feet (6') per second where well established sod is in
existence. (e)   For lined water carrying channels, the following velocities
are permitted:
         (1)   Six inch (6") Rock Rip-Rap - Up to six feet (6') per second.
         (2)   Nine inch (9") Rock Rip-Rap - Up to eight feet (8') per second.
         (3)   Asphalt - Up to seven feet (7') per second.
         (4)   Durable Bedrock - Up to eight feet (8') per second.
         (5)   Twelve Inch (12") Rock Rip-Rap - Up to nine feet (9') per
second.
         (6)   Concrete or Steel - Up to twelve feet (12') per second.
         (7)   The nonual maximum velocity of open channel flows shall not
exceed ten feet (10') per second.
   8.   Energy dissipators shall be placed at the outlets of all pipes where
flow velocities exceed maximum permitted channel velocities.
   9.   Where a subdivision or land development is traversed by a water course,
drainage way, channel, or stream, there shall be provided a drainage easement
conforming substantially with the line of such water course, drainage way,
channel, or stream and of such width as will be adequate to preserve the
unimpeded flow of natural drainage, or for the purpose of widening, deepening,
relocating, improving or protecting such drainage facilities. Any changes in
the existing drainage way shall be subject to the approval of the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Resources, and if applicable by the Water and Power
Resources Board and the Division of Dam and Encroachments.
   10.   All streets shall be so designed to provide for the discharge of
surface water from their rights-of-way.
   11.   The slope of the crown on proposed streets shall be 1/8 of an inch per
foot. Slope of the centerline grade shall be at least .75%.
   12.   Adequate facilities shall be provided at low points along streets and
where necessary to intercept runoff.
   13.   Storm sewers and related piping shall be fully coated corrugated
metal, reinforced concrete or corrugated polyethylene as approved by the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.
   14.   If the subdivision or land development is to be developed in stages, a
general drainage plan for the entire subdivision shall be presented with the
first stage and appropriate development stages for the drainage system shall be
indicated.
   15.   The existing points of natural drainage discharge onto adjacent
property shall not be altered without the written approval of the affected
landowners.
   16.   No storm water runoff or natural drainage water shall be so diverted
as to overload existing drainage systems, or create flooding or the need for
additional drainage structures on other private properties or public lands,
without approved provisions being made by the developer for properly handling
such conditions.
   17.   Vertical pipes, inlets and other surface water receiving structures
shall be installed with trash racks.
   18.   Storm water runoff channels shall be designed and installed to avoid
trapping excess sediment.
   19.   Storage of equivalent storm water runoff for a portion of a property
may be considered in lieu of storage of generated runoff provided:
      a.   The site is located so that it is physically impossible to detain
runoff from the proposed facilities or drainage problems exist upgrade that
would impact upon the site or downgrade properties.
      b.   The impact of generated runoff discharging off site from the
subdivision or land development is determined by the County Engineer to be
negligible and not detrimental to adjacent properties.
      c.   Implementation of equivalent storage shall be determined applicable
and feasible by the County Engineer.
   20.   A variety of methods for storm water detention are available for use.
These include surface detention, subsurface detention, use of existing
facilities (ponds, etc.) or a combination thereof. Subsurface detention shall
be utilized only where the subsurface is stable and not prone to sink hole
formation.
E.   Erosion and Sedimentation - Erosion and sedimentation control measures
shall be in accordance with the applicable standards and specifications set
forth in the current edition of Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Handbook
as prepared by the Lebanon County Soil Conservation District.
F.   Ownership and Maintenance Program - Each storm water management plan shall
contain provisions which clearly set forth the ownership and maintenance
responsibility of all temporary and permanent storm water management
facilities, and erosion and sedimentation control facilities, including:
   1.   Description of temporary and permanent maintenance requirements.
   2.   Identification of responsible individual, corporation, association or
other entity for ownership and maintenance of both temporary and permanent
storm water management and erosion and sedimentation control facilities.
   3.   Establishment of suitable easements for access to all facilities.
   4.   The intent of these regulations is to provide for private ownership and
maintenance of storm water management and erosion and sedimentation control
facilities. Where the Storm Water Management Plan proposes Municipal Ownership
and/ or maintenance, a description of the methods, procedures, and the extent
to which any facilities shall be turned over to the local municipality,
including a written approval of responsibilities as proposed, shall be
incorporated as an integral part of the plan.
G.   Basic Constriction Criteria - Construction of stomp water management and
erosion control facilities shall be in accordance with the approved plans and
accompanying specifications, if any. Construction or development contrary to,
or not in compliance with, the storm water management design on the approved
subdivision or land development plan shall be a violation of this Ordinance,
punishable as provided by § 8.06 of this Ordinance. The construction details
and standards of the following publications in their most recent revision shall
be acceptable:
   1.   "Erosion and Sedimentation Control Handbook of Lebanon County"
   2.   PennDOT, Foim 408, Specifications.
   3.   PennDOT, RC Series, Roadway Construction Standards.
§ 5.08. SEWAGE DISPOSAL
Sewage disposal facilities shall be designed and constructed to meet the needs
of the proposed subdivision or land development. Sewage disposal facilities
shall also meet all requirements of the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Resources and the municipality wherein the subdivision or land
development is located. The following requirements specify the design and
installation standards for subsurface sewage disposal and public and private
sewerage systems.
A.   Subsurface Sewage Disposal - All subdivisions and land developments
proposing subsurface sewage disposal shall be designed and submitted in
compliance with the prevailing requirements of the Pennsylvania Sewage
Facilities Act. It is the intent of this section to co-ordinate a simultaneous
review of subdivision and land development plans with sewage planning modules
at the municipal level, thereby avoiding the approval of lots that are not
suitable for sewage disposal. In accordance with those standards, application
for subdivision or land development approval shall satisfy the following
procedural requirements:
   1.   Minor Subdivision - The subdivider shall submit the sewage planning
module and required associated information to the sewage enforcement officer at
the time of final plat application. The subdivision or land development plan
shall not be processed until documentation is provided to verify that the
sewage enforcement officer has received the sewage planning module. All newly
created lots, whether for immediate or future use, shall be tested and approved
for sewage suitability.
   2.   Major Subdivision - The subdivider shall submit a preliminary plan
depicting general lot layout and street design, as required elsewhere herein.
After preliminary approval, the subdivider shall submit the required sewage
planning module and associated information to the sewage enforcement officer at
the time of final plan application. The subdivision or land development plan
shall not be processed until documentation is provided to verify that the
sewage enforcement officer has received the sewage planning module.
B.   Existing Public Sewers - When a subdivision or land development has public
sewers available on-site or within one thousand (1,000) feet of the site, sewer
lines shall be included on the subdivision or land development plan and
installation must be approved by the municipal authority responsible for the
sewer system.
C.   Planned Sewer Area - When a proposed subdivision or land development is
located in an area not presently served by public sewers, but which has
received design data preparatory to sewer system installation within eighteen
(18) months, then the municipality shall determined than necessity of
installing house connections and capped mains, even though on-site facilities
will be required in the interim. Installation of house connections and capped
mains shall be in accordance with municipal design data and approved by the
municipal engineer prior to approval of a preliminary or final plan.
D.   Private Sewerage System - When a subdivision or land development is to be
provided with a private sewerage system, a statement shall be submitted to the
Planning Department from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources
verifying that a permit has been issued approving the proposed facilities.
Additionally, the municipality must be satisfied that adequate provisions have
been made to guarantee the construction and maintenance of the proposed private
sewerage system.
E.   Plan Notice
   1.   Subsurface Sewage Disposal - All subdivision and land development plans
shall contain a plan note specifying that approval of the plan does not
guarantee permit issuance for sewage disposal.
   2.   Public Sewers - All subdivision and land development plans shall
contain a plan note specifying that connection to public sewer lines is
required.
§ 5.09. WATER SUPPLY
A water supply system shall be designed and constructed by the subdivider or
developer as required by the municipality, water company, or water authority in
relation to the specific site of the proposed subdivision or land development.
The water supply system shall be capable of meeting the domestic and fire
protection needs of the site. When possible, the subdivision or land
development should be served by a public water supply system approved by
municipal water officials or a community water system approved by the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources. If the subdivision or land
development is to be supplied by a public or community water system, the
subdivider or developer shall submit a written certification, commitment or
evidence that the municipal water company or authority or the association of
lot owners or private company, as applicable, has adequate water capacity and
has agreed to provide water service.
In those cases where a public or community water system is not available or
practical, a well shall be provided for each lot. Wells shall be placed uphill
from sewage disposal systems. Wells shall not be within one hundred feet (100')
of any part of the absorption field of any on-site sewage disposal system and
they shall not be placed within fifty feet (50') of lakes, streams, ponds,
quarries, etc.
Subdivision and land development plans shall contain a plan note specifying the
source of water supply. Plans proposing the use of public or community water
shall contain a note specifying that connection to the public or community
water line, as applicable, is required. Plans proposing the use of individual
wells shall contain a note specifying that the lot(s) has not been tested for
the availability of water of adequate quality or quantity and no guarantee of
water availability is provided.
§ 5.10. STREETS
In addition to relating to topography, natural features and solar orientation,
streets shall be designed according to the function served, the use of abutting
land, and standards of width, intersection, maximum grades and curvatures. The
Planning Department shall require that all developments have adequate access.
Where major subdivision is proposed or may occur because of the patterns stared
by minor subdivision activity the Planning Department should require
reservation for, or installation of, two or more streets to insure safe and
convenient access. elimination or vacation of previously approved streets shall
be approved only when the Planning Department determines that 1) alternate
access has been provided in another, more suitable location, 2) further
development is not possible utilizing the street, and 3) any land owners who
purchased property with reliance upon the street agree in writing to its
elimination.
The developer shall design and construct streets, including pavements,
shoulders, gutters, curbs, etc., as required by municipal ordinance. Where
specific municipal regulations do not exist, the following requirements shall
apply.
A.   Classification and General Design Goals
   1.   Major Streets - function primarily for the movement of fast traffic
between points of heavy traffic generation. They are often known as arterial
streets or highways. They shall be planned for continuation of existing streets
in the system at the same of greater width in accordance with adopted municipal
standards. Major streets shall contain as few intersections as possible.
   2.   Collector Streets - function to collect traffic from local streets and
distribute it into major streets, and, as such, they will normally contain a
relatively large number of intersections with local streets and few with main
streets. A collector street system may be required wherever a residential
neighborhood near a major street is over 150 acres in area or where the local
street pattern is so designed as to converge and serve over 500 one-family
dwellings, or 100 multi-family units. Collector streets shall be planned for
continuity and to lead more or less directly to one or more focal points or
centers of traffic generation, and may become bus routes.
   3.   Local Streets - provide direct access to each lot and function to allow
traffic to circulate toward the principal directions of travel, bus routes,
schools and playgrounds; however, the design shall discourage through and high
speed traffic. The street pattern shall be indirect and yet continuous to
prevent through traffic, formed of straight, moderately winding, curved, looped
or angular streets. Tee- intersections shall predominate and cross-
intersections shall be minimized. There shall be an underlying systematic
neighborhood pattern; however, gridiron and other rigid geometrical patterns
should be avoided where possible.
   4.   Cul-de-Sac Streets - provide direct access to properties from other
streets.
   Ordinarily, cul-de-sac is a short street with only one outlet and have an
appropriate terminal for safe and convenient reversal traffic movement.
Drainage should be towards the open end. If drainage is toward the closed end
it shall be conducted away in an underground storm sewer.
B.   Minimum Street Standards.

C.   Supplementary Street Standards - In addition to the specific standards
cited in Section B, the following street standards shall apply to design and
construction of streets:
   1.   Intersection
      a.   Streets shall be designed to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles (90 degrees). No street shall intersect another at less than 74
degrees. An oblique street should be curbed approaching an intersection and
should be right angles for at least 100 feet therefrom.
      b.   No more than two (2) streets shall intersect at any one point.
      c.   Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street
shall coincide with any existing intersection on the opposite side of the
street. Where intersection cannot practically be connected, a minimum of 150
feet shall separate the centerlines of offset local streets, and 400 feet
minimum shall be provided for collector and major streets.
      d.   Street curb intersections shall be rounded with a minimum radius of
twenty (20)   feet for local streets and thirty (30) feet for collector or
major streets. The radius point shall be concentric with that for the property
line.
      e.   Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade. In hilly or
rolling topography, a leveling area shall be provided at the approach to an
intersection. The leveling area shall have a maximum grade of two percent (2%
for sixty (60) feet preceding the intersection, measured from the nearest
right-of-way line of the intersecting street.
      f.   Clear sight triangles of seventy-five (75) feet measured along the
center line from the point of intersection, shall be provided and maintained at
all intersections.
   2.   Street Names - shall not duplicate other nearby, and shall be subject
to approval of the municipality. Street signs shall be erected to identify all
streets.
   3.   Street Expansion - where a subdivision adjoins unsubdivided land
sufficient streets shall be planned to extend to the boundary lines so that all
parcels may be subdivided and a coordinated street system obtained.
   4.   Streets for Multi-Family Development - shall be planned to connect with
major or collector streets to avoid generating large volumes of traffic from
adjacent property to such street.
   5.   Reserve Strips - the creation of reserve strips shall not be permitted
adjacent to a proposed street in such a manner as to deny access from adjacent
property to such street.
   6.   Right-of-Way Widths - land for the right-of-way for the opening or
extension of any street within a subdivision shall be dedicated by the
developer. Where a property abuts a street which does not conform to the right-
of-way width required by this Ordinance or other ordinances of the
municipality, the additional width necessary to meet current standards shall be
dedicated when such land is subdivided.
   7.   Auxiliary Street Improvements - In addition to the required pavement
and shoulder widths, streets shall be designed and constructed with curbs,
street lights, gutters, culverts, catch basins, sidewalks and other
improvements required by municipal ordinance or deemed necessary for a proposed
subdivision.
D.   Unimproved Streets or Rights-of-Way - Subdivision or unimproved (unpaved)
streets or access rights-of-way is discouraged. However, in municipalities
without prohibitive regulations, one lot may access via an unimproved right-of-
way provided that the right- of-way is a minimum of 50' in width and so located
and designed that a street could be installed in the event of future
subdivision activity.
E.   Private Streets - Private streets are to be discouraged. They will be
approved only if they are designed and constructed to meet public street
standards and maintenance is guaranteed in perpetuity via a bonafide
homeowner's association (or similar organization) agreement and appropriate
financial security for repair and maintenance.
F.   Street Construction Standards - Streets and rights-of-way shall be
improved to meet township and borough standards. The requirements contained
herein are provided as design standards and shall only be used as improvement
specifications in municipalities where no municipal standards exist. It shall
be the developer's responsibility to satisfy all applicable municipal
construction requirements and design standards, or in lieu thereof, deposit a
security in compliance with § 5.14 of this Ordinance and established municipal
policies. All public and private streets shall meet the following standards:
   1.   Adequate surface and subsurface drainage shall be provided.
   2.   All topsoil shall be removed from the area to be paved.
   3.   There shall be installed a base to consist of six (6) inches of rolled
stones or, on the alternate, an eight (8) inch base of rolled shale, under the
paved surface of the cartway and a minimum of four (4) inches of compacted
shale or stone shall be installed on the shoulder of the road which shall
extend four (4) feet minimum on both sides of the cartway.
   4.   The base course shall be constructed of minimum two inches (2") ID-
2 Binder Course in accordance with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department
of Transportation Manual Form 408. The base binder being constructed with #2B
stone with the specified bituminous residues on the aggregate shall conform to
the Form 408 Specifications.
G.   State Approval of Streets and Access - to insure that street design comply
with all applicable standards, the Planning Department may submit any
preliminary and final subdivision or land development plans to the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation for review and comment.
Subdivision and land development plans which will require access to a state
highway under the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
(PADOT) shall contain a plan note specifying that a highway occupancy permit is
required from PADOT before driveway access to the state highway is permitted.
The plan note shall also specify that plan approval does not guarantee that a
PADOT permit will be issued.
§ 5.11. MONUMENTS
Sufficient monuments shall be set to ensure that reliable survey points are
available for all parts of the subdivision. At least one (1) monument shall be
placed for every two (2) lots or every two hundred (200) feet of streets,
whichever requirement is less. The monument shall consist of either a cast iron
box inside of which shall be placed a 3/ 4 inch steel pin three (3) feet in
length, with the top of the pin set to serve as the survey point, or 4" square
X 30" in length concrete containing an iron bar for strength and drill hole for
line, set level with finished grade. All lot corners and changes in direction
shall be identified by steel pins.
The top of the monument box shall be set at the finished grade upon completion
of the grading of the street.
§ 5.12. UTILITIES AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS
All subdivisions shall be designed and serviced with adequate utilities,
including electricity and telephone service. The developer shall be responsible
to cooperate with the utility companies to insure installation of the necessary
utilities. All utilities shall be underground, except where development of five
(5) lots or less are exempted by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission.
Where required, the developer shall obtain a letter from the utility company
confirming that service may be extended to the development.
When required by the municipality, the developer shall provide a street
lighting duct system, in accordance with the specifications of appropriate
public utility.
In areas where public water lines are available, fire hydrants shall be
installed by the developer. Fire hydrants shall be located no more than 1,000
feet apart and within 500 feet of any dwelling or inhibited structure. The
nearest fire protection unit may be contacted for input regarding the design
and placement of a fire hydrant network.
§ 5.13. REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
The land improvements required to be completed by the developer of a
subdivision or land development, as set forth in this Chapter, shall be
designed and installed in accordance with this Ordinance and other codes of the
municipality. The improvements shall be of such size and capacities as are
required for the development of the proposed subdivision and of extra sizes as
may be necessary to serve nearby land which is an integral part of the
neighborhood service or drainage areas.
The developer shall be required to extend the improvements to serve adjoining
unsubdivided land. If streets or utilities are not available at the boundary of
a proposed subdivisions, the Planning Department may require the developer to
construct off-site extensions of the improvements. Procedures for providing any
necessary extra-size and off-site improvements and general standards for pro-
rating costs shall be coordinated with the municipality and shall be in
accordance with the following:
A.   Extra-Size Improvements - The developer shall be required to pay for a
part of the materials or construction of streets, sewers or water lines which
are determined by the Planning Department and the municipality according to the
standards set forth in this Chapter to be in excess of the size required for
the development of the subdivision and the integral neighborhood, service, or
drainage area.
If a storm sewer in excess of 18 inches, or a sanitary sewer in excess of 8
inches or a water main in excess of 6 inches is required, but each less in size
than the sewer trunk lines or water mains which are to be constructed and
financed on a regional basis, the municipality shall construct the extra size
utility and require a deposit in advance from the developer for the cost of the
utility he is required to install and his portion of other costs which the
municipality may assess against the benefitted property owners of the service
or drainage area.
B.   Extensions to Boundaries - The developer shall be required to extend the
improvements to the boundary of the proposed subdivision to serve adjoining
unsubdivided land; however, where the Department and the municipality
determines that a connecting street is necessary for the future subdividing of
adjoining land, but the present construction of pavement and utilities therein
are not warranted, the Department and/or municipality may require the
dedication of land, the pavement intersections constructed, utilities extended
at least three (3) feet beyond the pavement, and connections provided and made
available for future extensions by other developers.
C.   Off-Site Extensions - If streets or utilities are not available at the
boundary of a proposed subdivision, the Planning Department and /or
municipality may require as a precedence to approval of a preliminary or final
plan, assurances that such improvement extensions shall be provided as follows:
   1.   If the Planning Department and   municipality find the extensions
across undeveloped areas would not be warranted as a special assessment to the
intervening properties or a municipal expense until some future time, the
developer may be required, if he wishes to proceed with the development, to
obtain necessary easements or rights-of-way and construct and pay for
extensions. Such improvements shall be available for connections by developers
of adjoining land, or
   2.   The municipality may construct and pay for the extensions and assess
the costs to the owners benefitted and require a deposit from the developer as
described in subsection (A) herein. The municipality may establish a rotary
fund to pay for such development costs and not collect the assessments on the
intervening land until it is developed.
D.   Prorating Costs - In making determinations for prorating costs for the
construction of off-site extensions or extra-size improvements, the Planning
Department and the municipality shall consider in addition to the standards set
forth in this Chapter and other regulations of the municipality the following
conditions:
   1.   The relative location and size of the proposed subdivision,
   2.   The traffic estimated to be generated by the development in relation to
present streets,
   3.   The natural drainage area for sewers and the service area for water,
   4.   The development benefits that will accrue to the subdivision,
   5.   The sequence of land-and utility developments in the vicinity, and
   6.   Any other condition it may find pertinent.
§ 5.14. COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS OR GUARANTEE THEREOF PREREQUISITE TO FINAL
PLAN APPROVAL
A.   Performance Guarantee in Lieu of Installation - No plat shall be finally
approved unless the streets shown on such plan have been improved to a mud-free
or otherwise permanently passable condition, or improved as may be required by
the subdivision and land development ordinance and any walkways, curbs,
gutters, street lights, fire hydrants, shade trees, water mains, sanitary
sewers, stone sewers, storm water management facilities and other improvements
as may be required by the subdivision and land development ordinance have been
installed in accordance with this Ordinance. In lieu of the completion of any
improvement required as a condition for the final approval of a plat, the
subdivider or developer shall deposit with the municipality or county
(depending upon type of improvement) a fiscal security in an amount sufficient
to cover the costs of any improvements or common amenities including, but not
limited to roads, storm water detention and retention basins and other related
drainage facilities, open space improvements, or buffer or screen plantings
which may be required.
B.   Type Guarantee - Without limitation as to other types of financial
security which the municipality or county may approve, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld, Federal or Commonwealth chartered lending institution
irrevocable letters of credit and restrictive or escrow accounts in such
lending institutions shall be deemed acceptable financial security for the
purposes of this Section. Such financial security shall be posted with a
bonding company or Federal or Commonwealth chartered lending institution chosen
by the party posting the financial security, provided said bonding company or
lending institution is authorized to conduct such business within the
Commonwealth. Such bond, or other security shall provide for, and secure to the
public, the completion of any improvements which may be required on or before
the date fixed in the formal action of approval or accompanying agreement for
completion of the improvements.
C.   Amount of Guarantee - The amount of financial security to be posted for
the completion of the required improvements shall be equal to one hundred and
ten percent (110%) of the cost of completion estimated as of ninety (90) days
following the date scheduled for completion by the developer. Annually the
County may adjust the amount of the financial security by comparing the actual
cost of the improvements which have been completed and the estimated cost for
the completion of the remaining improvements as of the expiration of the
ninetieth (90th) day after either the original date scheduled for completion or
a rescheduled date of completion.
Subsequent to said adjustment, the County may require the developer to post
additional security in order to assure that the financial security equals said
one hundred and ten percent (110%). Any additional security shall be posted by
the developer in accordance with this subsection.
The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an estimate of
the cost of completion of the required improvements, submitted by an applicant
or developer and prepared by a professional engineer licensed as such in this
Commonwealth and certified by such engineer to be a fair and reasonable
estimate of such cost. The County Engineer shall review and approve the cost
estimate or, for good cause, refuse to accept the estimate, in which case he
shall calculate an accurate cost estimate of the required site improvements.
If the party posting the financial security requires more than one (1) year
from the date of posting of the financial security to complete the required
improvements, the amount of financial security may be increased by an
additional ten (10) percent of each year period beyond the first anniversary
date from posting of financial security or to an amount not exceeding one
hundred and ten percent (110%) of the cost of completing the required
improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration of the preceding one
(1) year period by using the above bidding procedure. A developer who fails to
complete the improvements within the allotted time specified in the financial
guarantee shall, at least thirty (30) days in advance of the guarantee
expiration date, renew or resubmit a financial guarantee. Failure to keep a
financial guarantee in effect until the completion and approval of all
improvements shall be a violation of this Ordinance.
D.   Progressive Installation - In the case where development is projected over
a period of years, the Planning Department may authorize submission of final
plats by sections or stages of development subject to such requirements or
guarantees as to improvements in future sections or stages of development as it
finds essential for the protection of any finally approved section of the
development.
E.   Release from Guarantee - As the work of installing the required
improvements proceeds, the party posting the financial security may request the
release, from time to time, of such portions of the financial security
necessary for payment to the contractor or contractors performing the work. Any
such requests shall be made in writing to the municipal governing body, or
Planning Department where applicable, and within forty-five (45) days of
receipt of such request the applicable municipal or county engineer, shall
certify, in writing, to his employers whether or not such portion of the work
upon the improvements has been completed in accordance with the approved plat.
When the improvements are certified to be in accordance with the approved plat,
the municipality or county shall authorize release by the bonding company or
lending institution of an amount as estimated by the municipal or county
engineer fairly representing the value of the improvements completed. If the
municipality or county fails to act within said forty-five (45) day period, the
release of funds shall be deemed to have been approved as requested. The
municipality or county may, prior to final release at the time of completion
and certification by its engineer, require retention of ten percent (10%) of
the estimated cost of the aforesaid improvement.
The applicant shall assume the necessary expense incurred for the inspection of
improvements. Such inspection costs shall be based upon a schedule established
and amended from time to time as deemed necessary.
F.   Maintenance Guarantee - Where the municipality or county accepts
dedication of all or some of the required improvements following completion,
the municipality or county may require the posting of financial security to
secure structural integrity of said improvements as well as the functioning of
said improvements in accordance with the design and specifications depicted on
the final plat for a term not to exceed eighteen (18) months from the date of
acceptance of dedication. Said financial security shall be of the same type as
otherwise required in this Section with regard to installation of such
improvements. The amount of financial security shall not exceed fifteen (15)
percent of the actual cost of installation of said improvements.
G.   Remedies to Effect Completion of Improvements - In the event that any
required improvements have not been installed as provided in this Ordinance or
in accordance with the approved final plat, the municipality or county is
hereby granted the power to enforce any corporate bond, or other security by
appropriate legal and equitable remedies. If proceeds of such bond, or other
security are insufficient to pay the cost of installing or making repairs or
corrections to all the improvements covered by said security, the municipality
or county may, at its option, install part of such improvements in all or part
of the subdivision or land development and may institute appropriate legal or
equitable action to recover the moneys necessary to complete the remainder of
the improvements. All of the proceeds, whether resulting from the security or
from any legal or equitable action brought against the developer, or both,
shall be used solely for the installation of the improvements covered by such
security, and not for any other municipal or county purpose. Failure to
properly install the required improvements shall also constitute a violation of
this Ordinance, punishable as provided by §
8.06 of this Ordinance.
§ 5.15. INSURANCE
The developer agrees to indemnify and save harmless the municipality and county
against and from any and all loss, cost, damage, liability, and expense on
account of damage to property of, or injury to or death of, the parties thereto
or third person, caused by, growing out of, or in any way whatsoever
attributable to the construction of said improvements and the use of the street
delineated on the subdivision plat during construction. The developer further
agrees, but without limiting its liability to indemnify the municipality or
county, to carry liability insurance contracts with a reliable insurance
company covering the period of said construction in the sum of $200,000 to
$400,000 for injury to or death of person(s), and in the sum of $200,000 for
damage to or destruction of property, which insurance contracts shall include
the municipality and county as named insured.
§ 5.16. BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND OCCUPANCY
A building or zoning permit may be issued and building construction started
after the approval of the final plat. Occupancy shall not be permitted prior to
the completion of streets, storm water management facilities and other
improvements necessary for the reasonable use of the building, unless written
authorization is granted by the Planning Department where improvements have
been guaranteed by valid bond or other security.
Chapter 6 - PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS
§ 6.01. INTENT
It is the intent of the Lebanon County Commissioners and the Planning
Department to provide for properly designed, constructed and maintained planned
residential developments when they are provided for in local municipal
regulations. Flexible subdivision design concepts are encouraged to meet the
growing demand for a variety of housing types.
§ 6.02. APPLICATION OF REGULATIONS
Planned residential developments are permitted only within municipalities with
individual planned residential development ordinances or separate planned
residential development chapters within their zoning ordinances, as per the
following:
A.   When a municipality has an individual planned residential development
ordinance or a zoning ordinance with a chapter regulating planned residential
developments and they also have a municipal subdivision and land development
ordinance, the Planning Department role during review shall be advisory, as
identified by Act 247 and the applicable municipal ordinance. A combined
subdivision and zoning procedure may be possible to allow comprehensive review
and approval.
B.   When a municipality has an individual planned residential development
ordinance or a zoning ordinance with a chapter regulating planned residential
development but does not have a municipal subdivision and land development
ordinance, the Planning Department shall review and approve or disapprove the
plan based upon its compliance with this Ordinance and the applicable municipal
ordinances. Subdivision plan processing and approval shall be in accordance
with Chapter 3 of this Ordinance and such additional procedures, hearings or
requirements as the municipal ordinances may mandate.
C.   When a municipality does not have an individual planned residential
development ordinance or a zoning ordinance with a chapter regulating planned
residential development, sites may not be subdivided or developed utilizing the
planned residential development concept or procedures.
§ 6.03. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
Upon receipt of planned residential development plans, the Planning Department
shall begin to review the plan for compliance with all applicable ordinance
criteria and general planning concepts. Plan review and approval or disapproval
shall be subject to plan procedures described within
Chapter 3 and supplements thereto, as described within §
6.02 of this Ordinance. Compliance with all applicable municipal and county
ordinances is required.
Furthermore, the following general planning concepts shall be applied during
the review and approval process for a planned residential development and may
be utilized as criteria in the evaluation of any planned residential
development application:
A.   Land shall be efficiently used; and
B.   The design and layout shall be consistent with the character of the
surrounding neighborhood; and
C.   Permitted non-residential buildings shall be a minor portion of the
development and shall be so located and grouped as to minimize impact on
adjacent residential uses; and
D.   Ownership, maintenance and management of the development project shall be
fully identified on the plan and within separate recorded documents to assure
construction and continuation of the project; and
E.   Open space and recreation areas shall be well located and adequately serve
the diverse needs of the proposed residents; and
F.   Although a mixture of housing types and design innovation are encouraged,
plans shall not contain extensive departure from standard design patterns
unless more conventional layout is determined to be impossible or
inappropriate; and
G.   The plan shall specify that all proposed buildings, community facilities,
site improvements and development amenities are to be constructed in accordance
with the approved plan and any development schedule approved therewith.
Chapter 7 - FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT
§ 7.01. INTENT
The purpose of the regulations set forth in this Chapter is to monitor the
subdivision and development of flood plain areas in order to promote and
protect the general health, welfare, and safety of the community; to require
that each subdivision lot in flood plain areas be provided with a safe building
site with adequate access; to insure that public facilities which serve such
lots or development be designed and installed to preclude flood damage; and to
protect individuals from purchasing lands which are unsuitable for development
because of flood plain lands. The subsequent sections shall be considered
requirements supplemental to those procedures and standards specified elsewhere
in the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance, municipal zoning ordinances,
the Lebanon County Floodproofing Building Code, and any other applicable
ordinances and codes.
§ 7.02. DEFINITIONS OF TERMS UTILIZED IN THIS CHAPTER
A.   Building - A structure which has a roof supported by columns, piers, or
walls, which is intended for the shelter, housing, or enclosure of persons,
animals, or chattel or which is to house a use of a commercial or manufacturing
activity.
B.   Development - Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to buildings, mobile homes, or other structures,
mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation, or drilling operations.
C.   Flood Plain - (1) a relatively flat or low area adjoining a river, stream,

water from any source.
D.   Floodway - That portion of the one hundred (100) year flood plain
including the channel of a river of other watercourse and adjacent land areas
which are required to carry and discharge the one hundred (100) year flood
where the activities permitted elsewhere in the flood plain district will not
cumulatively increase the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot at any
given point. Detailed studies of the Regulatory Flood by the Federal Insurance
Administrator provide specific flood profiles and allow for the delineation of
floodway and flood fringe areas within the bounds of the flood plain. For those
areas where no floodway has been identified by the Flood Insurance Study, the
floodway may be identified by other available studies or sources of information
provided by a registered professional engineer.
E.   Regulatory Flood - The flood which has been selected to serve as the basis
upon which the flood plain management provisions of this and other ordinances
have been prepared; for purpose of this Ordinance, the one hundred (100) year
flood, as defined by the Federal Insurance Administrator.
F.   Regulatory Flood Elevation - The 100 year flood elevation based upon the
information contained in the Official Flood Insurance Study.
G.   Structure - A man-made object usually assembled of interdependent parts or
components which is designed to have a more or less fixed location, whether or
not permanently attached at that location.
§ 7.03. APPLICATIONS PROCEDURES AND PLAT REQUIREMENTS

otherwise in these regulations.
A.   Pre-Application Procedures
   1.   It is suggested that prospective developers consult the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Resources concerning soil suitability when on-site
sewage disposal facilities are proposed.
   2.   Prospective developers shall consult the County Conservation District
representative concerning erosion and sediment control and the probable effect
of geologic conditions on the proposed development. Concurrently, a
determination should be made as to whether or not any flood hazards either
exist or will be created as a result of the proposed subdivision or
development.
B.   Preliminary Plan Requirements
The following information shall be required as part of the Preliminary Plan
when a subdivision is in a flood plain area and shall be prepared by a
registered surveyor:
   1.   A map illustrating the location of the proposed subdivision or land
development with respect to the municipality's flood plain areas including
information on, but not limited to, Regulatory Flood Elevations, boundaries of
flood plain areas, proposed lots and sites, fill, and flood or erosion
protective facilities.
   2.   Where the subdivision or land development lies partially or completely
in the flood plain area or where the subdivision borders on the flood plain
area, the preliminary plan map shall include detailed information giving the
location and elevation of proposed roads, public utilities, and building lots.
All such maps shall also show contours at intervals of two (2) feet and
identify accurately the boundaries of the flood plain area.
C.   Final Plan Requirements

§ 7.04. DESIGN STANDARDS AND IMPROVEMENTS
The design standards and improvements specified herein shall be considered
requirements in addition to those of
Chapter 5 and otherwise listed in this Ordinance.
A.   General
   1.   Where not prohibited by this or any other laws or ordinances, land
located in flood plain areas may be platted for development with the provision
that the developer construct all buildings and structures to preclude flood
damage in accordance with this and any other laws and ordinances regulating
such development.
   2.   Building sites for residences or any other type of dwellings or
accommodations and building sites for structures or buildings other than
residential uses shall be permitted in the flood plain only when in compliance
with appropriate municipal zoning ordinances, the Lebanon County Floodproofing
Building Code, and any other applicable regulations.
   3.   If the Planning Department and/or the local municipality determine that
only a part of a proposed plat can be safely developed, they shall limit
development to that part and shall require that development proceed consistent
with this determination.
   4.   When a developer does not intend to develop the plat himself and the
Planning Department and/or the local municipality determine that additional
controls are required to insure safe development, they may require the
developer to impose appropriate deed restrictions on the land. Such deed
restrictions shall be inserted in every deed and noted on every recorded plat.
   5.   Lots which are within the flood plain shall be subject to the
following:
      a.   Any lots created or revised shall have not more than 50% of their
area within the flood plain, except that large lots may be exempted provided a
minimum 1 acre area of said lot is outside the flood plain.
      b.   Lot access to a public road shall not be restricted or prevented by
flood plain areas.
B.   Excavation and Grading
Where any excavation or grading is proposed or where any existing trees, shrubs
or other vegetative cover will be removed, the developer shall consult the
County Conservation District representative concerning plans for erosion and
sediment control and to also obtain a report on the soil characteristics of the
site so that determination can be made as to the type and degree of development
the site may accommodate. Before undertaking any excavation or grading, the
developer shall obtain a Grading and Excavation Permit if such is required by
the municipality.
C.   Drainage Facilities
Storm drainage facilities shall be designed to convey the flow of surface water
without damage to persons or property. The system shall insure drainage at all
points along streets, and provide positive drainage away from buildings and on-
site disposal sites.
Plans shall be subject to the approval of the Planning Department. The Planning
Department may also require a primarily underground system to accommodate
frequent floods and a secondary surface system to accommodate larger, less
frequent floods. Drainage plans shall be designed to prevent the discharge of
excess runoff onto adjacent properties.
D.   Streets
The finished excavation of proposed streets shall be no more than two (2) feet
below the Regulatory Flood Elevation. The Planning Department may require,
where necessary, profiles and elevations of streets to determine compliance
with this requirement. Drainage openings shall be sufficient to discharge flood
flows without unduly increasing flood heights.
E.   Sewer Facilities
All sanitary sewer systems located in flood plain areas, whether public or
private, shall be floodproofed to a point two (2) feet above the Regulatory
Flood Elevation.
   1.   The Planning Department may prohibit installation of sewage disposal
facilities requiring soil absorption systems where such systems will not
function due to high ground water, flooding, or unsuitable soil
characteristics. The Planning Department may require that the developer note on
the face of the plat and in any deed of conveyance that soil absorption fields
are prohibited in designated areas.
   2.   The Planning Department may prescribe adequate methods for waste
disposal. If a sanitary sewer system is located on or within 1000 feet of the
proposed subdivision and land development, the Planning Department and/ or the
local municipality shall require the developer to provide sewage facilities to
connect to this system where practical, and shall prescribe the procedures to
be followed by the developer in connecting to the system.
F.   Water Facilities
All water systems located in flood plain areas, whether public or private,
shall be floodproofed to a point two (2) feet above the Regulatory Flood
Elevation. If there is an existing public water supply system on or near the
subdivision, the Planning Department and the local municipality shall require
the developer to connect to this system where practical, and shall prescribe
the procedures to be followed by the developer in connecting to the system.
G.   Other Public and/or Private Utilities and Facilities
All other public and/or private utilities and facilities shall be elevated or
floodproofed to a point two (2) feet above the Regulatory Flood Elevation.
§ 7.05. PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE
No final plat shall be approved by the Planning Department and the local
municipality until the improvements required by this Ordinance are completed in
a satisfactory manner and approved by the local municipality and the Planning
Department. In lieu of such construction, approval may be granted prior to
completion providing:
A.   The developer enters into an agreement with the local municipality or
county guaranteeing that improvements will be installed in accordance with the
plans, specifications, and schedules approved by the municipality prior to plat
approval. This agreement shall also guarantee that no lot will be sold or
building constructed in any flood plain area prior to completion of all
protective works or measures planned for such lot and necessary access to
facilities; and
B.   The developer provides a fiscal surety to guarantee performance of this
agreement and completion of the improvements as planned. The surety may include
a certified check, escrow account, irrevocable letter of credit or other bond
acceptable to the municipality. The procedural requirements of §
5.14 of this Ordinance shall apply to any such bonding proposal.
§ 7.06. MUNICIPAL LIABILITY
The grant of a permit or approval of a subdivision and/or land development plan
in the identified flood plain area shall not constitute a representation
guarantee, or warranty of any kind by the municipality or by any official or
employee thereof of the practicability or safety of the proposed use, and shall
create no liability upon the municipality, its officials or employees.
Chapter 8 - ADMINISTRATION, FEES AND PENALTIES
§ 8.01. INTENT
This subdivision and land development ordinance shall be considered to set
forth the minimum requirements for the protection of the public health, safety,
comfort, property or general welfare, pursuant to the authority of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, Act Number 247, 1968 sessions, as
amended, or such statutes hereinafter in effect, and shall be construed most
favorably to the county as encouraging standards of planning and development
exceeding these basic and minimum regulations.
§ 8.02. ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
The Lebanon County Planning Department is authorized to administer the
provisions of this subdivision and land development ordinance as herein
provided, and to enforce the provisions of this Ordinance on behalf of the

For specific revenue purposes, an annual tax is hereby levied and assessed,
commencing January 1, 2008, upon the privilege of engaging in an occupation
within the Cleona Borough during the tax year. Each individual who exercises
such privilege for any length of time during any tax year shall pay the tax for

with the provisions of this Part. This tax may be used solely for the following
purposes as the same may be allocated by the Borough Council of Cleona Borough
from time to time: (A) emergency services, which shall include emergency
medical services, police services and/or fire services; (B) road construction
and/or maintenance; (C) reduction of property taxes; or (D) property tax relief
through implementation of a homestead and farmstead exclusion in accordance
with 53 Pa.C.S., Ch. 85, Subch. F (relating to homestead property exclusion).
Cleona Borough shall use no less than 25% of the funds derived from the tax for
emergency services. This tax is in addition to all other taxes of any kind or
nature heretofore levied by Cleona Borough. The tax shall be no more than $52
on each person for each calendar year, irrespective of the number of political
subdivisions within which an individual may be employed.
(Ord. 277, 12/3/2007, § 3)
§ 204. EXEMPTIONS AND REFUNDS.
1.   Exemption. Any person whose total earned income and net profits from all
sources within Cleona Borough is less than $12,000 for any calendar year in
which the local services tax is levied is exempt from the payment of the tax
for that calendar year. In addition, the following persons are exempt from
payment of the tax:
   A.   Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which the
United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or released under
honorable circumstances from active service if as a result of military service,
the person is blind, paraplegic or a double or quadruple amputees or has a
service-connected disability declared by the United States Veterans’
Administration or its successor to be a total 100% disability.
   B.   Any person who serves as a member of a reserve component of the armed
forces and is called to active duty at any time during the taxable year. For
the purposes of this paragraph, “reserve component of the armed forces” shall
mean the United States Army Reserve, United States Navy Reserve, United States
Marine Corps Reserve, United States Coast Guard Reserve, United States Air
Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the Pennsylvania Air
National Guard.
2.   Procedure to Claim Exemption.
   A.   A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax may
annually file an exemption certificate with Cleona Borough and with the
person’s employer affirming that the person reasonably expects to receive
earned income and net profits from all sources within Cleona Borough of less
than $12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is filed.
In the event Cleona Borough utilizes a tax collection officer, it shall provide
a copy of the exemption certificate to that officer. The exemption certificate
shall have attached to it a copy of all the employee’s last pay stubs or W-
2 forms from employment within Cleona Borough for the year prior to the fiscal
year for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the local
services tax. Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise
instructed by the collector of the local services tax for Cleona Borough or
except as required by paragraph (B), the employer shall not withhold the tax
from the person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar year
for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall ensure that the
exemption certificate forms are readily available to employees at all times and
shall furnish each new employee with a form at the time of hiring. The
exemption certificate form shall be the uniform form provided by Cleona
Borough.
   B.   With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar
year from the local services tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by Cleona Borough that the person has received earned income and net
profits from all sources within Cleona Borough equal to or in excess of $12,000
in that calendar year or that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax
exemption for that calendar year, or upon an employer’s payment to the person
of earned income within Cleona Borough in an amount equal to or in excess of
$12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold the local services
tax from the person under paragraph (C).
   C.   If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year from the
local services tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
paragraph (B), the employer shall withhold the tax for the remainder of that
calendar year. The employer shall withhold from the person, for the first
payroll period after receipt of the notification under paragraph (B), a lump
sum equal to the amount of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the
exemption claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld per
payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that calendar year shall be
the same amount withheld, for other employees. In the event the employment of a
person subject to withholding of the local services tax under this paragraph is
subsequently severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any
outstanding balance of tax due, and Cleona Borough may pursue collection under
this Part.
   D.   Except as provided in paragraph (B), it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating exemption
certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or exempting any employee
from the local services tax.
   E.   Employers shall be responsible for retaining a copy of all exemption
certificates filed by employees within a given calendar year for a minimum of 3
years.
   F.   Employers who have failed to withhold the local services tax from an
employee or employees, and do not have copies of the employee exemption
certificate or certificates, will be held responsible for the payment of the
local services tax as if the tax had been originally levied against the
employer.
3.   Refunds. The Borough of Cleona in consultation with the collector and
DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims for any
tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which procedures shall be
in accord with provisions of the general municipal law relating to refunds of
overpayments and interest on overpay ments. Refunds made within 75 days of a
refund request or 75 days after the last day the employer is required to remit
the tax for the last quarter of the calendar year, whichever is later, shall
not be subject to interest. No refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a
calendar year that do not exceed $1. The Borough of Cleona or the collector
shall determine eligibility for exemption and provide refunds to exempt
persons.
(Ord. 277, 12/3/2007, § 4)
§ 205. DUTY OF EMPLOYER TO COLLECT TAX.
1.   Each employer within Cleona Borough, as well as those employers situated
outside Cleona Borough but who engage in business within Cleona Borough, is
hereby charged with the duty of collecting the tax from each of the employees
engaged by the employer or performing work for the employer within Cleona
Borough and making a return and payment thereof to the collector. Further, each
employer is hereby authorized to deduct this tax for each employee who is
employed by the employer, whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or
commission and whether or not all such services are performed within Cleona
Borough.
2.   Each person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro
rata share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person for a
payroll period shall be determined by dividing the “combined rate” of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods established by
the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of determining the pro rata
share, an employer shall round down the amount of the tax collected each
payroll period to the nearest one-hundredth of a dollar. Collection of the tax
for an employee shall be made on a payroll period basis for each payroll period
in which the person is engaging in an occupation, beginning with the first
payroll period in which the person is engaging in the occupation, except as
provided in subsection (4) of this Section. For purposes of this subsection,
“combined rate” shall mean the aggregate annual rate of the tax levied by the
school district and the municipality.
3.   No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
4.   In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement from a
principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the length of the
payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a statement from the
employee that the pay statement is from the employee’s principal employer and
the employee will notify other employers of a change in principal place of
employment within 2 weeks of its occurrence. The employee’s statement shall be
provided on the form approved by DCED.
5.   The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar year,
irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a person may
be employed. The political subdivision shall provide a taxpayer with a receipt
of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
6.   No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the local
services tax or for the payment of the withheld tax money to Cleona Borough if
the failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employee’s place or places of employment, the employee’s
principal office or where the employee is principally employed. Further, an
employer shall not be liable for payment of the local services tax in an amount
exceeding the amount withheld by the employer if the employee complies with the
provisions of subsection (2) of §
204 of this Part and this Section and remits the amount so withheld in
accordance with this Part.
7.   Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
(Ord. 277, 12/3/2007, § 5)
§ 206. RETURNS.
1.   Employers and self-employed individuals are required to make and file a
local services tax quarterly return 30 days after the end of each quarter of a
calendar year. The local services tax quarterly return shall list the name,
address, Social Security number of the employee; the physical address of the
employee’s place of employment; the number of payroll periods for which the
local services tax was withheld and the amount of local services tax being
remitted for each employee.
2.   If an employer fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not
the employer makes collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions
paid by him or her to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this Part,
the employer shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though
the tax had been originally levied against the employer.
(Ord. 277, 12/3/2007, § 6)
§ 207. DATES FOR DETERMINING TAX LIABILITY AND PAYMENT.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted and paid
over to the collector on or before the thirtieth day following the end of each
calendar quarter of each such tax year.
(Ord. 277, 12/3/2007, § 7)
§ 208. SELF-EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS AND EMPLOYERS.
All self-employed individuals and individuals whose employer is not required to
withhold the local services tax (certain State and Federal agencies) who
perform services of any type or kind or engages in any occupation or profession
with a primary place of employment within the political subdivision shall be
required to comply with this Part and pay the pro rata portion of the tax due
to the collector on or before the thirtieth day following the end of each
quarter.
(Ord. 277, 12/3/2007, § 8)
§ 209. INDIVIDUALS ENGAGED IN MORE THAN ONE OCCUPATION OR EMPLOYED IN MORE THAN
ONE POLITICAL SUBDIVISION.
1.   The situs of the local services tax shall be the place of employment on
the first day the person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period.
In the event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person working in
more than one political subdivision during a payroll period, the priority of
claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the following order when
each of the municipalities imposes a local services tax:
   A.   First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or her
principal office or is principally employed.
   B.   Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and works
if the tax is levied by that political subdivision.
   C.   Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person’s home.
2.   In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that
calendar year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions. The
final determination of priority payment shall be made under the provisions of
this Part and the provisions of the law.
3.   In the event that a person is engaged in an occupation which requires the
person working in more than one political subdivision during the payroll
period, in a case where only one of the political subdivisions imposes the
Local services tax, the priority of the claim to collect the tax shall be in
the following order:
   A.   If the political subdivisions have entered into an agreement that
provides for payment to a specific political subdivision, that political
subdivision shall receive payment of the tax.
   B.   If only one of the political subdivisions impose the local services
tax, the payment shall be made to that municipality.
(Ord. 277, 12/3/2007, § 9)
§ 210. NONRESIDENTS SUBJECT TO TAX.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places of
business outside of Cleona Borough but who perform services of any type or kind
or engage in any occupation or profession within Cleona Borough do, by virtue
thereof, agree to be bound by and subject themselves to the provisions,
penalties and regulations promulgated under this Part with the same force and
effect as though they were residents of Cleona Borough. Further, any individual
engaged in an occupation within Cleona Borough and an employee of a
nonresidential employer may, for the purpose of this Part, be considered a
self-employed person, and in the event his or her local services tax is not
paid, Cleona Borough shall have the option of proceeding against either the
employer or employee for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 277, 12/3/2007, § 10)
§ 211. ADMINISTRATION OF TAX.
1.   Any subsequent collector shall be appointed by resolution of the Borough
Council of Cleona Borough. It shall be the duty of the collector to accept and
receive payments of this tax and keep a record thereof showing the amount
received by the collector from each employer or self- employed person, together
with the date the tax was received. It shall be the duty of the collector to
accept and keep a record of the information submitted by employers relating to
the number of employees exempt from the tax, the employee exemption
certificates and refunds of the tax paid to individuals and employers.
2.   The collector is hereby charged with the administration and enforcement of
this Part and is hereby charged and empowered, subject to municipal approval,
to prescribe, adopt and promulgate rules and regulations relating to any matter
pertaining to the administration and enforcement of this Part, including
provisions for the examination of payroll records of any employer subject to
this Part, the examination and correction of any return made in compliance with
this Part and any payment alleged or found to be incorrect or as to which
overpayment is claimed or found to have occurred. Any person aggrieved by any
decision of the collector shall have the right to appeal consistent with the
Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights under Act 50 of 1998.
3.   The collector and Cleona Borough are hereby authorized to examine the
books and payroll records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of
any return made by an employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax
due. Each employer is hereby directed and required to give the collector and
Cleona Borough the means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.
(Ord. 277, 12/3/2007, § 11)
§ 212. SUITS FOR COLLECTION.
1.   In the event that any tax under this Part remains due or unpaid 30 days
after the due dates as provided herein, the collector or Cleona Borough may sue
for the recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this Part, together with
interest and penalty.
2.   If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6%
on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning with the due date of
the tax and a penalty of 10% shall be added to the flat rate of such tax for
nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery of this tax or other
appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable therefor shall, in
addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of collection, including but
not limited to administrative expenses and attorneys fees.
(Ord. 277, 12/3/2007, § 12)
§ 213. VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
Whoever makes any false or untrue statement on any return required by this
Part, or whoever refuses inspection of the books, records or accounts in his or
her custody and control setting forth the number of employees subject to this
tax who are in his or her employment, or whoever fails or refuses to file any
return or to pay the tax required by this Part shall be guilty of a violation
and, upon conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not less than
$100 nor more than $600 and costs of prosecution, and, in default of payment of
such fine and costs, to imprisonment for not more than 30 days. The action to
enforce the penalty herein prescribed may be instituted against any person in
charge of the business of any employer who shall have failed or who refuses to
file a return required by this Part. Each day or portion thereof that such
violation continues, or is permitted to continue, shall constitute a separate
offense. Each Section of this Part that is violated shall constitute a separate
offense. Cleona Borough may file a suit in equity in the Court of Common Pleas
of Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, to require compliance with this Part.
(Ord. 277, 12/3/2007, § 13)
§ 214. INTERPRETATION.
1.   Nothing contained in this Part shall be construed to empower Cleona
Borough to levy and collect the tax hereby imposed on any occupation not within
the taxing power of Cleona Borough under the Constitution of the United States
and the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

the Local Tax Enabling Act, Act of December 31, 1965, P.L. 1257, 53 P.S. § 6901

authority of that Act shall during the time such duplication of the tax exists,
except as hereinafter otherwise provided, be one-half of the rate and such one-
half rate shall become effective without any action the part of the Borough
Council of the Borough of Cleona; provided, however, that the Borough Council
of the Borough of Cleona and any other political subdivision which imposes such

respective rates to one-half of the rate herein provided, they will impose
respectively different rates, the total of which shall not exceed the maximum
rate permitted under the Local Tax Enabling Act.

§ 306. EXCLUDED TRANSACTIONS.
The tax imposed in §
304 shall not be imposed upon:

from taxing under the Constitution or statutes of the United States.

however, if any of the parties take shares greater in value than their

previously husband and wife who have since been divorced, provided the property
or interest therein subject to such transfer was acquired by the husband and
wife or husband or wife prior to the granting of the final decree in divorce,
between parent and child or the spouse of such child, between brother and
sister or spouse of a brother or sister, and between a grandparent and

by testate or intestate succession from a personal representative of a decedent
to the decedent’s devisee or heir.

property is the property of the grantee in his individual capacity if the
grantee claims an exemption from taxation under this paragraph.

corporation or statutory division of a nonprofit corporation, except where the
Department reasonably determines that the primary intent for such merger,
consolidation or division is avoidance of the tax imposed by this Part.

§ 409. PURPOSE/AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT/REPEAL.
The primary purpose of this Enactment is to conform the earned income and net
profits tax currently imposed to the Local Tax Enabling Act, as amended and
restated by Act 32 of 2008, and to do so within the time frame required by Act
32. Any prior enactment imposing a tax on earned income or net profits of
individuals is amended and restated in its entirety to read as stated in this
Enactment. Any other prior enactment or part of any prior enactment conflicting
with the provisions of this Enactment is rescinded insofar as the conflict
exists. To the extent the same as any enactment in force immediately prior to
adoption of this Enactment, the provisions of this Enactment are intended as a
continuation of such prior enactment and not as a new enactment. If this
Enactment is declared invalid, any prior enactment levying a similar tax shall
remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by adoption of this
Enactment. If any part of this Enactment is declared invalid, the similar part
of any prior enactment levying a similar tax shall remain in effect and shall
not be affected by adoption of this Enactment. The provisions of this shall not
affect any act done or liability incurred, nor shall such provisions affect any
suit or prosecution pending or to be initiated to enforce any right or penalty
or to punish offense under the authority of any enactment in force prior its
adoption of this Enactment. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this
Section, this Enactment shall amend and restate on the effective date any
enactment levying a tax on earned income or net profits in force immediately
prior to the effective date.
(Ord. 296, 11/7/2011, § 9)
§ 410. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Part shall take effect and be in force on January 1, 2012.

PART 5
TAXPAYERS' BILL OF RIGHTS
§ 501. ADOPTION OF THE TAXPAYERS' BILL OF RIGHTS NOTICE.
1.   The Borough Council is appointed as the Local Tax Appeals Board to receive
and make determinations on petitions from taxpayers relating to assessment,
determination or refund of taxes covered by disclosure statement. The Borough
Council's regular duties include functioning as the Local Tax Appeals Board and
will receive no compensation for performing such duties.
2.   The Borough Secretary or someone designated by the Borough Secretary is
appointed as the Borough representative to receive and resolve taxpayer
complaints.
3.   The Borough Secretary shall take all steps necessary or appropriate to
ensure Borough compliance with the requirements of the Local Taxpayers' Bill of
Rights.
(Res. 040599, 4/5/1999)
§ 502. TAXPAYERS' BILL OF RIGHTS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT.
Every taxpayer is obligated to pay all taxes levied by the Borough to which the
taxpayer is subject. When taxes are not paid or the Borough has questions about
whether a taxpayer has fulfilled all tax obligations, the Borough has legal
rights to enforce taxpayer obligations. In conjunction with taxpayer
obligations and Borough rights, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has enacted a
Local Taxpayers' Bill of Rights which grants legal rights to taxpayers and
creates obligations for boroughs so that equity and fairness control how
boroughs collect taxes. This document is the Borough Disclosure Statement
required by the Bill of Rights. This document is merely a summary of your
rights. For a complete statement of your rights and the obligations of the
Borough, see 53 P.S. §§8421-8438.
(Res. 040599, 4/5/1999)
§ 503. ELIGIBLE TAXES/APPLICABILITY.
Eligible taxes include any tax levied by the Borough other than the real estate
tax. The specific eligible taxes levied by the Borough are: (A) the $5 per
capita tax; (B) the earned income tax of 1% which is shared equally with school
districts; (C) the real estate transfer tax of 1% which is shared equally with
school districts; and (D) the $10 occupational privilege tax. This Disclosure
Statement applies to the per capita tax and the real estate transfer tax. The
earned income tax is collected and administered by the Earned Income Tax Bureau
of Lebanon County. A separate disclosure statement relating to the earned
income tax is available from that office.
This Disclosure Statement does not apply to the earned income tax. Unless
expressly provided in the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights, the failure of any
Borough representative to comply with any provision of this Disclosure
Statement, related regulations or the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights will not
excuse the taxpayer from paying the taxes owned.
(Res. 040599, 4/5/1999)
§ 504. TAXPAYER RIGHTS AND BOROUGH OBLIGATIONS WHEN THE BOROUGH REQUESTS
INFORMATION OR AUDITS TAXPAYER RECORDS.
1.   Minimum Time Periods for Taxpayer Response.
   A.   The taxpayer has 30 calendar days from the mailing date to respond to
Borough requests for tax information.
   B. Upon written request, the Borough will grant reasonable time extensions
for good cause.
   C.   The Borough will notify the taxpayer of the procedures to obtain an
extension in its initial request for tax information.
2.   Requests for Prior Year Returns.
   A.   An initial Borough request may cover only taxes required to be paid or
tax returns required to be filed no more than 3 years prior to the mailing date
of the request.
   B.   The Borough may take a subsequent request after the initial request,
the Borough determines that the taxpayer failed to file a tax return, or failed
to pay a tax for one or more of the tax periods covered by the initial request.
   C.   If the Borough has sufficient information to indicate that the taxpayer
failed to file a required return or pay an eligible tax which was due more than
3 years prior to the date of the notice, then the rules set forth in the
preceding 2 subsections are not applicable.
3.   Use of Federal Tax Information. The Borough may require a taxpayer to
provide copies of Federal tax returns if the Borough can show that the
information is reasonably necessary for enforcement or collection of a tax and
the information is not available from the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue or
other available sources.
(Res. 040599, 4/5/1999)
§ 505. TAX OVERPAYMENT REFUNDS.
A taxpayer may file a written request with the Borough for a refund or credit.
The filing of a written request will not preclude a taxpayer from later filing
a tax appeal petition as discussed below. The request must be made within 3
years of the due date for filing the return or 1 year after payment of the tax,
whichever is later. If no return is required, the request must be made within 3
years after the payment due date or within 1 year after payment, whichever is
later. A tax return filed by the taxpayer showing a tax overpayment will be
considered a written request for a cash refund unless the return indicates
otherwise. If the taxpayer pays a tax as a result of receiving a notice of
underpayment, the taxpayer must file a written request for a refund within 1
year of the payment date. Subject to certain exceptions, the Borough will pay
interest at the rate determined pursuant to State law, from the date of
overpayment until the date of resolution.
(Res. 040599, 4/5/1999)
§ 506. TAX ASSESSMENT/UNDERPAYMENT/REQUIRED NOTICE.
The Borough must notify the taxpayer in writing of the basis for any
underpayment determined by the Borough.
(Res. 040599, 4/5/1999)

2.   Borough Decision.
   A.   The Borough will issue a decision on tax appeal petitions within 60
days after receipt of a complete and accurate petition.
   B.   If the petition was complete and accurate when filed, the Borough's
failure to render a decision within 60 days will result in the petition being
deemed
approved.
3.   Appeals to Court.
   A.   Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Borough who has a direct
interest in the decision has the right to appeal to the County Court of Common
Pleas.
   B.   Appeals to court must be filed with the court within 30 days after the

(Res. 040599, 4/5/1999)
§ 508. BOROUGH ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES.
Depending on the type of tax involved and the specific circumstances, if a
taxpayer has not paid a tax liability determined to be due or which the Borough
has reason to believe might be due, possible Borough enforcement options
include:
   A.   The Borough may inquire directly to the taxpayer.
   B.   The Borough may audit the taxpayer's records.
   C.   The Borough may contact the taxpayer and attempt to resolve the
liability through payment in full, an installment payment plan or compromise.
   D.   The Borough may employ private collection agencies to collect the tax.
   E.   The Borough may file a lien against the taxpayer, and in some cases,
against an employer or other person responsible for payment of the tax.
   F.   The Borough may attach or require an employer to make reductions in the
wages or earnings of the taxpayer.
   G.   The Borough may file suit against the taxpayer before a district
justice or in the County Court of Common Pleas.
   H.   The Borough may execute upon and attach taxpayer bank accounts, sell
taxpayer vehicles, other person property or real estate, based on a judgment or
lien obtained through legal proceedings.
   I.   The Borough may seek criminal prosecution of the taxpayer.
(Res. 040599, 4/5/1999)
§ 509. TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIALITY.
Information gained by the Borough as a result of any audit, return, report,
investigation, hearing or verification shall be confidential. However,
confidentiality will not preclude disclosure for official purposes, whether in
connection with legal proceedings or otherwise, and will not preclude
disclosure to the extent require by any applicable law.
(Res. 040599, 4/5/1999)
§ 510. TAXPAYER COMPLAINTS.
If a taxpayer has a complaint about a Borough action relating to taxes, the

1.   Filing.
   A.   As explained more fully in the disclosure statement petitions should be

taxpayer directly. Action taken by taxpayer's authorized representative shall

3.   Burden of Proof. The taxpayer has the burden of proof on all issues.
4.   Hearings.

taxpayer will be deemed to have waived any right to a hearing and to have
requested that the Borough Council decide the taxpayer's case solely based on
the petition.
   B.   Order to Schedule. If the taxpayer requests a hearing, the Borough
Council, in their discretion, will decide whether the taxpayer has a right to a
hearing and whether a hearing is required. The Borough Council will thereafter
either issue to a Borough employee an order to schedule a hearing or issue to
the taxpayer the final decision incorporating an order denying a hearing.
   C.   Notice of Hearing. If the Borough Council schedules a hearing,
reasonable notice will be given to the taxpayer, in writing, specifying the
date, time and place.
   D.   Continuances. The Borough Council may grant a reasonable request for
continuance of a scheduled hearing. The request shall be made in writing, shall

Borough Council at least 5 days prior to the scheduled hearing.

      (4)   Receive evidence.
      (5)   Require production of books, records, documents and other data
pertinent to the issues.
   H.   Evidence. Hearings need not adhere to the technical rules of evidence.
In cases involving issues of fact, oral testimony shall be under oath or
affirmation. At the discretion of the Borough Council, depositions or
affidavits may be received in lieu of oral testimony if the actual presence of
a witness is not feasible.
   I.   Decision. The Borough Council's final decision will be in writing
signed by a Borough Council member.

A, AO, A1-30, AE. A99, or AH,
   START OF CONSTRUCTION - includes substantial improvement and other proposed
new development and means the date the permit was issued, provided the actual
start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within 90 days from the date of the permit
and shall be completed within 2 years after the date of issuance of the permit
unless a time extension is granted, in writing, by the Floodplain
Administrator. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not as part of the main structure. For
a structure without a basement or poured footings, the “start of construction”
includes the first permanent framing or assembly of the structure or any part

   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE - damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT - any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial
damage” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include any project for the improvement of a structure to correct
existing violations of the State or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would constitute a
substantial improvement as defined in this Chapter, must comply with all
ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific ordinance
requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of
Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places must be obtained from
the Secretary of the Interior of the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any
exemption from the ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
   Toxic Materials - the following materials and substances, which are listed
in § 38.7 of the Department of Community and Economic Development Floodplain
Management regulations, adopted pursuant to the Pennsylvania Flood Plain

   P.   Sodium.
   Q.   Sulfur and sulfur products.
   R.   Radioactive substances, insofar as such substances are not otherwise
regulated.
   UNIFORM CONSTRUCTION CODE (UCC) - the statewide building code adopted by the
Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1999 applicable to new construction in all
municipalities whether by the municipality, a third party, or the Department of
Labor and Industry. Applicable to residential and commercial buildings. The
Code adopted the International Residential Code (IRC) and the International
Building Code (IBC), by reference, as the construction standard applicable with

(Ord. 206, 2/7/1977, Art. IX; as amended by Ord. 299, 5/7/2012, § 9.02)
§ 903. DELINEATION OF DISTRICTS.
1.   The Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) shall include all areas of this
municipality subject to inundation by flood waters of the base flood. The basis
for the delineation of the SFHA shall be the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and
the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) issued by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) (dated June 5, 2012, or the most recent
revision thereof), the above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent
revisions and amendments are hereby adopted by the municipality and declared to
be part of this Chapter.
2.   The A and AE Zones are necessary to equitably enforce floodplain
management controls in the SFHA. The A Area/District shall be those areas of
the municipality identified as an A Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS
prepared by FEMA for which no 1% annual chance flood elevations have been
provided. The actual elevation and extent of the district is to be determined
by the base flood elevation. In order to determine the base flood elevation,
the following variety of sources of data shall be used:
   A.   All digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study.
   B.   Alluvial soil maps prepared by the U. S. Soil Conservation Service.
   C.   Local data from the 1972 flood.
   D.   Army Corps of Engineers–Floodplain Information Reports.
   E.   U.S. Geological Survey–Flood Prone Quadrangles.
   F.   Other available studies and sources of floodplain information.
3.   For these areas, elevation and floodway information from Federal, State or
other acceptable sources shall be used when available. In lieu of the
previously mentioned, the municipality shall require the applicant to determine
the base flood elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analysis shall be undertaken only by professional
engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications who shall certify that the
technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
Studies, analysis, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the municipality or a qualified agent
thereof. The actual elevation and extent of the district shall be determined by
the base flood elevation.
4.   Floodway areas in the AE Zones, where flood heights and velocities are
greatest, must have more restrictive provisions to prevent encroaching
development from elevating flood levels or creating more danger to life or
destruction of property. It has been delineated for purposes of this Chapter
using criteria that a certain area within the floodplain must be capable of
carrying the water of the base flood without increasing the water surface
elevation of that flood more than 1 foot at any point. The areas included in
this district are specifically defined in the Flood Insurance Study and shown
on the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM). In the AE Zones outside
of the floodway, where base flood elevations have been determined, and the
dangers of flooding are generally of a lesser degree, more types of development
may occur, but with necessary restrictions. In a detailed study area, the AE
Zone outside of the floodway shall be that area of the 100-year floodplain not
included in the Floodway District. The basis for the outermost boundary of the
AE Zone shall be the base flood elevations contained in the flood profiles of
the previously referenced Flood Insurance Study and as shown on the
accompanying maps.
5.   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments shall
provide base flood delineations; however, subdivision proposals and other
proposed new develop ment greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is the
lesser, shall include actual base flood elevation data. It shall be the
responsibility of the developer to provide the required base flood elevation
data, in a form comparable to HEC-2, which shall be certified as accurate by a
registered professional engineer.
6.   Initial interpretations of the boundaries of the SFHA shall be made by the
Floodplain Administrator. Where interpretation is needed concerning the exact
location of any boundary of the SFHA, the Zoning Hearing Board shall make the
necessary determina tion after hearing all evidence presented by the person or
persons contesting the location of district boundaries. The burden of proof
shall be the responsibility of the appellant, and he shall provide any and all
technical information to support his case.
7.   The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the municipal
governing body where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or
person documents the need for such revision, However, prior to any such change,
approval must be obtained from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but
not later than 6 months after the date such information becomes available, a
community shall notify FEMA of the changes by submitting technical or
scientific data.

§ 1305. SEPARATE OR COMBINED USE OF FACILITIES.
A building containing one use shall provide the off-street parking spaces as
required for the specific use. A building or group of buildings containing two
or more uses, operating normally during the same hours, and which have
different off-street parking requirements, shall provide spaces for not less

(Ord. 206, 2/7/1977, § 12.05)
§ 1306. PARKING AND GARAGE FACILITIES FOR RESIDENCES.
Accessory parking facilities shall be located on the same lot as the dwelling

(Ord. 206, 2/7/1977, § 12.06)
§ 1307. ACCESS DRIVE TO PARKING AREAS.
1.   The location and width of entrance and exit driveways to parking
facilities shall be planned to interfere as little as possible with the use of
nearby property and with pedestrian and vehicular traffic on the nearest
streets. The centerline of the access driveways on frontage street shall be at
least 80 feet from the right-of-way line of the nearest intersecting street.
Where there is more than one driveway to a parking area, the driveways,
whenever possible, shall be limited to one-way travel either as an entrance to
or exit from the parking area. In no case shall there be more than two
driveways for each 100 feet of frontage on any street. In addition, no two such
driveways shall be closer to each other than 12 feet, and no driveway shall be
closer to a side property line than 3 feet, and no flare shall cross an
extended side property line. Entrance and exits shall be limited to three
lanes. The width of such entrances and exits, measured at the street property
line, shall conform with the following schedule: [Ord. 283]
 
Width (Feet)
            Minimum Maximum
One lane    12      14
Two lanes   20      28
Three lanes 30      40
 
2.   In all cases, the radius of the edge of the driveway apron shall be at
least 15 feet so that a car entering or leaving may not obstruct vehicles in
other traffic lanes in the driveway or street.
3.   For nondwelling uses and apartment houses where there is an existing curb
and gutter or sidewalk on the street or private road, a safety island along the
entire frontage of the property shall be provided, except for the permitted
driveways. On the two ends and street or private road side of each such island
shall be constructed a concrete curb, the height, location and structural
specifications of which shall be provided by the Borough Engineer.
(Ord. 206, 2/7/1977, § 12.07; as amended by Ord. 283, 10/6/2008,§ 1)
§ 1308. IMPROVEMENTS TO PARKING AND LOADING AREAS.
All parking areas, loading areas and access driveways, except for one and two-
family dwellings, shall have an asphalt, concrete or other similar hard
surface, approved by the Borough Council. Surface water shall not be permitted
to discharge over the public sidewalks or roadways or onto other premises. The
maximum grade of the parking area shall not exceed 2%. Appropriate bumper
guards or curbs shall be provided in order to define parking spaces or limits
of paved areas and to prevent vehicles from projecting into required yards. The
Borough Council may require landscape features or a fence between a parking or
loading area and a side or rear lot line of a residential use or district. All
curbs and bumper guards shall be constructed in accordance with standards
established by the Borough Council.
(Ord. 206, 2/7/1977, § 12.08)
§ 1309. ILLUMINATION OF PARKING AND LOADING AREAS.
Parking and loading areas shall be illuminated whenever necessary to protect
the public safety. Such illumination shall be so designed and located that the
light sources are shielded from adjoining residences and residential streets,
and shall not be of excessive brightness or cause glare hazardous to
pedestrians or drivers.
(Ord. 206, 2/7/1977, § 12.09)
§ 1310. APPROVAL OF PARKING AND LOADING PLANS.
Detailed drawings of off-street parking and loading areas (except for one and
two-family dwellings) shall be submitted to the Zoning Officer for approval
prior to their construction. The drawings shall show each space, dimensions of
driveways, aisles and other features required under the provisions of this
Part. In instances when the drawings do not show full compliance with the
requirements of this Part, the Zoning Officer shall reject the plans. The
decision of the Zoning Officer may be appealed to the Zoning Hearing Board
which may, in specific cases, when the sizes, shape or location of the parking
or loading area is such that it is impractical to meet the strict requirements
of this Part, vary the strict terms hereof in accordance with the powers
granted in this Chapter.
(Ord. 206, 2/7/1977, § 12.10)
PART 14
NONCONFORMING LOTS, NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND, NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS,
NONCONFORMING USES OF BUILDINGS AND PREMISES AND NONCONFORMING CHARACTERISTICS
OF USE
§ 1401. INTENT.
1.   Within the districts established by this Chapter, or amendment that may
later be adopted, there exist:
   A.   Lots;
   B.   Buildings;
   C.   Uses of land and buildings; and,
   D.   Characteristics of use;
which were lawful before this Chapter was passed or amended, but which would be
prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this Chapter or future
amendment. It is the intent of this Chapter to permit these nonconformities to
continue until they are removed. It is further the intent of this Chapter that
nonconformities shall not be used as grounds for adding other structures,
buildings or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
2.   Nonconforming uses are declared by this Chapter to be incompatible with
permitted uses in the district involved. A nonconforming use of a building, a
nonconforming use of land or nonconforming use of a building and land in
combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this Chapter by
attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen
from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses, of a nature which
would be prohibited generally in the district involved.
3.   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Chapter shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building
on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Chapter and upon which actual building
construction has been carried on diligently. Actual construction is hereby
defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position
and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal
of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding,
such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual
construction, provided that work shall be carried on diligently
(Ord. 206, 2/7/1977, § 13.01)
§ 1402. NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
1.   In any district, a permitted building and customary accessory buildings
may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Chapter, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other
provisions of this Chapter. Such lot must be in separate ownership. This
provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for
area or width or both, that are generally applicable in this district, provided
that yard dimensions and requirements other than those applying to area or
width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in
which such lot is located. Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only
through action of the Zoning Hearing Board.
2.   If one or more lots are on record in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds
of Lebanon County and have been duly approved by the Borough Council, they may
be developed according to the recorded plan even though said lots may not
conform with the requirements for area or width or both that are generally
applicable in the district. However, no portion of said lots or parcels shall
be used or sold in a manner which further diminishes compliance with lot width
and area requirements as established by this Chapter.
(Ord. 206, 2/7/1977, § 13.02)
§ 1403. NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND (OR LAND WITH MINOR BUILDINGS ONLY).
Where, at the time of passage of this Chapter, lawful use of land exists which
would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this Chapter, and where
such use involves no individual building with a replacement cost exceeding
$1,000, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
provided:
   A.   If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than 90 continuous days, any subsequent use of such land shall
conform to the regulations specified by this Chapter for the district in which
such land is located.
   B.   No additional building not conforming to the requirements of this
Chapter shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.
   C.   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
this Chapter.
(Ord. 206, 2/7/1977, § 13.03)
§ 1404. NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS.
Where a lawful building exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment
of this Chapter that could not be built under the terms of this Chapter by
reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on
the lot or other requirements concerning the building; such building may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
   A.   No such nonconforming building may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity, but any building or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity.
   B.   Should such nonconforming building or nonconforming portion of building
be destroyed by any means, it shall not be reconstructed in a manner which
increases its nonconformity.
   C.   Should such building be moved for any reason for any distance whatever,
it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is
located after it is moved.
   D.   A nonconforming structure which has been damaged or destroyed to any
extent including, but not limited to, fire, explosion, accident, deterioration
or calamity, may be repaired or reconstructed provided: [Ord. 247]
      (1)   The rebuilt structure is unchanged in original size or location, or
is more conforming than the original structure; and,
      (2)   Repair or reconstruction is commenced within 1 year from the date
of damage or destruction. Failure to repair or reconstruct within 1 year shall
result in the loss of nonconforming rights and any successive structure shall
conform with all applicable Chapter requirements.
[Ord. 239]
(Ord. 206, 2/7/1977, § 13.04; as amended by Ord. 239, 2/5/1990, § 2; and by
Ord. 247, 11/7/1994, Exhibit "C"(1))
§ 1405. NONCONFORMING USE OF BUILDING OR OF BUILDINGS AND PREMISES IN
COMBINATION.
If lawful use involving individual buildings with a replacement cost of $1,000
or more, or of building and premises in combination, exists at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this Chapter, the lawful use may be continued
so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   A.   No existing building devoted to a use not permitted by this Chapter in
the district in which it is located shall be enlarged or extended, except on
continuous property owned at the time of adoption of this Chapter.
   B.   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this Chapter.
   C.   Any nonconforming use of a building, or building and premises, may as a
special exception be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the
Zoning Hearing Board, either by general rule or by making findings in the
specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more
appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting
such change, the Zoning Hearing Board may require appropriate conditions and
safeguards in accord with the provisions of this Chapter.
   D.   Any building or building and land in combination, in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter
be resumed.
   E.   Where nonconforming use status applies to a building and premises in
combination, removal or destruction of the building shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land. Destruction for the purpose of this
subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than 90% of the
replacement cost at the time of destruction.
   F.   If any such nonconforming uses of buildings or of buildings and
premises in combination should cease for any reason for a period of more than 2
years, any subsequent use of the building or of the building and premises in
combination shall conform to the regulations specified by this Chapter for the
district in which the building or building and premises are located.
(Ord. 206, 2/7/1977, § 13.05)
§ 1406. REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
Nothing in this Chapter shall be deemed to prevent any repairs or maintenance
of a nonconforming building or structure.
(Ord. 206, 2/7/1977, § 13.06)
§ 1407. USE UNDER SPECIAL EXCEPTION PROVISIONS NOT NONCONFORMING USE.
Any use which is permitted as a special exception in a district under the terms
of this Chapter (other than a change through Zoning Hearing Board action from a
nonconforming use to another use not generally permitted in the district) shall
not be deemed a nonconforming use in such district, but shall without further
action be considered a conforming use.
(Ord. 206, 2/7/1977, § 13.07)
§ 1408. NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
Any sign erected, constructed or placed before the effective date of this
Chapter may remain and continue to be used and maintained notwithstanding that
it does not conform to the applicable provisions of Part 12 of this Chapter;
provided, that no such sign shall be altered or relocated unless the same
either conforms or be made more conforming with applicable provisions of Part
12 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 206, 2/7/1977, § 13.08)

his representative unless all parties are given an opportunity to be present.
   J.   The Board or the hearing officer, as the case may be, shall render a
written decision or, when no decision is called for, make written findings on

days from the date of the applicant's request for a hearing, the decision shall
be deemed to have been rendered in favor of the applicant unless the applicant
has agreed in writing or on the record to an extension of time. When a decision
has been rendered in favor of the applicant because of the failure of the Board
to meet or render a decision as hereinabove provided, the Board shall give
public notice of the said decision within 10 days from the last day it could
have met to render a decision in the same manner as provided in subsection (A)
of this Section. If the Board shall fail to provide such notice, the applicant

§ 1604. PARTIES APPELLANT BEFORE THE BOARD.
Appeals raising the substantive validity of any land use ordinance (except
those to be brought before the Borough Council, pursuant to the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Code), procedural questions or alleged defects in the process of
enactment or adoption of a land use ordinance; or from the determination of the
Zoning Officer including, but not limited to, the granting or denial of any
permit, or failure to act on the application therefor, the issuance of any
cease and desist order or the registration or refusal to register any
nonconforming use, structure or lot; from a determination by the Borough
Engineer or the Zoning Officer with reference to the administration of any
floodplain or flood hazard ordinance or such provisions within a land use
ordinance; from the determination of any officer or agency charged with the
administration of any transfer of development rights or performance density
provisions of this Chapter; from the determination of the Zoning Officer or
Borough Engineer in the administration of any land use ordinance or provision
thereof with reference to sedimentation and erosion control and stormwater
management insofar as the same relate to development not involving subdivision
and land development or planned residential development may be filed with the
Zoning Hearing Board in writing by the landowner affected, any officer or
agency of the Borough or any person aggrieved. Requests for a variance and for
special exception may be filed with the Board by any landowner or any tenant
with the permission of such landowner.
(Ord. 206, 2/7/1977, Art. 17; as amended by Ord. 261, 7/1/2002, § 1)
§ 1605. STAY OF PROCEEDINGS.
1.   Upon filing of any appeal proceeding before the Zoning Hearing Board and
during its pendency before the Board, all land development pursuant to any
challenged ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning Officer or of any agency
or body, and all official action thereunder, shall be stayed unless the Zoning
Officer or any other appropriate agency or body certifies to the Board facts
indicating that such stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, in
which case the development or official action shall not be stayed otherwise
than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Board or by the court
having jurisdiction of zoning appeals, on petition, after notice to the Zoning
Officer or other appropriate agency or body. When an application for
development, preliminary or final, has been duly approved and proceedings
designed to reverse or limit the approval are filed with the Board by persons
other than the applicant, the applicant may petition the court having
jurisdiction of zoning appeals to order such persons to post bond as a
condition to continuing the proceedings before the Board.
2.   After the petition is presented, the court shall hold a hearing to
determine if the filing of the appeal is frivolous. At the hearing, evidence
may be presented on the merits of the case. It shall be the burden of the
applicant for a bond to prove the appeal is frivolous. After consideration of
all evidence presented, if the court determines that the appeal is frivolous,
it shall grant the petition for a bond. The right to petition the court to
order the appellants to post bond may be waived by the appellee, but such
waiver may be revoked by him if an appeal is taken from a final decision of the
court.
3.   The question whether or not such petition should be granted and the amount
of the bond shall be within the sound discretion of the court. An order denying
a petition for bond shall be interlocutory. An order directing the responding
party to post a bond shall be interlocutory.
4.   If an appeal is taken by a respondent to the petition for a bond from an
order of the court dismissing a zoning appeal for refusal to post a bond and
the appellate court sustains the order of the court below to post a bond, the
respondent to the petition for a bond, upon motion of the petitioner and after
hearing in the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals, shall be liable for
all reasonable costs, expenses and attorney fees incurred by the petitioner.
(Ord. 206, 2/7/1977, § 15.03; as amended by Ord. 261, 7/1/2002, § 1)
§ 1606. TIME LIMITATIONS.
1.   No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Zoning Hearing
Board later than 30 days after an application for development, preliminary or
final, has been approved by the Borough if such proceeding is designed to
secure reversal or to limit the approval in any manner unless such person
alleges and proves that he had no notice, knowledge or reason to believe that
such approval had been given. If such person has succeeded to his interest
after such approval, he shall be bound by the knowledge of his predecessor in
interest. The failure of anyone other than the landowner to appeal from an
adverse decision on a tentative plan or from an adverse decision by the Zoning
Officer on a challenge to the validity of this Chapter or an amendment hereto
or map or an amendment thereto shall preclude an appeal from a final approval
except in the case where the final submission substantially deviates from the
approved tentative approval.
2.   All appeals from determinations adverse to the landowner shall be filed by
the landowner within 30 days after notice of the determination is issued.

ZONING HEARING BOARD; VARIANCES; SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS; CONDITIONAL USES
§ 1701. SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS.
Where the Borough Council, in this Chapter, has stated special exceptions to be
granted or denied by the Zoning Hearing Board pursuant to express standards and
criteria, the Board shall hear and decide requests for such special exceptions
in accordance with such standards and criteria. In granting a special
exception, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards, in
addition to those expressed in this Chapter, as it may deem necessary to
implement the purposes of this Chapter and the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq. A special exception shall not be granted
by the Zoning Hearing Board unless and until:
   A.   A written application for a special exception is submitted indicating
the Section of this Chapter under which the special exception is sought and
stating the grounds on which it is requested.
   B.   Notice of the hearing shall be given in accordance with the regulations
of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
   C.   The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in person or by
agent or attorney.
   D.   The Zoning Hearing Board shall make a finding that it is empowered
under the Section of this Chapter described in the application to grant the
special exception, and that the granting of the special exception will not
adversely affect the public interest.
   E.   Before any special exception shall be issued, the Board shall make
written findings certifying compliance with the specific rules governing
individual special exceptions and that satisfactory provision and arrangement
has been made concerning the following, where applicable:
      (1)   Ingress and egress to property and proposed structures thereon with
particular reference to automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience,
traffic flow and control and the access in case of fire or catastrophe.
      (2)   Off-street parking and loading areas where required, with
particular attention to the items in subsection (1), above, and the economic,
noise, glare or odor effects of the special exception on adjoining properties
generally in the district.
      (3)   Refuse and service areas, with particular reference to the items in
subsection (1) and (2), above.
      (4)   Utilities, with reference to locations, availability, and
compatibility
      (5)   Screening and buffering with reference to type, dimensions and
character.
      (6)   Signs, if any, and proposed exterior lighting with reference to
glare, traffic safety, economic effect and compatibility and harmony with
properties in the district.
      (7)   Required yards and other open space.
      (8)   General compatibility with adjacent properties and other properties
in the district.
(Ord. 206, 2/7/1977, § 16.02; as amended by Ord. 261, 7/1/2002, § 1)
§ 1702. VARIANCES.
1.   The Zoning Hearing Board shall hear requests for variances where it is
alleged that the provisions of this Chapter inflict unnecessary hardship upon
the applicant. The Board may, by rule, prescribe the form of application and
may require preliminary application to the Zoning Officer. The Board may grant
a variance, provided that all of the following findings are made where relevant
in a given case:
   A.   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including
irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property
and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of this Chapter
in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
   B.   That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no
possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of this Chapter and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
   C.   That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the applicant.
   D.   That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
   E.   That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance
that will afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of
the regulation in issue.
2.   In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions
and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this
Chapter and the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10101 et
seq.
3.   A variance from the teems of this Chapter shall not be granted by the
Zoning Hearing Board unless and until:
   A.   A written application for a variance is submitted demonstrating:
      (1)   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar
to the land, structure or building involved and which are not applicable to
other lands, structures or buildings in the same district.
      (2)   That literal interpretation of the provisions of this Chapter would
deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the
same district under the terms of this Chapter.
      (3)   That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from
the actions of the applicant.
      (4)   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this Chapter to other lands,
structures or buildings in the same district. No nonconforming use of
neighboring lands, structures or buildings, in other districts shall be
considered grounds for the issuance of a variance.
   B.   Notice of public hearing shall be given as in §
1701(B), above.
   C.   The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in person, or by
agent, or by attorney.
   D.   The Zoning Hearing Board shall make findings that the requirements of §
1702(3)(A) have been met by the applicant for a variance.
   E.   The Zoning Hearing Board shall further make a finding that the reasons
set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance that will
make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure.
   F.   The Zoning Hearing Board shall further make a finding that the granting
of a variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this
Chapter, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise
detrimental to the public welfare.

§ 1703. BOARD HAS POWERS OF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL ON APPEALS, REVERSING
DECISION OF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL.
1.   In exercising the above mentioned powers, the Zoning Hearing Board may, so
long as such action is in conformity with the terms of this Chapter, reverse or
affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or
determination as ought to be made, and shall have the powers of the
administrative official from whom the appeal is taken.
2.   The concurring vote of two members of the Board shall be necessary to
reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the administrative
official, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is
required to pass under this Chapter, or to effect any variation in the
application of this Chapter.
3.   The granting of approval of any special exception or variance shall be
valid for the original landowner (appellant) only for a maximum of 2 years from
the date of decision. If, however, said property is transferred in ownership
prior to the 2 year limitation, the special exception or variance becomes
immediately invalid upon such transfer of ownership.

AMENDMENTS
§ 2101. ENACTMENT OF ZONING ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS.
1.   The Borough Council may from time to time amend, supplement or repeal any
of the regulations and provisions of this Chapter. The procedure for the
preparation of a proposed zoning ordinance as set forth in § 607 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10607, is hereby declared
optional.
2.   Before voting on the enactment of an amendment, the Borough Council shall
hold a public hearing thereon, pursuant to public notice. In addition, if the
proposed amendment involves a zoning map change, notice of said public hearing
shall be conspicuously posted by the Borough at points deemed sufficient by the
Borough along the perimeter of the tract to notify potentially interested
citizens. The affected tract or area shall be posted at least 1 week prior to
the date of the hearing.
3.   In the case of an amendment other than that prepared by the Planning
Agency the Borough Council shall submit each such amendment to the Planning
Agency at least 30 days prior to the hearing on such proposed amendment to
provide the Planning Agency an opportunity to submit recommendations.
4.   If, after any public hearing held upon an amendment, the proposed
amendment is changed substantially, or is revised to include land previously
not affected by it, the Borough Council shall hold another public hearing,

§ 2102. PROCEDURE FOR LANDOWNER CURATIVE AMENDMENTS.
1.   A landowner who desires to challenge on substantive grounds the validity
of this Chapter or the zoning map, or any provision thereof, which prohibits or
restricts the use or development of land in which he has an interest may submit
a curative amendment to the Borough Council with a written request that his
challenge and proposed amendment be heard and decided as provided in § 916.1 of
the Pennsylvania Municipalities Code (hereinafter "MPC"), 53 P.S. § 10916.1.
The curative amendment and challenge shall be referred to the Planning Agency
and the County planning agency as provided in § 609 and notice of the hearing
thereon, shall be given as provided in §§ 610 and 916.1 of the MPC, 53 P.S. §§

P.S. § 10908, and all references therein to the Zoning Hearing Board shall, for
purposes of this Section, be references to the Borough Council. If the Borough
does not accept a landowner's curative amendment brought in accordance with
this subsection and a court subsequently rules that the challenge has merit,
the court's decision shall not result in a declaration of invalidity for this
entire Chapter and zoning map, but only for those provisions which specifically
relate to the landowner's curative amendment and challenge.
3.   The Borough Council, if it determines that a validity challenge has merit,
may accept a landowner's curative amendment, with or without revision, or may
adopt an alternative amendment which will cure the challenged defects. The
Borough Council shall consider the curative amendments, plans and explanatory
material submitted by the landowner and shall also consider:
   A.   The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools and other public service facilities.
   B.   If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the proposal
upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of the proposal in providing
housing units of a type actually available to and affordable by classes of
persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by the challenged provisions of this
Chapter or zoning map.
   C.   The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by the
site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers, natural
resources and other natural features.
   D.   The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes, woodlands,
wetlands, floodplains, natural resources and natural features, the degree to
which these are protected or destroyed, the tolerance of the resources to
development and any adverse environmental impacts.
   E.   The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture and other
land uses which are essential to public health and welfare.
(Ord. 206, 2/7/1977; as added by Ord. 261, 7/1/2002, § 1)
§ 2103. PROCEDURE FOR BOROUGH CURATIVE AMENDMENTS.
1.   If the Borough determines that this Chapter, or any portion hereof, is
substantially invalid, it shall take the following actions:
   A.   The Borough shall declare by formal action this Chapter or portions
hereof substantially invalid and propose to prepare a curative amendment to
overcome such invalidity. Within 30 days of such declaration and proposal the
Borough Council shall:
      (1)   By resolution make specific findings setting forth the declared
invalidity of this Chapter which may include:
         (a)   References to specific uses which are either not permitted or
not permitted in sufficient quantity;
         (b)   Reference to a class of use or uses which requires revision; or,
         (c)   Reference to this entire Chapter which requires revisions.
      (2)   Begin to prepare and consider a curative amendment to this Chapter
to correct the declared invalidity.
2.   Within 180 days from the date of the declaration and proposal, the Borough
shall enact a curative amendment to validate or reaffilin the validity of this
Chapter pursuant to the provisions of § 609 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code (hereinafter "MPC"), 53 P.S. § 10609, in order to cure the
declared invalidity of this Chapter.

above, the Borough Council shall not be required to entertain or consider any
landowner's curative amendment filed under § 609.1 of the MPC, 53 P.S. §
10609.1, nor shall the Zoning Hearing Board be required to give a report
requested under §§ 909.1 or 916.1 of the MPC, 53 P.S. §§ 10909.1, 10916.1,
subsequent to the declaration and proposal based upon grounds identical or
substantially similar to those specified by the resolution required by
subsection (1)(A), above. Upon completion of the procedures set forth in
subsections (1) and (2), above, no rights to a cure pursuant to the provisions
of §§ 609.1 and 916.1 of the MPC, 53 P.S. §§ 10609.1,10916.1, shall, from the
date of the declaration and proposal, accrue to any landowner on the basis of
the substantive invalidity of this Chapter for which there has been a curative
amendment pursuant to this Section.
4.   The Borough, having utilized the procedures set forth in this Section, may
not again utilize said procedure for a period of 36 months following the date
of enactment of a curative amendment, or reaffirmation of the validity of this
Chapter; provided, however, if after the date of declaration and proposal there
is a substantially new duty imposed upon the Borough by virtue of a change in
statute or by virtue of a Pennsylvania appellate court decision, the Borough
may utilize the provisions of this Section to propose a curative amendment to
this Chapter to fulfill said duty or obligation.

In case any building, structure, landscaping or land is, or is proposed to be,
erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, converted, maintained or used in
violation of this Chapter, the Borough Council or, with the approval of the
Borough Council, an officer of the Borough, or any aggrieved owner or tenant of
real property who shows that his property or person will be substantially
affected by the alleged violation, in addition to other remedies, may institute
any appropriate action or proceeding to prevent, restrain, correct or abate
such building, structure, landscaping or land, or to prevent, in or about such
premises, any act, conduct, business or use constituting a violation. When any
such action is instituted by a landowner or tenant, notice of that action shall
be served upon the Borough at least 30 days prior to the time the action is
begun by serving a copy of the complaint on the Borough Council. No such action
may be maintained until such notice has been given.

§ 2403. ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
1.   Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated or
permitted the violation of the provisions of this Chapter shall, upon being
found liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the
Borough, pay a judgment of not more than $500 plus all court costs, including
reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Borough as a result thereof. No
judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or payable until the date of the
determination of a violation by the district justice. If the defendant neither
pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the Borough may enforce the judgment
pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation
continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless the district justice
determining that there has been a violation further determines that there was a
good faith basis for the person, partnership or corporation violating this
Chapter to have believed that there was no such violation, in which event there
shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until the fifth day
following the date of the determination of a violation by the district justice
and thereafter each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate
violation.
2.   The court of common pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of stay, upon
cause shown, tolling the per diem fine pending a final adjudication of the
violation and judgment.
3.   Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed or interpreted to
grant to any person or entity other than the Borough the right to commence any
action for enforcement pursuant to this Section.
4.   District justices shall have initial jurisdiction over proceedings brought
under this Section.
