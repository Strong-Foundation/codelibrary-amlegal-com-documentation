   The borough hereby adopts the attached amendment and restatement of the
Cressona Borough Police Pension referred to as the “Cressona Borough Police
Pension Plan” originally effective September 5, 1967, as amended and restated
effective January 1, 2008.
(Prior Code, Ch. 1, § 1-601) (Ord. 4-8, passed 12-1-2008, § 1)
Editor’s note:
   The amendment and restatement of the Cressona Borough Police Pension is on
file at the Borough Hall.
§ 35.02 REVISIONS.
   The borough hereby reserves the right from time to time to adopt
modifications of, supplements to, or amendments of its ordinance, including
this provision.
(Prior Code, Ch. 1, § 1-602) (Ord. 4-8, passed 12-1-2008, § 3)
§ 35.03 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   This subchapter shall become effective five days after the date of adoption.
(Prior Code, Ch. 1, § 1-603) (Ord. 4-8, passed 12-1-2008, § 5)
§ 35.04 AMENDMENTS TO POLICE PENSION PLAN.
   (A)   Repeal of service-connected death benefit and survivor benefit.
      (1)   Currently § 4.2(a) of the Cressona Borough Police Pension Plan
provides:
         (a)   Service-connected death benefit. If an active participant dies
while performing police services for the employer, the participant’s surviving
spouse (if any) shall receive a benefit equal to 50% of the average monthly
compensation of the active participant on the date of death.
      Payment shall be in the form of a pension (without actuarial adjustment
with respect to the age of the beneficiary) and shall commence as of the first
day of the month following the date of death. Payment to the surviving spouse
shall cease upon the death or remarriage of the surviving spouse.
      If there is no surviving spouse or if the surviving spouse dies or
remarries (thereby ceasing to be the widow or widower of the participant), then
the benefit shall be payable to any child (or children) of the participant who
is under the age of 18. In the case of multiple eligible children, the benefit
payable shall be divided equally among the children. Payment shall cease upon
the earlier of death or the attainment of age 18. Child shall include adopted
child of the participant.
      The participant’s spouse cannot waive receipt of this benefit. In the
case of an unmarried participant who has no children under the age of 18, no
death benefit shall be payable under this § 4.2, but a death benefit may be
payable under § 4.1. The death benefit payable shall not be less than the
benefit payable under § 4.1. In the event that there is no spouse or child
eligible to receive the death benefit payable under this § 4.2, the death
benefit provided under § 4.1 shall be paid as described therein. The
distribution shall comply with the Distribution Requirements of § 7.2(d)(2).
      If there is an acceptable domestic relations order in force with respect
to the participant, the alternate payee shall receive a portion of the death
benefit otherwise payable with respect to any actual surviving spouse or
eligible child to the extent provided in the order, but only if the alternate
payee has not died. However, no order shall be accepted if it provides that the
alternate payee shall be the surviving spouse creating a right to a death
benefit under this § 4.2 as the death benefit payable hereunder is only payable
with respect to a widow or widower or an eligible child.
         The above section is repealed in its entirety and is replaced with the
following provision:
         4.2 Service-Connected Death Benefit and Survivor Benefit.
         (a)   Service-connected death benefit. Effective with respect to death
occurring on or after October 9, 2009, the service-connected death benefit
shall no longer be payable under or pursuant to the terms of this plan or by
the employer.
      (2)   Authority to execute plan amendment. The authorized agent of the
borough (employer) is hereby directed to execute the attached amendment to the
Plan.
      (3)   Effective date. The amendment to the Cressona Borough Police
Pension Plan is hereby made effective as of October 9, 2009.
      (4)   Remaining plan provisions. All of the other provisions of the
Cressona Borough Police Pension Plan are hereby ratified and restated.
   (B)   2011 Heart Compliance Amendment.
      (1)   Authority to execute plan amendment. Sandra Brennan, as agent of
the employer, is authorized and directed by the Council of the Borough to
execute the attached amendment of the plan.
      (2)   Effective date. The amendment to the Cressona Borough Police
Pension Plan is hereby made effective as of November 12, 2011.
      (3)   Remaining plan provisions. All of the other provisions of the
Cressona Borough Police Pension Plan are hereby ratified and restated.
(Prior Code, Ch. 1, § 1-604) (Ord. 1-2010, passed 1-4-2010, §§ 1—4; Ord. 2-

vesting service shall be credited under this provision for purposes of
determining the amount of any death benefit payable.
SECOND: IRC Section 402(f) Notice Period
Effective for notices issued on or after January 1, 2007, Section 6.2(d)(2) is
amended to comply with the Pension Protection Act of 2006 by reflecting that a

eligible rollover distribution rights as required under IRC Section 402(f) no
less than 30 days and no more than 180 days (90 days for notices issued before
January 1, 2007) before the annuity starting date with respect to the
distribution. Effective for distributions made on or after January 1,1994, such
distribution may commence less than 30 days after the notice is given, provided
that:

shall contain the following additional paragraphs that shall read as follows:
In order to be taken into account for a limitation year, compensation must be
paid or treated as paid prior to severance from employment with the employer.
Effective for limitation years beginning on or after July 1,2007, an includable
payment shall be treated as paid prior to severance from employment if it is
paid by the later of 234 months after severance or the last day of the calendar
year that includes the severance date. For this purpose, includable payments
are those that absent the severance would have been paid and are regular
compensation for services during regular working hours or outside working hours
(such as overtime or shift differentials), commissions, bonuses, or other
similar compensation. Includable payments shall also include accrued sick,
vacation, or other leave if such payments would have been included in
compensation as defined in Section 1.3 if they were paid prior to the
employee’s severance from employment.
For limitation years beginning after December 31, 2008, compensation for a
limitation year shall include amounts paid as differential wages to a

subject to access and also contains information that is not subject to access
the borough’s response shall grant access to the information which is subject
to access and shall deny access to information which is not subject to access.
In the event that the information which is not subject to access is an integral

record, the borough shall redact from the record the information which is not
subject to access, and shall grant access to the information which is subject
to access. The borough shall not deny access to the record if the information
which is not subject to access is capable of being redacted. Information which
the borough redacts pursuant to this section shall be deemed a denial to that
information and may be treated as such by the requestor.

§ 37.22 FEES TO OBTAIN PUBLIC RECORDS OR FINANCIAL RECORDS.
   The Act requires the Commonwealth Office of Open Records to establish a fee
structure for local agencies which the borough hereby adopts as follows.
   (A)   Paper copies shall cost $0.25 per page per side.
   (B)   Certification of record shall cost $1 per document.
   (C)   Those specialized documents (for example blueprints, color copies and
nonstandard size documents) shall cost the actual cost of duplication, provided
that duplication is possible by the borough.
   (D)   Facsimile/microfiche/or other media shall cost the actual cost of
duplication that the borough must expend to duplicate the requested record.
   (E)   There shall be no fee for redaction of documents by the borough.
   (F)   In the event a record is only maintained electronically or in other
non-paper media, the duplication fees shall be limited to the lesser of the fee
for duplication on paper or the fee for duplication in the original media
unless the requestor specifically requests the record to be duplicated in the
more expensive media.
   (G)   Postage shall not exceed the actual cost of mailing.
   (H)   In the event requestor wishes to inspect rather than to receive a copy
of record and the record contains both public and non-public information, the
borough may not charge the requestor for the redaction which may be involved.
However, the borough may charge requestor for copies it must make of the
redacted material in order for the requestor to view the public record. The fee
structure outlined above shall apply. If after inspecting the records requestor
chooses to obtain the copies, no additional fee may be charged by the borough.
   (I)   Except as otherwise provided by the statute, the Act states that no
other fee may be imposed unless the borough necessarily incurs costs for
complying with requests, and such fees must be reasonable. No fee may be
imposed for the borough’s review of a record to determine whether the record is
a public record or a financial record subject to access in accordance with the
Act. No fee may be charged for searching for or retrieval of documents by the
borough. The borough may not charge staff time or salary for complying with the
right-to-know request.
   (J)   The borough may require the requestor to prepay estimated fees for
duplication when the estimate of fees exceed $100.
   (K)   The borough may waive the fee for duplication of a public or financial
record, including, but not limited to, when:
      (1)   The requestor duplicates the public record or financial record; or
      (2)   The borough deems it to be in the public interest to do so.

for the payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the
employee as to the employee’s place or places of employment, the employee’s
principal office, or where the employee is principally employed. Further, an
employer shall not be liable for payment of the local services tax in an amount

subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject themselves
to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under this subchapter
with the same force and effect as though they were residents of the political
subdivision. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation within the
political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential employer may, for the
purpose of this subchapter, be considered a self-employed person, and in the
event his or her tax is not paid, the political subdivision shall have the
option of proceeding against either the employer or employee for the collection
of this tax as hereinafter provided.

handles. Ashes containing hot embers shall not be collected until they have
been adequately quenched.
      (3)   Rubbish shall be stored in durable containers with tight-fitting
covers. Tree trimmings, hedge clippings, old newspapers and similar materials,
which cannot be conveniently placed in the aforementioned containers shall be
baled, tied or sacked in compact bundles no more than four feet in length and
placed in a location easily accessible to the collector.
      (4)   Bulky rubbish shall not be allowed to accumulate on any premises
except in containers described in division (B)(4) below.
      (5)   No person shall place refuse in any street, alley or other public
place, or upon any private property within the limits of the borough unless it
is placed in a proper refuse container for collection. Likewise, no person
shall throw or deposit refuse in any stream or any other body of water.
      (6)   Any unauthorized accumulation of refuse on any premises is hereby
declared to be a nuisance and is prohibited. Failure to remove any existing
accumulation of refuse within 30 days after the effective date of this
subchapter shall be deemed a violation of the same.
   (B)   Refuse storage. All refuse storage shall conform to the following
standards.
      (1)   General.
         (a)   All refuse receptacles shall be provided by the owner, tenant or
occupant of the premises, unless otherwise specified.
         (b)   The storage of all refuse by residents of the borough shall be
practiced so as to prevent the attraction, harborage or breeding of insects
and/or rodents and to eliminate conditions harmful to public health or which
create safety hazards, odors, unsightliness and public nuisances.
         (c)   The use of permanent type containers larger than 32 gallons
capacity, i.e., 55 gallon steel drums, will not be permitted to be used for
storage of residential, commercial or institutional solid wastes.

household and other premises shall have the following physical characteristics:
            1.   Constructed in such manner as to be easily handled for
collection with a capacity no greater than 32 gallons for combined refuse
storage;
            2.   Constructed of rust and corrosion resistant materials;
            3.   Be equipped with tight-fitting lids except those containers
used for storage of ashes;
            4.   Constructed in such manner as to be watertight, leak-proof,
weatherproof, insect-proof and rodent-proof; and

collection.
      (4)   Bulk containers. Bulk containers for commercial, industrial and
institutional refuse shall meet the general and individual container
requirements previously set forth except for size limitations. Bulk containers
shall be sized according to the type and quantity of waste production,
equipment handling capabilities and the frequency of collection.
      (5)   Open storage. Certain wastes of a nondecomposable nature lend
themselves to temporary storage in a manner other than containerization. Wastes
and bulky items such as bundled newspapers and magazines, packing cases and
materials, junk automobiles and machinery are examples of this type of waste.
         (a)   In order to minimize littering, magazines, newspapers, waste
paper, tree prunings, brush and yard trimmings, when stored outside of
containers, shall be tied securely in bundles no greater than four feet in
length and 50 pounds in weight.
         (b)   Tires and out-sized wastes such as furniture and appliances

§ 51.113 TIME AND METHOD OF PAYMENT.
   (A)   Sewer rentals or charges imposed by this §§
51.110 through
51.121 shall be payable quarterly.
      (1)   In the case of an owner of improved property whose quarterly bill
for sewer rentals or charges shall be computed in whole or in part upon the
basis of water volume usage metered in connection with the water system, the
quarterly billing date shall be the same date as shall be applicable for
billing in connection with the water system. Such bill for sewer rentals or
charges shall cover services furnished during the three months immediately
preceding the billing date.
      (2)   In the case of an owner of improved property whose quarterly bill
for sewer rentals or charges shall be computed on any basis completely
independent of water volume usage metered in connection with the water system,
the quarterly billing dates shall be the first days of January, April, July and
October, respectively, in each year, and shall cover services furnished during
the three calendar months immediately preceding the billing date.
   (B)   (1)   Sewer rentals or charges shall be due and payable five days
after mailing or delivery by or in behalf of this borough to the person
responsible for payment thereof. If sewer rentals or charges are not paid
within 30 calendar days after the same become due and payable, an additional
sum of 5% shall be added to such net bill, which net bill, plus such additional
sum, shall constitute the gross bill. Payment made or mailed and postmarked on
or before the last day of such 30-calendar day period shall constitute payment
within such period. If the end of such 30-calendar day period shall fall on a
legal holiday or on a Sunday, payment made on or mailed and postmarked on the
next succeeding business day which is not a legal holiday, shall constitute
payment within such period.
      (2)   Whenever service to any improved property shall begin after the
first day or shall terminate before the last day of any quarterly billing
period, sewer rentals or charges for such period shall be prorated equitably,
if appropriate, for that portion of the quarterly billing period during which
such improved property was served by the sewer system.
   (C)   Every owner of improved property which is connected to the sewer
system initially shall provide this borough with and thereafter shall keep this
borough advised of his or her correct address. Failure of any person to receive
quarterly bills for sewer rentals or charges shall not be considered an excuse
for nonpayment nor shall such failure result in an extension of the period of
time during which the net bill shall be payable.

§ 51.114 LIENS FOR SEWER RENTALS.
   Sewer rentals or charges imposed by this §§
51.110 through
51.121 shall be a lien on the improved property connected to and served by the
sewer system; and any such sewer rentals or charges which are not paid within
60 days after each quarterly billing date applicable to the particular improved
property shall be filed as a lien against the improved property so connected to
and served by the sewer system, which lien shall be filed in the office of the
Prothonotary of the county, and shall be collected in the manner provided by
law for the filing and collection of municipal claims.

§ 51.115 MEASURING VOLUME OF WASTES.
   (A)   Methods of measuring volume.
      (1)   Whenever the entire water supply of an improved property or, if
applicable, a billing unit or billing units located therein, constituting a
commercial, industrial or institutional establishment, other than a school,
which shall be discharging sanitary sewage and/or industrial wastes into the
sewer system, is supplied by the water system, the volume of water furnished,
as determined from meter readings of the water system, shall be used as the
measure of discharge of sanitary sewage and/or industrial wastes in computing
sewer rentals or charges, subject to adjustment, if appropriate, as provided by
§§
51.110 through
51.121.
      (2)   (a)   Whenever an improved property or, if applicable, a billing
unit or billing units located therein, constituting a commercial, industrial or
institutional establishment, other than a school, which shall be discharging
sanitary sewage and/or industrial wastes into the sewer system, shall have a
source or sources of water supply in addition to or other than the water
system, the owner of such improved property shall provide a meter or meters on
such additional or other source or sources of water supply.
         (b)   The total volume of water consumed, as determined from the meter
readings of the water system and the meter readings of the meter or meters on
such additional or other source or sources of water supply, or the meter
readings of the meter or meters on such other source or sources of water
supply, as appropriate, shall be used as the measure of discharge of sanitary
sewage and/or industrial wastes in computing the sewer rentals or charges,
subject to adjustment, if appropriate, as provided in §§
51.110 through
51.121.
      (3)   Whenever an improved property or, if applicable, a billing unit or
billing units located therein, other than a school, constituting a commercial,
industrial or institutional establishment shall use water from the water system
and/or water from a source or sources of supply in addition to or other than
the water system for cooling or unpolluted commercial or industrial process
purposes and all or part of the water so used shall not be discharged into the
sewer system, the volume used as the measure of discharge of sanitary sewage
and/or industrial wastes in computing sewer rentals or charges may be adjusted
by one of the following methods:
         (a)   By installing a meter or other measuring device on the
connection to the sewer system. The readings from such meter or measuring
device shall be used as the measure of discharge of sanitary sewage and/or
industrial wastes in computing sewer rentals or charges;
         (b)   By installing a meter or other measuring device to measure the
volume not being discharged into the sewer system. The readings from such meter
or measuring device shall be deducted from the total water meter readings and
the remainder shall be used as the measure of discharge of sanitary sewage and/
or industrial wastes in computing sewer rentals or charges; or
         (c)   If it is not practical, in the opinion of this borough, to
install a meter or other measuring device to determine continuously the volume
not discharged into the sewer system, this borough shall determine, in such
manner and by such method as it may prescribe, the percentage of metered water
which is being discharged into the sewer system. The quantity of water used as
the measure of discharge of sanitary sewage and/or industrial wastes in
computing sewer rentals or charges shall be the percentage so determined of the
quantity measured by the water meter or meters. Any dispute as to such
estimated percentage shall be submitted to this borough, after notice of such
estimate. The decision of this borough with respect to the matter shall be
final for the then current calendar year.
      (4)   Whenever an industrial or commercial establishment shall discharge
only industrial wastes into the sewer system, the volume of water used,
measured as herein provided, shall be used as a measure of the quantity of
industrial wastes so discharged.
   (B)   Measuring devices. Meters or other measuring devices which shall not
be available in connection with the water system, but which shall be required
or permitted under provisions of §§
51.110 through
51.121, shall be furnished and installed by the owner of the improved property
at his or her expense, shall be under the control of this borough and may be
tested, inspected or repaired by this borough whenever necessary. The owner of
the improved property upon which such meter or other measuring device shall be
installed shall be responsible for its maintenance and safekeeping; and all
repairs thereto shall be made at the expense of the owner, whether such repairs
shall be made necessary by ordinary wear and tear or other causes. Bills for
such repairs, if made by this borough, shall be due and payable immediately
upon completion of such repairs and shall be collected in the same manner as
quarterly bills for sewer rentals or charges.
   (C)   Meter readings. This borough, except to the extent that meter readings
are made by any other person in connection with the water system and are made
available to this borough for purposes of this subchapter, shall be responsible
for the reading of all meters or other measuring devices and the same shall be
available to this borough at all reasonable times.

§ 114.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually
oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals and general
welfare of the citizens of the borough, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually
oriented businesses within the borough. The provisions of this chapter have
neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the
content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.
Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny
access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment or to deny access to sexually oriented businesses by patrons or by
the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone
or legitimize sexually oriented businesses or the distribution of obscene
material.
   (B)   Findings. Based on the concern of adverse secondary effects of adult
uses in the community. Borough Council is of the position that:
      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are uncontrolled by the operators of the
establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of
these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their
premises;
      (2)   Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this
chapter engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior
than employees of other sexually oriented business establishments;
      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at
sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, live sex shows or
massages;
      (4)   Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which
creates unhealthy conditions;
      (5)   Persons frequent sexually oriented businesses, for amongst other
things, for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually
oriented businesses;
      (6)   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS) ,
genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and
shigella infections;
      (7)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as, syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts;
      (8)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate that activities
and maintain those facilities; and
      (9)   Restricting doors on viewing booths and requiring sufficient
lighting on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental
interest in curbing illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in
sexually oriented businesses.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth has, by the passage of the Pennsylvania
Floodplain Management Act of 1978, delegated the responsibility to local
governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations to promote public
health, safety, and the general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the
Council of the borough does hereby order as follows.
(Ord. 01-2021, passed 2-15-2021)
§ 153.002 INTENT.
   The intent of this chapter is to:
   (A)   Promote the general health, welfare and safety of the community;
   (B)   Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in
order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future;
   (C)   Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage;
   (D)   Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units, and its residents, by preventing excessive development in areas subject
to flooding; and
   (E)   Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
(Ord. 01-2021, passed 2-15-2021)
§ 153.003 APPLICABILITY.
   It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or corporation to
undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or development anywhere
within the borough unless a permit has been obtained from the Floodplain
Administrator.
(Ord. 01-2021, passed 2-15-2021) Penalty, see §
153.999
§ 153.004 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in
effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance provisions
shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those provisions are
more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of
this chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
(Ord. 01-2021, passed 2-15-2021)
§ 153.005 SEVERABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this
chapter shall be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such a decision
shall not affect the remaining portions of the chapter, which shall remain in
full force and effect, and for this purpose the provisions of this chapter are
hereby declared to be severable.
(Ord. 01-2021, passed 2-15-2021)
§ 153.006 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   (A)   The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this
chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
accepted engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights
may be increased by human-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge
openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that areas outside
any identified floodplain areas, or that land uses permitted within such areas
will be free from flooding or flood damages.
   (B)   This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the borough or
any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance
on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 01-2021, passed 2-15-2021)
§ 153.007 ENACTMENT; ADOPTION.
   This chapter shall be effective on May 18, 2021 and shall remain in force
until modified, amended or rescinded by the borough.

   (A)   Any areas of Borough of Cressona, classified as special flood hazard
areas (SFHAs) in the flood insurance study (FIS) and the accompanying flood
insurance rate maps (FIRMs) dated May 18, 2021 and issued by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof,
including all digital data developed as part of the flood insurance study; and
   (B)   The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and
amendments are hereby adopted by borough and declared to be a part of this
chapter.
(Ord. 01-2021, passed 2-15-2021)
§ 153.041 DESCRIPTION AND SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF IDENTIFIED FLOODPLAIN AREAS.
   The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific
areas.
   (A)   The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without increasing the water surface elevation by more than one foot at any
point. This term shall also include floodway areas which have been identified
in other available studies or sources of information for those special flood
hazard areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
      (1)   Within any Floodway Area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted
unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed
encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      (2)   Within any Floodway Area, no new construction or development shall
be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the Department of
Environmental Protection Regional Office.
   (B)   The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations
have been provided.
      (1)   The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for
which base flood elevations have been provided and a floodway has been
delineated.
      (2)   AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE
zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided but no floodway has been determined.
         (a)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements or other development shall be permitted in an AE Zone without
floodway, unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed development together with all other existing and anticipated
development, would not result in an increase in flood levels within the entire
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
         (b)   No new construction or development shall be located within the
area measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse, unless
the appropriate permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection Regional Office.
   (C)   (1)   The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone
on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base flood
elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and floodway
information from other federal, state or other acceptable sources shall be used
when available.
      (2)   Where other acceptable information is not available, the base flood
elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary
of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction site.
      (3)   In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional
engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the
technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
Studies, analyses, computations and the like, shall be submitted in sufficient
detail to allow a thorough technical review by the municipality. In the absence
of any of the above data or documentation, the community may require elevation
of the lowest floor to be at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade.
   (D)   The AO and AH Area/District shall be those areas identified as Zones
AO and AH on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject to inundation by
1% annual-chance shallow flooding where average depths are between one and
three feet. In Zones AO and AH, drainage paths shall be established to guide
floodwaters around and away from structures on slopes.
(Ord. 01-2021, passed 2-15-2021)
§ 153.042 CHANGES IN IDENTIFICATION OF AREA.
   The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Council
where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person documents
the need for such revision. However, prior to any such change to the special
flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from FEMA. Additionally, as soon
as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA of the changes to the special
flood hazard area by submitting technical or scientific data. See §
153.055(B) for situations where FEMA notification is required.
(Ord. 01-2021, passed 2-15-2021)
§ 153.043 BOUNDARY DISPUTES.
   Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the borough and any party aggrieved by
this decision or determination may appeal to the Council. The burden of proof
shall be on the appellant.
(Ord. 01-2021, passed 2-15-2021)
§ 153.044 JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARY CHANGES.
   Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other corporate
boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community shall review
flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary changes. The
community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in areas subject to
annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or exceed those in 44
C.F.R. part 60.3.

VARIANCES
§ 153.105 GENERAL.
   If compliance with any of the requirements of this chapter would result in
an exceptional hardship to a prospective builder, developer or landowner, the
Borough Zoning Hearing Board may, upon request, grant relief from the strict
application of the requirements.
(Ord. 01-2021, passed 2-15-2021)
§ 153.106 VARIANCE PROCEDURES AND CONDITIONS.
   (A)   Requests for variances shall be considered by the Borough Zoning
Hearing Board in accordance with the procedures contained in §
153.029 and the following.
      (1)   No variance shall be granted within any identified floodplain area
that would cause any increase in BFE. In A Area/District, BFEs are determined
using the methodology in §
153.041(C).
      (2)   No variances shall be granted for a proposed accessory structure
that exceeds 600 square feet in size. A signed non-conversion agreement is
required as a condition of receiving the variance.
      (3)   Except for a possible modification of the regulatory flood
elevation requirement involved, no variance shall be granted for any of the
other requirements pertaining specifically to development regulated by special
permit (§§
153.075 through
153.078) or to development which may endanger human life (§
153.058).
      (4)   If granted, a variance shall involve only the least modification
necessary to provide relief.
      (5)   In granting any variance, the Borough Zoning Hearing Board shall
attach whatever reasonable conditions and safeguards it considers necessary in
order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, and to achieve the
objectives of this chapter.
      (6)   Whenever a variance is granted, the Borough Zoning Hearing Board
shall notify the applicant in writing that:
         (a)   The granting of the variance may result in increased premium
rates for flood insurance; and
         (b)   Such variances may increase the risks to life and property.
      (7)   In reviewing any request for a variance, the Borough Zoning Hearing
Board shall consider, at a minimum, the following:
         (a)   There is good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant;
         (c)   The granting of the variance will:
            1.   Neither result in an unacceptable or prohibited increase in
flood heights, additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public
expense; nor
            2.   Create nuisances, cause fraud on, or victimize the public, or
conflict with any other applicable state or local ordinances and regulations.
      (8)   A complete record of all variance requests and related actions
shall be maintained by the Borough Zoning Hearing Board. In addition, a report
of all variances granted during the year shall be included in the annual report
to the FEMA.
   (B)   Notwithstanding any of the above, however, all structures shall be
designed and constructed so as to have the capability of resisting the 1%
annual chance flood.

the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% or more of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or
other improvement of a structure, of which the cost equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial
damage” or “cumulative substantial damage” regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a
structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or
safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living
conditions.
   UNIFORM CONSTRUCTION CODE (UCC). The statewide building code adopted by The
Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1999 applicable to new construction in all
municipalities whether administered by the municipality, a third party or the
Department of Labor and Industry. Applicable to residential and commercial
buildings, the Code adopted the International Residential Code (IRC) and the
International Building Code (IBC), by reference, as the construction standard
applicable with the state floodplain construction. For coordination purposes,
references to the above are made specifically to various sections of the IRC
and the IBC.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain
management regulation.

§ 153.999 PENALTY.
   Any person who fails to comply with any or all of the requirements or
provisions of this chapter or who fails or refuses to comply with any notice,
order of direction of the Floodplain Administrator or any other authorized
employee of the municipality shall be guilty of a summary offense and upon
conviction shall pay a fine to the borough of not less than $25 nor more than
$600 plus costs of prosecution. In addition to the above penalties all other
actions are hereby reserved including an action in equity for the proper
enforcement of this chapter. The imposition of a fine or penalty for any
violation of, or noncompliance with this chapter shall not excuse the violation
or noncompliance or permit it to continue. All such persons shall be required
to correct or remedy such violations and noncompliance within a reasonable
time. Any development initiated or any structure or building constructed,
reconstructed, enlarged, altered or relocated, in noncompliance with this

DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 154.065 INTRODUCTION.
   (A)   This section relates to the minimum design standards which the
Commission adopts as representing the best in land development practices as
protecting the public’s health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   Whenever developments increase these minimum standards the developer
is assured of increased benefits to himself or herself and to potential
purchasers.
   (C)   The Commission recommends increases above these minimum standards and
favors such increases whenever possible.
(Prior Code, Ch. 22, § 501) (Ord. 173, passed 10-5-1970, § 501)
§ 154.066 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Land requirements. Land shall be suited to the purpose for which it is
to be subdivided. In general, the Commission shall take the following factors
into consideration:
      (1)   Land subject to periodic flooding or other hazards to life, health
or property shall not be subdivided for residential purposes unless adequate
safeguards against such hazards are provided by the plan; and
      (2)   Areas characterized by steep slopes, rock formations or other such
features shall not be subdivided for residential purposes.
   (B)   Common facilities and master plan requirements. The Commission will
consider the adequacy of existing or proposed community facilities to serve the
uses proposed in the subdivision. Where a proposed park, playground or other
public use shown in the master plan of the borough is located in whole or in
part in a subdivision, the Commission may require the provision or reservation
of such area as may be deemed reasonable; provided, that such provision or
reservation is acceptable to the borough.
      (1)   Areas provided or reserved for such community facilities should be
adequate to provide for building sites, landscaping and off-street parking as
appropriate to the use proposed.
      (2)   The layout of the proposed subdivision shall be in general
conformity with the features or developments proposed in the master plan of the
borough.
   (C)   Lots and lot sizes. Lot dimensions, areas, yards and building setback
lines shall be not less than specified by the provisions of the zoning
regulations (
Chapter 155 of this code of ordinances), if such exists:
      (1)   All lots shall front upon a public street, existing or proposed;
      (2)   Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to
street lines;
      (3)   If remnants of land exist after subdividing, they shall be
incorporated in existing or proposed lots, or dedicated to public use, if
acceptable to the borough;
      (4)   Double frontage lots are prohibited, except where employed to
prevent vehicular access to major traffic streets; and
      (5)   Depth and width of parcels laid out or reserved for nonresidential
use shall be sufficient to provide satisfactory space for off-street parking
and unloading.
   (D)   Easements.
      (1)   Easements with a minimum width of ten feet plus the width of any
required pipe or other improvements shall be provided as necessary for
utilities.
      (2)   To the fullest extent possible, easements shall be centered on or
adjacent to rear or side lot lines.
      (3)   Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, there shall be
provided a drainage easement or right-of-way conforming substantially with the
line of such watercourse and of such width as will be adequate to preserve
natural drainage.
   (E)   Blocks.
      (1)   The length, width and shape of blocks shall be determined with due
regard to the following:
         (a)   Provision of adequate sites for buildings of the type proposed;
         (b)   Zoning requirements;
         (c)   Topography; and
         (d)   Requirements for safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian
circulation.
      (2)   In the design of blocks longer than 1,000 feet, special
consideration shall be given to the requirements of satisfactory fire
protection.
      (3)   Residential blocks shall be of sufficient depth to accommodate two
tiers of lots, except where reverse frontage lots bordering a major traffic
street are used.
      (4)   Pedestrian interior walks may be required where necessary to assist
circulation or provide access to community facilities. Such crosswalks shall
have a width of not less than ten feet and a paved walk of not less than four
feet.
      (5)   All blocks shall be designed in such a manner as to be well drained
so that no lot shall have water standing thereon after any rain. When drainage
courses traverse any block, due consideration shall be given to provide
whatever drainage facilities and easements as may be necessary to protect the
life and property of the general public.
   (F)   Street widths and geometric standards. Street widths shall be as in
the table below.

shall be made by horizontal curves, and a tangent shall be required between
reverse horizontal curves.
 
   (G)   Street system layout.
      (1)   Proposed streets shall be properly related to such street plans or
parts thereof as have been officially prepared and adopted by the borough, and
they shall further conform to such county and state road and highway plans as
have been prepared, adopted and/or filed as prescribed by law.
      (2)   The proposed street layout shall provide for the continuation or
projection of existing streets in the surrounding area unless the Commission
deems such extension undesirable for specific reasons of topography or design.
      (3)   Streets shall be logically related to the topography to produce
usable lots and reasonable grades.
      (4)   Minor streets shall be laid out to discourage through traffic, but
provision for street connections into and from adjacent areas will generally be
required.
      (5)   Proposed streets shall be extended to provide access to adjoining
property where necessary.
      (6)   Adequate street rights-of-way shall be provided as necessary where
lots in the proposal are large enough to permit resubdivision or if a portion
of the tract is not subdivided.
      (7)   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major
traffic street, the Commission may require marginal access streets, rear
service alleys, reverse frontage lots or such other treatment as will provide
protection for abutting properties, reduction in the number of intersections
with the major street, and separation of local and through traffic.
      (8)   New alleys, half or partial streets will not be permitted, except
where essential to reasonable subdivision of a tract in conformance with the
other requirements and standards contained herein and where, in addition,
satisfactory assurance for dedication of the remaining part of the street can
be secured.
      (9)   Wherever subdivision or land development abuts or contains an
existing street of inadequate right-of-way width and/or cartway width,
additional right-of-way width and/or cartway width shall be constructed/
dedicated to conform with the standards of this chapter.
      (10)   Dead-end streets shall be prohibited, except as stubs to permit
future street extension into adjoining tracts, or when designed as cul-de-sacs.
      (11)   New reserve strips, including those controlling access to streets,
shall be avoided.
      (12)   Wherever a subdivision or land development abuts or contains an
existing street of inadequate horizontal and/or vertical alignment, the borough
may require additional right-of-way width or cartway width along the existing
street frontage in order to improve public safety.
      (13)   Wherever a subdivision or land development abuts or contains an
existing street without curb and sidewalk, such improvements shall be
constructed in accordance with the standards of this chapter along the existing
street frontage of the property being subdivided/developed.
      (14)   All proposed streets shall be designed and constructed in
accordance to the standards of this chapter with respect to right-of-way width,
cartway width, horizontal and vertical curves, street grades, curbs and
sidewalks.
   (H)   Street intersections.
      (1)   Streets shall be laid out to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles. No street shall intersect another at an angle of less than 60
degrees.
      (2)   (a)   Multiple intersections involving junction of more than two
streets shall be avoided.
         (b)   Where this proves impossible, such intersections shall be
designed with extreme care for both pedestrian and vehicular safety.
      (3)   Clear sight triangles of 30 feet measured along street lot lines
from their point of junction shall be provided at all intersections, and no
building shall be permitted within such sight triangles.
      (4)   To the fullest extent possible, intersections with major traffic
streets shall be located not less than 800 feet apart, measured from centerline
to centerline.
      (5)   Streets entering opposite sides of another street shall be laid out
either directly opposite one another or with a minimum offset of 125 feet
between their centerlines.
      (6)   Minimum curb radii at street intersections shall be 15 feet for
intersections involving only minor streets, 25 feet for intersections involving
other types of streets, or such greater radius as is suited to the specific
intersection.
      (7)   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing street of
inadequate right-of-way width, additional right-of-way width in conformance
with division (F) above will be required.
      (8)   Where the grade of any street at the approach to an intersection
exceeds 7%, a leveling area shall be provided having not greater than 4% grades
for a distance of 50 feet measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the
intersecting street.
   (I)   Cul-de-sac-street.
      (1)   Cul-de-sac streets, permanently designed as such, shall not exceed
500 feet in length, and shall furnish access to not more than 20 dwelling
units.
      (2)   Cul-de-sac streets shall be provided at the closed end with a paved
turnaround having a minimum radius to the outer pavement edge or curb line of
40 feet.
      (3)   Unless future extension is clearly impractical or undesirable, a
turnaround right-of-way of the same width as the street shall be carried to the
property street into the line in such a way as to permit future extension of
the adjoining tract.

§ 154.090 FINANCIAL SECURITY.
   (A)   General requirements.
      (1)   Financial security required by this section shall be in the form of
a federal or Commonwealth chartered lending institution irrevocable letter of
credit, a restrictive or escrow account in such an institution or a financially
responsible bonding company, cash or cash equivalent, or such other type of
financial security as may be approved by the borough. The lending institution
or bonding company, as applicable, may be chosen by the party posting the
financial security, provided that the said lending institution or bonding
company is authorized to conduct business within the Commonwealth, is
acceptable to the Borough Council, is a member of FDIC and stipulates that it
will submit to state jurisdiction and the county venue in the event of legal
action.
      (2)   No single restricted escrow account shall contain an amount in
excess of $100,000.
      (3)   All agreements for guarantees required by this section shall be
executed by the applicant or developer and shall be approved by the borough
upon advisement of the Borough Solicitor.
   (B)   Improvements guarantee.
      (1)   If financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion
of improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a subdivision
or land development proposal, as provided for by §
154.035(D), the borough shall not condition the issuance of a building, grading
or other permit relating to the erection or placement of improvements,
including buildings, upon the lots or land as depicted upon the approved final
plan upon actual construction of the said improvements. Moreover, if financial
security has been provided, occupancy permits for any building or buildings to
be erected shall not be withhold following:
         (a)   The completion of the construction of new streets as described
in this chapter in all respects except for the installation of the wearing
course; and
         (b)   The completion of all other improvements as depicted upon the
approved final plan, either upon the lot or lots or beyond the lot or lots in
question if such improvements are necessary for the reasonable use of or
occupancy of the building or buildings.
      (2)   The applicant shall deposit with the borough financial security in
an amount equivalent to 110% of the estimated cost of completion of all
improvements, including engineering and inspections costs, as of 90 days
following the completion date anticipated by the applicant. All improvements,
both public and private, shall be included in the cost estimate shall be all
improvements and common amenities, both public and private including, but not
limited to, streets, walkways, shade trees, stormwater management facilities,
open space improvements, buffer or screen plantings, water mains and other
water supply facilities, fire hydrants and sanitary sewage disposal facilities.
      (3)   The cost estimate shall be submitted by the applicant, shall be
prepared by a professional engineer licensed as such by the Commonwealth, and
shall be certified by such engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate. The
borough, upon the recommendation of the Borough Engineer, may refuse to accept
such estimate for good cause shown. If the borough and the applicant are unable
to agree upon an estimate, then the estimate shall be recalculated and
recertified by another, neutral, professional engineer licensed as such by the
Commonwealth and chose mutually by the borough and the applicant. The estimate
certified by the neutral engineer shall be presumed fair and reasonable, and
shall be the final estimate. In the event that a neutral engineer is so chosen,
fees for services of said engineer shall be paid equally by the borough and the
applicant.
      (4)   When requested by the applicant, the borough shall furnish the
applicant with a signed copy of a resolution indicating approval of the final
plan contingent upon the provision of financial security by the applicant. The
final plan shall not be signed or recorded until the improvements guarantee has
been executed. The resolution and letter of contingent approval shall expire
and be deemed to be revoked if the financial security agreement is not executed
within 90 days, unless a written extension is granted by the Borough Council.
Request for such extension by the applicant shall be in writing.
      (5)   The said financial security shall provide for, and secure to the
public, the completion of all subdivision improvements for which such security
is being posted within one year of the date fixed on the subdivision plan and
improvement construction plan for completion of such improvements.
      (6)   The borough may adjust the amount of the improvements guarantee
annually by comparing the actual cost of the improvements which have been
completed and the estimated cost of the completion of the remaining
improvements as of the expiration of the ninetieth day after either the
original date scheduled for completion or a rescheduled date of completion.
Subsequent to said adjustment, the borough may require the applicant to post
additional security in order to assure that the amount of the improvements
guarantee will equal no less than 110% of the cost of the remaining
improvements at all times.
      (7)   If the party posting the improvements guarantee requires more than
one year from the date of posting the guarantee to complete the improvements,
the amount of the guarantee shall be increased by an additional 10% for each
one-year period beyond the first anniversary date from the date of the original
posting. The new amount shall not exceed 110% of the cost of completing the
remaining required improvements as established upon the expiration date of the
preceding one-year period.
      (8)   Where development is projected over a period of years, the borough
may authorized submission of final plans by section or phase of development,
subject to such requirements or guarantees for improvements within the future
sections or stages of development as Borough Council may deem essential for the
protection of any finally approved section or phase of the development.
      (9)   As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the improvements guarantee may request the Borough Council to
release or to authorize the release of such portions of the improvements
guarantee necessary for payment to the contractor(s) performing such work. Any
such requests shall be in writing, addressed to the Borough Council. Council
shall have 45 days from the receipt of such request within which to allow the
Borough Engineer to certify in writing to the borough that such portion of the
work upon the improvements has been completed in accordance with approved
plans. Upon such certification, Council shall authorize release by the bonding
company or lending institution of an amount as estimated by the Borough
Engineer fairly representing the value of the improvements completed. If
Council fails to act within the said 45-day period, Council shall be deemed to
have approved the release of funds as requested.
      (10)   The Borough Engineer, in certifying the completion of work for a
partial release, shall not be bound to the amount requested by the applicant,
but shall certify to Borough Council his or her independent evaluation of the
proper amount of partial releases.
   (C)   Release from improvements guarantee.
      (1)   (a)   When the developer has completed all improvements according
to agreement, he or she shall so notify the borough and the Borough Engineer in
writing by certified or registered mail. Upon receipt of such notice, the
Borough Council shall direct the Borough Engineer to make a final inspection of
the improvements covered by the guarantee.
         (b)   The Borough Engineer shall file a report in writing with the
Borough Council, and shall promptly mail a copy of the report to the developer
by certified mail. The report shall be made and mailed within 30 days after
receipt by the Borough Engineer of the notification from the developer. The
report shall be detailed and shall indicate his or her recommendation of
approval or rejection of improvements, whether in whole or in part. If the
Borough Engineer recommends nonapproval or rejections of the improvements, or
any portion thereof, the report shall state the reasons for such
recommendation.
      (2)   The Borough Council shall notify the developer in writing by
certified mail of the action of Council with regard to approval, nonapproval or
rejection of the improvements.
      (3)   If any portion of the improvements shall not be approved or shall
be rejected by Council, the developer shall proceed to complete those
improvements. Upon completion, the same procedure of notification and
inspection as described hereinabove shall be used.
      (4)   Ten percent of the improvements guarantee shall be held back by the
borough until the developer has posted a performance guarantee, as required by
division (D) below.
   (D)   Performance guarantee.
      (1)   The developer shall be responsible for maintenance of all
subdivision or land development improvements until such improvements are
offered for dedication and are accepted by the borough or have been placed
under the control of a community association.
      (2)   Where the Borough Council accepts dedication of all or some of the
required improvements following completion, Council shall require the posting
of financial security for the structural integrity of the improvements and the
functioning of the improvements in accordance with the design and
specifications as depicted on the final plan.
      (3)   The security required shall be in the form required by division (A)
above, shall be for a term of 18 months from the date of the completion of the
improvement(s), and shall be in an amount equal to 15% of the actual
installation cost of the dedicated improvements.
   (E)   Other financial security. If water mains, sanitary sewer lines, or
both, along with apparatus or facilities related thereto, are to be installed
under the jurisdiction of and pursuant to the rules and regulations of a public
utility or borough authority separate and distinct from the borough, financial
security to assure proper completion and maintenance thereof shall be posted in
accordance with the regulations of the controlling public utility or borough
authority. Such funds shall not be included within the financial security
required by this section.

§ 154.091 REMEDIES TO EFFECT COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   In the event that any improvements which may be required have not been
installed as provided in this chapter or in accord with the approved final
plat, the Borough Council is hereby granted the power to enforce any corporate
bond or other security by appropriate legal and equitable remedies. If the
proceeds of such bond or other security are insufficient to pay the cost of
installing or making repairs or corrections to all the improvements covered by
said security, the Borough Council may, at its option, install part of such
improvements in all or part of the subdivision or land development and may
institute appropriate legal or equitable action to recover the moneys necessary
to complete the remainder of the improvements. All of the proceeds, whether
resulting from the security or from any legal or equitable action brought
against the developer, or both, shall be used solely for the installation of
the improvements covered by such security and not for any other borough
purpose.

or land development intended to contain a structure of the kind described in
division (C) above, shall be:
         (a)   Elevated or designed and constructed to remain completely dry up
to at least one and one-half feet above the 100-year flood; and
         (b)   Designed to prevent pollution from the structure or activity
during the course of a 100-year flood.
      (2)   Any subdivision or land development intended to contain any such
structure, or part thereof, that will be built below the regulatory flood

involved, no variance shall be granted for any of the other requirements of
this section.
(Prior Code, Ch. 22, § 902) (Ord. 173, passed 10-5-1970; Ord. 245, passed 5-5-
1986, § 9.20; Ord. 323, passed 7-6-1998)

provisions of this chapter shall, upon being found liable therefor in a civil
enforcement proceeding commenced by the borough, pay a judgment of not more
than $500 plus all court costs, including attorney fees incurred by the borough
as a result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or
payable until the date of the determination of a violation by the district
justice. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the
borough may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil
procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate
violation, unless the district justice determining that there has been a
violation further determines that there was a good faith basis for the person,
partnership or corporation violating this chapter to have believed that there
was no such violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have been only
one such violation until the fifth day following the date of the determination
of a violation by the district justice and thereafter each day that a violation
continues shall constitute a separate violation.
   (B)   The Court of Common Pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of stay,
upon cause shown, tolling the per diem judgment pending a final adjudication of
the violation and judgment.
   (C)   Nothing contained in this section shall be construed or interpreted to
grant to any person or entity other than the borough the right to commence any
action for enforcement pursuant to this section.

NONCONFORMING LOTS, USES AND STRUCTURES
§ 155.185 INTENT.
   Within the zoning districts established by this chapter, or subsequent
amendments thereto, there exist, or will exist, lots, structures and uses which
were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended, but which would be
prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future
amendment. It is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to
continue until they are removed.

§ 155.186 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   (A)   In any district, a permitted building may be erected on any single lot
of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter,
notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter. Such
lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other
lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot
fails to meet the requirement for area or width, or both, that are generally
applicable in this district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements
other than these applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform
to the regulations for the district in which the lot is located.
   (B)   Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of
the Zoning Hearing Board.
   (C)   If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are on record at the time of passage or
amendment of this chapter, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the
requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be
considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of this chapter, and no
portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes
compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this chapter,
nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with width or
area below the requirements stated in this chapter.

   Where at the time of passage of this chapter or lawful use of land exists
which would not be permitted by regulations imposed by this chapter:
   (A)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter, unless by grant of special exception by
the Borough Zoning Hearing Board, when in such case a maximum increase of 25%
is permitted on existing lands owned and occupied by the existing nonconforming
land use and contingent upon compliance with all the applicable regulations of
this chapter; and
   (B)   If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than 12 months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to
the regulations specified by this Chapter for the district in which such land
is located.
(Prior Code, Ch. 27, § 27-1203) (Ord. 293, passed 4-20-1992, § 12.3; Ord. 323,

§ 155.188 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this chapter that could not be built under the terms of this
chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its
location on the lot or other requirements concerning the structure, such
structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful subject to
the following provisions.
   (A)   No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged, or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity.
   (B)   Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of
structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 80% of its
replacement cost at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except
in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.

in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
chapter, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions.
   (A)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter
in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged or extended.
   (B)   Any nonconforming use and premises may, as a special exception, be
expanded or changed to another nonconforming use provided that the Zoning
Hearing Board by special exception shall find that the expansion or proposed
change in use is appropriate to the district. In permitting such change, the
Zoning Hearing Board shall require appropriate conditions and safeguards in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   A nonconforming use may be changed to a conforming use and shall not
be changed back to a nonconforming use.

§ 155.190 REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit any repairs, maintenance or
remodeling of any nonconforming building or structure provided that such does
not make the building or structure more nonconforming in terms of the
regulations of this chapter. Further, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed
to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building
or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting
the public safety, upon order of such official.

   Any use which is permitted as a special exception in a district under the
terms of this chapter (other than a change through Zoning Hearing Board action
from a nonconforming use to another use not generally permitted in the
district) shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such district, but shall
without further action be considered a conforming use.

155.234; provided, that no such sign shall be altered or relocated unless the
same shall either conform to or be made to conform in all respects with the
applicable provisions of §§

(Prior Code, Ch. 27, § 27-1301) (Ord. 293, passed 4-20-1992, § 13.1)
§ 155.206 CONTINUATION OF PARKING FACILITIES.
   (A)   All off-street parking facilities, or those required as accessory to a
use of a proposed or altered building, shall continue unobstructed in

reduced below the required size as long as the principle use remains, unless an
equivalent number of spaces is provided for such use in another approved
location.
   (B)   In order to ensure the continued use for parking purposes of any areas
established therefor by persons who are not the owners thereof, the Borough
Council may require, before approval, evidence in writing that the owner or
owners of the land to be included in such parking areas have by covenant agreed
to allow the use of such land for the required off street parking, which
covenant shall so indicate that said covenant will bind any successors, heirs
or assigns of the owner or owners of the land affected; such covenant may be
filed for record with the Recorder of the county.

§ 155.283 VARIANCES; CONDITIONS GOVERNING APPLICATIONS; PROCEDURES.
   (A)   To authorize, upon appeal in specific cases, such variance from the
terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owing to special conditions, literal enforcement of the provisions of this
chapter would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (B)   A variance from the terms of this chapter shall not be granted by the
Zoning Hearing Board unless and until:
      (1)   (a)   A written application for a variance is submitted by a
landowner, or a tenant with the landowner’s permission, demonstrating that:
            1.   There are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape or
exceptional typographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property, and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such
conditions, and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of this chapter in the neighborhood or district in which the
property is located;
            2.   Because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of this chapter and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property;
            3.   Such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant;
            4.   The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare; and
            5.   The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulations at issue.
         (b)   In granting any variance, the Board may attain such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of
this chapter.
      (2)   Notice of public hearing shall be given as in §
155.282(B)(2);
      (3)   The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in person,
or by agent or by attorney;
      (4)   The Zoning Hearing Board shall make findings that the requirements
of division (B)(1) above have been met by the applicant for a variance;
      (5)   The Zoning Hearing Board shall further make a finding that the
reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance that
will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure; and
      (6)   The Zoning Hearing Board shall further make a finding that the
granting of a variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent
of this chapter, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise
detrimental to the public welfare.
   (C)   In granting any variance, the Zoning Hearing Board may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter.
Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this
chapter and punishable under §
155.999.

ZONING OFFICER.
   (A)   In exercising the abovementioned powers, the Zoning Hearing Board may,
so long as such action is in conformity with the terms of this chapter, reverse
or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or
determination as ought to be made, and to that purpose shall have the powers of
the Zoning Officer from whom the appeal is taken.
   (B)   The concurring vote of two members of the Board shall be necessary to

required to pass under this chapter, or to effect any variance in the
application of this chapter.
