shall be conclusive for both the applicant and the city, except when the meter
has been found to be registering inaccurately or has ceased to register. In
such case, the quantity may be determined by the average registration of the
meter when in order, or by such other fair and reasonable method as shall be
based upon the best information obtainable.
   (L)   No bypass or connection between the meter and the main shall be made,
maintained or permitted except as may be directed or installed by the city or
upon written permission from the city.
   (M)   The city may require a sealed bypass on any meter where water service
is critical, and such a bypass, or a tandem meter installation, shall be
required on all services one and one-half inch or larger. The cost of the
necessary valves and piping and the cost of their installation shall be borne
by the customer as part of the building connection.
   (N)   (1)   No charge shall be made for the furnishing of any meter, but a
fee as fixed by resolution of City Council shall be charged for the furnishing
and installation of an “outside reading” attachment to any present meter
installation, if requested by the customer. Such installations shall be made by
city forces when scheduling allows, and the cost included with the first water
billing following installation. All new services provided by the city, except

§ 51.13 PAYMENT FOR SERVICE.
   (A)   Bills for all charges are made in accordance with this chapter and are
due and payable on the fifteenth day of each month for water consumed, work
done, or services rendered during the preceding bill cycle. If the bill for
water furnished is not paid by the fifteenth day of the month a penalty of 10%
will be added, with a minimum penalty of $.10 for any one bill. If the
fifteenth day of the month falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, bills may be
paid without penalty on the next business day.
   (B)   Bills for service to the federal government, state or local
governments, or their departments and institutions shall be payable without
penalty within 30 days of the date rendered.
   (C)   If any bill is not paid prior to the date of adding penalty, service
may be discontinued after five days’ written notice.
   (D)   (1)   The city may, at its option, in cases deemed hardships, enter
into an agreement of time payments, for a period not to exceed one year, for
installation or repair charges on the following:
         (a)   New service or renewal of service for owner of single-family or
owner-occupied multi-family dwellings; or
         (b)   Damage to city owned property.
      (2)   All such time payments shall bear interest in the amount of 6%, not
compounded, on the unpaid balance, until paid.
   (E)   All meters shall be read at least quarterly, and bills shall be
rendered as stated above. If the meter reader is unable to procure a monthly
reading of the meter, because ingress to the meter is obstructed in any manner,
or entrance to the premises is made precarious by a vicious dog, or for any
other reason, an estimate shall be made of the amount of water consumed, and
the billing shall be based on the estimate.
   (F)   In addition to the foregoing remedy and such other remedies as are
provided by law for the collection of delinquent water rents, it shall be
lawful for the proper officers of the city to file a lien or liens against the
property for any and all delinquent accounts, in the same manner provided by
law in the case of unpaid city taxes on real estate and to proceed to collect
the same.

§ 51.14 MAIN EXTENSIONS.
   (A)   The city may refuse the extension of any main because of insufficient
water supply, lack of anticipated revenue sufficient to justify city
expenditures or for any other reason deemed fit by the city.
   (B)   The cost of the extension of any main shall be borne by the political
subdivision in which it is located or by such person as may agree to pay for
the extension, except for such credits as hereinafter specified.
   (C)   City specifications shall be followed in all construction of water
mains. Such specifications shall be approved by City Council and be kept on
file in the office of the City Engineer.
   (D)   All permits required by the state or federal government, or their
agencies, for extensions of mains shall be secured by the political subdivision
in which the main extension is to be constructed, or shall be secured by such
person as the political subdivision may delegate.
   (E)   Adequate plans and dimensions shall be submitted to the City Council
to secure approval for main extensions. Such plans shall be submitted by the
political subdivision in which the extension is to be made. All bidding
documents required for contracting such work done, including all drawings,
specifications, bid forms, advertisements, and permits shall be provided by
said political subdivision. The city may require that such plans submitted for
major extensions shall be certified to by a professional engineer licensed in
Pennsylvania.
   (F)   The minimum size of all main extensions shall be as the city deems
necessary, and shall be in accordance with accepted good engineering practice.
Any political subdivision desiring to install smaller mains shall provide proof
of adequacy for all potential needs. The size of the existing mains from which
extensions are proposed shall not be a limiting factor in sizing of main
extensions. The city reserves the right to regulate the use of cross-
connections from another source of its mains.
   (G)   All main extensions not constructed by city forces shall be inspected
and tested by the city, and the actual cost of said inspection and testing
shall be billed by the city and considered in all respects as a part of the
cost of extending the main or mains. No trench shall be closed on any new main
installation until said installation is approved by the city. The city may,
with City Council approval, allow such inspection and testing to be done by a
professional engineer registered in the State of Pennsylvania, providing such
approval is given before the project is underway, and providing that all costs
are borne by the political subdivision in which the extension occurs, or by
such other person as may agree to pay such costs.
   (H)   Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the city from electing to
install all or any part of any main extension with city forces, or to negotiate
with any political subdivision, person or firm as to a charge for such work,
whether said extensions are in public right-of-way or within private property.
   (I)   Main extensions shall be permitted in proposed subdivisions only if
such subdivision meets all county and/or local subdivision regulations, as may
apply, and only if the political subdivision in which the development is
located has agreed to accept and maintain the streets and roads therein.
   (J)   All main extensions into private developments shall be at the expense
of the developer, except for such credits as hereinafter specified.
   (K)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as prohibiting any
political subdivision from entering into agreements with developers for the
purpose of sharing in the cost of the extensions of water mains.
   (L)   Upon completion of any main extension, including testing, chlorination
and final approval by the City Engineer, the main extension shall be accepted
by the city as part of its water distribution system and shall become the
property of, and be maintained by, the city.
(Ord. 1179, passed 2-5-1973 ; Ord. 1626, passed 12-19-2022)
§ 51.15 CREDITS FOR MAIN EXTENSIONS; EXISTING STREETS AND ROADS.
   (A)   A credit equal to the cost of furnishing and installing 35 feet of the
main extension for each bonafide customer may be credited against the total
cost of the main extension by the city. In cases where the main extension is
not to be made with city forces, the city may elect to pay said credit or to
install such portion of the main, with its own forces, as will equal the credit
based on 35 feet per bonafide customer.
   (B)   In determining the length of and necessity for any extension to a bona
fide customer, the terminal point of such extension shall, in all cases, be to
or beyond that point which lies in the road or street and which is located in
such fashion that the service and building connections can be installed at
right angles to the main to serve the proposed meter location on the last lot
for which service is requested. However, in the extension of any system of
distribution mains to a real estate development, the length of mains shall
include any necessary additional mains required for the rendition of adequate
service within the development.
   (C)   A BONAFIDE CUSTOMER within the meaning of this chapter shall mean a
prospective customer who has signed an application for water service and
agreed, in writing, to have water furnished by the city for a period of one
year or more.
(Ord. 1179, passed 2-5-1973 ; Ord. 1626, passed 12-19-2022)
§ 51.16 CREDITS FOR MAIN EXTENSIONS, NEW DEVELOPMENTS.
   (A)   (1)   A credit equal to the cost of furnishing and installing 35 feet
of main for each customer who actually connects to such main extension during a
period of five years may be paid by the city toward reimbursing the cost of
construction of mains in new streets or roads in private developments, if such
streets or roads are accepted and maintained by the political subdivision in
which they are located and meet all applicable subdivision and zoning
regulations.
      (2)   No reimbursement shall be made except through a written contract
with the city, on city forms and which is executed prior to construction of the
mains.
      (3)   The period of five years during which such reimbursement can be
made shall commence on the date of acceptance of said mains by the city.
   (B)   The payments of the credits for the customer who connect shall be made
by the city to the developer within 30 days after the first monthly water bill
is paid for said service by the customer.
   (C)   The total credits paid the developer shall in no case exceed the total
cost of the main. Capped service lines from the main to a point two feet inside
the curb line may be included in said total cost of main, if installed with
curb cock. No tapping fee will be required in such installations.
   (D)   The city may require documentation from the developer as to total
costs when the mains are not installed by the city.
(Ord. 1179, passed 2-5-1973 ; Ord. 1626, passed 12-19-2022)
§ 51.17 COMPUTATION OF CREDITS.
   (A)   In computing the credit for 35 feet of main or main extension, the
city shall use the latest costs available from its own records or those of the
water supply company, where applicable, for main construction of a similar size
and nature installed by city or water supply company personnel. Allowances
shall be made for unusual circumstances such as stream crossings or boring. The
computation shall include all direct material and labor costs together with 15%
of such costs for wage fringes, handling, waste and other overhead.
   (B)   The above computation shall be used to establish the value of credits
for all mains or main extensions installed by other than city forces. Said
value shall not be changed after start of construction.
   (C)   The credit to be used for mains installed by city forces shall be the
actual costs of construction determined as in division (A) above, including the
15% overhead.
(Ord. 1179, passed 2-5-1973 ; Ord. 1626, passed 12-19-2022)
§ 51.18 WATER SERVICE, GENERAL.
   (A)   No person will be allowed to furnish water to others except in
temporary emergency. In case of violation, water may be shut off, after due
notice, and the person supplying said water charged with an estimated bill for
water so supplied.
   (B)   Should any person or persons move into any premises supplied with
water from the city mains, without making a written application in the manner
provided therefor, and uses water, then such person or persons shall become
responsible for all water used from the date of the last reading previous to
their occupying such premises. Failure to pay the same shall be cause for
disconnecting such service until the amount due is paid.
   (C)   Where any customer is liable to the city for water furnished at one
place, and is thereafter located using water at some other place, the water
shall be turned off at the new location until all valid accounts past due are
paid.
   (D)   Where two or more occupants use the same house or apartment, and the
water account is in the name of one, and the one in whose name the account
stands moves away, the remaining occupant is also responsible for any unpaid
water bills.
   (E)   All meters, curb cocks, valves and meter boxes connected with the city
mains and service pipes, including those furnished at the expense of the
consumers or property owners, shall remain under the direct control of the
city, and no person or persons other than those authorized by the city shall
connect or disconnect, remove seals from, move or otherwise tamper with any
such meter or turn on or off the water at the curb cock, valve or meter, or to
open, move or tamper with any meter box, or open any meter box in any way.
   (F)   No person shall take or use water from the city water system except
under the terms and conditions specified in these regulations.
   (G)   The city may inquire into and investigate into the cause of any
unusual flow or unnecessary waste of water upon or within any premises served.
If such flow or waste results from want of repair of any pipe or other fixture,
it shall require the owner of such premises to make such necessary repairs
within ten days. Upon failure of such owner to make such repairs within the
time, it shall have authority to shut off the supply of water leading to such
premises. Such water shall not again be turned on until the consumer shall have
made the required repairs and paid the fee of $50 which is herein established
for such service.
   (H)   All contractors, persons or corporations who open, grade, regrade,
fill, excavate or work any street or alley shall give ten days’ written notice
to the city for the removal, raising or lowering of any water mains, pipes,
fittings, meters or other city material that may interfere with such work. Upon
failure to furnish such notice, any damage resulting from such failure will be
charged against such contractor, person or corporation responsible.
   (I)   Whenever water shall be used on any metered premises for fire
protection or firefighting, in an actual case of fire or conflagration, no
charge shall be made for the water so used and the amount of water so used
shall be ascertained by comparison with the average use of water during a
corresponding billing period, as shown by the meter.
   (J)   City Water Department employees shall have the right at any and all
reasonable hours to enter upon or into any premises to which water is supplied
by the city, for the purpose of inspecting any pipe, fixture, setting, reading
or repairing any meter, turning water off or on and enforcing the provisions of
these regulations generally. No person shall deny entrance to any such premises
to any officer or employee hereby granted such right of entry.
   (K)   Whoever intentionally, by any means or device, prevents water from
passing through any meter belonging to the city, or used in connection with the
supply of water to any customer by the city, to register the amount of water
passing through such meter, or intentionally prevents a meter from duly
registering the quantity of water supplied, or in any way interferes with its
proper action or just registration, or without the consent in writing of the
city intentionally diverts any water from any pipe or pipes of the city or
otherwise intentionally uses, or causes to be used, without the consent of the
city, any water produced or distributed by the city, or any person who retains
possession of or refuses to deliver any meter or other appliance loaned to him
or her by the city for the purpose of furnishing water through the city shall
for every offense suffer a penalty as hereinafter provided. The presence at any
time on or about any such meter or pipe of any device or pipes resulting in the
diversion of water or prevention of its free passage and registration by the
meter or diverting from the meter as above defined or resulting in the
prevention of water from reaching the meter, or preventing the just
registration of the meter or meters or the taking of any water except through a
meter as above set forth shall constitute prima facie evidence of knowledge on
the part of the person owning or having custody and control of the room,
building, place or premises where such device or pipe is of the existence
thereof and knowledge of such existence to the person who would be benefitted
by the failure of the water to be properly metered, and shall further
constitute prima facie evidence of intention on the part of such person or
persons to defraud, and shall bring such person prima facie within the scope,
meaning and penalties of these regulations.

violation of the city’s NPDES permit or a violation of this chapter.
      (2)   In no case shall any such waiver or adjustment of local limits
allow a user to discharge any pollutant which, in combination with other users’
discharges, would reasonably be expected to exceed the mass loadings determined
by the city as acceptable to the POTW based upon considerations of, among other
things, interference, pass through and sludge contamination. The city may
consider other factors (e.g., effect of the discharge on the POTW’s treatment,
future expansion; whether compliance with the limit would result in a removal
cost wholly out of proportion to the environmental benefits achieved) as it
deems appropriate.
      (3)   The city may require a user requesting such special agreement
waiving or adjusting any such local limit to submit supporting documentation
indicating why the user cannot reasonably expect to meet the local limits,
setting forth an expeditious schedule for obtaining compliance with such local
limits, and such other information as the city may require. In granting a
special agreement the city may impose time limitations upon any less-stringent
requirements and a compliance schedule for achieving full compliance. In
granting any special agreement, the city may impose any other special
conditions deemed necessary or appropriate by the city.
      (4)   If granting a special agreement under this section would result in
increased costs to the city (e.g., capital, operations and maintenance,
treatment, and/or sludge disposal costs), the city may condition the special
agreement upon the agreement of the user to pay such costs, and to provide
security adequate in the city’s judgment to assure payment of such costs. Any
and all special agreements or waivers under this section require the approval
of City Council.

§ 52.042 PRETREATMENT FACILITIES.
   Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this
chapter and shall achieve compliance with all applicable federal categorical
pretreatment standards, state industrial waste discharge standards, local
limits and the prohibitions set out in §
52.035 within the time limitations specified by EPA, the DEP or the city,
whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be
provided, operated and maintained at the user’s expense. Detailed plans
describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the
city for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before such facilities are
constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way
relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as
necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the city under the provisions of
this chapter.
(Ord. 1433, passed 7-1-2002)
§ 52.043 ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT MEASURES.
   (A)   Whenever deemed necessary, the city may require users to restrict
their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be
discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of
discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams and such
other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the
user’s compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   The city may require any person discharging into the POTW to install
and maintain, on his or her property and at his or her expense, a suitable
storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. An individual
discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
   (C)   Grease, oil and/or sand interceptors (i.e., traps) provided by the
user, shall be installed by all restaurants discharging to the POTW; provided,
however, that this requirement may be waived by the city on a case-by-case
basis with respect to a restaurant which is not discharging wastewater with oil
and grease in greater that normal domestic sanitary sewage levels. In addition,
grease traps shall be provided and installed by other users when, in the
opinion of the city, they are necessary for the proper handling of any
wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that
such interceptors shall not be required for domestic users. All interception
units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the city and shall be so
located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors
shall be inspected, cleaned and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at
his or her expense. Records of grease trap inspections and maintenance and
receipts from the discharge or disposal of all grease shall be maintained
onsite at each facility required to have a grease trap.

not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic
nature, a non-customary batch discharge, or a slug load or slug, of prohibited
wastewater, materials or other substances regulated by this chapter, or that
may cause potential problems for the POTW. All facilities needed to prevent
such discharges shall be provided and maintained at the user’s own cost and
expense.
   (B)   The coordinator shall periodically evaluate whether each significant
industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The
coordinator may also require any user to develop, submit for approval, and
implement such a plan. Alternatively, the coordinator may develop such a plan
for any user. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a
minimum, the following:
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental or
slug discharge, as required by §
52.090; and
      (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, flow equalization measures and/or
facilities, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including
solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response.

by the coordinator; provided, however, that nothing herein shall require the
city or the POTW to accept any hauled or septic tank waste at any time from any
source. Such waste shall not violate this chapter or any other requirements
established by the city. The coordinator may require septic tank waste haulers
to obtain individual wastewater discharge permits.
   (B)   Haulers of any industrial waste shall obtain individual wastewater
discharge permits from the city prior to disposing industrial waste in the city
POTW. The coordinator may require generators of hauled industrial waste to
obtain wastewater discharge permits. The coordinator also may prohibit the
disposal of hauled septic and/or industrial waste. The discharge of hauled
industrial waste is subject to all other requirements of this chapter.
   (C)   Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations
designated by the coordinator. No load may be discharged without prior consent
of the coordinator. The coordinator may collect samples of each hauled load to
ensure compliance with applicable limits and standards. The coordinator may
require the industrial waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load
prior to discharge.
   (D)   Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for every
load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the
industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and
addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. The
form shall identify, at a minimum, the type of industry, known or suspected
waste constituents and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes.

not limited to, flow increases (over the daily flow measurements reported by
the user in its baseline monitoring report or otherwise) of 20% or greater, and
the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants.
(Ord. 1433, passed 7-1-2002)
§ 52.090 REPORTS OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS.
   (A)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-
customary batch discharge, or a slug load or slug, that may cause potential
problems for the POTW, the user shall telephone and notify the coordinator of
the incident immediately if possible (and in any event within 24 hours
thereof). This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type
of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and the corrective actions taken
by the user.
   (B)   Within five days following such discharge, the user shall submit a
detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the
measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such
notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other
liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural
resources or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such
notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties or other liability which
may be imposed pursuant to this chapter or any other applicable law.
   (C)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a
discharge described in division (A) above. Users shall ensure that all of their
employees who may cause, contribute to, or witness the occurrence of such a
discharge are advised of the emergency notification procedures.
(Ord. 1433, passed 7-1-2002)
§ 52.091 REPORTS FROM UNPERMITTED USERS.
   All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide
appropriate information and reports to the coordinator as the coordinator may
require.
(Ord. 1433, passed 7-1-2002)
§ 52.092 NOTICE OF VIOLATION/REPEAT SAMPLING AND REPORTING.
   If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation of this chapter or any
permit issued thereunder, the user must notify the coordinator within 24 hours,
and in writing within five days of becoming aware of the violation. The user
shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the
repeat analysis to the coordinator within 30 days after becoming aware of the
violation. The user is not required to resample if the coordinator monitors at
the user’s facility at least once a month, or if the coordinator samples
between the user’s initial sampling and when the user receives the results of
this sampling.
(Ord. 1433, passed 7-1-2002)
§ 52.093 NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.
   (A)   (1)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall
notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director and the
state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW
of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste
under 40 C.F.R. part 261. Such notification must include the name of the
hazardous waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R. part 261, the EPA hazardous waste
number and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other).
      (2)   If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per
calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following
information to the extent such information is known and readily available to
the user; an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the
wastestream discharged during that calendar month and an estimation of the mass
of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the
following 12 months.
      (3)   All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the
discharge commences. Any notification under this division (A) need be submitted
only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of
changed conditions must be submitted under §
52.089. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§
52.085,
52.087 and
52.088.
   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (A) above
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of
hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in
40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of
non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires
a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges
more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional
notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA identifying
additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional
substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the coordinator, the EPA
Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director and the state hazardous waste
authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective
date of such regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder and/or any applicable federal or state law.
   (F)   No hazardous waste shall be discharged to the POTW by any user unless
specifically approved by the coordinator.

52.999
§ 52.094 ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted
as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be
performed using techniques acceptable to USEPA and PADEP as specified in 40
C.F.R. part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical
pretreatment standard.
   (B)   If no such method is specified by the foregoing, one of the acceptable
methods described in the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination
of Water and Sewage, published by the American Public Health Association shall
be used.
(Ord. 1433, passed 7-1-2002)
§ 52.095 SAMPLE COLLECTION.
   (A)   Except as indicated in division (B) below or otherwise in this chapter
or an industrial wastewater discharge permit, the user must collect wastewater
samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event
flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the coordinator may authorize the use
of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user
demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent
being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance
with instantaneous discharge limits.
   (B)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
   (C)   In addition, the city expressly reserves the right to construct,
install, operate and/or maintain off-site sampling and flow monitoring stations
with respect to any user.
(Ord. 1433, passed 7-1-2002)
§ 52.096 TIMING.
   Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern.
(Ord. 1433, passed 7-1-2002)
§ 52.097 RECORD KEEPING.
   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain,
and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information
obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter and any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include
the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person
(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the
analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such
analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least five
years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any
litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been
specifically notified of a longer retention period by the coordinator.
(Ord. 1433, passed 7-1-2002)
COMPLIANCE
§ 52.110 RIGHT OF ENTRY; INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   (A)   The coordinator or its designees shall have the right to enter the
property and premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying
with all requirements of this chapter and any wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder.
   (B)   Users shall allow the coordinator ready access to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and
copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
      (1)   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the coordinator will be permitted to enter without
delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
      (2)   The coordinator shall have the right to set up on or off the user’s
property, and/or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to
conduct sampling and/or metering of the user’s operations and discharge.
      (3)   The coordinator may require the user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility’s sampling and monitoring equipment shall
be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user
at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality
shall be calibrated semi-annually or otherwise as required by the coordinator
to ensure their accuracy.
      (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
user at the written or verbal request of the coordinator and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the coordinator access to the
user’s premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 1433, passed 7-1-2002) Penalty, see §
52.999
§ 52.111 SEARCH WARRANTS.
   If the coordinator has been refused access to a building, structure or
property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need
to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
of the city designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any permit or
order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and
welfare of the community, then the coordinator may seek issuance of a search
warrant from the District Justice and/or the county’s Court of Common Pleas.
(Ord. 1433, passed 7-1-2002)
§ 52.112 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits and monitoring
programs, and from the coordinator’s inspection and sampling activities, shall
be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically
requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the coordinator,
that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or
methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable
state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the
information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a
report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately
upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or
pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person
furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other
“effluent data” as defined by 40 C.F.R. § 2.302 will not be recognized as
confidential information and will be available to the public without
restriction.
(Ord. 1433, passed 7-1-2002)
§ 52.113 ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (A)   Notice of violation. When the coordinator finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the coordinator may serve upon that user a written notice of
violation. Within 30 days of the receipt of such notice, an explanation of the
violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to
include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the
coordinator. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability
for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of
violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the coordinator
to take any enforcement or other action, including emergency actions or any
other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
   (B)   Consent orders. The city may enter into administrative consent orders,
assurances of voluntary compliance or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will
include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance
within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the
same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to divisions
(D) and (E) below and shall be judicially enforceable.
   (C)   Show cause hearing. The Sewer Director may order a user which has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, to appear before the Sewer Director and show cause why any
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the
user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement
action, the reasons for such action and a request that the user show cause why
the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on
any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a
bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   (D)   Compliance orders. When the coordinator finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the coordinator may issue an administrative order to the user
directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the
user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may
be discontinued unless and until adequate treatment facilities, devices or
other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated, or the user
otherwise comes into compliance. Compliance orders also may contain other
requirements to address the noncompliance, including without limitation,
additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the
amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend
the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or
requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any
violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order
shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the user.
   (E)   Cease and desist orders. When the coordinator finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, or that the user’s past violations are likely to recur, the
coordinator may issue an administrative order to the user directing it to cease
and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and
desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user.
   (F)   Administrative civil penalties.
      (1)   When the city finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city
may assess a civil penalty against such user in an amount not to exceed $1,000
per day for each violation. Each violation for each separate day shall
constitute a separate and distinct offense. In the case of monthly or other
long-term average discharge limits, civil penalties may be assessed for each
day during the period of violation.
      (2)   The procedures for assessing and appealing such administrative
civil penalties, and the relevant factors to be considered in assessing such
penalties, shall be as set forth in the city’s Civil Penalty Assessment Policy
attached hereto as
Appendix A.
      (3)   In addition to the civil penalties provided herein, the city may
recover interest, damages, reasonable attorney’s fees, expert witness fees,
administrative or show cause proceedings costs and/or court costs, court
reporter fees and other administrative enforcement, proceedings and/or
litigation expenses against the person or user found to be in violation of this
chapter.
      (4)   Assessment of an administrative civil penalty hereunder shall not
be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
user.
   (G)   Emergency suspensions. The coordinator may immediately suspend a
user’s discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension
is necessary in the opinion of the coordinator to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which presents or causes, or may present or cause, an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, which threatens
or causes interference or pass through or sludge contamination with respect to
the POTW, which threatens or causes the POTW to violate any term or condition
of its NPDES permit, or which presents or causes, or may present or cause, an
endangerment to the environment.
      (1)   Any person or user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
coordinator may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream or endangerment to any individuals. The coordinator may
allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to
the satisfaction of the coordinator that the period of endangerment has passed,
unless the termination proceedings in division (H) below are initiated against
the user.
      (2)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting such endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the coordinator within five days thereof.
      (3)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
   (H)   Termination of discharge.
      (1)   In addition to the provisions in §
52.072, any user who violates the following conditions may be subject to
discharge termination:
         (a)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
         (b)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
         (c)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
         (d)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or
         (e)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in §§
52.035 through
52.045.
      (2)   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under division (C) above
why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the
coordinator shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
(Ord. 1433, passed 7-1-2002)
§ 52.114 JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (A)   Injunctive relief. When the coordinator finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the coordinator may seek the issuance of a temporary or
permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific
performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order or other requirement
imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The coordinator may also
seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief,
including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental abatement,
remediation and/or corrective action. A petition for injunctive relief shall
not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a
user.
   (B)   Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this chapter are
not exclusive. The coordinator may take any, all or any combination of these
actions against a noncompliant user. The coordinator may take any other
enforcement action under applicable law against any user when the circumstances
warrant. Further, the coordinator is empowered to take more than one
enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
(Ord. 1433, passed 7-1-2002)
§ 52.115 SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION.
   (A)   Performance bonds. The coordinator may decline to issue or reissue a
wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any
provision of this chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless
such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum not to
exceed a value determined by the coordinator to be necessary to achieve
consistent compliance.
   (B)   Liability insurance. The coordinator may decline to issue or reissue a
wastewater discharge permit to any user, including without limitation any user
who has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, a previous
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user first submits proof that
it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to
the POTW caused by its discharge.
   (C)   Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water
service to the user may be severed in accordance with applicable law. Service
will only recommence, at the user’s expense, after it has satisfactorily
demonstrated its ability to comply.
   (D)   Public nuisances. A violation of any provision of this chapter, a
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement is hereby declared a public nuisance and
shall be corrected or abated as directed by the coordinator. Any person(s)
creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of applicable law
governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the city for any costs incurred
in removing, abating or remedying said nuisance.
(Ord. 1433, passed 7-1-2002)
§ 52.116 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Upset.
      (1)   For the purposes of this section, UPSET means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards or with individual permit limits because of
factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An UPSET does not include
noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed
treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive
maintenance or careless or improper operation.
      (2)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of division (C) below are met.
      (3)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or
other relevant evidence that:
         (a)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
         (b)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
         (c)   The user has submitted the following information to the
coordinator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information
is initially provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five
days of becoming aware of such upset:
            1.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
            2.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
            3.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      (4)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
      (5)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
      (6)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
   (B)   Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative
defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the
general prohibitions in §
52.035(A) or the specific prohibitions in §
52.035(B)(9) through (B)(17) and (C) if it can prove that it did not know, or
have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and
that either:
      (1)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through
or interference; or
      (2)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when
the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
   (C)   Bypass.
      (1)   For the purposes of this division (C), the following definitions
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
         (a)   BYPASS means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any
portion of a user’s treatment facility.
         (b)   SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. SEVERE PROPERTY
DAMAGE does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
      (2)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provision of divisions (C)(3) and (C)(4) below.
      (3)   (a)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the coordinator, at least ten days before the date of
the bypass, if possible.
         (b)   1.   A user shall submit oral notice to the coordinator of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass.
            2.   A written submission shall also be provided within five days
of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass.
            3.   The written submission shall contain a description of the
bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and
times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is
expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
      (4)   (a)   Bypass is prohibited, and the coordinator may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
            1.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury or severe property damage;
            2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
            3.   The user submitted notices as required under division (C)(3)
above.
         (b)   The coordinator may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the coordinator determines that it will
meet the three conditions listed in division (C)(4) above.

   The volume of water to be used for determining sewer charges or rentals
shall include metered water purchased from the city, and in addition all water
obtained from sources other than the city (wells, streams and the like), as
determined from meters installed and maintained by the city, from meters

(Ord. 1225, passed 3-21-1977)
§ 52.172 COMPUTATION OF WATER USE.
   The following methods of measurement shall be used for the computation of
the volume of water upon which the sewage charge shall be based.
   (A)   Metered sewer users supplied with water by the city. The sewer rental
or charge for any premises shall be computed monthly according to the water
meter readings as used by the city for billing water service to said premises.
   (B)   Sewer users supplied with water which originates, all or in part, from
sources other than the city water mains. The sewer rental or charge shall be
computed monthly according to the total water used, including both water from
city mains and from other sources. The city shall furnish, install and
maintain, at city expense, a meter or meters to measure the flow of such water
from other sources at a point near the source or entrance into the premises.
The user shall allow the installation and maintenance of such meter or meters,
including necessary piping, and shall afford normal and reasonable protection
to such equipment.
   (C)   Sewer users for which water used is excluded from the sewer system. In
the event it is established to the satisfaction of the city that a portion of
the water used in or on any property, served by the public sanitary sewerage
system, does not and cannot enter the system, the city may require or permit
the installation of additional meters in such manner as to determine either the
quantity of water excluded from the public sewerage system or the quantity of
water actually entering the public sewerage system, exclusive of stormwater
runoff. The sewer charge shall be based upon the quantity of water estimated,
measured or computed by the city to be actually entering the public sewerage
system, exclusive of stormwater runoff. The cost of furnishing, installing and
maintaining any meters other than those utilized to measure water purchased
from the Water Department shall be borne by the sewer user. The type, size,

may elect, or the city may require, the user to install, pay for and maintain a
meter or meters, and necessary piping, approved by the city for measuring the
volume of sewage discharged to the sewerage system, in which case sewer rentals
or charges shall be based upon actual metered waste volumes discharged to the
sewerage system at a rate equal to the charge that would be made had such waste
volume discharged been metered water use.
(Ord. 1225, passed 3-21-1977)
§ 52.174 MORE THAN ONE WATER METER.
   Where industrial, commercial or public sewer customers have more than one
meter serving property situated on contiguous parcels and under common
ownership and occupancy, the measurement by two or more meters of the quantity
of water used in or on one property by one customer may be combined and the

served or capable of being served by the single meter. The product shall be
rounded to the nearest 100 cubic feet to obtain the average water consumption
per unit. The monthly charge for sewer service shall be the applicable sewer
rate for the average water consumption per unit multiplied by the number of
units served or capable of being served by the single meter, plus the “base
charge”.
(Ord. 1341, passed 2- -1990)

   Civil penalty assessment policy, see
Appendix A
APPENDIX A: CIVIL PENALTY ASSESSMENT POLICY
   (A)   Introduction. The city hereby adopts and issues this policy for the
assessment of civil penalties for violations of the pretreatment and/or other
provisions in the city’s sewer ordinance.
   (B)   Purpose.
      (1)   
Chapter 52, inter alia, establishes a regulatory system by which the city
monitors and controls the quantity and quality of discharges to its sewage
collection system from industrial and other users. A key to the success of this
program is timely and meaningful enforcement of pretreatment regulations
governing the discharge of industrial waste into the city’s sewage collection
system.
      (2)   It is the purpose of this policy to establish procedures by which
the city may assess administrative civil penalties. Nothing in this policy is
to be construed as precluding any other action or remedy available, in equity
or at law by any legal entity or governmental entity.
   (C)   Procedure for assessing civil penalties.
      (1)   Violations of the pretreatment and other ordinance provisions are
discovered through a variety of mechanisms. These may include industrial users’
self-monitoring compliance reports; city sampling; city field inspections;
reports from other governmental agencies; and reports from employees or
citizens. When the city determines that a civil penalty is warranted, an
investigation is initiated to determine the appropriate level of penalty. The
purpose of the investigation is to evaluate the factors used to determine the
amount of the civil penalty. The factors to be evaluated are the damage to the
air, water, land or other natural resources of the commonwealth and their uses;
costs of restoration and abatement; savings resulting to the user in
consequence of the violation; history of past violations; deterrence of future
violations; and other relevant factors, as well as the civil penalties factors
as set forth in the Federal Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq.) and the
state’s Clean Streams Act (35 P.S. §§ 691.1 et seq.) The results of the
investigation shall be documented and the appropriate penalty determined in
accordance with the foregoing factors.
      (2)   Once the city has prepared a recommended penalty assessment, a show
cause order is prepared by the coordinator. The show cause order shall contain
the name and address of the user committing the violation; the specific
violation or violations for which the penalty is sought with a brief
description of the circumstances surrounding the violation or violations
sufficient to provide notice to the user; an explanation of the factors
selected to determine the penalty; the penalty proposed; and any other
enforcement actions proposed to be taken at that time in addition to the
penalty.
      (3)   The show cause order and attachments shall be submitted to the City
Sewer Director. If the show cause order facially states a violation, the Sewer
Director shall sign the show cause order and direct the user to appear before
him or her for a show cause hearing on a date no sooner than 15 days from the
issuance of the show cause order. The Sewer Director shall direct that the show
cause order be served upon the user. Upon service of the show cause order, the
Sewer Director shall advise the user that; the user has the right to be
represented by counsel; a court reporter will be present to record the show
cause hearing, the user is entitled to present witnesses and offer evidence on
its own behalf; the user will have the right to cross examine any witness of
the city; and any testimony presented at the show cause hearing will be under
oath or affirmation
      (4)   The Sewer Director shall preside over the show cause hearing. At
the show cause hearing, the coordinator shall present testimony and evidence in
support of the proposed order. The user, with the assistance of its own
counsel, shall have the opportunity to defend its actions and to challenge the
proposed assessment of the penalty or other enforcement action. At the
conclusion of the show cause hearing, the Sewer Director shall direct the
coordinator and the industrial user, with the assistance of their respective
counsels, to prepare proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law and orders.
After consideration and review of the proposed findings of fact, conclusions of
law and orders submitted, the Sewer Director shall prepare a final order which
is supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law. This final order may
be appealed to the county’s Common Pleas Court within 30 days of its issuance
pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 933 and 5571(b).
      (5)   Appealing a penalty or negotiating a compliance agreement shall not
relieve a user of a duty to mitigate and/or correct any violation of any
federal, state or local law, regulation, ordinance, permit or requirement.
Penalties shall continue to accrue for existing or new violations during the
negotiation or appeal process until the issues involved with such violations
are resolved.
   (D)   Procedure for obtaining consent penalties.
      (1)   In addition to the unilateral penalty assessment just described,
the coordinator may negotiate consent penalties in lieu of assessments.
      (2)   The procedures established herein for determining the appropriate
penalties shall be used for obtaining consent penalties. In addition to the
information required to be included in the show cause order, the coordinator
shall also include a brief description of the circumstances which justify a
negotiated penalty. Negotiated penalties may be less than unilateral penalties
with justification, but the initial penalties sought must take into account the
relevant and applicable penalties factors. As with assessed penalties, proposed
consent penalties must be reviewed and approved by the Sewer Director.
      (3)   Factors to be considered in determining whether to seek a consent
penalty include without limitation the nature and severity of the violation,
compliance history, recalcitrance of the user, undue economic distress caused
by assessment of the penalty according to the factors, and the negative impact
which the penalty would have upon the users ability to achieve compliance.
Consent penalties shall be incorporated into binding and enforceable consent
order and agreements or compliance agreements negotiated to achieve timely and
effective correction of the violation. All consent orders and agreements or
compliance agreements shall stipulate further penalties for breach of any terms
of such agreement.

§ 110.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The city recognizes the need for an inspection program for residential
rental properties located within the city in order to ensure all residential
rental properties meet minimum standards for the protection of the health and

system for compelling both absentee and local owners and operators of these
properties to correct violations and maintain in proper condition rental
properties within the city. The city recognizes that the most efficient system
to meet these objectives is the creation of a program requiring the inspection
of residential rental properties within the city as defined in this chapter, so
that a verification of compliance exists with the Property Maintenance Code of
the city.

(Ord. 1480, passed 12-3-2007)
§ 113.03 EXEMPTION AND REFUNDS.
   (A)   Exemption. Any person whose total earned income and net profits from
all sources within the political subdivision is less than $12,000 for any

payment of the tax:
      (1)   Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which the
United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or released under
honorable circumstances from active service if, as a result of military
service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double or quadruple amputee or

Administration or its successor to be a total one hundred percent disability.
      (2)   Any person who serves as a member of a reserve component of the

shall mean the United States Army Reserve, United States Navy Reserve, United
States Marine Corps Reserve, United States Coast Guard Reserve, United States
Air Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the Pennsylvania Air

   (B)   Procedure to claim exemption.
      (1)   A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local sendees tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the political subdivision and
with the person’s employer affirming that the person reasonably expects to
receive earned income and net profits from all sources within the political
subdivision of less than $12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption
certificate is filed. In the event the political subdivision utilizes a tax
collection officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to
that officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of all
the employee’s last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment within the political
subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year for which the employee is
requesting to be exempted from the tax. Upon receipt of the exemption
certificate and until otherwise instructed by the political subdivision or
except as required by subsection (2) below, the employer shall not withhold the
tax from the person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar
year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall ensure that
the exemption certificate forms are readily available to employees at all times
and shall furnish each new employee with a form at the time of hiring. The
exemption certificate form shall be the uniform form provided by the political
subdivision.
      (2)   With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the person or
by the political subdivision that the person has received earned income and net
profits from all sources within the political subdivision equal to or in excess
of $12,000 in that calendar year or that the person is otherwise ineligible for
the tax exemption for that calendar year, or upon an employer’s payment to the
person of earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold the local
services tax from the person under subsection (3) below.
      (3)   If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year from
the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under subsection (2)
above, the employer shall withhold the tax for the remainder of that calendar
year. The employer shall withhold from the person, for the first payroll period
after receipt of the notification under subsection (2) above, a lump sum equal
to the amount of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per payroll amount due
for that first payroll period. The amount of tax-withheld per payroll period
for the remaining payroll periods in that calendar year shall be the same
amount withheld for other employees. In the event the employment of a person
subject to withholding of the tax under this clause is subsequently severed in
that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any outstanding balance of
tax due, and the political subdivision may pursue collection under this
subchapter.
      (4)   Except as provided in subsection (2) above, it is the intent of
this subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating
exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or exempting any
employee from the local services tax.
   (C)   Refunds. The City Council, in consultation with the Collector and
DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims for any
tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which procedures shall be
in accord with provisions of the general municipal law relating to refunds of
overpayments and interest on overpayments. Refunds made within 75 days of a
refund request or 75 days after the last day the employer is required to remit
the tax for the last quarter of the calendar year, whichever is later, shall
not be subject to interest. No refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a
calendar year that do not exceed $1. The City Council or the Collector shall
determine eligibility for exemption and provide refunds to exempt persons.
(Ord. 1480, passed 12-3-2007)
§ 113.04 DUTIES OF EMPLOYERS TO COLLECT.
   (A)   Each employer within the city, as well as those employers situated
outside the city but who engage in business within the city, is hereby charged
with the duty of collecting the tax from each of his or her employees engaged
by him or her or performing for him or her within the political subdivision and
making a return and payment thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is
hereby authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in his or her employ,
whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and whether or not
all such services are performed within the political subdivision.
   (B)   A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro
rata share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person for a
payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax levied for
the calendar year by the number of payroll periods established by the employer
for the calendar year. For purposes of determining the pro rata share, an
employer shall round down the amount of the tax collected each payroll period
to the nearest one-hundredth of a dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made
on a payroll period basis for each payroll period in which the person is
engaging in an occupation, except as provided in division (D) of this section.
For purposes of this division (B), combined rate shall mean the aggregate
annual rate of the tax levied by the school district and the municipality.
   (C)   No person shall be subject to the payment of the local sendees tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
   (D)   In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement from a
principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the length of the
payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a statement from the
employee that the pay statement is from the employee’s principal employer and
the employee will notify other employers of a change in principal place of
employment within two weeks of its occurrence. The employee’s statement shall
be provided on the form approved by DCED.
   (E)   The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The political subdivision shall provide a taxpayer a
receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
   (F)   No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or
for the payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the
employee as to the employee’s place or plates of employment, the employee’s
principal office or where the employee is principally employed. Further, an
employer shall not be liable for payment of the local services tax in an amount
exceeding the amount withheld by the employer if the employer complies with the
provisions of §
113.03(B) of this subchapter and this section and remits the amount so withheld
in accordance with this subchapter.
   (G)   Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
(Ord. 1480, passed 12-3-2007)
§ 113.05 TAX RETURNS.
   Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her to
an employee, except as provided hereafter in this subchapter, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.
(Ord. 1480, passed 12-3-2007)
§ 113.06 DATES FOR DETERMINING TAX LIABILITY AND PAYMENT.

over to the Collector on or before the 30th day following the end of each
calendar quarter of each such tax year.
(Ord. 1480, passed 12-3-2007)
§ 113.07 SELF EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS.
   Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind or
engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of employment
within the political subdivision shall be required to comply with this
subchapter and pay the pro rata portion of the tax due to the Collector on or
before the 30th day following the end of each quarter.
(Ord. 1480, passed 12-3-2007)
§ 113.08 INDIVIDUALS ENGAGED IN MORE THAN ONE OCCUPATION OR EMPLOYED IN MORE
THAN ONE POLITICAL SUBDIVISION.
   (A)   The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day
the person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the event
a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is, concurrent
employment, or an occupation which requires the person working in more than one
political subdivision during a payroll period, the priority of claim to collect
the local services tax shall be in the following order:
      (1)   First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
      (2)   Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision; and
      (3)   Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person’s home.
   (B)   In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that
calendar year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.

   All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the city but who perform services of any type or kind or
engage in any occupation or profession within the city do, by virtue thereof,
agree to be bound by and subject themselves to the provisions, penalties and
regulations promulgated under this subchapter with the same force and effect as
though they were residents of the city. Further, any individual engaged in an
occupation within the city and an employee of a nonresidential employer may,
for the purpose of this subchapter, be considered a self-employed person, and
in the event his or her tax is not paid, the city shall have the option of
proceeding against either the employer or employee for the collection of this
tax as hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 1480, passed 12-3-2007)

enforcement of this subchapter and is hereby charged and empowered, subject to

subchapter, including provisions for the examination of payroll records of any

Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Collector shall have the right to
appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County as in other cases provided.
   (C)   The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return made by

is hereby directed and required to give the Collector the means, facilities and
opportunity for such examination.
(Ord. 1480, passed 12-3-2007)

interest and penalty.
   (B)   If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate
of 6% on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning with the due date
of the tax and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of such tax for
nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery of this tax or other
appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable therefor shall, in
addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of collection.
(Ord. 1480, passed 12-3-2007)

STREET EXCAVATIONS
§ 150.35 APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   No excavation shall be made within the right-of-way of any public
street of the city, unless the excavator has first obtained a permit at the
City Engineer’s office, and has deposited bond in the amount of $5,000.
   (B)   A fee as established by resolution shall be paid to the city for each
permit obtained to excavate in the streets. In the event that the excavation is

(Ord. 1019, passed 9-14-1964; Ord. 1261, passed 8-18-1980)
§ 150.36 EVACUATION METHODS.
   (A)   Before any excavation is begun, the excavator shall make provisions to
re-route traffic, if necessary, shall place flags and barriers, or flares if at
night, and in case of a deep excavation or excavation in loose material, shall
be equipped to shore up the sides of the excavation with trench jacks or
cribbing.
   (B)   All safety devices and precautions for work on state routes shall be
in strict accordance with current specifications and regulations of the state’s
Department of Highways.
   (C)   The paving to be removed shall first be scored with a scoring tool. It
shall then be broken with a paving breaker. The cut through the paving shall be
vertical and shall be squared to include the area to be removed. Paving shall
be removed a minimum of six inches and a maximum of one foot beyond the edge of
the proposed trench.
   (D)   (1)   The width of the trench shall be no wider than is required for
the work to be done, with allowance for shoring, when necessary. The walls of
the trench shall be vertical. The length of a transverse trench shall be
limited to one-half of the roadway width. In the case of three or more lanes of
paving, this may be extended to two-thirds of the roadway.
      (2)   If absolutely necessary to repair or install a facility in one
length, across the entire width of the roadway, a combination of open trench
and tunneling will be permitted, if the applicant agrees to backfill the tunnel
with gunite sand, concrete or other material as may be approved by the City
Engineer.
   (E)   If the excavation has been made in basically granular native soil, it
may be backfilled with the material removed, compacted by flooding or by
tamping while moist. In the case of deep trenches in native soils which are not
granular, the excavation may be backfilled with sand and gravel, suitably
compacted, to a level just below the frost penetration. The remainder of the
excavation will then be backfilled with native soil, as specified in division
(G) below.
   (F)   When the excavation has exposed city-owned storm or sanitary sewers,
the initial lift to the top of pipes larger than 24 inches’ nominal diameter,
or to one foot above the top of smaller pipes, shall be placed and compacted as
follows.
      (1)   Selected granular material shall be placed by hand or by suitable
equipment in such manner as not to disturb the pipe. Such material shall not
include any rocks larger than two inches in the maximum dimension, hard or
frozen lumps which could damage the pipe.
      (2)   This material shall be compacted with mechanical tampers in four-
inch layers.
   (G)   The remainder of the trench shall then be backfilled as follows.
Native soil free from frozen lumps and vegetable matter shall be placed in six-
inch layers and compacted with power equipment. The degree of compaction shall
be such that there will be no appreciable settlement of the finished fill. The
excavation shall be filled thusly to the level of the existing subgrade.
(Ord. 1019, passed 9-14-1964)
§ 150.37 REPLACEMENT OF BASE.
   (A)   For concrete or bituminous paving over a granular, sand or natural
soil base, the base shall be replaced to the same thickness and with comparable
materials as the base of the original paving. Crushed rock, crushed gravel and
granulated slag are acceptable materials. This base shall be compacted
mechanically to a density comparable to the original. The base so formed shall
be brought to an elevation that will provide for the proper pavement thickness
as hereinafter specified. The thickness of the base under bituminous paving
shall be 12 inches minimum, and shall be six inches minimum under concrete
paving.
   (B)   For bituminous paving on a concrete or soil cement base, the base
shall be replaced with concrete as follows. Prior to pouring the concrete, old
concrete or soil cement shall be cleaned and the sides and bottom of the hole
shall be dampened. High early cement shall be used. The concrete shall be
vibrated or rodded to remove all voids between it and the existing base.
Concrete with a slump of one and one-half inches shall be used. The surface of
the poured concrete shall be rodded or vibrated and screened slightly above the
surface of the existing concrete or soil cement and then reduced to the proper
level by floating after the concrete is partially set. Provision shall be made
by the excavator for proper curing of the concrete.
(Ord. 1019, passed 9-14-1964)
§ 150.38 REPLACEMENT OF PAVEMENT.
   (A)   For bituminous patches, the material used shall be a hot-mixed and
hot-applied asphaltic concrete meeting the state’s Department of Highways
specifications for FJ-1 or 1D-2 surface course or 1D-2 base course. The
compacted thickness shall be a minimum of three inches.
   (B)   The following procedure shall be followed for all bituminous patches.
      (1)   The sides of the original paving shall be cleaned and covered with
a thin coat of cutback asphalt, such as RC-1.
      (2)   The patch material will be raked into the edges and mounded high
enough so that when compacted it will form a smooth surface, flush with the
original paving.
      (3)   The finished patch shall be protected from traffic for not less
than six hours.
      (4)   The joint around the patch shall be sealed with a surface
application of suitable asphaltic sealer.
   (C)   For concrete paving, the same procedure shall be followed as in
division (B) above, with the additional provision that any joints in the
original concrete paving shall be carried through the patch.
   (D)   For brick paving, the brick shall be replaced with good workmanship on
a one-half inch course of sand over a concrete base. The concrete base shall be
installed in accordance with §
150.37. Asphaltic concrete patches over a concrete base or concrete patches six
inches thick may be installed in brick streets if approved by the City
Engineer.
(Ord. 1019, passed 9-14-1964)
§ 150.39 WINTER EXCAVATIONS.
   (A)   Whenever weather conditions do not permit proper restoration of an
excavation, the excavation shall be closed to the best of the excavator’s
ability, with the express understanding that the excavation shall be correctly
restored, following the above outlined procedure, as soon as weather permits.
This specifically includes proper compaction of the trench, if needed.
   (B)   Cold-mixed asphaltic concrete patches may be used during winter
months, but they must be replaced with a permanent patch as hereinbefore
specified as soon as weather permits.
(Ord. 1019, passed 9-14-1964)
§ 150.40 WET EXCAVATIONS.
   Whenever the backfill in an excavation shall obtain a moisture content too
high for proper compaction, whether due to groundwater, rain or surface water,
the contractor shall remove the wet material and import dry material. The
backfill shall then be compacted as hereinbefore specified.
(Ord. 1019, passed 9-14-1964)
§ 150.41 RESPONSIBILITY.
   (A)   Whenever for any reason the pavement cannot be replaced immediately,
the filled-in excavation shall be maintained by the excavator, so as not to
create a hazard or nuisance to vehicles or pedestrians, until the pavement can
be replaced.
   (B)   If any settlement or failure in a restored area occurs within a period
of two years from the date of completion of the permanent restoration, the
patch shall be replaced by the excavator at his or her expense.
   (C)   The city may, by agreement with any particular utility, provide that
the replacement of the pavement shall be done by the city and the cost thereof
charged against or billed to such utility
(Ord. 1019, passed 9-14-1964)
§ 150.42 ENFORCEMENT.
   If a city official or police officer shall determine that an untended
filled-in excavation has become a hazard or a nuisance to vehicles or
pedestrians, the excavator shall be notified in writing of the same. The
excavator shall correct the situation within 36 hours of receipt of said
notice.

shall issue a written notice requiring the owner, within a reasonable time
specified in the notice, to rectify the conditions constituting the nuisance,
or to remove or demolish the structure. Such removal or demolition shall not be
ordered unless the cost of such repair, alteration or improvement shall exceed
50% of the market value of the structure. If requested by the two interested
parties, a board of three appraisers shall be appointed to decide the market
value. Each party shall select one appraiser; who in turn shall select the
third. Any fee engendered through action shall be borne by the property owner.

structure, the Housing Officer may cause such repairs, alterations or
improvements to be made. The amount of such cost of alterations or
improvements, or vacating, closing, removal or demolition shall be a municipal
lien against the real property upon which the cost was incurred. If the
structure is removed or demolished by order of the Housing Officer, he or she
shall sell the materials of such structure for the best price attainable, and
shall credit the proceeds of such sale against the cost of removal or
demolition, and any such balance remaining shall be disbursed to the owner.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.001 SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “City of Corry
Stormwater Management Ordinance”.
(Ord. 1508, passed 12-20-2010)
§ 152.002 STATEMENT OF FINDINGS.
   The governing body of the city finds that:
   (A)   Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from
development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities,
contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of
existing streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public
facilities to convey and manage stormwater, undermines floodplain management
and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities, reduces
groundwater recharge, threatens public health and safety and increases non-
point source pollution of water resources;
   (B)   A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including reasonable
regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff, is
fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare and the protection of the
people of the city and all the people of the state, their resources and the
environment;
   (C)   Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from
land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface
water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns; accelerating
stream flows (which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and stream banks
thereby elevating sedimentation); destroying aquatic habitat; and elevating
aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients,
heavy metals and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted through
loss of recharge;
   (D)   Stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater
recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams, which also protects and
maintains surface water quality;
   (E)   Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater issues;
   (F)   Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are required
to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer
systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES); and
   (G)   Non-stormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of waters of the state.
(Ord. 1508, passed 12-20-2010)
§ 152.003 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety and welfare within
the city, by minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits described in §
152.002 through provisions intended to:
   (A)   Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim and restore
the existing and designated uses of the waters of the state;
   (B)   Manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems close
to their source, by regulating activities that cause these problems;
   (C)   Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible;
   (D)   Maintain groundwater recharge, to prevent degradation of surface and
groundwater quality, and to otherwise protect water resources;
   (E)   Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses;
   (F)   Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams and
prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds;
   (G)   Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, with a minimum
of structures and a maximum use of natural processes;
   (H)   Provide procedures, performance standards and design criteria for
stormwater planning and management;
   (I)   Provide proper operations and maintenance of all stormwater management
facilities and best management practices (BMPs) that are constructed and
implemented; and
   (J)   Provide standards to meet the NPDES permit requirements.

§ 152.023 VOLUME CONTROLS.
   (A)   The low impact development practices provided in the BMP Manual and in
Appendix B of this chapter shall be utilized for all regulated activities to
the maximum extent practicable.
   (B)   Stormwater runoff volume controls shall be implemented using the
design storm method or the simplified method as defined below. For regulated
activity areas equal or less than one acre that do not require hydrologic
routing to design the stormwater facilities, this chapter establishes no
preference for either method; therefore, the applicant may select either method
on the basis of economic considerations, the intrinsic limitations on
applicability of the analytical procedures associated with each methodology,
and other factors.
      (1)   The design storm method (CG-I in the BMP Manual) is applicable to
any sized regulated activity. This method requires detailed modeling based on
site conditions.
         (a)   Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the two-year 24-hour storm;
         (b)   For hydrologic modeling purposes:
            1.   Existing non-forested pervious areas must be considered meadow
(good condition) for pre-development hydrologic calculations; and
            2.   Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present
within the proposed project site, shall be considered meadow (good condition)
for pre-development hydrologic calculations for re-development.
      (2)   The simplified method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual) is independent of
site conditions and should be used if the design storm method is not followed.
This method is not applicable to regulated activities greater than one acre or
for projects that require detailed design of stormwater storage facilities. For
new impervious surfaces:
         (a)   Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two
inches of runoff from all new impervious surfaces;
         (b)   At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious
surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow, (i.e., it shall not
be released into surface waters of the state). Removal options include reuse,
evaporation, transpiration and infiltration;
         (c)   Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed runoff; however, in
all cases at least the first half-inch of the permanently removed runoff should
be infiltrated; and
         (d)   Actual field infiltration tests at the location of the proposed
elevation of the stormwater BMPs are required. Infiltration test shall be
conducted in accordance with the BMP Manual. A minimum 48-hour notification of
the municipality shall be provided to allow witnessing of the testing.
      (3)   In cases where it is not possible or desirable to use infiltration-
based best management practices to partially fulfill the requirements in either
divisions (B)(1) or (B)(2) above, the following procedure shall be provided to
allow witnessing of the testing.
         (a)   At a minimum, the following documentation shall be provided to
justify the decision to reduce the use of infiltration BMPs:
            1.   Description of and justification for field infiltration/
permeability testing with respect to the type of test and test locations);
            2.   An interpretive narrative describing existing site soils and
their structure as these relate to the interaction between soils and water. In
addition to providing soil and soil profile descriptions, this narrative shall
identify depth to seasonal high water tables and depth to bedrock, and provide
a description of all subsurface elements (fragipans and other restrictive
layers, geology and the like) that influence the direction and rate of
subsurface water movement;
            3.   A qualitative assessment of the site’s contribution to annual
aquifer recharge shall be made, along with identification of any restrictions
or limitations associated with the use of engineered infiltration facilities;
and
            4.   The provided documentation must be signed and sealed by a
professional engineer or geologist.
         (b)   The following water quality pollutant load reductions will be
required for all disturbed areas within the proposed development.
 
Pollutant Load               Units  Required reduction (%)
Total nitrate (NO3)          Pounds 50
Total phosphorous (TP)       Pounds 85
Total suspended solids (TSS) Pounds 85
 
         (c)   The performance criteria for water quality best management
practices shall be determined from the state’s Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual most current version.
   (C)   The applicable worksheets from the BMP Manual must be used in
calculations to establish volume control.

      (3)   Innovative stormwater BMPs and recharge facilities are encouraged
(e.g., rooftop storage, drywells, cisterns, recreation area ponding, diversion
structures, porous pavements, holding tanks, infiltration systems, in-line
storage in storm sewers and grading patterns). They shall be located, designed
and constructed in accordance with the latest technical guidance published by
PADEP, provided they are accompanied by detailed engineering plans and
performance capabilities and supporting site specific soils, geology, runoff
and groundwater and infiltration rate data to verify proposed designs.
Additional guidance from other sources may be accepted at the discretion of the
city, a pre-application meeting is suggested.
      (4)   All existing and natural watercourses, channels, drainage systems
and areas of surface water concentration shall be maintained in their existing
condition unless an alteration is approved by the appropriate regulatory
agency.
      (5)   The design of all stormwater management facilities shall
incorporate sound engineering principles and practices. The municipality shall
reserve the right to disapprove any design that would result in the
continuation or exacerbation of a documented adverse hydrologic or hydraulic
condition within the watershed, as identified in the Plan.
      (6)   The design and construction of multiple use stormwater detention
facilities are strongly encouraged. In addition to stormwater management,
facilities should, where appropriate, allow for recreational uses including
ball fields, play areas, picnic grounds and the like. Consultation with the
city and prior approval are required before design. Provision for permanent wet
ponds with stormwater management capabilities may also be appropriate.
         (a)   Multiple use basins should be constructed so that potentially
dangerous conditions are not created.   
         (b)   Water quality basins or recharge basins that are designed for a
slow release of water or other extended detention ponds are not permitted for
recreational uses, unless the ponded areas are clearly separated and secure.
      (7)   Should any stormwater management facility require a dam safety
permit under PADEP Chapter 105, the facility shall be designed in accordance
with Chapter 105 and meet the regulations of Chapter 105 concerning dam safety.
   (B)   Stormwater management facility design considerations. All stormwater
management facilities shall meet the following design requirements.
      (1)   No outlet structure from a stormwater management facility, or
swale, shall discharge directly onto a municipal or state roadway without
approval from the city or PennDOT.

greater than existing ground elevations 50 feet from top of stream bank in the
facility’s vicinity.
      (5)   Basin outflow culverts discharging into floodplains must account
for tailwater. Tailwater corresponding to the 100-year floodplain elevation
must be used for all design storms, or the applicant may elect to determine
flood elevations of the adjacent watercourse for each design storm. The
floodplain is assumed to be 50 feet from top of stream bank in areas where a
floodway is not designated or no other evidence is provided.
      (6)   The invert of all stormwater management facilities and underground
infiltration/storage facilities shall be located a minimum of two feet above
the seasonal high groundwater table. The invert of stormwater facilities may be
lowered if adequate sub-surface drainage is provided. Flows from underdrains
need not be accounted for in volume or rate control calculations.
      (7)   Whenever possible, the side slopes and basin shape shall be
amenable to the natural topography. Vertical side slopes and rectangular basins
shall be avoided whenever possible.
      (8)   Exterior slopes of compacted soil shall not exceed a three to one
ratio, and may be further reduced if the soil has unstable characteristics.

stormwater management facilities shall have a minimum slope of 2% extending
radially out from the principal outlet structure. Facilities designed as water
quality/infiltration BMPs may have a bottom slope of zero.
      (11)   Impervious low-flow channels are not permitted within stormwater
management facilities.
      (12)   Unless specifically designed as a volume control or water quality
facility, all stormwater management facilities must empty over a period of time
not less than 24 hours and not more than 72 hours from the end of the
facility’s inflow hydrograph. Infiltration tests performed at the facility
locations and proposed basin bottom depths, in accordance with the BMP Manual,
must support time-to-empty calculations if infiltration is a factor.
      (13)   Energy dissipators and/or level spreaders shall be installed at
points where pipes or drainageways discharge to or from basins. Discharges to
drainage swales shall be dissipated or piped to an acceptable point.

slope at a minimum.
      (17)   Any stormwater management facility designed to store runoff shall
provide an emergency spillway designed to convey the 100-year post-development
peak rate flow with a blocked primary outlet structure. The emergency spillway
shall be designed per the following requirements:
         (a)   The top of embankment elevation shall provide a minimum one foot
of freeboard above the maximum water surface elevation. This is to be
calculated when the spillway functions for the 100-year post-development
inflow, with a blocked outlet structure;
         (b)   Avoid locating on fill areas, whenever possible;
         (c)   The spillway shall be armored to prevent erosion during the 100-
year post-development flow, with a blocked primary outlet structure. Synthetic

spillway invert if riprap is the proposed armoring material. Emergency spillway
armor must extend up the sides of the spillway, and continue at full width to a
minimum of ten feet past the toe of slope;
         (d)   The city may require the use of additional protection when
slopes exceed a four to one ratio and spillway velocities might exceed NRCS
standards for the particular soils involved; and
         (e)   Any underground stormwater management facility, pipe storage
systems, must have a method to bypass flows higher than the required design, up
to a 100-year post-development inflow, without structural failure or causing
downstream harm or safety risks.
      (18)   Design of stormwater management facilities having three feet or
more of water depth, measured vertically from the lowest elevation in the
facility to the crest of the emergency spillway, shall meet the following
additional requirements.

a density at least 98% of it’s the maximum dry density. Each layer of compacted
fill shall be tested to determine its density per ASTM 2922 or ASTM 3017. One
test per 50 cubic yards of material placed, at least one per layer, shall be
performed by an independent testing agency.
         (e)   A cutoff and key trench of impervious material shall be provided
under all embankments four feet or greater in height. The cutoff trench shall
run the entire length of the embankment and tie into undisturbed natural
ground.
         (f)   Anti-seep collars, or a PADEP approved alternative, must be

collars.
      (19)   Construction of stormwater management facilities:
         (a)   Basins used for rate control only shall be installed prior to or
concurrent with any earthmoving or land disturbances which they will serve. The
phasing of their construction shall be noted in the narrative and on the plan.

         (c)   Compaction test reports shall be kept on file at the site and be
subject to review at all times with copies being forwarded to the city upon
request.
         (d)   Temporary and permanent grasses or stabilization measures shall
be established on the sides and base of all earthen basins within 15 days of

      (20)   Exceptions to these requirements may be made at the discretion of
the municipality for BMPs that retain or detain water, but are of a much
smaller scale than traditional stormwater management facilities.
   (C)   Stormwater carrying facilities.
      (1)   All storm sewer pipes, grass waterways, open channels, swales and
other stormwater carrying facilities that service drainage areas within the

         (g)   Standard type “C” inlets with eight-inch hoods shall be used
along curbed roadway networks. Type “C” inlets with ten-inch hoods that provide
a two-inch sump condition may be used with approval of the city when roadway

§ 152.051 CALCULATION METHODOLOGY.
   (A)   Calculations. All calculations shall be consistent with the guidelines
set forth in the BMP Manual, as amended herein.
   (B)   Methodology. Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be
calculated using either the rational method or the NRCS rainfall-runoff
methodology. Other methods shall be selected by the design professional based
on the individual limitations and suitability of each method for a particular
site and approved by the city.
   (C)   Rainfall values. NRCS rainfall-runoff method. The soil conservation
service type II, 24-hour rainfall distribution shall be used in conjunction
with rainfall depths from NOAA Atlas 14 or be consistent with the following
table.
 
Return Interval (Year) 24-Hour Rainfall Total (Inches)
1                      2.13
2                      2.56
10                     3.71
25                     4.46
50                     5.09
100                    5.76
 
   (D)   Runoff volume.
      (1)   Rational method. Not to be used to calculate runoff volume.
      (2)   NRCS rainfall-runoff method. This method shall be used to estimate
the change in volume due to regulated activities. Combining curve numbers for
land areas proposed for development with Curve Numbers for areas unaffected by
the proposed development into a single weighted curve number is not acceptable.
   (E)   Peak flow rates.
      (1)   Rational method. This method may be used for design of conveyance
facilities only. Extreme caution should be used by the design professional if
the watershed has more then one main drainage channel, if the watershed is
divided so that hydrologic properties are significantly different in one versus
the other, if the time of concentration exceeds 60 minutes or if stormwater
runoff volume is an important factor. The combination of rational method
hydrographs based on timing shall be prohibited.
      (2)   NRCS rainfall-runoff method.
         (a)   This method is recommended for design of stormwater management
facilities and where stormwater runoff volume must be taken into consideration.
The following provides guidance on the model applicability:
            1.   NRCS’s TR-20 or HEC-HMS: no size limitations; and
            2.   Other models as pre-approved by the municipality.
         (b)   The NRCS antecedent runoff condition II (ARC II, previously AMC
II) must be used for all simulations. The use of continuous simulation models
that vary the ARC are not permitted for stormwater management purposes.
      (3)   Rate comparison. For comparison of peak flow rates, flows shall be
rounded to a tenth of a cubic foot per second (cfs).
   (F)   Runoff coefficients.
      (1)   Rational method. Use Table C-1 (
Appendix C).
      (2)   NRCS rainfall-runoff method. Use table C-2 (
Appendix C). Curve numbers (CN) should be rounded to tenths for use in
hydrologic models as they are a design tool with statistical variability. For
large sites, CNs should realistically be rounded to the nearest whole number.
      (3)   Pre-development peak flow rate.
         (a)   For the purposes of pre-development peak flow rate and volume
determination, existing non-forested pervious areas conditions shall be
considered as meadow (good condition).
         (b)   For the purposes of pre-development peak flow rate and volume
determination, 20% of existing impervious area, when present, shall be
considered meadow (good condition).
   (G)   Design storm.
      (1)   All stormwater management facilities shall be verified by routing
the proposed one-year, two-year, ten-year, 25-year, 50-year and 100-year
hydrographs through the facility using the storage indication method or
modified puls method. The design storm hydrograph shall be computed using a
calculation method that produces a full hydrograph.
      (2)   The stormwater management and drainage system shall be designed to
safely convey the post development 100-year storm event to stormwater detention
facilities, for the purpose of meeting peak rate control.
   (H)   Time of concentration.
      (1)   The time of concentration is to represent the average condition
that best reflects the hydrologic response of the area. The following time of
concentration (Tc) computational methodologies shall be used unless another
method is pre-approved by the city:
         (a)   Pre-development - NRCS’s lag equation:
            Time of concentration = Tc = [(Tlag/.6) * 60] (minutes)
                     Tlag = L0.8 (S+1)0.7
                      1900Y
            Where:
            Ttag   =   Lag time (hours)
            L   =   Hydraulic length of watershed (feet)
            Y   =   Average overland slope of watershed (percent)
            S   =   Maximum retention in watershed as defined by: S = [(1000/
CN) - 10]
            CN   =   NRCS curve number for watershed
         (b)   Post-development; commercial, industrial or other areas with
large impervious areas (>20% impervious area) - NRCS segmental method. The
length of sheet flow shall be limited to 100 feet. Tc for channel and pipe flow
shall be computed using Manning’s equation.
         (c)   Post-development; residential, cluster or other low impact
designs less than or equal to 20% impervious area - NRCS lag equation or NRCS
segmental method.
      (2)   Additionally, the following provisions shall apply to calculations
for time of concentration:
         (a)   The post-development Tc shall never be greater than the pre-
development Tc for any watershed or sub-watershed. This includes when the
designer has specifically used swales to reduce flow velocities. In the event
that the designer believes that the post-development Tc is greater, it will
still be set by default equal to the pre-development Tc for modeling purposes.
         (b)   The minimum Tc for any watershed shall be five minutes.
         (c)   The designer must provide computations for all pre-development
Tc paths. A five minute Tc can not be assumed for pre-development.
         (d)   Undetained fringe areas (areas that are not tributary to a
stormwater facility but where a reasonable effort has been made to convey
runoff from all new impervious coverage to best management practices) may be
assumed to represent the pre-development conditions for purpose of Tc
calculation.
   (I)   Drainage. Drainage areas tributary to sinkholes or closed depressions
in areas underlain by limestone or carbonate geologic features shall be
excluded from the modeled point of analysis defining pre-development flows. If
left undisturbed during construction activities, areas draining to closed
depressions may also be used to reduce peak runoff rates in the post-
development analysis. New, additional contributing runoff should not be
directed to existing sinkholes or closed depressions.
   (J)   Uniform flow. Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning’s
equation shall be used for hydraulic computations and to determine the capacity
of open channels, pipes and storm sewers. Manning’s “n” values shall be
obtained from PennDOT’s Drainage Manual, Publication 584. Inlet control shall
be checked at all inlet boxes to ensure the headwater depth during the ten-year
design event is contained below the top of grate for each inlet box.
   (K)   Existing runoff rates. The municipality may require that computed
existing runoff rates be reconciled with field observations, conditions and
site history, if the designer can substantiate, through actual physical
calibration, that more appropriate runoff and time of concentration values
should be utilized at a particular site, then appropriate variations may be
made upon review and recommendation of the municipality.

APPENDIX B: LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES
   Natural hydrologic conditions may be altered radically by poorly planned
development practices, such as introducing unneeded impervious surfaces,
destroying existing drainage swales, constructing unnecessary storm sewers, and
changing local topography. A traditional drainage approach of development has
been to remove runoff from a site as quickly as possible and capture it in a
detention basin. This approach leads ultimately to the degradation of water
quality, as well as expenditure of additional resources for detaining and
managing concentrated runoff at some downstream location.
   The recommended alternative approach is to promote practices that will
minimize post-development runoff rates and volumes, which will minimize needs
for artificial conveyance and storage facilities. To simulate pre-development
hydrologic conditions, forced infiltration is often necessary to offset the
loss of infiltration by creation of impervious surfaces. The ability of the
ground to infiltrate runoff depends upon the soil types and its conditions.
   Preserving natural hydrologic conditions requires careful alternative site
design considerations. Site design practices include preserving natural
drainage features, minimizing impervious surface area, reducing the hydraulic
connectivity of impervious surfaces, and protecting natural depression storage.
A well-designed site will contain a mix of all those features. The following
describes various techniques to achieve the alternative approaches:
      (1)   Preserving Natural Drainage Features. Protecting natural drainage
features, particularly vegetated drainage swales and channels, is desirable
because of their ability to infiltrate and attenuate flows and to filter
pollutants. However, this objective is often not accomplished in land
development. In fact, commonly held drainage philosophy encourages just the
opposite pattern - streets and adjacent storm sewers typically are located in
the natural headwater valleys and swales, thereby replacing natural drainage
functions with a completely impervious system. As a result, runoff and
pollutants generated from impervious surfaces flow directly into storm sewers
with no opportunity for attenuation, infiltration, or filtration. Developments
designed to fit site topography also minimize the amount of grading on site.
      (2)   Protecting Natural Depression Storage Areas. Depressional storage
areas have no surface outlet, or drain very slowly following a storm event.
They can be commonly seen as ponded areas in farm fields during the wet season
or after large runoff events. Traditional development practices eliminate these
depressions by filling or draining, thereby obliterating their ability to
reduce surface runoff volumes and trap pollutants. The volume and release-rate
characteristics, of depressions should be protected in the design of the
development site. The depressions can be protected by simply avoiding the
depression or by incorporating its storage as additional capacity in required
detention facilities.
      (3)   Avoiding Introduction of Impervious Areas. Careful site planning
should consider reducing impervious coverage to the maximum extent possible.
Building footprints, sidewalks, driveways, and other features producing
impervious surfaces should be evaluated to minimize impacts on runoff.
      (4)   Reducing the Hydraulic Connectivity of Impervious Surfaces.
Impervious surfaces are significantly less of a problem if they are not
directly connected to an impervious conveyance system (such as storm sewer).
Two basic ways to reduce hydraulic connectivity are: routing of roof runoff
over lawns; and reducing the use of storm sewers. Site grading should promote
increasing travel time of stormwater runoff and should help reduce
concentration of runoff to a single point in the development.
      (5)   Routing Roof Runoff Over Lawns. Roof runoff can be easily routed
over lawns in most site designs. The practice discourages direct connections of
downspouts to storm sewers or parking lots. The practice also discourages
sloping driveways and parking lots to the street. The routing of roof drains
and crowning the driveway to allow runoff to discharge to pervious areas is
desirable as the pervious area essentially acts as a filter strip.
      (6)   Reducing the Use of Storm Sewers. By reducing the use of storm
sewers for draining streets, parking lots, and back yards, the potential for
accelerating runoff from the development can be greatly reduced. The practice
requires greater use of swales and may not be practical for some development
sites, especially if there are concerns for areas that do not drain in a
“reasonable” time. The practice requires educating local citizens and public
works officials, who expect runoff to disappear shortly after a rainfall event.
      (7)   Reducing Street Widths. Street widths can be reduced by either
eliminating on-street parking or by reducing cartway widths. Municipal planners
and traffic designers should encourage narrower neighborhood streets, which
ultimately could lower maintenance and maintenance related costs.
      (8)   Limiting Sidewalks to One Side of the Street. A sidewalk on one
side of the street may suffice in low-traffic neighborhoods. The lost sidewalk
could be replaced with bicycle/recreational trails that follow back-of-lot
lines. Where appropriate, backyard trails should be constructed using pervious
materials.
      (9)   Using Permeable Paving Materials. These materials include permeable
interlocking concrete paving blocks or porous bituminous concrete. Such
materials should be considered as alternatives to conventional pavement
surfaces, especially for low use surfaces such as driveways, overflow parking
lots, and emergency access roads.
      (10)   Reducing Building Setbacks. Reducing building setbacks reduces
driveway and entry walks and is most readily accomplished along low-traffic
streets where traffic noise is not a problem.
      (11)   Constructing Cluster Developments. Cluster developments can also
reduce the amount of impervious area for a given number of lots. The biggest
savings is in street length, which also will reduce costs of the development.
Cluster development “clusters” the construction activity onto less-sensitive
areas without substantially affecting the gross density of development.
   In summary, careful consideration of the existing topography and
implementation of a combination of the above mentioned techniques may avoid
construction of costly stormwater control measures. Other benefits include:
reduced potential of downstream flooding, reduced water quality degradation of
receiving streams and water bodies, enhancement of aesthetics, and reduction of
development costs. Beneficial results include: more stable baseflows in
receiving streams, improved groundwater recharge, reduced flood flows, reduced
pollutant loads, and reduced costs for conveyance and storage.

Credit 1: DISCONNECTION OF IMPERVIOUS AREA
   When runoff from impervious areas is directed to a pervious area that allows
for infiltration, filtration, and increased time of concentration, all or parts
of the impervious areas may qualify as Disconnected Impervious Area (DIA).
Using the criteria below, determine the portion of the impervious area that can
be excluded from the calculation of total impervious area.
Criteria: An impervious area is considered to be completely or partially
disconnected if it meets the requirements listed below
   (A)   Rooftop area draining to a downspout is 500 sf
   (B)   Paved area draining to a discharge is 1,000 sf
   (C)   Flow path of paved impervious area is not more than 75’
   (D)   Soil at discharge is not designated as hydrologic soil group “D”
   (E)   Flow path at discharge area has a positive slope of 5%
   (F)   Gravel strip or other spreading device is required at paved
discharges.

SMALL PROJECT SWM PLAN WORKSHEET
   Based upon the information you have provided a Stormwater Plan is required
for this development activity. The Stormwater Management Ordinance developed
through the Erie County Stormwater Management Act, 32 P.S. §§ 680.1 et seq.,
regulates compliance requirements for Stormwater Management in this
jurisdiction. A complete copy of the Plan can be found on the Erie County
Planning Department website (http://www.eriecountyplanning.org) which contains
the Model Ordinance.
   Regulated activities shall be conducted only after (municipality) approves a
stormwater management plan. The Erie County Stormwater Management Act, 32 P.S.
§§ 680.1 et seq., will assist you in preparing the necessary information and
plans for (municipality) to review and approve. This document will constitute
an approved plan if all of the relevant details are to be installed in their
entirety AND no part of the stormwater system adversely affects any other
property, nor adversely affect any septic systems or drinking water wells on
this, or any other, parcel. Alternative system proposed require a plan will
need to be submitted to [municipality] for approval. A design by a qualified

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.001 INTENT.
   The intent of this chapter is to:
   (A)   Promote the general health, welfare and safety of the community;
   (B)   Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in
order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future;
   (C)   Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage;
   (D)   Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units and its residents by preventing excessive development in areas subject to
flooding; and
   (E)   Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
(Ord. 1534, passed 3-3-2014)
§ 153.002 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or
corporation to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or
development anywhere within the city unless a permit has been obtained from the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing buildings
or structures.
(Ord. 1534, passed 3-3-2014) Penalty, see §
153.999
§ 153.003 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in
effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance provisions
shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those provisions are
more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of
this chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
(Ord. 1534, passed 3-3-2014)

as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the flood insurance study (FIS) and
the accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) dated February 19, 2014 and
issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), or the most recent
revision thereof, including all digital data developed as part of the flood
insurance study.
   (B)   The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and
amendments are hereby adopted by the city and declared to be a part of this
chapter.
(Ord. 1534, passed 3-3-2014)
§ 153.041 DESCRIPTION AND SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF IDENTIFIED FLOODPLAIN AREAS.
   The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific
areas.
   (A)   The floodway area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without increasing the water surface elevation by more than one foot at any
point. This term shall also include floodway areas which have been identified
in other available studies or sources of information for those special flood
hazard areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
      (1)   Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements or other development shall be permitted
unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed
encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      (2)   Within any floodway area, no new construction or development shall
be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the Department of
Environmental Protection Regional Office.
   (B)   The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations
have been provided.
      (1)   The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for
which base flood elevations have been provided and a floodway has been
delineated.
      (2)   AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE
zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided but no floodway has been determined.
         (a)   No permit shall be granted for any construction, development,
use or activity within any AE Area/District without floodway unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development would not,
together with all other existing and anticipated development, increase the BFE
more than one foot at any point.
         (b)   No new construction or development shall be located within the
area measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse, unless
the appropriate permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection Regional Office.
   (C)   (1)   The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone
on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base flood
elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and floodway
information from other federal, state or other acceptable sources shall be used
when available. Where other acceptable information is not available, the base
flood elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on the
boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction
site.
      (2)   In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional
engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the
technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
Studies, analyses, computations and the like shall be submitted in sufficient
detail to allow a thorough technical review by the municipality.
   (D)   The AO and AH Area/District shall be those areas identified as Zones
AO and AH on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject to inundation by
1% annual chance shallow flooding where average depths are between one and
three feet. In Zones AO and AH, drainage paths shall be established to guide
flood waters around and away from structures on slopes.
(Ord. 1534, passed 3-3-2014)
§ 153.042 CHANGES IN IDENTIFICATION OF AREA.
   The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Council
where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person documents
the need for such revision. However, prior to any such change to the special
flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from FEMA. Additionally, as soon
as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA of the changes to the special
flood hazard area by submitting technical or scientific data. See §
153.055(B) for situations where FEMA notification is required.
(Ord. 1534, passed 3-3-2014)
§ 153.043 BOUNDARY DISPUTES.
   Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the city and any party aggrieved by this
decision or determination may appeal to the Council. The burden of proof shall
be on the appellant.
(Ord. 1534, passed 3-3-2014)
§ 153.044 JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARY CHANGES.
   Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other corporate
boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community shall review
flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary changes. The
community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in areas subject to
annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or exceed those in 44
C.F.R. § 60.3.

arterial street and a minor street, and with vehicular access solely from the
latter.
   RUNOFF. The surface water discharge or rate of discharge of a given
watershed after a fall of rain or snow that does not enter the soil but runs
off the surface of the land.

including the entire right-of-way. Particular types of streets are further
defined as follows:
      (1)   COLLECTOR. This class of road serves the internal traffic movement
within the municipality and connects developed areas with the arterial system.
They do not accommodate long, through trips and are not continuous for any
appreciable length. The principal difference between collector and arterial
roads is the length of trip accommodated. The collector system is intended to
simultaneously supply abutting property with the same degree of land service as
a minor street and accommodate local internal traffic movements.
      (2)   LOCAL OR MINOR. The minor streets sole function is to provide
access to immediately adjacent land. They normally represent a fairly large
percentage of the total street mileage, but carry a small portion of the
vehicle miles traveled daily.
      (3)   MINOR ARTERIAL. Arterials bring traffic to and from the expressway
and serve major movements of traffic within or through the areas not served by
expressways. They serve primarily to move traffic, but also perform a secondary
function of land service.
      (4)   PRINCIPAL ARTERIAL OR EXPRESSWAY. This class of highway facility is
devoted entirely to the task of moving large volumes of traffic and performs
little or no land service function. It is generally characterized by some
degree of access control. Normally, this classification should be reserved for
multi-lane, divided roads with few, if any, grade intersections.
   STREET CENTERLINE. An imaginary line which passes through the middle of the
right-of-way and the cartway simultaneously, or which is in the center of the
right-of-way in cases where the cartway is not centered in the right-of-way.
   STRUCTURE. Any man-made object having an ascentainable stationary location
on or in land or water, whether or not affixed to the land.
   SUBDIVIDER. A developer, upon final approval of a subdivision plat.
   SUBDIVISION. The division or redivision of a lot, tract or parcel of land by
any means into two or more lots, tracts, parcels or other divisions of land
including changes in existing lot lines for the purpose, whether immediate or
future, of lease, transfer of ownership or building or lot development;
provided, however, that the division of land for agricultural purposes into
parcels of more than ten acres, not involving any new street or easement of
access, shall be exempted. The term SUBDIVISION also includes the following:
      (1)   Any development of a parcel of land, (for example, as a shopping
center, an industrial park or a multiple dwelling project), which involves
installation of streets and/or alleys, even though the streets and alleys may
not be dedicated immediately for purposes of conveyance, transfer or sale;
      (2)   Resubdivision and, as appropriate in these regulations, the process
of subdividing land and the land subdivided; and
      (3)   The division of any part, parcel or area of land into two or more
lots irrespective of the length of time which may elapse prior to the time the
second lot or area is created and became existent.
   SUBDIVISION - MAJOR. Any subdivision which is not a minor subdivision.
   SUBDIVISION - MINOR. A subdivision having ten lots or less and which has all
lots fronting on an existing street, and which does not include or require new
sanitary sewer main extensions, or the dedication of streets or alleys.
   SURVEYOR. A professional surveyor licensed as such in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania.
   SWALE. A low lying stretch of land which gathers or carries surface water
runoff, but which is mowable and not a ditch.
   TEMPORARY TURN-AROUND. A temporary circular turn-around at the end of a
road.
   TOPSOIL. Surface soils and subsurface soils which presumable are fertile
soils and soil material, ordinarily rich in organic matter or humus debris.
TOPSOIL is usually found in the uppermost soil layer.
   UTILITY PLAN. A plan to show all existing and proposed fire hydrants, water
and sewer lines, and street lighting.
   WATERCOURSE. A permanent stream, intermittent stream, river, brook, creek,
or a channel, drain, or ditch for water, whether natural or man-made.

PROCEDURES; MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS
§ 154.020 PRE-APPLICATION INVESTIGATION.
   (A)   Developers are urged to discuss possible development sites with city
officials, the County Metropolitan Planning Department, and other agencies as
required, prior to submission of the preliminary plan. The purpose of the pre-
application meeting is to afford the developer an opportunity to avail himself
or herself of available advice and assistance, and to consult early and
informally with the agencies having jurisdiction or responsibilities in land
development or subdivision.
   (B)   The developer may also consult with other parties with a view to
reaching at this initial stage, firm conclusions regarding the suitability of
the location of the proposed subdivision, the most advantageous subdivision
plan, the arrangement of streets, lots and other features of the proposed
development.
   (C)   A sketch plan may be prepared and presented for review and discussion
at the same time. Sketch plans should generally include those items listed
under §§
154.080 through
154.082.

§ 154.021 PRELIMINARY PLAN APPLICATION.
   (A)   The preliminary plan and all information and procedures relating
thereto shall in all respects be in compliance with the applicable provisions
of these regulations when submitted to the Commission. It is the responsibility
of the developer to coordinate his or her plans pursuant to the provisions of
these regulations with all private and public service agencies and utility
companies.
   (B)   All plans shall be reviewed by the Commission and/or city officials
during regular office hours.
   (C)   In addition to filing an application for approval of a preliminary
plan with the Commission, the plan shall also be concurrently submitted to the
Erie Metropolitan Planning Department.
   (D)   Information to be filed with preliminary plans shall generally include
those items listed under §§
154.080 through
154.082, and shall be prepared in accordance with, and submitted with the
number of copies, as specified therein.
(Ord. 1286, passed 6-7-1982)
§ 154.022 APPROVAL OF PRELIMINARY PLAN.
   (A)   After receipt of all required data, the Commission and/or staff will
discuss the preliminary plan with the developer or his or her agent and will
request the developer to obtain a report from the County Department of Health
if on-site sewage disposal and/or on-site individual water supply are planned.
In cases where the subdivision fronts on an existing or proposed state highway
or has proposed streets entering on such highways, the Commission and/or city
may submit the plans to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation for
review.
   (B)   The Commission will then review the plan to determine if it meets the
standards as set forth in these regulations.
   (C)   The Commission and City Council shall review the preliminary plan for
approval to determine its conformity to the design standards and requirements
contained in these regulations. Within five calendar days after this review,
the Commission shall notify, in writing, the developer or his or her agent, the
action taken specifying what changes or additions, if any, will be required
prior to review of the final plan.
   (D)   Any modification of the preliminary plan required as prerequisites to
approval shall be noted on four copies of the preliminary plan. One copy will
be returned to the developer, one will be retained by the Commission and one
will be retained by City Council and the fourth will be filed with the County
Metropolitan Planning Department.
   (E)   Approval of the preliminary plan shall constitute approval of the
subdivision as to the character and intensity of development, the arrangement
and approximate dimensions of streets, lots, and other planned features, but
shall not authorize the sale of lots.
   (F)   The city may issue a building permit for the construction of one
sample home upon approval of the preliminary plan, but is not required to issue
such a permit.
(Ord. 1286, passed 6-7-1982)
§ 154.023 FINAL PLAN APPLICATION.
   (A)   After the developer has received official notification that the
preliminary plan has been approved and what changes, if any, must be made if
the plan is to proceed to consideration as a final plan, he or she has one year
in which to submit a final plan. If he or she does not do so within a one-year
period, the approval of the preliminary plan shall become null and void unless
an extension of time is requested by the developer in writing and is granted in
writing by the Commission before the expiration date.
   (B)   When an extension of time is granted for the submission of a final
plan, the Commission shall do one of two things when the final plan is
submitted:
      (1)   Make a finding that the conditions on which its approval of the
preliminary plan was based have not changed substantially; or
      (2)   Require changes in the plan, prior to final approval, that will
reflect any substantial changes on the site of the subdivision or in its
surroundings, that have taken place since the grant of preliminary approval.
   (C)   It is not necessary for the whole plan that received preliminary
approval to be submitted as a final plan. The final plan may be submitted in
sections, each covering a portion of the entire proposed subdivision shown on
the preliminary plan. Except for the initial preliminary plan stage, the one-
year time limit does not apply.
   (D)   The developer must provide sewerage and water plans for the entire
preliminary plan regardless of the number of lots to be initially developed.
   (E)   If completion of improvements is required prior to receiving final
approval of the plan, the final plan may be given conditional approval. The
plan and design requirements for conditional approval are the same as for final
approval. Upon completion of the required improvements, the conditional plan
may proceed to final plan approval. Upon receiving conditional approval, one
sample home may be constructed, if a building permit has been issued by the
city.
   (F)   The information and plans to be filed with the final application shall
include those items listed under §§
154.080 through
154.082, and the submission shall be prepared in accordance with §§

   (A)   The Commission shall take action and report within 45 calendar days
from the date of submission of the final plan. Otherwise, such plan shall be
deemed to have been approved, and a certificate as to the date of submission of
the final plan for approval to the Commission and the failure of said
Commission to report action thereon within 45 calendar days shall be issued on
demand of the developer or his or her agent by the Commission. The grounds of
modification or of disapproval of any final plan submitted to the Commission
shall be stated on the records of the Commission, and may include the refusal
or failure of the developer to furnish such documents as the Commission may
require pursuant to these regulations, or to comply with such provisions of the
following division as the Commission may have required as prerequisites to
approval of the final plan.
   (B)   Prior to final approval of the plan by the Planning Commission, the
plan shall be submitted by the Commission, together with recommendations, to
City Council for approval. Final approval by the Commission shall not be
granted unless the plan has been approved by City Council.
   (C)   After completion of all procedures and upon approval of a final plan,
the Commission shall notify the subdivider or his or her agent of such actions.
The developer shall then present this plan for the required signatures of the
County Metropolitan Planning Department, the Commission, and the city, and
subsequently be recorded. In no case shall the plan be recorded after 90 days
from the date of the original approval by the city and Commission. Should the
developer fail to record the final plan within such a period, the approval
shall be null and void unless an extension of time is requested in writing by
the developer.

      (2)   Minor subdividers of one lot may be recorded in triplicate on plots
of 8-1/2 x 11 inches in connection with the deed.
   (B)   Recording the final plan after approval shall have the effect of an
irrevocable offer to dedicate all streets and other public ways to public use,
and to dedicate or reserve all park reservations, and school sites and other
public service areas as hereafter provided. Approval shall not impose any duty
upon the city concerning maintenance or improvement of any such dedicated
streets, parks, areas or portions of same until the proper authorities of the
city shall have made actual appropriation of the same by ordinance or
resolution, or by entry, use or improvement.
   (C)   The developer may place a notation on the final plan to the effect
that there is no offer of dedication to the public of certain designated public
areas, or (in unusual circumstances), streets or alleys, in which event the
title to such areas shall remain with the owner, and the city and local
authorities shall assume no responsibility for improvement or maintenance
thereof, which fact shall also be noted on the final plan. Where applicable,
the city shall require a notation on each lot of record that is not suitable
for on-lot septic systems as determined by the County Health Department.

DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 154.095 GENERAL.
   (A)   The following land subdivision principles, standards, and requirements
shall be applied by the Commission in evaluating the plans for proposed
subdivisions and shall be considered minimum requirements.
   (B)   Land shall be suited for the purpose for which it is to be subdivided.
Land subject to hazards of life, health and safety shall not be subdivided
until such hazards have been removed.
   (C)   In reviewing subdivision plans, the Commission will consider the
adequacy of existing or proposed community facilities to serve the additional
dwelling units proposed by the subdivision. A reservation of land for community
facilities may be requested when appropriate.
   (D)   The subdividing of land shall be done in a manner that will not have
the effect of debarring adjacent property owners from access to the street and
ways of the allotment. The Commission may require dedicated, improved or
undedicated parcels to be provided for future access to adjacent land.
(Ord. 1286, passed 6-7-1982)
§ 154.096 STREETS.
   (A)   Minimum street right-of-way widths and cartway widths shall be as
follows:
 
Cartway - Between Curbs
Type of Street         Right-of-Way
Cul-de-sac     26 feet 50 feet
Minor          26 feet 50 feet
Collector      36 feet 60 feet
Arterial       As prescribed by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
               and/or City Council
 
   (B)   In cases where a new subdivision is planned to join the street system
on an existing subdivision, the above requirements shall apply except where the
existing streets and rights-of-way are larger than required. In this event, the
Commission may require that the new streets and rights-of-way be as large as
those in the existing subdivision or the above minimums. Private covenants may
apply if their provisions are in excess of these regulations. Any street or way
that is planned, though not already established shall be continued at not less
than its width as planned.
   (C)   Provisions for additional street width (right-of-way) may be required
by the Commission in specific cases for:
      (1)   Public safety and convenience;
      (2)   Parking in commercial and industrial areas and areas of high
density residential development; and
      (3)   Widening existing streets (rights-of-way) where the width does not
meet with the requirements of these regulations.
   (D)   General design criteria for streets shall be in accordance with the
design and criteria for streets table in this section.
   (E)   Dead end streets (cul-de-sacs) shall be permitted when it is clear
that through traffic at such a street end is not essential to the street system
in that district, and under the said conditions, a dead end must have adequate
turning space foe vehicles, which shall include a minimum right-of-way radius
of 60 feet, and a minimum outside curb radius of 50 feet.
   (F)   Street intersections shall comply with the following requirements:
      (1)   (a)   All curbs at intersections shall be rounded by a minimum
radius of:
            1.   Collector and arterial streets: 25 feet; and
            2.   Minor streets: 20 feet.
         (b)   Twenty-foot radii may be used where minor streets intersect
collector and/or arterial streets.
      (2)   When fences, hedges or other plantings, structures, or walls on any
lot corner would create a traffic hazard by limiting clear vision across a
corner lot from a height of three feet above the ground or paved area, such
structure and/or vegetation shall be removed in conjunction with grading the
right-of-way to provide a sight triange, formed by the intersection of the
center line of each street; sight triangles shall be formed by the connection
of points on the intersecting street centerlines; such points being 80 feet
from the intersection of the centerlines. Trees may be planted in this triangle
area provided the lowest foliage is eight feet or higher. In computing heights,
the street adjacent to the structure, or the ground line at the structure,
whichever is lower, shall be the elevation from which heights are measured.
Sight triangles shall be shown on the plan.
      (3)   Where the grade of any street at the approach to an intersection
exceeds 5%, a leveling area shall be provided, if possible, with a transitional
grade not to exceed 2% for a distance of 50 feet from the nearest curb line of
the intersection.
      (4)   Intersections of more than two streets shall be avoided.
      (5)   Minimum street intersection angles shall be 60 degrees. Right angle
intersections shall be used whenever possible.
      (6)   Intersecting streets shall be separated by 200 feet or more,
measured between centerlines along the centerline of the intersected street.
   (G)   Horizontal curves shall be laid on all deflecting angles along the
centerline of streets and the degree of curvature shall be set to assure the
proper sight distance as shown in the design criteria for streets table in this
section.
   (H)   Vertical curves shall be used in changes of grade exceeding 1% and
shall be designed for maximum visibility.
   (I)   In general, minor and collector streets shall not adjoin into the same
side of arterial streets at intervals of less than 600 feet.
   (J)   Half streets shall be prohibited. If circumstances render this
impractical, adequate provisions for the concurrent dedication of the remaining
half of the street must be furnished by the developer.
   (K)   Minor streets in a new development shall be designed to discourage
through traffic. However, the provisions for the extension and continuation of
major streets into and from adjoining areas is required. Where a subdivision
abuts or contains an existing or proposed major street, the Commission may
require marginal access streets, reverse frontage lots or such treatments as
will provide protection for abutting properties, reduction in the number of
intersections with the major traffic streets, and separation of local and
through traffic.
   (L)   When the subdivision adjoins unsubdivided acreage, new streets shall
be provided through to the boundary lines of the development with temporary
easements for turn-arounds and the construction of graveled 100 foot diameter
turnarounds.
   (M)   Proposed streets shall be properly related to municipal, county, and
state roads and highway plans which have been prepared and officially adopted,
and shall be logically related to the topography so as to produce useable lots
and reasonable grades.
   (N)   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way, an
arterial highway right-of-way or a stream, ravine, steep hill, canal, or swamp,
the Commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side
of such right-of-way or other obstruction at a distance suitable for the
appropriate use of the intervening land. Such distances shall also be
determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future
grade separations, and for non-residential uses of land, where permitted.
   (O)   If the lots in a development are large enough for resubdivision, or if
a portion of the tract is not subdivided, suitable access and street openings
for such resubdivision shall be provided.

§ 154.097 A1LEYS.
   (A)   Alleys are prohibited in developments of detached and semi-detached
houses; they may be permitted in other types of residential development.
   (B)   Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts,
except that the Commission may waive this requirement where other definite and
assured provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading,
unloading and parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed.
   (C)   The right-of-way width of alleys shall be 20 feet and alleys shall be
graded to a minimum width of 18 feet and paved. Maximum grades in alleys shall
be 12%, unless otherwise approved.
   (D)   Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided;
dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable, shall be
provided with adequate turn-around facilities at the dead-end as determined by
the Commission based upon the proposed use of the alley and consideration for
public safety.
(Ord. 1286, passed 6-7-1982) Penalty, see §

except lots along a major thoroughfare which fronts on an interior street.
Block lengths shall not be less than 400 feet.
   (B)   In commercial areas, the block layout shall conform, with due
consideration to site conditions, to the best possible layout to serve the
buying public, to permit good traffic circulation and the parking of cars, to
make delivery and pickup efficient, and to reinforce the best design of the
units in the commercial areas.
   (C)   The block layout in industrial areas shall be governed by the most
efficient arrangement of space for present use and future expansion, with due
regard for worker and customer access parking.
   (D)   In large blocks with interior parks and playgrounds, in exceptionally
long blocks where access to a school and/or shopping center is necessary, or
where cross streets are impractical or unnecessary, a pedestrian right-of-way
at least ten feet wide may be required by the Commission near and through the
center of every block over 1,000 feet long and such right-of-way shall be paved
with a walk at least five feet wide.
   (E)   Cul-de-sacs, in general, shall not exceed 700 feet in length, except
where approved by the Commission to provide for future extension.
(Ord. 1286, passed 6-7-1982) Penalty, see §
154.999
§ 154.099 LOTS AND BUILDING LINES.
   (A)   The depth-to-width ratio of useable lot length shall be a maximum of
four to one, except where unusual conditions exist. Additional land required
for on-lot sewage disposal shall not be deemed as a justification for such
exceptions.
   (B)   Double frontage and reverse frontage lots should be avoided except
where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic
arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. A
planting screen easement across which there shall be no right of access may be
required by the Commission along the line of lots abutting such a traffic
artery or other disadvantageous use.
   (C)   Side lines of lots, so far as practical, shall be at right angles or
radial to street lines.
   (D)   Corner lots shall be increased in size whenever necessary so as to
provide that any structure to be placed thereon shall conform to the minimum
building setback line for a front yard to each street.
   (E)   Lots abutting local streets shall front upon the streets which
parallel the long dimension of the block, if possible.
   (F)   All lots shall abut by their frontage on a publicly dedicated street
or on a street that has received the legal status as such. Lots abutting on a
private street or easement shall not be approved.
   (G)   The frontage width of lots fronting a cul-de-sac will be determined as
the width at the building line, but shall not be less than 40 feet at the
right-of-way line. The side yard setback requirements will be calculated from
the closest point of the structure to the side line.
   (H)   Lot size and area, height regulations, and yard requirements shall be
in accordance with the official city zoning ordinance.
(Ord. 1286, passed 6-7-1982)
§ 154.100 EASEMENTS.
   (A)   Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway,
channel, or stream, a drainage easement may be required that conforms
substantially with the water line of such watercourse, drainageway, channel, or
stream and of such width as will be adequate to preserve the unimped flow of
natural drainage, or for the purpose of widening, deepening, relocating,
improving or protecting such drainage facilities.
   (B)   Where desirable or necessary, adequate easements or dedications for
public service utilities shall be provided for sewer, water, electric power,
gas lines, storm drainage and similar services; and no structure or obstruction
of any kind shall be placed or allowed to be placed where it will interfere in
any way with such easements.
   (C)   Utility easements, where required, shall have a minimum width of 15
feet and be placed at the side or rear of lots whenever possible.
   (D)   Aerial easements, if required, shall commence at a point 15 feet of
more above ground.

§ 154.101 PUBLIC AREAS.
   (A)   The developer shall consider reserved areas for public use where
required, or where topography may preclude use for proper development. Reserve
areas, however, which shall make any area unprofitable for regular or special
assessments or which may revert to untended nuisance areas will not be
approved.
   (B)   The Commission may require that areas for parks and playgrounds (of a
size not to exceed 10% of the land area to be subdivided) be dedicated to the
city for recreation purposes. The city, however, shall retain the right to
accept or decline such dedication. The proposal to dedicate recreation areas in
any proposed subdivision shall be compared with similar existing dedications in
adjoining tracts or subdivisions in order to provide usable recreation areas
where required without imposing hardships on the developer.
(Ord. 1286, passed 6-7-1982)
§ 154.102 STREET NAMES.
   The developer may choose his or her street names subject to the
recommendations of the Commission, and approval of the city and the post
office. No street, other than an extension, may be given a name identical or
similar to another street in the city, or in an adjoining township if proximity
to the township road is close enough to cause confusion.

period.
   (D)   Street mains shall be no less than six inches diameter, and shall have
valves located at all street intersections, except that mains four inches or
less in size may be approved by the city subject to provisions of water rate
and regulation ordinance for cul-de-sacs and other dead end or otherwise non-
extendable areas.
   (E)   Where water mains are extended through or along adjacent property in
other ownership, the costs of construction may be proportionately shared by
abutting properties upon connecting to the water lines, provided that all such
agreements are in accordance with current city ordinances and regulations, and
are approved in writing by the city.
   (F)   Fire hydrants shall be provided where required and shall be located no
more than 1,200 feet apart; and within 600 feet but no closer than 35 feet,
from any structure unless otherwise approved by the city. Where the system is

§ 154.135 STREETS, SUBGRADE, SUBDRAINS, PAVEMENT AND CURBS.
   (A)   Streets shall be graded to the full width of the right-of-way,
surfaced, and improved to the grades and dimensions shown on plans, curbed with
profiles and typical cross-sections submitted by the developer and approved by
the Commission. In subdivisions where sidewalks are not required, the sidewalk
areas shall be graded in the same manner as if sidewalks were to be constructed
and shall be brought to within six inches of final sidewalk grade.
   (B)   Side slopes shall be graded to blend with the natural lay of the land
or in accordance with plans approved by the Commission. Where fill material is
necessary to establish uniform grades, compacting shall be required in
accordance with Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Form 408
Specifications for embankment. A slope of two horizontal feet to one vertical
feet beyond the right-of-way line in cut or fill shall ordinarily be required
except for unusual conditions. Street cross sections for minor and collector
streets shall be in accordance with accepted standards and shall be approved by
the city. Arterial street cross sections shall be as approved by the city and
shall be approved by the state where required.
   (C)   The subgrade shall be shaped to rough lines and elevations equal to
the width of the pavement plus two feet. Adequate drainage facilities shall be
installed to provide for the disposition of underground seepage and the
percolation of surface water. The subgrade shall be thoroughly compacted by
power rollers with a minimum weight of ten tons to ensure satisfactory
compaction and stabilization; it shall be compacted at optimum moisture
content. The finished surface shall be uniformly shaped to facilitate drainage
and any irregularities from planned grade shall be corrected prior to placing
the subbase. Where material encountered in the normal excavation has a C.B.R.
value of 2.5 or less and will not develop the required stability and provide
for adequate drainage, the area shall be undercut and granular material added
to a depth of at least 12 inches. It shall then be brought to a firm and
thoroughly compacted surface as hereinbefore specified. The prepared subgrade
shall be protected by the contractor to prevent undue rutting from trucks or
other equipment and if such damage does occur, the subgrade shall be reshaped
and compacted prior to placing the subbase material.
   (D)   Subdrains shall be laid along one side of all streets where there is
apparent ground water percolation or soils are of an unstable type. Side or
diagonal subdrains shall be installed where conditions require additional
subdrainage. Side drains may require pipe in addition to stone backfill. The
required interval for side drains shall be related to ground water conditions.
The developer shall be fully responsible for proper subdrainage of all street
improvements. The Commission may direct that additional subdrainage be added
where conditions warrant. Subdrains shall generally be drained to storm sewer
catch basins, inlets, or manholes, or to natural drainage channels.
   (E)   In general, all pavement, base, and subbase (where required) shall
conform to the following requirements. It is the intent of these specifications
to designate acceptable quality and any substitutions of materials or methods
must be approved.

locate;

appellant;

character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor

variance that will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulation in issue; and

conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to assure compliance with
the objectives of this chapter.
