   Where, pursuant to § 508(b)(1)(I) and other provisions of Act 98 of 1992, as
amended, the Borough Treasurer issues a certificate indicating that there are
no delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties or user charges against real
property or costs incurred or estimated by the borough for the removal, repair
or securing of a building or other structure on the property, the insuring
agent shall pay the claim of the named insured, provided however, that if the
loss agreed upon by the named insured and the insuring agent equals or exceeds

building restructure, the following procedures must be followed.
   (A)   The insuring agent shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the
designated officer of the borough in the aggregate of $2,000 for each $15,000

   (C)   The transfer of proceeds shall be on pro rata basis by all insuring
agents insuring the building or other structure.
   (D)   After the transfer, the named insured may submit a contractor’s signed

structure, and the designated officer shall return the amount of the funds
transferred to the borough in excess of the estimate and in excess of the
amount of delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties or user charges, to the
named insured, if the borough has not commenced to remove, repair or secure the
building or other structure.
   (E)   Upon receipt of proceeds under this section, the borough shall do the

charges. Such costs shall include, without limitation, any engineering, legal
or administrative costs incurred by the borough in connection with such
removal, repair or securing of the building or any proceedings related thereto;

insured, the designated officer shall contact the named insured, certify that
the proceeds have been received by the borough and notify the named insured
that the procedures under this subsection (E) shall be followed;
      (3)   When repairs, removal or securing of the building or other
structure have been corrected in accordance with all applicable regulations and
orders of the borough and the required proof of such completion received by the
designated officer, and if the borough has not incurred any costs for repairs,
removal or securing and if there are no outstanding delinquent taxes,
assessments, penalties or user charges, the fund shall be returned to the named
insured. If the borough has incurred costs for repairs, removal or securing of
the building or other structure, the costs shall be paid from the fund and if
excess funds remain after payment of outstanding delinquent taxes, assessments,
penalties or user charges, the borough shall transfer the remaining funds to
the named insured; and
      (4)   To the extent interest is earned on proceeds held by the borough
pursuant to this section, and not returned to the named insured, such interest
shall belong to the borough. To the extent that proceeds are returned to the
named insured, interest earned on such proceeds shall be distributed to the
named insured at the time that the proceeds are returned.
   (F)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ability of the
borough to recover any deficiency. Furthermore, nothing in this section shall

   (B)   Requests must be specific enough for the borough to determine what

§ 1-603 BOROUGH’S RESPONSE TO REQUESTS FOR ACCESS.
   (A)   General rule. Upon receipt of a written request for access to a
record, the borough shall make a good faith effort to determine if the record
requested is a public record and to respond as promptly as possible under the
circumstances existing at the time of the request, but shall not exceed five
business days from the date the written request is received by the borough.
Except as set forth in subsection (B) below, if the borough fails to send the
response within five business days of receipt of the written request for
access, the written request for access shall be deemed denied.
   (B)   Exception.
      (1)   Upon receipt of a written request for access, if the borough
determines that one of the following applies:
         (a)   The request for access request requires redaction of a public
record;
         (b)   The request for access requires the retrieval of a record stored
in a remote location.
         (c)   A timely response to the request for access cannot be
accomplished due to bona fide and specific staffing limitations;

regarding access to public records;
         (f)   The requestor refuses to pay applicable fee set forth in this

five business days of the borough’s receipt of the request notifying the
requestor that the request for access is being reviewed, the reason for the
review and a reasonable date that a response is expected to be provided. If the
date that a response is expected to be provided is in excess of 30 days,
following the five business days allowed under subsection (A) above, the
request for access shall be deemed denied.
   (C)   Denial. If the borough’s response is a denial of a written request for
access, whether in whole or in part, a written response shall be issued and
include:
      (1)   A description of the record requested;
      (2)   The specific reasons for the denial, including a citation of

telephone number and signature of the public official or public employee on

      (5)   The procedure to appeal the denial of access under 65 P.S. §§ 66.1
et seq.
§ 1-604 REDACTION.
   If the borough determines that a public record contains information which is
subject to access, as well as information which is not subject to access, the
borough’s response shall grant access to the information which is subject to
access and deny access to the information which is not subject to access. If
the information which is not subject to access is an integral part of the
public record and cannot be separated, the borough shall redact from the public
record the information which is not subject to access and the response shall
grant access to the information which is subject to access. The borough may not
deny access to the public record if the information which is not subject to
public access is able to be redacted. Information which the borough redacts in
accordance with this section shall be deemed a denial under §
1-603(C) of this Part.
§ 1-605 FINAL BOROUGH DETERMINATION.
   (A)   Filing of exceptions. If a written request for access is denied or
deemed denied, the requestor may file exceptions with the Borough Manager/
Secretary of the borough within 15 business days of the mailing date of the
borough’s response or within 15 days of a deemed denial. The exceptions shall
state grounds upon which the requestor asserts that the record is a public
record and shall address any grounds stated by the borough for delaying or
denying the request.
   (B)   Determination. Unless the requestor agrees otherwise, the Borough
Manager/Secretary or his or her designee shall make a final determination
regarding the exceptions within 30 days of the mailing date of the exceptions.
Prior to issuing the final determination regarding the exceptions, the Borough
Manager/Secretary or his or her designee may conduct a hearing. The
determination shall be the final order of the borough. If the Borough Manager/
Secretary or his or her designee determines that the borough correctly denied
the request for access, the Manager/Secretary or his or her designee shall
provide a written explanation to the requestor of the reason for the denial.
§ 1-606 JUDICIAL APPEAL.
   (A)   Filing a petition. Within 30 days of the denial by the borough
pursuant to §
1-603(C) of this Part, or of the mailing date of a final determination of the
borough affirming the denial of access, a requestor may file a petition for
review or other document as might be required by Rule of Court with the Court
of Common Pleas of York County or bring an action in the local magisterial
district. A requestor is entitled to a reasoned decision containing findings of
fact and conclusions of law based upon the evidence as a whole which clearly
and concisely states and explains the rationale for the decisions so that all
can determine why and how a particular result was reached.
   (B)   Notice. The borough shall be served notice of actions commenced in
accordance with subsection (A) above and shall have an opportunity to respond
in accordance with applicable court rules.

may be imposed unless the borough necessarily incurs costs for complying with
the request and such fees must be reasonable. No fee may be imposed for the
borough’s review of a record to determine whether the record is a public record

§ 8-302 DESCRIPTION OF FLOODPLAIN AREAS.
   The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific
areas.
   (A)   FW (Floodway Area). The areas identified as “Floodway” in the AE Zone
in the flood insurance study prepared by the FEMA. The term shall also include
floodway areas which have been identified in other available studies or sources
of information for those floodplain areas where no floodway has been identified
in the flood insurance study. For the purposes of this chapter, the floodway is
based upon the criteria that a certain area within the floodplain would be
capable of carrying the waters of the 100-year flood more than one foot at any
point.
   (B)   FF (Flood-Fringe Area). The remaining portions of the 100-year
floodplain in those areas identified as an AE Zone in the flood insurance
study, where a floodway has been delineated. The basis for the outermost
boundary of this area shall be the 100-year flood elevations as shown in the
flood profiles contained in the flood insurance study.
   (C)   FE (Special Floodplain Area). The areas identified as Zone AE in the
flood insurance study, where 100-year flood elevations have been provided, but
no floodway has been delineated.
   (D)   FA (General Floodplain Area).
      (1)   The areas identified as Zone A in the FIS for which no 100-year
flood elevations have been provided. When available, information from other
federal, state and other acceptable sources shall be used to determine the 100-
year elevation shall be determined by using a point on the boundary of the
identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction site in question.
      (2)   In lieu of the above, the borough may require the applicants to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional
engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the
technical concepts, studies, analyses, computation and the like shall be
submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough, technical review by the
borough.
   (E)   In Zone A, in the absence of FEMA BFE data and floodway data, consider
other available data as basis for elevating residential structures to or above
base flood level, and for floodproofing or elevating nonresidential structures
to or above base flood level.

§ 8-303 CHANGES IN IDENTIFICATION OF AREA.
   The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Borough
Council when studies or other information provided by a qualified agency or
person documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any change to
the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from FEMA.
Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later that six months after the
date such information becomes available, the borough shall notify FEMA of the
changes to the special flood hazard area by submitting technical or scientific
data.

downgrading of the neighborhood with the accompanying diminution of property
values. Such minimum standards shall include, but not be limited to, the
following:
            1.   Equipment and materials relating to commercial or industrial
uses shall not be stored or used at a location visible from the sidewalk,

(including fences) shall be maintained in good repair, and all surfaces thereof
shall be kept painted or otherwise treated when necessary for purposes of
preservation and appearance. The same shall be maintained free of broken glass,
loose shingles, crumbling stone or brick, excessive peeling paint or other
conditions reflective of deterioration or inadequate maintenance, to the end
that the property itself may be preserved, safety and fire hazards eliminated,
and adjoining properties and the neighborhood protected from blighting
influences; and
            5.   All auxiliary structures in residential areas shall be
securely affixed and anchored to a foundation that would prevent said buildings
from being blown from their location by high winds and moved or removed by
vandals.
      (6)   Basements, cellars and crawlspaces are to be free of moisture
resulting from seepage, and cross ventilation shall be required when necessary
to prevent accumulation of moisture; and

Part and to any applicable rules and regulations, and of all corrections made
in response to such requests and complaints. Such records shall be made
available by the owner or other person in charge to the Building Code Inspector
for inspection and copying upon demand. Such records shall be admissible in any
administrative or judicial proceedings pursuant to the provisions of this Part
as prima facie evidence of the violation or the correction of violations of
this Part or applicable rules and regulations pursuant thereto.

residents and visitors has a detrimental effect to citizens of the borough.

to prurient interests. Any writing, recording, pictorial representation or

find that such matter, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest in
sex;
   (B)   The subject matter is depicted or described in a patently offensive
way; and
   (C)   The subject matter taken as a whole lacks serious literary, artistic,
educational or scientific value.
(Ord. 1981-5, passed 9-22-1981)

   The display of any offensive material as defined in this Part by a private
person within his or her own home to his or her family or invitees shall not be
considered an unlawful act. This Part shall not apply to display by any public
library, library of any school, college or university or any archive or library
under the supervision and control of the Commonwealth or its political
subdivisions.
(Ord. 1981-5, passed 9-22-1981)
§ 13-209 SEVERABILITY, INTERPRETATION OF CHANGES OF THE LAW.

found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional, the
remaining provisions of this Part shall remain valid. Should any court of
competent jurisdiction render any decision which shall have the effect of
rendering this Part or portion thereof invalid, the guidelines, standards and
law held by said court as requisite to sustain its validity shall have the
effect of amending this chapter as set forth in such decision.

§ 22-403 PRELIMINARY PLANS, PROCEDURES.
   The following procedures shall be followed in the submission and processing
of preliminary plans for proposed subdivisions and land developments.
   (A)   The developer has the two following alternatives regarding the
submission of a preliminary plan:
      (1)   (a)   In the case of a minor subdivision or land development plan
(as defined), request the Council to waive the requirement that a preliminary
plan be submitted and approved before consideration of a final plan. If the
Council grants the waiver, he or she may begin the final plan preparation and
procedure as required by §§
22-404 and
22-405; and
         (b)   After two minor subdivisions have taken place within any given
tract, the developer shall be required to submit a complete preliminary plan
for the entire tract on the next subsequent application unless the size,
frequency and interrelationships of prior subdivisions clearly do not warrant
such.
      (2)   Prepare a preliminary plan in accordance with the requirements of §
22-402.
   (B)   The developer shall submit the required preliminary plan documentation
and fees to the Borough Secretary at least 15 business days prior to the
regularly scheduled meeting of the Planning Commission.
   (C)   At the next regularly scheduled meeting, the Planning Commission shall
first review the submission in respect to completeness.
      (1)   If the submission is found to be in accordance with the
requirements of this Part the submission shall be accepted with said acceptance
to constitute official plan filing by the developer as of that meeting date,
and the Commission may proceed with plan review.
      (2)   If the submission is found to be incomplete in respect to the
requirements of this Part, the Planning Commission shall suspend review and the
plan shall not be considered as filed. Within five days thereafter, the
Planning Commission shall notify the developer of the additional information
required.
   (D)   Upon the filing of a preliminary plan as determined above, the
Planning Commission shall forward a copy of all documents to the County
Planning Commission for review and report. In addition, the Planning Commission
shall refer the plan to the following as appropriate:
      (1)   Borough Engineer for review of required improvements;
      (2)   Pennsylvania Department of Transportation when the subdivision or
land development will front on an existing or proposed state route or will have
a proposed street requiring access to such a route;
      (3)   Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection for any
necessary report in respect to sewer and water facilities; and
      (4)   York County Conservation District for review in respect to
drainage, erosion and any other related consideration.
   (E)   At a scheduled public meeting the Borough Council shall render its
decision on the preliminary plan and communicate its decision to the applicant
not later than 90 days following the date of the regular meeting of the
borough’s Planning Commission next following the date the application is filed
or after a final order of the court remanding an application, provided that
should said next regular meeting occur more than 30 days following the filing
of the application or the final order of the court, the said 90 day period
shall be measured from the thirtieth day following the day the application has
been filed. The developer or representative should attend the Council and
Planning Commission meetings in order to answer any questions that may arise.
If there are questions, and the developer or representative is not in
attendance, the plan may be tabled or rejected. The decision of the Borough
Council concerning preliminary plan approval shall be in writing and shall be
communicated to the applicant personally or mailed to him or her at his or her
last known address not later than 15 days following the decision.
      (1)   When the plan is not approved in terms as filed, the decision shall
specify the defects found in the plan, shall describe the requirements which
have not been met, and shall cite the sections of these regulations relied
upon.
      (2)   Failure of the Borough Council to render a decision and communicate
it to the applicant within the time and in the manner required herein shall be
deemed as approval of the application in terms as presented unless the
applicant has agreed in writing to an extension of time or change in the
prescribed manner of presentation or communication of the decision, in which
case, failure to meet the extended time or change in manner of presentation or
communication shall have like effect.
   (F)   Approval of the preliminary plan constitutes approval of the proposed
subdivision or land development in respect to the general design, the
approximate dimensions and other planned features. Preliminary approval binds
the developer to the general scheme of the plan as approved and permits the
developer to begin preparation of the final plan. Preliminary approval does not
authorize the recording, sale or transfer of lots nor installation of
improvements.
   (G)   Changes in the ordinance shall affect plats as follows.
      (1)   From the time an application for approval of a plat, whether
preliminary or final, is duly filed as provided in the subdivision and land
development ordinance, and while such application is pending approval or
disapproval, no change or amendment of the zoning, subdivision or other
governing ordinance or plan shall affect the decision on such application
adversely to the applicant and the applicant shall be entitled to a decision in
accordance with the provisions of the governing ordinances or plans as they
stood at the time the application was duly filed. In addition, when a
preliminary application has been duly approved, the applicant shall be entitled
to final approval in accordance with the terms of the approved preliminary
application as hereinafter provided. However, if an application is properly and
finally denied, any subsequent application shall be subject to the intervening
change in governing regulations.
      (2)   When an application for approval of a plat, whether preliminary or
final, has been approved without conditions or approved by the applicant’s
acceptance of conditions, no subsequent change or amendment in the zoning,
subdivision or other governing ordinance or plan shall be applied to affect
adversely the right of the applicant to commence and to complete any aspect of
the approved development in accordance with the terms of such approval within
five years from such approval. The five-year period shall be extended for the
duration of any litigation, including appeals, which prevent the commencement
or completion of the development and for the duration of any sewer or utility
moratorium or prohibition which was imposed subsequent to the filing of an
application for preliminary approval of a plat. In the event of an appeal filed
by any party from the approval or disapproval of a plat, the five-year period
shall be extended by the total time from the date the appeal was filed until a
final order in such matter has been entered and all appeals have been concluded
and any period for filing appeals or requests for reconsideration have expired;
provided, however, that no extension shall be based upon any water or sewer
moratorium which was in effect as of the date of the filing of a preliminary
application. (Amended June 22, 2000, P.L. No.68)
      (3)   Where final approval is preceded by preliminary approval, the
aforesaid five-year period shall be counted from the date of the preliminary
approval. In the case of any doubt as to the terms of a preliminary approval,
the terms shall be construed in the light of the provisions of the governing
ordinances or plans as they stood at the time when the application for such
approval was duly filed.
      (4)   Where the landowner has substantially completed the required
improvements as depicted upon the final plat within the aforesaid five-year
limit, or any extension thereof as may be granted by the governing body, no
change of municipal ordinance or plan enacted subsequent to the date of filing
of the preliminary plat shall modify or revoke any aspect of the approved final
plat pertaining to zoning classification or density, lot, building, street or
utility location.
      (5)   In the case of a preliminary plat calling for the installation of
improvements beyond the five-year period, a schedule shall be filed by the
landowner with the preliminary plat delineating all proposed sections as well
as deadlines within which applications for final plat approval of each section
are intended to be filed. Such schedule shall be updated annually by the
applicant on or before the anniversary of the preliminary plat approval, until
final plat approval of the final section has been granted and any modification
in the aforesaid schedule shall be subject to approval of the governing body in
its discretion.
      (6)   Each section in any residential subdivision or land development,
except for the last section, shall contain a minimum of 25% of the total number
of dwelling units as depicted on the preliminary plan, unless a lesser
percentage is approved by the governing body in its discretion. Provided the
landowner has not defaulted with regard to or violated any of the conditions of
the preliminary plat approval, including compliance with landowner’s aforesaid
schedule of submission of final plats for the various sections, then the
aforesaid protections afforded by substantially completing the improvements
depicted upon the final plat within five years shall apply and for any section
or sections, beyond the initial section, in which the required improvements
have not been substantially completed within said five-year period the
aforesaid protections shall apply for an additional term or terms of three
years from the date of final plat approval for each section.
      (7)   Failure of landowner to adhere to the aforesaid schedule of
submission of final plats for the various sections shall subject any such
section to any and all changes in zoning, subdivision and other governing
ordinance enacted by the municipality subsequent to the date of the initial
preliminary plan submission.

§ 22-405 FINAL PLANS, PROCEDURES.
   The following procedures shall be followed in the submission and processing
of the final plans for proposed subdivision and land developments.
   (A)   The developer shall submit the required final plan documentation and
fees to the Borough Secretary at least 15 business days prior to a regularly
scheduled meeting of the Planning Commission. An application for final plan
approval may be for all land included in the preliminary plan approval or for a
section thereof. If the final plan is to be submitted in sections or phases,
each section or phase in any residential subdivision or land development,
except for the last section or phase, shall contain a minimum of 25% of the
total number of dwelling units as depicted on the preliminary plan, unless a
lesser percentage is approved by the Borough Council after reviewing a written
request from the developer. In such cases, the applicant shall submit a
tentative schedule for the development of the balance of the tract. The final
plan submission requirements as set forth herein and procedures must be
followed for each subsequent section prior to recording and sale or transfer of
lots within such sections.
   (B)   (1)   The filing, review and action upon the final plan shall proceed
in accordance with §
24-403(C), (D), (E) and (F), Preliminary Plan - Procedures, herein. Approval of
the final plan by the Borough Council constitutes final approval of the land
development as to the character and intensity of development, the layout and
the dimensions of streets, lots and other planned features. This approval binds
the developer to the scheme shown on the final plan.
      (2)   Final plan approval authorizes the developer to proceed with the
recording of the final plan which must be accomplished before the developer can
proceed with the sale of any lots or the construction of buildings or
structures.
   (C)   At the time of approval by the Council, the original final plan
drawings shall be made available for authentication and signing by said bodies.
   (D)   Original approved final plans for the subdivision of land not intended
for development shall be clearly marked “NOT APPROVED FOR DEVELOPMENT” and no
permit shall be issued for the erection or placement thereon of any building or
structure intended for human occupancy (residential or otherwise), nor shall
any improvement under the jurisdiction of this chapter be installed thereon,
unless and until appropriate plans and related documents are submitted and
approved in accordance with the requirements of this Part.
   (E)   No changes, erasures, modifications or revisions may be made on any
final plan after having been formally approved by the Council, unless the plan
is first resubmitted to the borough.
(Ord. 178, passed 7-15-1974, Art. IV, § 405; Ord. 1993-1, passed 2-16-1993, §
1; Ord. 1997-03, passed 3-18-1997)
§ 22-406 COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS OR GUARANTEE THEREOF PREREQUISITE TO FINAL
PLAN APPROVAL.
   The following regulations shall apply in respect to the installation and
completion of improvements.
   (A)   Approval. No plan shall be finally approved unless the streets shown
on such plan have been improved as may be required by this Part, and any
walkways, curbs, gutters, street lights, fire hydrants, shade trees, water
mains, sanitary sewers, storm drains and other improvements as may be required
have been installed in accordance with this Part. In lieu of the completion of
any improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a plan, the
developer shall deposit with the Borough Council a corporate bond or other
financial security in an amount sufficient to cover the costs of any
improvements which may be required. Such financial security may include, among
others, a lending institution’s irrevocable letter of credit or a restrictive
or escrow account in a lending institution. Such bond, or other security, shall
provide for, and secure to the public, the completion of any improvements which
may be required. In the case where development is projected over a period of
years, Borough Council may authorize submission of final plans by sections or
stages of development subject to such requirements or guarantees to
improvements in future sections or stages of development as it finds essential
for the protection of any finally approved section of the development.
      (1)   The amount of financial security or bond to be posted for the
completion of the required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost of
the completion estimate as of 90 days following the date scheduled for
completion by the developer.
      (2)   Annually the borough may adjust the amount of financial security by
comparing the actual cost of the improvements which have been completed and the
estimated cost for the completion of the remaining improvements as of the
expiration of the ninetieth day after either the original date scheduled for
completion or a rescheduled date for completion. Subsequent to said adjustment,
the Council may require the developer to post additional security in order to
assure that the financial security equals 110% of the cost of completion. The
procedures for securing the appropriate securities or bonds and related
requirements shall be as outlined in § 509 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code, Act 247, as reenacted and amended, being 53 P.S. §§ 10101 et
seq.
      (3)   If financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion
of improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a plan as set
forth in this section, the borough shall not condition the issuance of
building, grading or other permits relating to the erection or placement of
improvements, including buildings, upon the lots or land as depicted upon the
final plan upon actual completion of the improvements depicted upon the
approved final plan. Moreover, if said financial security has been provided,
occupancy permits for any buildings to be erected shall not be withheld
following the improvement of the streets providing access to and from existing
public roads to such building or buildings to a mud-free or otherwise
permanently passable condition, as well as the completion of all other
improvements as depicted upon the approved plan, either upon the lot or lots or
beyond the lot or lots in question if such improvements are necessary for the
reasonable use of or occupancy of the building or buildings.
   (B)   Notice of intent to initiate improvements. Prior to the initiation of
any required improvement, the developer shall notify the Council, in writing,
by certified or registered mail, five days in advance of the date of the
initiation of such improvement and shall send a copy thereof to the Borough
Engineer. Such notification shall include an estimate of the time required to
complete the improvement. All costs incurred in the inspection of improvements
by the Borough Engineer shall be paid by the developer.
   (C)   Release from improvement bond.
      (1)   When the developer has completed all of the necessary and
appropriate improvements, he or she shall notify the Council, in writing, by
certified or registered mail, of the completion of the aforesaid improvements
and shall send a copy thereof to the Borough Engineer. The Council shall,
within ten days after receipt of such notice, direct and authorize the Borough
Engineer to inspect all of the aforesaid improvements. The Borough Engineer
shall, thereupon, file a report, in writing, with the Council, and shall
promptly mail a copy of the same to the developer by certified or registered
mail. The report shall be made and mailed within 30 days after receipt by the
Borough Engineer of the aforesaid authorization from the Council; said report
shall be detailed and shall indicate approval or rejection of said
improvements, either in whole or in part, and if said improvements, or any
portion thereof, shall not be approved or shall be rejected by the Borough
Engineer, said report shall contain a statement of reasons for such nonapproval
or rejection.
      (2)   The Council shall notify the developer, within 15 days of receipt
of the Borough Engineer’s report, in writing by certified or registered mail,
of the action of the Council with relation thereto.
      (3)   If the Council or the Borough Engineer fail to comply with the time
limitation provisions contained herein, all improvements will be deemed to have
been approved and the developer shall be released from all liability, pursuant
to its performance guaranty bond or other security agreement.
      (4)   If any portion of the said improvements shall not be approved or
shall be rejected by the Council, the developer shall proceed to complete the
same and, upon completion, the same procedure of notification, as outlined
herein, shall be followed:
      (5)   Nothing herein, however, shall be construed in limitation of the
developer’s right to contest or question by legal proceedings or otherwise, any
determination of the Borough Council or the Borough Engineer.
      (6)   Where herein reference is made in this Part to the Borough
Engineer, he or she shall either be a staff employee thereof or be engaged as a
consultant thereto.
      (7)   To cover inspection costs, the developer must pay a fee to be
established by the Borough Council. Any unused portion of this fee will be
refunded to the developer upon completion of the inspections.

§ 22-407 REMEDIES TO EFFECT COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   In the event that any improvements which may be required have not been
installed as provided in this Part or in accordance with the approved final
plan, the Borough Council is hereby granted the power to enforce any corporate
bond, or other security by appropriate legal and equitable remedies. If
proceeds of such bond, or other security are sufficient to pay the cost of
installing or making repairs or corrections to all the improvements covered by
said security, the Borough Council may, at its option, install part of such
improvements in all or part of the subdivision or land development and may
institute appropriate legal or equitable action to recover the monies necessary
to complete the remainder of the improvements. All of the proceeds, whether
resulting from the security or from any legal or equitable action brought
against the developer, or both, shall be used solely for the installation of
the improvements covered by such security, and not for any other purpose.
(Ord. 178, passed 7-15-1974, Art. IV, § 407; Ord. 1993-1, passed 2-16-1993, §
1; Ord. 1997-03, passed 3-18-1997)
§ 22-408 OFFERS OF DEDICATION.
   (A)   The offer to dedicate streets, or other areas or portions of them,
does not impose any duty upon the borough concerning maintenance or improvement
until the proper authorities of the borough have made actual appropriation by
ordinance or resolution or by entry or improvement. No right-of-way, easement,
public grounds, streets or other public improvement shall be accepted by the
borough, authority, utility or other public entity, until such has been
provided and/or installed and approved in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter.
   (B)   If the land is dedicated for a public site and its use for this
purpose is not imminent, the developer may be permitted to dedicate the land
with the privilege of using the surface rights until the borough is ready to
use the land. Such dedication with the temporary privilege of use must be noted
on the final plan.
(Ord. 178, passed 7-15-1974, Art. IV, § 408; Ord. 1993-1, passed 2-16-1993, §
1; Ord. 1997-03, passed 3-18-1997)
§ 22-409 LAND RESERVATION.
   On sites reserved for eventual public acquisition, no building development
is permitted during the period of reservation, said period of time not to
extend more than 18 months without consent of the developer. Such land
reservations shall be noted on the final plan.
(Ord. 178, passed 7-15-1974, Art. IV, § 409; Ord. 1993-1, passed 2-16-1993, §
1; Ord. 1997-03, passed 3-18-1997)
§ 22-410 EFFECT OF PLAN RECORDING ON DEDICATION AND RESERVATION.
   Recording the final plan after approval of the Borough Council has the
effect of an irrevocable offer to:
   (A)   Dedicate all streets and other public ways to public use;
   (B)   Dedicate all public areas to public use; and
   (C)   Reserve for possible future public acquisition such additional areas
as may be required by the borough.

1; Ord. 1997-03, passed 3-18-1997)
§ 22-411 MAINTENANCE GUARANTEE.
   Where the Borough Council accepts dedication of all or some of the required
improvements following completion, the Borough Council may require the posting
of financial security to secure structural integrity of said improvements as
well as the functioning of said improvements in accordance with the design and
specifications as depicted on the final plan for a term not to exceed 18 months
from the date of acceptance of dedication. Said financial security shall be of
the same type as otherwise required in §
22-406 with regard to installation of such improvements, and the amount of the
financial security shall not exceed 15% of the actual cost of installation of
said improvements. Defective improvements include any defect in material or
workmanship that was latent in character and not discernible at the time of
final inspection or acceptance by the borough and/or any damage to improvements
by reason of the settling of ground, base or foundation thereof. However, any
damage to the street surface caused by tire chains, snow removal equipment or
utility cuts by others are not the responsibility of the developer.

1; Ord. 1997-03, passed 3-18-1997)
§ 22-412 RECORDING OF FINAL PLAN.
   Within 90 days after the date of final approval or the date the approval of
the borough is noted on the plan, whichever is later, the final plan shall be
recorded in the office of the Recorder of Deeds of the county. Within ten days
thereafter, the developer shall furnish the Borough Council a Recorder’s
certificate upon a copy of the plan certifying that said plan is properly
recorded. The developer shall also furnish the Council a reproducible copy of
the final plan on a stable base with recording data included.
   (A)   After the subdivision or land development plan is officially recorded,
the streets, public grounds and other public improvements shown thereon shall
be considered a part of the official map of the borough.
   (B)   Streets, public grounds, easements and other public improvements may
be offered for dedication to the borough by formal notation on the final plan.
   (C)   Streets and public grounds shown on a recorded final plan shall be
deemed private until offered for dedication to the borough and accepted by
ordinance or resolution; or until condemned for use by the public.
   (D)   Upon completion of the streets and the like, the developer shall
petition the Council to accept or adopt. If such petition is not presented
within a reasonable time after completion, Council may adopt the streets as
improved on the basis of the offer of dedication on the plan at any time after
30 days notice to the developer.
   (E)   The recording of the plan shall not constitute grounds for assessment
increases until such time as lots are sold or improvements are installed on the
land included within the subject plan.

§ 22-500 GENERAL.
   (A)   Suitability of land. Land subject to hazards of life, health or
property as may arise from fire, floods, severe stormwater runoff, disease or
other dangers shall not be subdivided for development or developed for purposes
susceptible to such hazards unless they have been eliminated or the subdivision
or land development plan provides adequate safeguards against such.
   (B)   Physiography considerations. The standards of this Part may be
increased, or the modification of the design of a proposed subdivision or land
development may be required, on the recommendation of the Borough Engineer and/
or the designated borough planning consultant, when such is deemed necessary as
a result of topographic and other natural or human-made physical features
within or adjoining a particular site to assure public safety, health and
welfare; the provision of public services; and the maintenance of public
facilities.
   (C)   Natural and historic features. Every measure shall be taken to ensure,
insofar as possible, the preservation of natural and historic features, areas
and structures determined to be worthy of such preservation by the Council and
to ensure public access to such where appropriate.
   (D)   Coordination of development.
      (1)   The design of proposed subdivision and land developments shall be
coordinated with existing nearby development and physiography to that the
entire area may be developed harmoniously.
      (2)   Each land development plan shall describe the proposed exterior
building materials, or range of materials, for each building facade that is
visible from a public street, residential district boundary, residence or
residential use. In addition, the following guidelines must be achieved.
         (a)   Long, unbroken facades are discouraged.
         (b)   Deed restrictions shall be imposed to require that at least 50%
of the front facades of buildings that face a public street, residential
district boundary, residence or residential use be constructed of glass and/or
decorative masonry (such as brick). The intent is to allow the use of metal,
cinder block and other materials on the nonpublic street and nonresidential
facades of buildings, and allow 50% on the facades fronting on public streets,
residential districts, residences or residential uses.
         (c)   The front entrances of buildings should be placed relatively
close to a public street to promote pedestrian access.
         (d)   New or expanded loading areas that accommodate two or more
tractor- trailer trucks shall be located and landscaped, or screened by
decorative masonry walls, in a manner that will minimize their visibility from
any public street, residential district or primarily residential use. To the
maximum extent feasible, new loading docks for tractor-trailer trucks shall be
located along the rear facade of buildings along a public street.
      (3)   For the purpose of this subsection (D), the word FACADE shall mean
the front or principle face of a building which faces any public roadway.
Buildings existing on corner lots or other lots facing two or more roadways
shall, for the purpose of this chapter, contain multiple facades, one for each
public roadway for which the building faces.
   (E)   Conformance. The design of proposed subdivisions and land developments
shall conform to applicable borough and county comprehensive plan elements,
applicable development regulation, or official map and to any applicable
regulation of the Commonwealth.
(Ord. 178, passed 7-15-1974, Art. V, § 500; Ord. 1997-03, passed 3-18-1997;
Ord. 2008-3, passed 4-9-2008)
§ 22-501 BLOCKS AND LOTS.
   (A)   General layout.
      (1)   (a)   In general the lengths, depths, and shapes of blocks and lots
must be determined with regard to:
            1.   Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special
need of the type of use contemplated;
            2.   Zoning requirements as to lot sizes, dimensions, yards and
other open areas;
            3.   Needs for convenient access, circulation, control, safety of
street traffic; and
            4.   Limitations and opportunities of topography.
         (b)   Normally, block length may not exceed 1,600 feet nor be less
than 500 feet. In blocks exceeding 1,200 feet in length, a pedestrian crosswalk
having minimum width of ten feet and an all-weather surface at least five feet
wide, shall be provided. Blocks shall be wide enough for two tiers of lots,
except where reverse frontage lots are necessary and in the case of “cluster”
layouts.
      (2)   In nonresidential areas, the block and lot layout must be designed
with consideration of site conditions:
         (a)   To permit the most efficient arrangement of space for present
use and future expansion; and
         (b)   To permit adequate, safe worker and patron access, circulation
and parking as well as loading and unloading.
   (B)   Access.
      (1)   Every lot shall abut a public street.
      (2)   No lot may have a primary access onto an alley or street with a
cartway width less than 20 feet.
   (C)   Through lots. Double frontage lots shall not be platted, except that
where desired along limited access and other arterial highways, lots may face
on an interior street and back on such thoroughfares to which direct access
shall not be permitted.
   (D)   Lot lines. Lot lines shall be approximately at right angles or radial
to the street line so long as reasonably shaped lots result.
   (E)   Corner lots. Corner lots shall be proportionally larger than other
lots in order to meet required building setbacks from both streets and such
shall be provided with radius corners or diagonal cutoffs substantially
concentric with or parallel to the chord of the required cartway radius
corners.
   (F)   Building setback lines. The building setback lines shall conform to
the requirements of the borough zoning ordinance (
Chapter 27 of this code of ordinances) provided, however, that no building line
shall be less than 60 feet from the centerline of any existing street
classified as a collector under the borough’s comprehensive plan, which is a
component of the Northern York County Regional Plan. The straight alignment of
dwellings along established minimum setback lines is not recommended,
therefore, varying setbacks shall be encouraged.
   (G)   Street address. Address numbers shall be assigned to each lot by the
Borough Manager in accordance with Chapter 4, Buildings, Part 1, §
4-101.
(Ord. 178, passed 7-15-1974, Art. V § 501; Ord. 1997-03, passed 3-18-1997)
§ 22-502 STREETS, CURBS AND SIDEWALKS.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   Proposed streets shall be planned with regard to topographic
conditions (diagonally across contours where slopes are steep); public safety
and convenience in terms of vehicular and pedestrian movement, maintenance, and
fire protection; probable traffic volumes; and existing and proposed uses of
land on abutting properties.
      (2)   The proposed street system shall extend existing or recorded
streets at the same width, but in no case at less than the required minimum
width.
      (3)   Where, in the opinion of the Council, it is desirable to provide
for street access to adjoining property, streets shall be extended by
dedication to the boundary of such property.
      (4)   New minor streets shall be so designed as to discourage through
traffic, but the developer shall give adequate consideration to provisions for
the extension and continuation of major and collector streets into and from
adjoining properties.
      (5)   Where a subdivision or land development abuts or is traversed by an
existing street of improper width or alignment, the dedication of land
sufficient to widen the street or correct the alignment is recommended.
      (6)   Private streets (streets not to be offered for dedication) are
prohibited.
      (7)   Whenever the proposed subdivision or land development contains or
is adjacent to an arterial highway, provision for a marginal access street may
be required. Rear service alleys, reverse frontage lots or such other treatment
which will provide protection for abutting properties, reduction in the number
of intersections with major streets, and separation of local and through
traffic may also be required.
      (8)   Where the lots in a subdivision are large enough for resubdivision,
or where a portion of tract is not subdivided, suitable access to these areas
shall be provided.
      (9)   Proposed streets which are aligned with existing streets shall bear
the name of the existing street. In the event a proposed street is not aligned
with an existing street, it shall not bear a name similar to any existing
street located within the municipality and/or the same postal service area,
irrespective of the suffix: street, avenue, boulevard, drive, place, court and
the like.
      (10)   Dead-end streets shall be prohibited, except when designed and
constructed as permanent cul-de-sac streets, or as stubs to permit future
street extension into adjoining tracts (in such cases, a temporary turn-around
having at least a stabilized surface and an outside diameter of 80 feet shall
be provided). In the design and construction of such streets, an area for snow
disposal must be provided. Alternative designs to the circular cul-de-sac
turnaround will be considered, provided that they meet the requirements of Act
655, being 53 P.S. §§ 10101 et seq. for obtaining liquid fuels tax allocations.
      (11)   Half or partial streets are permitted only where needed to
complete existing half streets.
      (12)   Reserve strips, including those controlling access to streets, are
prohibited except along legal limited access thoroughfares or along other
arterial streets when approved by the borough.
      (13)   Design standards for arterial streets are to be determined after
consultation with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. In any case
the design criteria for such streets shall not be less than as required herein
for collector streets.

require additional depth of materials or to deviate from type of material
specified where, in the opinion of the Borough Engineer, it is necessary to
withstand projected traffic loads or adverse environmental conditions.
      (4)   Binder. When required by the borough to protect the pavement course
from potential excessive damage, the wearing course shall only be applied
following improvement of 80% of the lots which the street will service or as
otherwise determined by the Borough Engineer. In this case, the borough may
require an alternate type of binder course to be used.
      (5)   Subsurface drainage systems. The borough may, when deemed necessary
by the Borough Engineer, require the installation of subsurface drainage
systems which may consist of subgrade and/or subbase drains. Construction

collection and/or disposal of stormwater, the Council shall review the design
of such in relation to adequacy, safety, erosion and stagnation.
         (a)   Prior written agreements shall be obtained by the developer for
any drainage ways (or storm sewers) which are to discharge upon another
property from the affected adjoining owners.
         (b)   Easements of sufficient width shall be established for any
drainageway not located within a public right-of-way.
   (D)   Utility line installation. Electric, telephone and all other utility
facilities shall be installed underground unless in the opinion of the Borough
Council special conditions require otherwise. The subdivider shall also be
required, prior to borough approval, to obtain a letter from the appropriate
public utility confirming that the subdivider has entered into an agreement to
provide for an underground electric system in accordance with the Pennsylvania
Public Utility Commission Investigation Docket #99, as amended from time to
time, or has obtained a waiver from said Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission
to allow overhead electric facilities.
   (E)   Utility easements.
      (1)   Width; location. When easements are required for any utility
serving a subdivision or land development, they must be a minimum of 25 feet
wide for underground utility lines and 20 feet wide for others, and must, to
the fullest extent possible, be adjacent to, or centered on, rear or side lot
lines.
      (2)   Gas lines. All gas lines must be installed in compliance with all
applicable federal, state and local codes. The minimum distance from a natural
gas line to a dwelling unit or other structure must be as required by the
applicable transmission or distributing company.

§ 22-505 LOCAL RECREATION SITES.
   In any proposal that will result in the creation of five or more new
dwelling units, the applicant or developer shall either dedicate land to the
borough, reserve land for private recreational facilities that will be
permanently devoted to recreation and adequately secured for such use,
construct recreation facilities, pay a fee in lieu of dedication or
construction, or provide some combination thereof for recreational purposes, in
accordance with the following standards.
   (A)   The land to be dedicated or reserved must be of suitable size,
dimension, topography, access, location and general character for the proposed
use. Such land shall also be readily accessible to all existing and proposed
inhabitants of the development.
   (B)   The amount of land to be dedicated or reserved shall be not less than
0.05 acres per dwelling unit as determined on the final subdivision or land
development plan.
   (C)   Where the application of the area standards of subsection (B) above
would result in a site too small to be useable, or where there is not an
identified need for additional land for recreational purposes in the area of
the borough in which the subdivision or land development is located, or where
the applicant and Borough Council agree for any other reason, the applicant or
developer shall pay to the borough a fee per dwelling unit established annually
by resolution of the Borough Council for the purpose of providing park or
recreational facilities accessible to the development.
   (D)   In lieu of such fees, the applicant and Borough Council may agree that
the applicant will construct recreational facilities at an existing borough
recreational site accessible to the development. The applicant and the Borough
Council may also agree in a written agreement, upon any combination of
dedication of site, construction of facilities and/or payment of a fee that
will meet the intent of the Northern York County Regional Plan; the 2005
Carroll Township/Dillsburg Borough Comprehensive Recreation, Park, and Open
Space Plan; and this chapter.
   (E)   The fee in lieu of dedication or facilities to be constructed shall be
substantially equal in value to the value of the land that would be dedicated
if the standards of subsection (B) above were applied and shall be based on the
prevailing average value of development land in the borough.
   (F)   A fee established by this section shall be paid to the borough prior
to recording of the final plan. Such fee, upon its receipt by the borough,
shall be deposited in an interesting bearing account, clearly identifying the
specific recreational facilities for which the fee was received. The interest
earned on the account shall become funds of that account. Funds from such
account shall be expended only in properly allocable portions of the cost
incurred to construct the specific recreation facilities for which the funds
were collected.
   (G)   Funds collected under this section shall be expended within three
years of the date of receipt, or the borough shall refund such fee, together
with interest accumulated thereon, to the developer who remitted that payment,
upon receipt from the developer of a written request for refund.
(Ord. 178, passed 7-15-1974, Art. V, § 505; Ord. 1993-6, passed 10-19-1993, §
13; Ord. 1997-03, passed 3-18-1997)
§ 22-506 SITE PLANNING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Accessibility. Generally, the development of sites not located on a
public thoroughfare of sufficient width and alignment in respect to the traffic
to be generated is discouraged. When proposed subdivisions or land developments
are not located directly upon an adequate thoroughfare, the developer may be
required to participate with the borough, through negotiation, in the
improvement of the service road between the site and the nearest adequate
thoroughfare as a condition precedent to final plan approval. Where necessary
to access to public or common land, a pedestrian and/or limited use vehicular
easement shall be provided with a width of no less than ten feet for pedestrian
and no less than 12 feet for vehicular traffic. Additional width may be
required by the borough depending upon the purpose and use of the easement.
   (B)   Grading. In order to provide more suitable sites for building and
other uses, improve surface drainage and control erosion, the following
requirements shall be met.
      (1)   All lots, tracts or parcels shall be graded to provide proper
drainage away from buildings and dispose of the runoff without ponding, and all
land within a development shall be graded to drain and dispose of surface water
without ponding, except where other arrangements are approved by the Council.
      (2)   All drainage provisions shall be of such design to adequately
handle the surface runoff and carry it to the nearest suitable outlet such as a
curbed street, storm drain or natural watercourse. Where drainage swales are
used to divert surface waters away from buildings, they shall be sodded or
planted and shall be of such slope, shape and size as to conform with the
requirements of the borough.
      (3)   Concentration of surface water runoff shall only be permitted in
swales or watercourses.
      (4)   Excavations and fills.
         (a)   Cut and fill slopes shall not be steeper than 2:1 for cuts and
3:1 for fills (horizontal:vertical). A steeper slope may be permitted for
special conditions, if stabilized by a retaining wall or cribbing and approved
by the Borough Engineer.
         (b)   Adequate provisions shall be made to prevent surface water from
damaging the cut face of excavations or the sloping surfaces of fills.
         (c)   Cut and fills shall not endanger adjoining property.
         (d)   Fill shall be placed and compacted so as to minimize sliding or
erosion of the soil.
         (e)   Fills shall not encroach on natural watercourses or constructed
channels.
         (f)   Fills placed adjacent to natural watercourses or constructed
channels shall have suitable protection against erosion during periods of
flooding.
      (5)   Grading will not be done in such a way so as to divert water onto
the property of another landowner without the expressed consent of the borough
and the affected landowner.
      (6)   During grading operations, necessary measures for dust control will
be exercised.
      (7)   Top soil shall be preserved and redistributed as cover and shall be
expeditiously planted with perennial grass or ground cover.
      (8)   Tree guards during construction and grading, and limitations as to
cuts and fills, both temporary and permanent near trees shall be provided as
necessary to give reasonable assurance of their continued healthy growth.
      (9)   Grading equipment will not be allowed to cross live streams.
Provision will be made for the installation of culverts or bridges.
   (C)   Pedestrian circulation.
      (1)   Pedestrian walkways shall be physically separated from all streets
and, insofar as possible, from vehicle circulation ways within nonresidential
developments.
      (2)   Parking lots shall be designed so as to minimize the necessity for
pedestrians to walk within and across vehicle circulation ways.
      (3)   Commercial developments should be designed so as to allow
pedestrians to browse and pause in areas removed and otherwise protected from
vehicular circulation and parking areas.
      (4)   Insofar as possible, common open areas and other residential
service areas shall be located at the interior of dwelling sites to minimize
the necessity for pedestrians to cross streets.
   (D)   Storage areas.
      (1)   Outdoor storage areas of any type should be located to the rear of
structures and should be screened by natural vegetation or fencing.
      (2)   In group developments, it is recommended that remote, screened
storage areas be provided for items infrequently used such as recreation
vehicles.
   (E)   Structure orientation.
      (1)   Structure sites should be grouped whenever possible as such
provides larger, more usable open space without decreasing the overall density
of development.
      (2)   Extra building setbacks are recommended at all street intersections
in order to increase sight distances and to make the presence of an
intersection more apparent.
      (3)   Insofar as possible, commercial structures should be relatively
central in respect to their parking areas in order to minimize requiring
walking distance for safety and convenience. (Protected pedestrian accessways
shall be provided in commercial developments adjacent to residential
neighborhoods.)
   (F)   Vegetation.
      (1)   Conservations. Development shall be planned so as to minimize the
removal of existing trees, shrubs and ground cover and to minimize the amount
of land covered by structures and paving.
      (2)   Noise control. Street trees along arterial and collector streets in
residential areas are recommended to absorb traffic noise.
      (3)   Screening. Wherever natural screening is being provided to meet a
screening requirement of the borough zoning ordinance (Chapter 27 of this code
of ordinances) such shall consist of 50% evergreen or evergreen type hedges and
50% shrubs interplanted and of a variety and size at the time of planting that
such will attain a height of at least six feet within three years thereafter
and spaced at intervals of not more than four feet. Furthermore, subdivision
and land development plans shall provide such screening:
         (a)   Where commercial or industrial uses abut residential uses;
         (b)   Where residential uses abut any railroad or limited access
highway, or any other arterial highway in the case of reverse frontage or where
marginal or rear access is provided;
         (c)   Around all open sides of any common utility yard and any outdoor
equipment or refuse storage area in group residential developments; and
         (d)   Elsewhere as deemed necessary by the Council.
      (4)   Windbreaks. The use of planting rows to serve as windbreaks to
control the drifting of snow across public and private thoroughfares as well as
for general comfort is recommended.
      (5)   Street trees. Street trees of a caliper not less than one and one-
half inches shall be planted 40 to 60 feet apart. The location of street trees
shall be as deemed, appropriate by the Council but in no case shall be planted
within the right-of-way. The provision of street trees may be waived where, in
the opinion of the Council, sufficient trees exist and will remain. In no
circumstances will any of the following trees be permitted either to remain or
to be planted as street trees:
         (a)   Poplars; all varieties;
         (b)   Willows; all varieties;
         (c)   White or silver maple (Acer Saccharinum);
         (d)   Aspen; all varieties;
         (e)   Common black locust;
         (f)   Norway spruce; and
         (g)   Bradford pear.
      (6)   Obstructions to vision. No bushes or shrubs exceeding 30 inches in
height, or at such lesser height which due to ground elevations would obstruct
the vision of motorists, shall be permitted within any required clear-sight-
triangle nor within ten feet of the right-of-way line adjacent to access
drives.
   (G)   Vehicles provisions.
      (1)   Driveway/access drives. Whenever required and/or provided under the
provisions of this chapter or the borough zoning ordinance (Chapter 27 of this
code of ordinances), all driveways/access drives shall be designed according to
the following standards.
         (a)   Layout. Except in the case of single-family and two-family
dwellings, the general layout shall be such that there will be no need for
motorists to back into public rights-of-way.
         (b)   Width. Access drives for multi-family dwellings and
nonresidential uses shall not be less than 18 feet in width nor exceed 35 feet
in width within 12 feet of the street right-of-way line, excepting as increased
by the curb radii.
         (c)   Surfacing. All driveways/access drives shall be paved with a
concrete or bituminous paving material.
         (d)   Number. The number of driveways/access drives shall not exceed
one per lot on any street frontage. The Council may grant permission for
additional driveways/access drives where required to meet exceptional
circumstances and where frontage of unusual length exists.
         (e)   Location. Driveways/access drives shall not cross the street
right-of-way lines:
            1.   Within 40 feet of the street right-of-way line of an
intersecting street and in no case less than ten feet from the point of
tangency when the intersecting street lines are joined by a curve. When deemed
reasonably necessary for safety by the Council, this dimension shall be
increased for access drives to shopping centers, other commercial, industrial,
public or institutional uses. Such access drives shall be located on major
streets when practical, in a manner to permit safe ingress and egress;
            2.   Within ten feet of a fire hydrant, catch basin or drain inlet;
            3.   Within 40 feet of another driveway/access drive; and
            4.   Within three feet of a property line unless two adjoining
owners mutually agree to a common driveway/access drive.
         (f)   General safety requirement. Access to the public highway or
street shall be controlled in the interest of public safety. Off-street
parking, loading and service areas on all properties used for purposes other
than single-family residences shall be physically separated from the highway or
street by a curb, pipe rail, or fence and a planting strip.
         (g)   Sight distance. Driveways/access drives shall be located in safe
relationship to sight distance and barriers to vision, and shall not exceed a
slope of 7% within 12 feet of the street right-of-way line. Where driveways/
access drives enter a bank through a cut, unless a retaining wall is used, the
side slopes of the cut shall be graded to not more than one-half foot vertical
to one foot horizontal within ten feet of the point the driveway/access drive
intersects with the right-of-way line.
      (2)   Off-street parking facilities. Whenever required and/or provided
under the provisions of this chapter or the borough zoning ordinance (Chapter
27 of this code of ordinances), all off-street parking facilities shall be
designed according to the following standards.
         (a)   Size. All parking spaces shall be ample in size for the vehicles
for which use is intended; however, each parking space per vehicle shall be not
less than ten feet wide and 20 feet long. Such outdoor spaces shall be deemed
to be part of the open space of the lot on which it is located. Where five or
more parking spaces are required or provided, the total parking area, including
access drives and interior aisles, must average 300 square feet of gross
parking area per parking space.
         (b)   Surfacing. All off-street parking areas, service drives and
access drives shall be paved with a concrete or bituminous paving material,
shall be graded for proper drainage, shall be stabilized sufficiently to
accommodate the anticipated traffic, and shall be so arranged as to provide for
orderly and safe parking and storage of self-propelled vehicles.
         (c)   Lighting. Adequate lighting shall be provided if the parking
area is to be used after-dark. Any lighting used to illuminate an off-street
parking area shall be so arranged as to reflect the light away from adjoining
residential use premises, as well as away from vehicles moving upon a public
thoroughfare. There shall be no more than 0.25 foot candles shining off the
site, as measured vertically between five and ten feet off the ground.
      (3)   Off-street loading and unloading facilities. Whenever required and/
or provided under the provisions of this chapter or the borough zoning
ordinance (Chapter 27 of this code of ordinances), all off-street loading and
unloading facilities shall be designed according to the following standards.
         (a)   Size. The minimum size of the loading and unloading space shall
be 50 feet in depth, 12 feet in width, with an overhead clearance of 14 feet.
         (b)   Surfacing and lighting. As per subsection (G)(2)(c) above.

   (A)   It shall be the duty of the Borough Council or the duly authorized
representative of the Borough Council to enforce the provisions of this
chapter. The Enforcement Officer shall require that the application for a
building permit contain all information necessary to enable him or her to
ascertain whether the proposed building, alteration or use is located in an
approved land development.
   (B)   (1)   The borough or its zoning or building permit officer may refuse
to issue any permit or grant any approval necessary to further improve or
develop any real property which has developed or which has resulted from a
subdivision of real property in violation of this chapter. This authority to
deny such a permit or approval shall apply to any of the following applicants:
         (a)   The owner of record at the time of violation;
         (b)   The vendee or lessee of the owner of record at the time of such
violation without regard as to whether such vendee or lessee had actual or
constructive knowledge of the violation;
         (c)   The current owner of record who acquired the property subsequent
to the time of violation without regard as to whether such current owner had
actual or constructive knowledge of the violation; and
         (d)   The vendee or lessee of the current owner of record who acquired
the property subsequent to the time of violation without regard as to whether
such vendee or lessee had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
      (2)   As an additional condition for issuance of a permit or granting of
an approval to any such owner, current owner, vendee or lessee for the
development of any such real property, the applicant shall comply with the
conditions that would have been applicable to the property at the time he or
she acquired an interest in the real property.
   (C)   In addition to other remedies, the borough may institute and maintain
appropriate actions by law or in equity to restrain, correct or abate
violations, to prevent unlawful construction, to recover damages and to prevent
illegal occupancy of a building, structure of premises. The description by
metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other documents used in the
process of selling or transferring land shall not exempt the seller or
transferor from such penalties or from the remedies provided in this chapter.

before magisterial district judge, pay a judgment of not more than $500 plus
all court costs, including reasonable attorney fees incurred by the borough as
a result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or be
payable until the date of determination of a violation by the magisterial
district judge. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment,
the borough may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil
procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate
violation, unless magisterial district judge determines that there was a good
faith basis for the person, partnership or corporation violating the ordinance
to have believed that there was no such violation, in which case there shall be
deemed to have been only one such violation until the fifth day following the
date of the determination of a violation by a magisterial district judge and
thereafter each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate
violation. All fines collected for such violations shall be paid over to the
borough.

taxpayer.
(Ord. 2011-4, passed 11-7-2011)
§ 24-105 DECLARATION AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)   Application.

the current year, shall, within 30 days after the discontinuance of business,

make the deductions required by this section shall be liable for payment of the
taxes which the employer is required to withhold to the extent that such taxes

      (2)   The declaration or return has been filed; or
      (3)   A redetermination of compensation or net profits by the
Pennsylvania Department of Revenue whichever date is later; provided, however,

the collection schedule shall become effective upon adoption by the TCC. The

(Ord. 2011-4, passed 11-7-2011)
§ 24-112 APPLICABILITY.
   This Part shall not apply to any person or property as to whom or which it
is beyond the legal power of the municipality to levy, assess and impose the
tax or duties as herein provided.
(Ord. 2011-4, passed 11-7-2011)
§ 24-113 SEVERABILITY.
   The provisions of the Part are severable and if any of its provisions are
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or
unconstitutional, such determination shall not affect or impair any of the
remaining provisions of this Part. It is hereby declared to be the intention of
the Borough Council that this Part would have been adopted is such invalid or
unconstitutional provision had not been included.
(Ord. 2011-4, passed 11-7-2011)
§ 24-114 PURPOSE/AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT/REPEAL.
   The primary purpose of this Part is to conform the local income tax
currently levied on earned income and net profits by the municipality with the
Act and to do so within the time frame set forth in the Act. Any prior
ordinance levying such tax is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to
read as set forth in this Part. To the extent that any previous ordinance or
portion thereof is inconsistent or conflicts with this Part, such ordinance(s)
or portion thereof shall be repealed to the extent of such inconsistency and/or
conflict. To the extent the same or any prior ordinance levying such tax in
force immediately prior to enactment of this Part, this Part is intended as a
continuation of such prior ordinance and not as the enactment of an ordinance
imposing a new tax. In the event this Part or any portion thereof is determined
to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, the prior ordinance, or portion
thereof, levying a similar tax shall remain in full force and effect and shall
not be affected by the adoption of this Part. Nothing contained herein shall
affect, impair or otherwise abrogate any act done or liability incurred, nor
shall any provision of this Part affect, impair or preclude any suit or
prosecution pending, whether or not currently initiated, to enforce any right,
penalty or violation under the authority of any previous ordinance in force
prior to adoption of this Part.

prescribed in the Local Tax Enabling Act, Act of December 31, 1965, P.L. 1257,
53 P.S. §§ 6924.101 et seq., so that if any other political subdivision shall
impose or hereafter shall impose such tax on the same person or transfer then
the tax levied by the Borough Council under the authority of that Act shall
during the time such duplication of the tax exists, except as hereinafter
otherwise provided, be one-half of the rate and such one-half shall become
effective without any action on the part of the Borough Council provided,
however, that the borough and any other political subdivision which impose such
tax on the same person or transfer may agree that, instead of limiting their
respective rates to one-half of the rate herein provided, they will impose
respectively different rates, the total of which shall not exceed the maximum
rate permitted under the Local Tax Enabling Act.

in effect at the time the tax is due, shall be added and collected.

agencies or political subdivisions shall be exempt from payment of the tax
imposed by this Part. The exemption of such governmental bodies shall not,

pursuant to acquisition by the municipality, township, school district or
county of a tax delinquent property at sheriff sale or tax claim bureau sale;

confirms a transfer previously recorded, but which does not extend or limit
existing record legal title or interest;

consideration of property passed by testate or intestate succession and held by
co-tenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in value than

presented with a copy of the trust instrument that clearly identifies the
grantor and all possible beneficiaries;

PARTNERS, STOCKHOLDERS OR SHAREHOLDERS THEREOF.
   Except as otherwise provided in § 24-306, documents which make, confirm or
evidence any transfer or demise of title to real estate between associations or

transferred by the deed which is the subject of the tax imposed, assessed and
levied by this Part, said lien to begin at the time when the tax under this
Part is due and payable, and continue until discharged by payment, or in

the person’s employer affirming that the person reasonably expects to receive
earned income and net profits from all sources within the political subdivision
of less than $12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate
is filed.
   (E)   The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of all of
the employee’s last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment within the political
subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year for which the employee is
requesting to be exempted from the local services tax.
   (F)   Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise
instructed by the Collector of the tax for the political subdivision levying
the tax the employer shall not withhold the tax from the person during the
calendar year or remainder of the calendar year for which the exemption
certificate applies. With respect to a person who claimed an exemption from the
local services tax, upon notification to an employer by the person or by the
Collector of the tax for the political subdivision, that the person has
received earned income and net profits from all sources within that political
subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or that the
person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that calendar year, or
upon an employer’s payment to the person of earned income within that political
subdivision in an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar
year, an employer shall withhold the local services tax from the person as
follows:
      (1)   If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year from
the local services tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year, the
employer shall withhold the tax for the remainder of that calendar year;
      (2)   The employer shall withhold from the person, for the first payroll
period after receipt of the notification under subsection (F)(1) above, a lump
sum equal to the amount of the tax that was not withheld from the person due to
the exemption certificate filed by the person, plus the per payroll amount due
for that first payroll period;
      (3)   The amount of tax withheld per payroll period for the remaining
payroll periods in that calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for
other employees; and
      (4)   In the event the employment of a person subject to withholding of
the local services tax under this exception is severed in that calendar year,
the person shall be liable for any outstanding balance of tax due and the
political subdivision levying the tax may pursue collection under this Act.
   (G)   Employers shall not be responsible for investigating exemption
certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or exempting any employee
from a local services tax.
   (H)   Employers shall be responsible for retaining a copy of all exemption
certificates filed by employees within a given calendar year for a minimum of
three years. Employers who have failed to withhold the local services tax from
an employee or employees, and do not have copies of the employee exemption
certificate or certificates, will be held responsible for the payment of the
local services tax as if the tax had been originally levied against the
employer.

ARTICLE I: GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 26-101 SHORT TITLE.
   This Part shall be known and may be cited as the “Dillsburg Borough
Stormwater Management Ordinance”.
(Ord. 2011-2, passed 10-11-2011)
§ 26-102 STATEMENT OF FINDINGS.
   The governing body of the borough finds that:
   (A)   Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flows and velocities,
contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of
streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public facilities to
carry and control stormwater, undermines floodplain management and flood
control efforts in downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge,
threatens public health and safety, and increases non-point source pollution of
water resources;
   (B)   A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including reasonable
regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff, is
fundamental to the public health, safety and welfare and the protection of
people of the Commonwealth, their resources, and the environment;
   (C)   Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides groundwater
recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams, which also protects and
maintains surface water quality; and
   (D)   Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are required
to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer
systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES).
(Ord. 2011-2, passed 10-11-2011)
§ 26-103 PURPOSE.
   This Part was created pursuant to and under the authority of the Borough
Code. The purpose of this Part is to minimize the harm and maximize the
benefits described in §
26-102 of this Part, through provisions designed to:
   (A)   Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim and restore the
existing and designated uses of the waters of this Commonwealth;
   (B)   Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible;
   (C)   Manage stormwater runoff close to the source;
   (D)   Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater planning
and management;
   (E)   Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and
groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources;
   (F)   Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and stream beds;
   (G)   Provide proper operation and maintenance of all SWM BMPs that are
implemented within the municipality; and
   (H)   Require proof of NPDES permit acquisition when applicable.

erosion sedimentation control plan that has been deemed adequate by York County
Conservation District and/or DEP.
   (E)   For all regulated activities, implementation of the volume controls in
§
26-303 is required, unless specifically exempted under subsection (C) above, or
exempted by an approved modification request as specified in §
26-403(B) of this Part.
   (F)   Impervious areas.
      (1)   The measurement of impervious areas shall include all of the
impervious areas in the total proposed development even if development is to
take place in phases.
      (2)   For development taking place in phases, the entire development plan
must be used in determining conformance with this Part.
      (3)   For projects that add impervious area to a parcel, the total
impervious area on the parcel is subject to the requirements of this Part;
except that the volume controls in §
26-303 and the peak rate controls of §
26-304 do not need to be retrofitted to existing impervious areas that are not
being altered by the proposed regulated activity.
   (G)   Stormwater flows shall not be created, increased, decreased to water
features or water resources, relocated, or otherwise altered in a manner which
would affect any adjacent contiguous or nearby properties without demonstrating
that the owners of such affected properties have been made aware of the flow/
direct discharge intended.
   (H)   All regulated activities shall include such measures as necessary to:
      (1)   Protect health, safety and property;
      (2)   Meet the water quality goals of this Part, as stated in §
26-103, by implementing measures to:
         (a)   Minimize disturbance to floodplains, wetlands, wooded areas and
existing vegetation;
         (b)   Maintain or extend riparian buffers;

completely drain both the volume control and rate control capacities over a
period of time not less than 24 hours and not more than 72 hours from the end
of the design storm. However, any designed infiltration at such facilities is
exempt from the minimum 24-hour standard, i.e., may infiltrate in a shorter
period of time, so long as none of the stormwater flowing into the infiltration
facility is discharged directly into the surface waters of the Commonwealth.
(Inordinately rapid infiltration rates may indicate the presence of large
fractures or other conditions for which an additional soil buffer may be
required.)
   (L)   The design storm volumes and precipitation intensities to be used in
the analysis of discharge or runoff shall be obtained from the Precipitation-
Frequency Atlas of the United States, Atlas 14, Volume 2, Version 3.0, U.S.

§ 26-302 EXEMPTIONS.
   Any regulated activity that meets the following exemption criteria is exempt
from the part(s) of this Part as specified herein. However, the requirements of
the Part shall otherwise remain in effect. The criteria for exemption in this
section apply to the total development proposed, including instances in which
the development is proposed to take place in phases. The date of enactment of
this Part shall be the starting point from which future development and the
respective proposed impervious surface computations shall be cumulatively
considered and regulated. Exemption shall not relieve an applicant from
implementing such measures as necessary to meet the intent of this Part, or
compliance with any NPDES permit requirements.
   (A)   Regulated activities that create DIAs equal to or less than 1,000
square feet are exempt from the peak rate control and the SWM site plan
preparation requirements of this Part.

applicant from the requirements in § 26-301(D) through (L) of this Part.
   (G)   The municipality may deny or revoke any exemption pursuant to this
section at any time for any project that the municipality determines poses a
threat to public health, safety, property or the environment.
(Ord. 2011-2, passed 10-11-2011)
§ 26-303 VOLUME CONTROLS.
   The low impact development practices provided in the BMP Manual shall be
utilized for all regulated activities to the maximum extent practicable. Water
volume controls shall be implemented using the design storm method in
subsection (A) below or the simplified method in subsection (B) below. For
regulated activity areas equal or less than one acre that do not require
hydrologic routing to design the stormwater facilities, this Part establishes
no preference for either methodology; therefore, the applicant may select
either methodology on the basis of economic considerations, the intrinsic
limitations on applicability of the analytical procedures associated with each
methodology, and other factors.
   (A)   The design storm method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) is applicable to any
size of regulated activity. This method requires detailed modeling based on
site conditions.
      (1)   Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the two-year 24-hour duration precipitation.
      (2)   For modeling purposes:
         (a)   Existing (pre-development) non-forested pervious areas must be
considered meadow.
         (b)   Twenty percent of the existing impervious area of a project
site, when present, shall be considered meadow in the model for existing
conditions.
   (B)   (1)   The simplified method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual) provided below is
independent of site conditions and should be used if the design storm method is
not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated activities greater
than one acre or for projects that require design of stormwater storage
facilities.
      (2)   For new impervious surfaces:
         (a)   Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two
inches of runoff from all new impervious surfaces;
         (b)   At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious
surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it shall not
be released into the surface waters of this Commonwealth. Removal options for
the first one inch of runoff include reuse, evaporation, transpiration and
infiltration;
         (c)   Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed runoff; however, in
all cases at least the first one-half inch of the permanently removed
stormwater runoff shall be infiltrated; and
         (d)   This method is exempt from the requirements of §
26-304, Rate Controls.
(Ord. 2011-2, passed 10-11-2011)
§ 26-304 RATE CONTROLS.
   (A)   For computation of pre-development peak discharge rates, 20% of the
existing impervious area of a project site, when present, shall be considered
meadow.
   (B)   Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the pre-development
discharge rates for the one-, two-, five-, ten-, 25-, 50- and 100-year 24-hour
storms. If it is shown that the peak rates of discharge indicated by the post-
development analysis are less than or equal to the peak rates of discharge
indicated by the pre-development analysis for one-, two-, five-, ten-, 25-, 50-
and 100-year 24-hour storms, then the requirements of this section have been
met. Otherwise, the applicant shall provide additional controls as necessary to
satisfy the peak rate of discharge requirement as outlined in § 
26-306.
   (C)   Pre-existing, pervious or impervious areas, where stormwater
management controls have been previously provided, may be included as existing
conditions in pre-development runoff calculations. However, if stormwater
management controls have not been previously provided, ground cover shall be
considered as meadow.

§ 26-305 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FACILITIES FOR PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF
TRANSPORTATION (PennDOT) AND PENNSYLVANIA TURNPIKE COMMISSION (PTC) ROADWAYS
AND ASSOCIATED FACILITIES.
   (A)   For the purposes of the Act 167 Stormwater Management (Plan) elements,
being 32 P.S. §§ 680.1 et seq., contained within the York County Integrated
Water Resources Plan, and this Part, design policy pertaining to stormwater
management facilities for Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT)
and Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission (PTC) roadways and associated facilities
is provided in § 13.7 (Antidegradation and Post Construction Stormwater
Management Policy) of PennDOT Publication No. 13M, Design Manual Part 2 (August
2009), as developed, updated, and amended in consultation with the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Resources (DEP). As stated in DM-2.13.7.D (Act 167
and municipal ordinances), PennDOT and PTC roadways and associated facilities
shall be consistent with Act 167 Plans. DM-2.13.7.B (Policy on Antidegradation
and Post Construction Stormwater Management) was developed as a cooperative
effort between PennDOT and DEP. DM-2.13.7.C (Project Categories) discusses the
anticipated impact on the quality, volume and rate of stormwater runoff.
   (B)   Where standards in the Act 167 elements of the IWRP and this Part are
impractical, PennDOT or the PTC may request assistance from DEP, in
consultation with the county, to develop an alternative strategy for meeting
state water quality requirements and the goals and objectives of the Act 167
elements within the IWRP.
   (C)   For the purposes of the Act 167 elements in the IWRP and this Part,
road maintenance activities are regulated under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102.
(Ord. 2011-2, passed 10-11-2011)
§ 26-306 DESIGN AND INSTALLATION STANDARDS.
   (A)   Stormwater collection system. The design of stormwater collection and
conveyance facilities shall be governed by the following criteria.
      (1)   Storm drainage system.
         (a)   Rational formula.
            1.   Peak discharge shall be computed using the rational formula:
 
Q = CIA
 
               Where:
         Q = Peak discharge in cubic feet per second;
         C = Runoff coefficient expressed as the ratio of peak runoff rate to
the average amount of rainfall over a period of time equal to the time of
concentration;
         I = Average rainfall intensity in inches per hour for a time equal to
the time of concentration; and
         A = Drainage area in acres.
            2.   In general, the procedure from the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation, Design Manual, Part 2 shall be followed.
               a.   Typical runoff coefficients for various surfaces can be
found in the Exhibit 2 of this Part. Runoff coefficients shall be computed as a
weighted average of conditions, which represent maximum development potential
on the property. Soil types, ground slope, and storm frequency shall all be
considered in the selection of runoff coefficients.
               b.   A computation table similar to the one found in the Exhibit
1 of this Part shall be submitted with the design of any stormwater collection
system.
               c.   Storm intensity (I) shall be computed as a function of the
time of concentration (Tc). A Tc of five minutes shall be used in determining
intensity unless the drainage area parameters justify the use of a greater
value. Use of a Tc greater than five minutes shall be as approved by the
Borough Engineer.
               d.   The minimum full flow velocity of any storm drainage system
or culvert shall be two and one-half feet per second (fps).
         (b)   Storm frequency.
            1.   The following storm frequencies are to be used for design:
               a.   Local streets: 25 year;
               b.   Major intersections of local streets: 25 year; and
               c.   Collector streets and arterial streets: 50 year.
            2.   Alternate criteria may be required following recommendation of
the Borough Engineer. In addition, functional classification of streets shall
be as interpreted by the Borough Engineer.
         (c)   Pipe material. For storm drainage systems which will be
dedicated to the borough, all pipe material shall either be reinforced concrete
or smooth lined corrugated polyethylene pipe to be as determined by the
borough. Standards as referenced from ASTM or other source acceptable to the
Borough Engineer shall be specified.
         (d)   Pipe size. Minimum pipe size for storm drainage pipe shall be 15
inches in diameter unless otherwise approved by the Borough Engineer.
         (e)   Installation.
            1.   Storm drainage pipes shall be installed a sufficient time in
advance of final street paving in order to allow for settlement of the trench.
            2.   Installation shall be in accordance with manufacturers’
recommendations, PennDOT Publication 408 and RC standards or as specified by
the Borough Engineer.
            3.   Storm drainage systems to be dedicated to the borough shall be
placed on a minimum of six inches of stone bedding. Stone backfill shall be
required to a point of 12 inches minimum over the top of the pipe for pipes
which will not be located under streets or parking lots and to the top of
finished subgrade for pipes which will be beneath streets or parking lots.
Backfill shall be compacted in lifts and shall be subject to inspection by the
Borough Engineer.
            4.   Minimum cover from the top of the pipe to the top of subgrade
shall be 12 inches.
         (f)   Safety features. Safety features shall be incorporated into the
storm drainage system as necessary.
         (g)   Minimum thickness. Minimum thickness of any corrugated steel or
metal pipe shall be 16 gage or as otherwise required by the borough for
anticipated load conditions. Metal pipes shall also be coated with applicable
approved material to minimize corrosion.
      (2)   Inlets/manholes/junctions.
         (a)   In general, inlets, manholes, grates, covers, frames and the
like shall conform to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Standard
Specifications, Publication 408 and RC Standards. Design shall be performed in
accordance with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation or Federal
Highway Administration Standards. Additional/alternate criteria may be required
following review of the Borough Engineer.
            1.   Inlets shall be spaced such that they are not subject to flows
higher than five cubic feet per second or at a distance greater than 400 feet
along curbed streets and at low points on sag vertical curves with an inlet on
each side of the street. Additional inlets shall be placed at the upper side of
street intersections, to prevent stormwater from crossing the intersection.
Inlets are not allowed on the intersection radii. In no case shall inlets be
placed at a location where they function at less than 65% efficiency based on
criteria in the PennDot Design Manual. Design shall be such that the maximum
allowable spread of water on streets shall not exceed one-half of the travel
lane.
            2.   Inlets shall have weep holes placed at the appropriate
elevations to drain the bottom of the inlet box and the subgrade prior to
placing the base and surface courses.
         (b)   Where structures are subject to traffic loads, the structure
shall be traffic rated.
         (c)   Inlet tops in residential developments shall be bicycle safe
unless otherwise approved.
         (d)   Manholes shall not be placed more than 500 feet apart.
Additionally, manholes shall be placed at points of change in horizontal and/or
vertical direction of storm drainage systems. Inlets may be substituted for
manholes where they will serve as a means of intercepting runoff.
         (e)   If less than a 48-inch diameter, curves in pipes or box
culverts, without junction are prohibited. Tee joints, elbows and wyes are
prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Borough Engineer.
      (3)   Channels and culverts.
         (a)   In cases where drainage is collected by means of a headwall, and
inlet or outlet conditions control, the pipe shall be designed as a culvert.
            1.   The minimum diameter of the culvert shall be 18 inches. Design
shall be in accordance with the U.S. Federal Highway Administration design
procedure.
            2.   The maximum HW/D ratio for inlet control shall be 1.25 or such
that water surface elevation is one-half foot below the edge of street grade
during a 25-year storm event, whichever is more stringent.
            3.   Headwalls and endwalls shall be provided for all culverts
unless otherwise approved by the Borough Engineer. Material shall be reinforced
concrete unless otherwise approved.
            4.   Culvert pipe and material shall be the same as that required
for storm drainage systems. All applicable nomographs and supporting
documentation shall be submitted.
         (b)   Manning’s equation shall be used for the design of all open
channels. Complete calculations shall be submitted which detail flow, depth and
velocity. For channels and swales, design for erosion control must be provided.
         (c)   All channels shall be designed to prevent erosion of the channel
bottom and sides. The flow velocity in all vegetated drainage channels shall
not exceed the maximum permissible velocity to prevent soil erosion.
Stabilization techniques such as rip-rap, sodding, geo-fabrics and/or pre-
manufactured products shall be utilized where necessary to minimize erosion
potential.
         (d)   The design of swales and channels shall, as a minimum, conform
to the design procedures as outlined by the Federal Highway Administration and
the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, Bureau of Soil and
Water Conservation, Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control Manual.
         (e)   Where swales are installed and vegetative stabilization has not
or will not occur between November 1 and March 1, other means of temporary
stabilization shall be provided.
         (f)   Design criteria for swales and channels shall be the same, as
that required for storm drainage systems.
   (B)   Stormwater management facilities.
      (1)   General design criteria.
         (a)   Peak discharge and runoff shall be computed using the soil-cover
complex method contained in the Urban Hydrology for Small Water Sheds,
Technical Release No. 55, published by the Engineering Division, Soil
Conservation Service, United States Department of Agriculture. Alternate
methodology may be used subject to approval by the Borough Engineer.
         (b)   Any pre-existing, pervious areas shall be assumed to be “meadow”
for purposes of establishing an existing ground cover condition unless actual
conditions would dictate a lesser value than for a meadow condition.
         (c)   Pre-existing, pervious or impervious areas, where stormwater
management controls have been previously provided, may be included as existing
conditions in pre-development runoff calculations. However, if stormwater
management controls have not been previously provided, ground cover shall be
considered as meadow.
         (d)   The rate and quantity of stormwater runoff from any proposed
subdivision and/or land development shall not exceed the rate and quantity or
volume of runoff prior to development (i.e., zero increase in runoff) for the
one-, two-, five-, ten-, 25- and 50-year storm event frequencies.
         (e)   1.   Applicants are encouraged to include stormwater quality
considerations in the design of stormwater management facilities.
            2.   Where, required by the borough, following review by the
Borough Engineer, high concentrations of oils, greases, metals and sediment may
occur, the design shall include provisions for the interception of such
constituents prior to discharge into surface waterways or municipal storm
drainage systems.
         (f)   Stormwater shall not be re-routed or concentrated in a manner
that is inconsistent with downstream conditions or where downstream properties
are likely to be affected. In addition the proposed stormwater discharge at the
perimeter of the site shall not exceed the capacity of any existing facility
nor shall it alter the pre-development flow characteristics. The existing
points of concentrated drainage that discharge onto adjacent property shall not
be altered without permission of the altered property owner(s) and shall be
subject to any applicable discharge criteria specified in this Part. All new
concentrated discharges of stormwater onto adjacent properties shall be within
existing storm drainage systems or channels. The borough may require written
acknowledgement or easement from adjacent property owners in the event that
these conditions are not met.
      (2)   Detention basins.
         (a)   Basin design criteria.
            1.   Basins shall provide control of post development peak runoff
rates as previously specified.
            2.   Basins shall be designed to safely convey the rate, quantity
or volume of stormwater runoff resulting from a 100-year 24-hour storm under
full development conditions, neglecting the discharge capacity of the principle
outlet structure. Contributing flow to the basin shall also include any off-
site runoff that may enter the basin. The design of the facility shall be
verified by routing the one-, two-, five-, ten-, 25-, 50- and 100-year
frequency storm hydrographs through the facility.
            3.   The modified PULS routing technique or other method approved
by the Borough Engineer shall be used for routing computations.
            4.   Computer software used in analysis shall be as approved by the
Borough Engineer.
         (b)   Basin construction standards.
            1.   Basins shall not be located over any existing or proposed
utility lines.
            2.   The maximum slope of earthen embankments shall be three to
one, with four to one preferred. The top or toe of any slope shall be located a
minimum of 15 feet from adjacent property lines, except for a downstream
property line where there shall be sufficient additional distance for energy
dissipation. Greater slopes may be allowed with the provision of a design basis
which considers fill material and stabilization where approved by the Borough
Engineer. In areas that are not easily accessible for maintenance, side slopes
shall not exceed five to one.
            3.   Where possible the side slopes and basin shape shall blend
with the natural topography.
            4.   The minimum top width of detention basin berms shall be six
feet. For basins over six feet in depth, a top of embankment width of eight
feet may be required.
            5.   All basins shall have provisions for de-watering so as not to
create unmaintainable conditions. The minimum grade of the basin floor shall be
2% to ensure proper drainage towards the outlet structure. This requirement may
be waived if a paved low flow channel (1% grade) is provided.
            6.   All submitted basin plans shall indicate the construction
specifications and compaction requirements to be used during construction. All
earth fill dams shall be designed and certified by a registered professional
engineer. Construction specifications shall be reviewed and approved by the
Borough Engineer.
            7.   A cutoff trench shall be excavated along the centerline of any
dam on an earth fill embankment. The minimum depth shall be three feet. The
minimum bottom width shall be ten feet or wide enough to permit operation of
compaction equipment.
            8.   A minimum of six inches of topsoil shall be placed on all
areas affected by the basin construction (i.e., basin floor, side slopes, top
of berm and the like) to allow for the establishment of vegetation.
            9.   All basins shall be stabilized using methods acceptable to the
USDA Soil Conservation Service.
            10.   The maximum water depth of a finished detention basin
(measured from the lowest point in the basin floor to the crest of the
emergency spillway) shall not exceed eight inches unless otherwise approved by
the Borough Engineer.
            11.   Fencing may be required where the borough, following
consultation with the Borough Solicitor and/or Borough Engineer, determines the
need for each specific case. Height of such fence shall be four feet to six
feet as required and shall include a locking main gate and vehicle access.
            12.   A minimum of one foot freeboard shall be provided above the
basin water surface elevation during a 100-year frequency storm.
            13.   Minimum floor elevations for all structures shall be two feet
(minimum) above the basin water surface elevation during 100-year frequency
storm. If basements will be provided, detailed calculations and water proofing
design shall be provided which addresses the effects of stormwater on the
structure.
            14.   The borough may, upon recommendation of the Borough Engineer,

APPENDIX A: DISCONNECTED IMPERVIOUS AREA (DIA)
A. 1.   Rooftop Disconnection
When rooftop down spouts are directed to a pervious area that allows for
infiltration, filtration and increased time of concentration, the rooftop may
qualify as completely or partially DIA and a portion of the impervious rooftop
area may be excluded from the calculation of total impervious area.
A rooftop is considered to be completely or partially disconnected if it meets
the requirements listed below:
   •   The contributing area of rooftop to each disconnected discharge is 500
square feet or less;
   •   The soil, in proximity of the roof water discharge area, is not
designated as hydrologic soil group “D” or equivalent; and
   •   The overland flow path from roof water discharge area has a positive
slope of 5% or less.
For designs that meet these requirements, the portion of the roof that may be
considered disconnected depends on the length of the overland path as
designated in Table B.l.
Table B.1: Partial Rooftop Disconnection
Length of Pervious Flow Path * Roof Area Treated as Disconnected
(ft)                           (% of contributing area)
Table B.1: Partial Rooftop Disconnection
Length of Pervious Flow Path Roof Area Treated as Disconnected
*
(ft)                         (% of contributing area)
0—14                       0
15—29                      20
30—44                      40
45—59                      60
60—74                      80
75 or more                   100
*   Flow path cannot include impervious surfaces and must be at least 15 feet
from any impervious surfaces.
   
A.2. Pavement Disconnection
When pavement runoff is directed to a pervious area that allows for
infiltration, filtration, and increased time of concentration, the contributing
pavement area may qualify as a DIA that may be excluded from the calculation of
total impervious area. This applies generally only to small or narrow pavement
structures such as driveways and narrow pathways through otherwise pervious
areas, e.g., a walkway or bike path through a park.
Pavement is disconnected if the pavement, or area adjacent to the pavement,
meets the requirements below:
   •   The contributing flow path over impervious area is not more than 75
feet;
   •   The length of overland flow is greater than or equal to the contributing
length;
   •   The soil is not designated as hydrologic soil group “D” or equivalent;
   •   The slope of the contributing impervious area is 5% or less; and
   •   The slope of the overland flow path is 5% or less.
If the discharge is concentrated at one or more discrete points, no more than
1,000 square feet may discharge to any one point. In addition, a gravel strip
or other spreading device is required for concentrated discharges. For non-
concentrated discharges along the edge of the pavement, this requirement is
waived; however, there must be a provision for the establishment of vegetation
along the pavement edge and temporary stabilization of the area until
vegetation becomes stabilized.

Board may require appropriate conditions and safeguard in accord with the
provisions of this chapter.

or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except
in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located.
   (G)   Zone changes. Whenever the boundaries of a zone shall be changed so as
to transfer an area from one zone to another zone of a different
classification, the foregoing provisions shall also apply to any nonconforming

            1.   Purpose of building separation standard. Council hereby adopts
a standard for the separation of buildings, recognizing the need to provide for
construction of buildings which will provide for the health and safety of the
citizens of the borough. By establishing such standards, the borough will help
to ensure that the occupants of buildings will be provided a standard of safety
for exposure from adjoining buildings in case of fire, explosion, or other
emergency.
            2.   Applicability of building separation standard. A building
separation requirement of 25 feet shall apply to all occupied buildings, in all
zoning districts within the borough. Such 25 feet building separation standard
shall be measured along a straight line between one building and another, from
the outer portion of the exterior wall of the first building to the outer
portion of the exterior wall of the second building. Such measurement shall be
taken from a point where the buildings are closest together. Small buildings,
typically meant for back-yard storage, commonly referred to as “sheds”, are
considered to be unoccupied buildings. Such buildings, designed or used for
storage, not exceeding 196 square feet in area and 12 feet in height, shall
meet a minimum building separation requirement of ten feet. Such storage sheds
are only approved for back yard use. Section 27-501(3)(B) of the Zoning
ordinance, previously referencing separation standards of sheds, is hereby
repealed and eliminated.
            3.   Definition of occupancy. OCCUPANCY is a building that provides
enclosed space designed for human occupancy in which individuals congregate for
amusement, educational, domicile or similar purposes, or in which occupants are
engaged in labor.
            4.   Repealer and severability. Any ordinance, or part, thereof,
conflicting with this section shall be, and hereby is, repealed insofar as it
conflicts with this chapter. Further, the provisions of this section are
severable. If any sentence, clause or section of this Part is for any reason
found to be unconstitutional, illegal, or invalid, such unconstitutionally,
illegality, or invalidity shall not affect or impair any of the remaining
provisions of this section. It is hereby declared to be the intent of the
Borough Council that this section would have been adopted had such
unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, clause, or section not been
included herein.

compensation of the Secretary and members of the Zoning Hearing Board, notice
and advertising costs and necessary administrative overhead connected with the
hearing. The costs, however, shall not include legal expenses of the Zoning
Hearing Board, expense for engineering, architectural or other technical
consultants or expert witness costs.
      (2)   The hearings shall be conducted by the Board or the Board may
appoint any member as a Hearing Officer. The decision, or, where no decision is
called for, the findings shall be made by the Board; however, the appellant or
the applicant, as the case may be, in addition to the borough, may, prior to
the decision of the hearing, waiver decision or findings by the Board and
accept the decision of the Hearing Officer as final.
      (3)   Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but irrelevant,
immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence may be excluded.
      (4)   The Board or Hearing Officer shall not communicate, directly or
indirectly, with any party or his or her representatives in connection with any
issue involved except upon notice and opportunity for all parties to
participate; shall not take notice of any communication, reports, staff

      (1)   Parties to the hearings shall be the borough, any person affected

be, shall render a written decision or, when no decision is called for, make
written findings on the application within 45 days after the hearing before the
Board or Hearing Officer. Where the application is contested or denied, each
decision shall be accompanied by findings of fact and conclusions based thereon
together with the reasons therefor. Conclusions based on any provisions of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code or of any ordinance, rule or
regulation shall contain a reference to the provision relied on and the reasons
why the conclusion is deemed appropriate in the light of the facts found. If
the hearing is conducted by a Hearing Officer, and there is no stipulation that
his or her decision of findings is final, the Board shall make his or her
report and recommendations available to the parties within 45 days and the
parties shall be entitled to make written representations thereon to the Board
prior to final decision or entry of findings, and the Board’s decision shall be
entered no later than 30 days after the report of the Hearing Officer. Where
the Board fails to render the decision within the period required by this
subsection (D), or fails to hold the required hearing within 60 days from the
date the appeal or application is filed with the borough, the decision shall be
deemed to have been rendered in favor of the applicant, unless the applicant
has agreed in writing or on the record to an extension of time. When a decision
has been rendered in favor of the applicant because of the failure of the Board
to meet or render a decision as herein-above provided, the Board shall give
public notice of said decision within ten days from the last day it could have
met to render a decision in the same manner as provided in subsection (D)(1)
below. Nothing in this subsection (D) shall prejudice the right of any party
opposing the application to appeal the decision to a court of competent
jurisdiction.
      (1)   A copy of the final decision or, where no decision is called for,
of the findings, shall be delivered to the applicant personally or mailed to

the hearing, the Board shall provide by mail or otherwise, brief notice of the

to the granting of an application or appeal, this condition must be stated in
the order of the Board and in the permit issued pursuant to the order by the
Zoning Officer. This permit remains valid only as long as the conditions or
conditions upon which it is granted or the conditions imposed by this chapter
are adhered to.
   (E)   Records. The Board or the Hearing Officer, as the case may be, shall
keep a stenographic record of the proceedings. The appearance fee for a
stenographer shall be shared equally by the applicant and the Board. The cost
of the original transcript shall be paid by the Board if the transcript is
ordered by the Board or Hearing Officer, or shall be paid by the person
appealing from the decision of the Board if such appeal is made, and in either
event the cost of additional copies shall be paid by the person requesting such
copy or copies. In other cases, the party requesting the original transcript
shall bear the cost thereof.

§ 27-603 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Filing of variance.
      (1)   An application may be made to the Zoning Hearing Board for a
variance where it is alleged that the provisions of this chapter inflict
unnecessary hardship upon the applicant. The application must be on a form
provided for that purpose by the Zoning Officer. It must be filed with the
Board and copies given to the Zoning Officer and Borough Planning Commission.
      (2)   The applicant must provide all the information requested on the
form, together with any other information and data that may be required to
advise the Board of the variance, whether such information is called for by the
official form or not.
      (3)   Unless otherwise specified or extended by the Board, a variance
authorized by it expires if the applicant fails to obtain a building permit or
use certificate within six months from the date of the authorization of the
variance.
   (B)   Referral to Planning Commission. All applications for a variance shall
be referred to the Planning Commission for a report.
   (C)   Standards for variance. Where there is unnecessary hardship, the Board
may grant a variance in the application of the provisions of this chapter
provided the following findings are made where relevant in a given case:
      (1)   There are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including
irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property,
and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such condition and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of this chapter
in the neighborhood or zone in which the property is located;
      (2)   Because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no
possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of this chapter and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property;
      (3)   The unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant;
      (4)   The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character
of the neighborhood or zone in which the property is located, nor substantially
or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property,
nor be detrimental to the public welfare; and
      (5)   The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance
that will afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of
the regulation in issue.
   (D)   Conditions. In granting any variance, the Board may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes of this chapter.

shall in no case be construed as waiving any provision of this chapter and such
permit may be revoked.
   (G)   Civil enforcement proceedings. Upon determining that a violation of
any of the provisions of this chapter exists, the Zoning Officer may initiate
civil enforcement proceedings. To initiate a civil enforcement proceeding, the

appeal shall be heard in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 27-602
of this chapter; and
      (6)   Failure to comply with the notice within the time specified, unless
extended by appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board, constitutes a violation, and
