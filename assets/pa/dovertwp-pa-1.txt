FOREWORD
History
Â Â Â This comprises the codification of the ordinances of the Township of Dover.
The first counties in Pennsylvania were established in 1681 under a charter
granted to William Penn by Charles II, King of England. Settlement occurred
mainly east of the Susquehanna River until the conclusion of the Indian Treaty
of 1736, when the limits of Lancaster County were extended indefinitely
westward. These fertile lands were soon occupied by immigrants from England,
Ireland, Scotland, and Germany.
Â Â Â Boundary Formation. It was under the authority of the Lancaster County Court
that Dover Township was formed in 1743. It was formed out of old Manchester
Township which was so large that it extended into Adams County. The township's
name, Dover, was apparently selected to honor Dover, England.
Â Â Â The shape of Dover Township is irregular with its southwestern boundary
resting upon what is now Jackson and Paradise Townships. To the west lie
Warrington and Washington Townships, while to the east lie West Manchester,
Manchester, and Conewago Townships. The original boundaries were not well-
defined, but they included part of what is today Washington and Conewago
Townships, and Dover Borough.
Â Â Â In 1770, that area which stretches from the top of the Conewago Hills to the
Big Conewago Creek was added to Dover Township from Warrington Township. The
Big Conewago Creek forms its present western boundary line. Then, in 1818,
Dover residents east of the Bull Road petitioned the York County Courts to form
a new township known as Conewago Township. About two-thirds of this new
township came from Dover Township and one-third from Newberry Township. It is
this line along the Bull Road, delineated in 1818, which forms the present
eastern boundary of the Township. The northern boundary is formed where the
eastern and western boundaries of Dover Township meet. The southern boundary
consists of a line which originally separated Dover Township from Paradise
Township. Today, it separates Dover Township from both Paradise and Jackson
Townships. Jackson Township was an offspring of the original Paradise Township.
The southeastern boundary of Dover Township is delineated by the Little
Conewago Creek up to the point where it meets the Bull Road.
Â Â Â Â Early Settlement. Place names, family traditions, and artifacts
substantiate the fact that Native American settlements existed in and around
the Dover Township area. At the time of these settlements, though, the Township
was merely an extension of the wilderness that was part of Lancaster County
which was still under the jurisdiction of Philadelphia. The Native Americans of
the York-Dover area were distributed and had, on occasion, complained to
Philadelphia about the European settlers who were crossing the Susquehanna
River and clearing the wilderness and planting. It became evident that the
settlers were coming into the area to live and settle.
Â Â Â Much of the land in the Township is fertile and produces abundant crops. The
major source of income for these early settlers was farming. Corn, wheat, and
potatoes were the primary crops except in the northern section where peaches
and strawberries were cultivated and became an important industry in that
section during the early days of the Township. Other important industries
during the early days of the Township were weaving, tanning, quarrying, and
harness and wagon-making. The sandstone for the ornamentations on the Dauphin
County Court House was quarried in the Township. The Townshipâ€™s location was
ideal for the tanning industry because hides could be obtained from nearby
butchers and dehaired with the lime from the West Manchester Township lime
kilns.
Â Â Â An early inventory of Dover Township (1783), showed 219 horses, 146 barns,
697 male and 670 female inhabitants; 4 slaves, 7 mills, and 23,811 acres of
land. From this early inventory (1,367 inhabitants), the population of the
Township has shown a slow but steady increase except for two distinct periods.
Before and after the turn of the twentieth century, the population showed a
slight decline while during recent years, there has been a tremendous influx of
people into the township.

Â Â Â Several settlements in Dover Township reach back into its very earliest days
of existence. The oldest settlement was Emig's Mill where a Dietrich Updegraff
took up land in 1745 and where a house of public entertainment existed. Later,
a roller mill which originated as a mill in colonial times, flourished here.
Also, many Native American artifacts have been found by collectors along the
Little Conewago Creek from Emig's Mill to its mouth at York Haven.
Â Â Â Davidsburg, a village situated in the center of a fine agricultural region
in the western part of Dover Township, has been an interesting area since its
inception in the early part of the nineteenth century. Part of its importance
can be attributed to the fact that it is located along the Shippensburg Road
(now the Davidsburg Road). During colonial times this was a well-known route of
travel from York to the Cumberland Valley. Its importance later grew as a wagon
trail for farm products being carried from York County to the Baltimore area
for sale. Some of the early enterprises of importance in Davidsburg were a
harness-making business, the sale of farm implements, a cigar factory, general
merchandising businesses, and a village hotel.
Â Â Â Admire is a small village in the southwestern part of the Township a few
miles south of Davidsburg. It was originally called Slabtown; then Newport, and
for a brief period of time it was known as Voltaire before receiving its
present name of Admire. A store and a post office existed there around the turn
of the twentieth century.
Â Â Â Mount Royal was a cluster of houses in the northern part of the Township
along the road from Dover to Rossville, a village in Warrington Township. A
store and a post office had existed there for many years. Both of these were
under the direction of a Robert Kunkle around the turn of the twentieth
century.
Â Â Â When it received its name in 1825, the village of Weigelstown was a small
hamlet of about half a dozen houses near the southern boundary of the township.
Its name is believed to be derived from two of its early settlers named Weigel;
one of whom was a blacksmith, while the other was a tavern keeper. The village
grew from six houses in 1825 to over 200 people by the turn of the century.
Several of the early village structures still stand today.
Â 
Â Â Â Regional Setting. Dover Township, located in the northwestern part of York
County, is about three miles from the city of York. The cities of Carlisle and
Harrisburg are both approximately the same distance (26 miles) from the
Township. Harrisburg is directly north of the Township while Carlisle lies to
the northwest.
Â Â Â Several highways are readily accessible to the residents of the Township to
provide access to the major cities of the region. U.S. Route 15 and U.S. Route
30 provide access to cities such as Gettysburg, Harrisburg, Lancaster, and
points east. Interstate 83 provides access to Baltimore and Washington, D.C.,
to the south and Harrisburg, Philadelphia, New York, and other cities to the
north via the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Pennsylvania Route 74 (Carlisle Road)
which traverses the Township from northwest to southeast, provides connections
between Carlisle and the City of York.
Â Â Â Because of the extensive area of the Township, 40.59 square miles, it can be
stated that the predominate character of development in the Township is rural.
As can be seen from general observation, there are acres of farmlands and
forests within the Township's boundaries. Although this may be the predominate
land use in the Township, it cannot be said to be the most influential. There
is a definite trend toward suburbanization within the Township as evidenced by
the many subdivisions and commercial activity taking place in the southeastern
part of the township, especially along Route 74. It is evident that this
emerging pattern of residential and commercial uses will have an important
effect upon the overall development of the Township. Therefore, as the region
and the greater York area develop and grow, the effects of this development and
growth will be felt in Dover Township. There is an effort to preserve
"important farmland" since it has been plotted and described.
Â Â Â With a large portion of the Township's 40.59 square miles served by public
water and sanitary sewer, Dover Township is a developing community balancing
its growth with preservation of its natural resources. Approved residential
plans provide for an additional 2,000+ homes in the near future.
Organization
Â Â Â The Code contains four parts which are (1) the valid current ordinances of
the Township of Dover contained in Chapters 1 through 27, (2) the Appendix,
which lists by abstracted title all ordinances of a temporary or "one time"
nature, (3) the Key to the disposition of each ordinance ever enacted by the
Township of Dover, and (4) the Index, which is an alphabetical arrangement of
subjects.
Â Â Â In the Code each Chapter is separated by a divider tab, and specific
ordinances can be located by subject on the contents page at the beginning of
each Chapter. The Index may also be used to search for a subject when one is
looking for general information on a particular subject, or if it is not known
in which Chapter the subject might be found. The Appendix consists of several
general categories containing a chronological listing of short subject
descriptions along with a reference to the original ordinance and its date of
enactment, if known.
Â Â Â The Key to disposition indicates what action has been taken by the Township
of Dover Board of Supervisors with regard to every ordinance ever enacted. An
ordinance has either been (1) specifically repealed, (2) superseded by another
ordinance, (3) is located in a Chapter of the Code book, or (4) is located in
the Appendix. Annual tax rate and budget ordinances are located only in the
Key. The Key is a cross reference to the original ordinance books of the
Township of Dover, and to the location within the Code of each ordinance by
number.

Part 2
Compensation of Supervisors
Â§ 1-201.Â Â Â Purpose.
Â Â Â This Part is intended to implement the authorization set forth in Act 68 of
the General Assembly of Pennsylvania approved October 31, 1985, and as amended
March 30, 1988, P.L. 312, No. 41, December 20, 1991, P.L. 408, No. 49, and
December 16, 1992, P.L. 1213, No. 157, amending Â§ 515 of the Second Class
Township Code (53 P.S. 65515) permitting Supervisors of Townships of the Second
Class to be compensated for their services based upon a population scale. The
Board of Supervisors of Dover Township finds that the population of the
Township at the latest available official census (1990 U.S. Census) was 15,668;
that the Township is steadily being developed and provides the average range of
services to its residents; an efficient and effective administration of
Township services requires the Supervisors to devote a substantial amount of
time in performance of their official duties; and that it is in the interest of
the Township that its Supervisors be compensated for their services
commensurate with responsibilities as limited by law.
(Ord. 95-1, 2/13/1995, Â§ 1)
Â§ 1-202.Â Â Â Compensation of Supervisors.
Â Â Â Each duly elected or appointed Supervisor of Dover Township whose term of

installments as the Board of Supervisors shall from time to time establish by
resolution.
(Ord. 95-1, 2/13/1995, Â§ 2)
Part 3
Identity Theft Prevention Program
Â§ 1-301.Â Â Â Purpose.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â To establish an identity theft prevention program designed to detect,
prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with new or existing accounts
and to provide for continued administration of the program in compliance with
the Federal Trade Commissionâ€™s Red Flag Rule (Part 681 of Title 16 of the Code
of Federal Regulations) implementing Â§Â§ 114 and 315 of the Fair and Accurate
Credit Transactions Act (FACTA) of 2003.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â This program is intended to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Identify relevant red flags for new or existing covered accounts.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Detect red flags which have been identified.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Provide the appropriate response to any red flags that are detected
to prevent and mitigate identity theft.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Ensure that the program is updated periodically to reflect changes
in risks to customers.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â This program shall, as appropriate, incorporate existing policies and
procedures that control reasonably foreseeable risks.
(Ord. 2009-02, 3/23/2009, Â§I)
Â§ 1-302.Â Â Â Contact Information.
Â Â Â The Senior Management Official responsible for this program is:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Laurel Wilson, Township Manager
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2480 W Canal Rd
Â Â Â Â Â Â Dover, PA 17315
Â Â Â Â Â Â (717) 292-3634
(Ord. 2009-02, 3/23/2009, Â§II)
Â§ 1-303.Â Â Â Definitions.
Â Â Â Identity theftâ€“fraud committed or attempted using the identifying
information of another person without authority.
Â Â Â Red flagâ€“a pattern, practice or specific activity that indicated the
possible existence of identity theft.
(Ord. 2009-02, 3/23/2009, Â§III)
Â§ 1-304.Â Â Â Risk Assessment.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Dover Township (the â€œTownshipâ€) has conducted an internal risk
assessment with necessary staff to evaluate how at risk the current procedures
are at allowing customers to create fraudulent accounts and evaluate if current
and existing accounts are being manipulated or can be manipulated. The Township
reviewed each red flag and determined its applicability, if any, to the
Township.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The Township reviewed sewer and water accounts (â€œutility accountsâ€). It
was determined that the accounts run with the property and not the property
owner. The Township provides the account number. The only personal information
provided is the property ownerâ€™s name and property address. The Township does
not maintain any personal information or background information such as Social
Security numbers, date of births or driverâ€™s license information. No
application is provided. The real estate transfer is the trigger for the
account. The account is always in the property ownerâ€™s name as indicated on the
deed. Since the account runs with the property, it would be impossible for some
one to open a fraudulent account.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The Township does not accept payment by credit card and does not speak
to any credit agencies on behalf of the Township. Information about an account
is not provided over the telephone. Staff with access to these accounts is
minimal.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The Township invoices customers with use of a card. The card does not
provide any personal or protected information. It provides:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Name and address.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Account number which is unique to the property address.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Usage and amount due.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â It was determined that this information is not personal identifying
information and could not result in any identity theft.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â The Township determined that the customerâ€™s utility accounts are at a
low to very low risk for identity theft.
(Ord. 2009-02, 3/23/2009, Â§IV)
Â§ 1-305.Â Â Â Identify and Detect Red Flags.
Â Â Â After a thorough review of the red flags and Township policies and
practices, the Township has identified the following red flags:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Change of billing address or request to have bill sent somewhere
else.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Payments are made in a manner associated with fraud, i.e., signature
on check or name on check.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â An account with low activity unexpectedly jumps to high consumption
or any other suspicious activity relating to a specific account.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Mail sent to customer is repeatedly returned.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Township is notified by law officials or others regarding possible
identity theft.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Presentation of suspicious documents.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Presentation of suspicious personal identifying information.
Â Â Â These are not intended to be an all-inclusive list and any other suspicious
activities may be investigated as necessary.
(Ord. 2009-02, 3/23/2009, Â§V)
Â§ 1-306.Â Â Â Responding to Red Flags.
Â Â Â Any staff or employee that may suspect fraud or detect a red flag shall take
one or more of the following steps, depending on the degree of risk posed by
the red flag. All detections and suspicions shall be reported to and logged by
the Senior Management Official.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Notify senior management official.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Notify law enforcement of any attempted or actual identity theft.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Contact customer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Continue to monitor the situation for evidence of identity theft.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Take all steps necessary to correct the situation.
(Ord. 2009-02, 3/23/2009, Â§VI)
Â§ 1-307.Â Â Â Other Privacy Security Measures.
Â Â Â In order to further prevent the likelihood of identity theft occurring with
respect to utility accounts, the Township will take the following steps with
respect to its internal operating procedures to protect customer-identifying
information:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Ensure complete and secure destruction of customer information, if
applicable.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Employees will not leave sensitive papers out on their desks when
they are away from their workstations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Employees will log off their computers when leaving for the day.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Passwords will not be shared or posted near workstations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â No visitor will be give access keys or allowed unescorted access to
the Township offices.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â When installing new software, immediately change vendor-supplied
default passwords to a more secure strong password.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Anti-virus programs will be run on individual computers.
Â Â Â Â Â Â H.Â Â Â New and existing employees will sign a confidentiality agreement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Issue visitor badges for all outside vendors, visitors, etc.
(Ord. 2009-02, 3/23/2009, Â§VII)
Â§ 1-308.Â Â Â Updating the Program.
Â Â Â This program shall be updated periodically to reflect changes in the risks
to customers or changes to the safety and soundness of the Township from
identity theft based upon factors such as:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The experience of the Township with identity theft.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Changes in methods of identity theft.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Changes in methods to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Changes in the types of accounts that the Township offers or
maintains.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Changes in the Township procedures regarding accounts that the

A. General Provisions
Â§ 4-101.Â Â Â Intent.
Â Â Â The intent of this Part is to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in
order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units, and its residents, by preventing excessive development in areas subject
to flooding.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
(Ord. 2015-07, 11/23/2015)
Â§ 4-102.Â Â Â Applicability.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or
corporation to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or
development anywhere within the Township of Dover unless a permit has been
obtained from the Floodplain Administrator.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing buildings
or structures.
(Ord. 2015-07, 11/23/2015)
Â§ 4-103.Â Â Â Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.
Â Â Â This Part supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in effect
in identified floodplain areas. However, any other Part provisions shall remain
in full force and effect to the extent that those provisions are more
restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of this
Part, the more restrictive shall apply.
(Ord. 2015-07, 11/23/2015)
Â§ 4-104.Â Â Â Severability.

considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on accepted
engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be
increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings
restricted by debris. This Part does not imply that areas outside any
identified floodplain areas, or that land uses permitted within such areas will
be free from flooding or flood damages.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â This Part shall not create liability on the part of the Township of
Dover or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from
reliance on this Part or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 2015-07, 11/23/2015)

authorized official shall inspect the premises to determine that the work is
progressing in compliance with the information provided on the permit

associated with the requirements of this Part including, but not limited to,
finished construction elevation data, permitting, inspection and enforcement.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â The Floodplain Administrator is the official responsible for submitting
a biennial report to FEMA concerning community participation in the National
Flood Insurance Program.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â The responsibility, authority and means to implement the commitments of
the Floodplain Administrator can be delegated from the person identified.
However, the ultimate responsibility lies with the person identified in this
Part as the Floodplain Administrator/Manager.
Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â The Floodplain Administrator shall consider the requirements of 34 PA
Code and the 2009 IBC and the 2009 IRC or the latest edition thereof adopted by

Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Any areas of Township of Dover, classified as Special Flood Hazard
Areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood
Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated December 16, 2015 and issued by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof,
including all digital data developed as part of the flood insurance.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and
amendments are hereby adopted by Township of Dover and declared to be a part of
this Part.
(Ord. 2015-07, 11/23/2015)
Â§ 4-132.Â Â Â Description and Special Requirements of Identified Floodplain Areas.
Â Â Â The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific
areas:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The floodway area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without increasing the water surface elevation by more than one foot at any
point. This term shall also include floodway areas which have been identified
in other available studies or sources of information for those special flood
hazard areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted
unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed
encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Within any floodway area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the Department
of Environmental Protection Regional Office.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone
on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for
which base flood elevations have been provided and a floodway has been
delineated.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base flood
elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and floodway
information from other federal, state, or other acceptable sources shall be
used when available. Where other acceptable information is not available, the
base flood elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on
the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â In lieu of the above, the Township may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional
engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the
technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the Township.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The AO and AH Area/ District shall be those areas identified as
Zones AO and AH on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject to
inundation by 1-percent-annual-chance shallow flooding where average depths are
between one and three feet. In Zones AO and AH, drainage paths shall be
established to guide floodwaters around and away from structures on slopes.
(Ord. 2015-07, 11/23/2015)
Â§ 4-133.Â Â Â Changes in Identification of Areas.
Â Â Â The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Board of
Supervisors where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or
person documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such change
to the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from FEMA.
Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the
date such information becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA of the
changes to the special flood hazard area by submitting technical or scientific
data. See Â§
4-141B. for situations where FEMA notification is required.
(Ord. 2015-07, 11/23/2015)
Â§ 4-134.Â Â Â Boundary Disputes.
Â Â Â Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator and any
party aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the Board of
Supervisors. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
(Ord. 2015-07, 11/23/2015)
Â§ 4-135.Â Â Â Jurisdictional Boundary Changes.
Â Â Â Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other corporate
boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community shall review
flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary changes. The
community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in areas subject to
annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or exceed those in CFR 44
60.3.

the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% or more of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
Â Â Â Substantial improvement - any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, of which the cost equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the â€œstart of constructionâ€ of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred â€œsubstantial
damageâ€ or â€œrepetitive lossâ€ regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure
to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety
code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
Â Â Â Uniform Construction Code (UCC) - The statewide building code adopted by the
Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1999 applicable to new construction in all
municipalities whether administered by the Township, a third party or the
Department of Labor and Industry. Applicable to residential and commercial
buildings, the Code adopted The International Residential Code (IRC) and the

Â§ 8-105.Â Â Â Use of Fire Insurance Proceeds.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â No insurance company, association or exchange (hereinafter the
"insurer") doing business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall pay a claim
of a named insured for fire damage to a structure located within the Township
where the amount recoverable for the fire loss to the structure under all
policies exceeds $7,500 unless the insurer is furnished by the Township's
Treasurer with a certificate pursuant to Section 508(b) of the Act and unless
there is compliance with the procedure set forth in Section 508(c) and (d) of
the Act.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Where there are delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties or user
charges against the property ("municipal claims"), or there are expenses which
the Township has incurred as costs for the removal, repair or securing of a
building or other structure on the property (collectively, "Municipal
Expenses"), the Manager of the Township shall immediately render a bill for
such work, if he has not already done so. Upon written request of the named
insured specifying the tax description of the property, the name and address of
the insurer and the date of receipt by the insurer of a loss report of the
claim, the Treasurer shall, within 14 working days after the request, furnish
to the insurer, a certificate (or at his discretion an oral notification
confirmed in writing) either (i) stating that there are no unpaid municipal
claims or municipal expenses against the property; or (ii) specifying the
nature and amount of such claims or expenses, accompanied by a bill for such
amounts. Taxes, assessments, penalties and user charges shall be deemed
delinquent for this purpose, if a lien could have been filed for such claims
under applicable law. Upon receipt of a certificate and bill pursuant to clause
(ii) of the preceding sentence, the insurer shall transfer to the Treasurer an
amount from the insurance proceeds sufficient to pay such sums prior to making
payment to the named insured, subject to the provisions of subsection 3. below

issued a certificate described in clause (i) of subsection 2. above indicating

the loss agreed upon by the named insured and the insurer equals or exceeds 60%
of the aggregate limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building
or structure, the following procedures must be followed:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The insurer shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the
Treasurer, in the aggregate, $2,000 for each $15,000 of such claim or fraction
thereof.

insured has submitted to the insurer, with a copy to the Township, a
contractor's signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing
the building or other structure in an amount less than the amount calculated
under the foregoing transfer formula, the Insurer shall transfer to the
Treasurer from the insurance proceeds the amount specified in the estimate. If
there is more than one insurer, the transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata
basis by all insurers insuring the building or other structure.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Upon receipt of the above described portion of the insurance
proceeds, the Treasurer shall do the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used solely as
security against the total municipal expenses anticipated by the Township to be
required in removing, repairing, or securing the building or structure as
required by this Chapter. Such costs shall include, without limitation, any
engineering, legal or administrative costs incurred by the Township in
connection with such removal, repair or securing or any proceedings related
thereto; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Mail to the named insured, at the address received from the
insurer, a notice that the Township has received the proceeds and that the
procedures under this subsection shall be followed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â After the transfer, the named insured may submit to the Township
a contractor's signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing
the building or other structure, in which event the Treasurer shall, if such
estimate is deemed by the Treasurer to be reasonable, return to the insured the
amount of the funds transferred to the Township in excess of that required to
pay the municipal expenses, provided the Township has not commenced to remove,
repair or secure the building or other structure, in which case the Township
will complete the work.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Pay to the Manager, for reimbursement to the Township's General
Fund, the amount of the municipal expenses paid by the Township.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Pay the remaining balance in the fund (without interest) to the
named insured upon receipt of a certificate issued by the Codes Enforcement
Officer of the Township that the repair, removal or securing of the building or
other structure has been completed in accordance with all applicable codes and
regulations of the Township.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Nothing in this Section shall be construed to limit the ability of
the Township to recover any deficiency in the amount of municipal claims or
municipal expenses recovered pursuant to this Chapter, or to insurance
proceeds, by an action at law or equity to enforce the codes of the Township or
to enter into an agreement with the named insured with regard to such other
disposition of the proceeds as the Township may deem reasonable.

Â Â Â The use of burglar or fire alarms, whether audible or direct-line type of
alarms, are expressly permitted in this Township subject to the following
conditions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Direct-line radio or other electronic fire/burglar alarm shall be
installed by competent workmen so that such devices shall not emit false
alarms.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Any alarm system that produces four or more false alarms during any
calendar year shall constitute a public nuisance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Any policeman or fireman who responds to a false alarm shall report
the same to his superior, that is, the Chief of Northern Regional Police
(hereafter called Chief of Police) or to the Fire Commissioner, as the case may
be, who shall monitor and maintain records concerning such false alarms.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â When any alarm system shall have created three false alarms in any
calendar year, the Chief of Police or the Fire Commissioner, as the case may
be, shall notify the owner of the system that any further false alarms during
the calendar year shall constitute a public nuisance and that any further false
alarms during the calendar year shall result in sanctions as set forth later in
this Part.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Notice as required by this Part shall be given by the respective
Chief of Police or Fire Commissioner by mailing a certified letter with return
receipt requested, or by personal service of said notice by handling a copy of
the same to the owner of the subject property, or to an adult resident thereof.
If service is made in person, the respective Commissioner or his designee shall
file a proof of service which shall be under oath, and which shall designate
the person upon which service was made
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â For the purpose of this Part, the owner of real estate on which an
alarm system is placed and used shall be considered the owner and the person
responsible for its proper maintenance and use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â In addition to any penalty provided hereunder, upon notifying the
owner that the burglar alarm system constitutes a public nuisance, the Chief of
Police or the Fire Commissioner, as the case may be, shall also notify York
County Control and any other agency handling the system and advise such agency
that the system has been declared a public nuisance and that the system should
be disconnected and no longer used.
(Ord. 91-1, 9/9/1991, Â§ 5.41)
Â§ 10-102.Â Â Â Unlawful Uses of Fire and Burglar Alarms.
Â Â Â It shall be unlawful for any owner of property or person in charge of real
property to use or permit to be used any burglar or fire alarm system that has
previously been declared a public nuisance as provided herein. If any false
alarms shall be given by said system following the date of receipt of notice as
set forth herein, the said false alarm shall be unlawful and considered a

Â§ 10-104. Remedies Upon Notice of False Alarms.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Following notice by the appropriate municipal official that a burglar
or fire alarm system constitutes a public nuisance, the owner of said system

alarms previously caused by said system were caused by a known mechanical or
other defect within the system. Said owner may verify and shall include a
statement by competent workmen or repairmen in the field that said system was
defective and such deficiency has been corrected. Upon the filing of such
affidavit with appropriate exhibits and the payment of an annual permit fee as
hereinafter provided, the false alarm history concerning the premises shall be
considered void and of no legal effect.
Â Â Â 2. Â Â Â Where false alarms have originated from negligent use or a combination
of negligent use and a defective system, in order to terminate the finding that
the system is a public nuisance an owner shall comply with the above subsection
and, in addition, file an affidavit explaining the steps that have been taken
to correct the negligent use which has resulted in false alarms. Thereafter,
the determination of the Fire Commissioner or Chief of Police, as the case may
be, shall be of no legal effect and the system shall not be considered a public
nuisance. Subject, nevertheless, that should such system be declared a nuisance
as provided hereinabove within a 1-year period following reinstatement under
this Section, use of the said system shall terminate for a period of one year
before this Section may again be used to reinstate service.

prior consent of the Chief of Police of this Township or the Fire Commissioner,
as the case may be, before it may be utilized and the payment of an annual
permit fee in an amount as established from time to time by resolution of the
Board of Supervisors. [Ord. 2005-08]
Â Â Â 2. Â Â Â Any permission to install a burglar or fire alarm granted by the Chief

defined hereunder, then the alarm system shall be terminated also as provided
herein.

charged an administrative fee in an amount as established from time to time by
resolution of the Board of Supervisors for each false alarm in excess of three
false alarms per 12-month period. [Ord. 2005-08]
Â Â Â 2. Â Â Â  In the event that said owner of real estate fails to pay the
administrative fee set forth in subsection .1 herein, or the owner exceeds
three false alarms in a 12-month period, said owner shall be prosecuted before
a magisterial district judge in the same manner provided for the enforcement of
summary offenses under the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure. Upon

allowed by law for the punishment of summary offenses, or to a term of
imprisonment for the failure to pay a fine pursuant to the Pennsylvania Rules
of Criminal Procedure. Each false alarm occurring after notice shall constitute
a separate offense. Any other violations of this Part shall result in the
payment of a fine not exceeding $300, together with costs of suit. [Ord. 2005-
08]
Â Â Â 3. Â Â Â  In addition to the foregoing provisions, the Township in which an
alarm system has been declared a public nuisance as herein provided may bring
appropriate legal proceedings in equity or otherwise to prohibit the continued
use of such system and to collect any and all damages on behalf of the Township
resulting from the use of such system.

General Provisions
Â§ 19-101.Â Â Â Short Title.
Â Â Â This Chapter shall be known and may be cited as the â€œDover Township
Stormwater Management Ordinance.â€
(Ord. 2022-01, 7/25/2022)
Â§ 19-102.Â Â Â Statement of Findings.
Â Â Â The governing body of the Township finds that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases runoff volumes, flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying
capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public
facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines floodplain management
and flood control efforts in downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, threatens public health and safety, and increases nonpoint source
pollution of water resources.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â A comprehensive program of stormwater management (SWM), including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff,
is fundamental to the public health, safety, and welfare and the protection of
people of the Commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Stormwater is an important water resource that provides groundwater
recharge for water supplies and supports the base flow of streams.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The use of green infrastructure and low impact development (LID) are
intended to address the root cause of water quality impairment by using systems
and practices which use or mimic natural processes to: 1) infiltrate and
recharge; 2) evapotranspire; and/or 3) harvest and use precipitation near where
it falls to earth. Green infrastructure practices and LID contribute to the
restoration or maintenance of pre-development hydrology.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls called a Municipal Separate Storm
Sewer System (MS4) Program. These municipalities are required to obtain a
permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under
the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program.
(Ord. 2022-01, 7/25/2022)
Â§ 19-103.Â Â Â Purpose.
Â Â Â The purpose of this Chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
the Township and its watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing the
benefits described in Â§
19-102, through provisions designed to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim, and restore the
existing and designated uses of the waters of this Commonwealth.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Preserve natural drainage systems.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Manage stormwater runoff close to the source, reduce runoff volumes,
and mimic pre-development hydrology.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater planning
and management.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and
groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Provide proper operation and maintenance of all stormwater best
management practices (BMPs) that are implemented within the Township.
Â Â Â Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Provide standards to meet and enforce NPDES permit requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Create a platform with which to advocate and grow the use of low-
impact development procedures and green infrastructure.
Â Â Â Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Protecting people and property from the known and unknown changes to
our climate and weather patterns.
(Ord. 2022-01, 7/25/2022)
Â§ 19-104.Â Â Â Statutory Authority.
Â Â Â The Township is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect runoff
by the authority of the Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, The
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, and/or the Act of
October 4,1978, P.L. 864 (Act 167), 32 P.S. Â§Â§680.1, et seq., as amended, the
Stormwater Management Act.

Â§ 19-105.Â Â Â Applicability.
Â Â Â All regulated activities and all activities that may affect stormwater
runoff, including land development and earth disturbance activity, are subject
to regulation by this Chapter.
(Ord. 2022-01, 7/25/2022)
Â§ 19-106.Â Â Â Repealer.
Â Â Â It is the intent of this Chapter to replace in its entirety Chapter 19,
â€œStormwater Management,â€ and that the provisions of this Chapter shall control
the management of stormwater within Dover Township and shall conform to the
numbering system in
Chapter 19 of the Dover Township Code of Ordinances.
(Ord. 2022-01, 7/25/2022)
Â§ 19-107.Â Â Â Severability.
Â Â Â In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction declares any section or
provision of this Chapter invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity
of any of the remaining provisions of this Chapter.
(Ord. 2022-01, 7/25/2022)
Â§ 19-108.Â Â Â Compatibility with Other Requirements.
Â Â Â Approvals issued and actions taken under this Chapter do not relieve the
applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for
activities regulated by any other code, law, regulation, or ordinance.
(Ord. 2022-01, 7/25/2022)
Â§ 19-109.Â Â Â Erroneous Permit.
Â Â Â Any permit or authorization issued or approved based on false, misleading,
or erroneous information provided by an applicant is void without the necessity
of any proceedings for revocation. Any work undertaken or use established
pursuant to such permit or other authorization is unlawful. No action may be
taken by a board, agency, or employee of the Township purporting to validate
such a violation.
(Ord. 2022-01, 7/25/2022)
Â§ 19-110.Â Â Â Waivers.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â If the Township determines that any requirement under this Chapter
cannot be achieved for a particular regulated activity, the Township may, after
an evaluation of alternatives, approve measures other than those in this
Chapter, subject to subsections B. and C.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Waivers or modifications of the requirements of this Chapter may be
approved by the Township if enforcement will exact undue hardship because of
peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question, provided that the
modifications will not be contrary to the public interest and that the purpose
of the chapter is preserved. Cost or financial burden shall not be considered a
hardship. Modification may be considered if an alternative standard or approach
will provide equal or better achievement of the purpose of the chapter. A
request for modifications shall be in writing and accompany the stormwater
management site plan submission. The request shall provide the facts on which
the request is based, the provision(s) of the chapter involved, and the
proposed modification.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â No waiver or modification of any regulated stormwater activity
involving earth disturbance greater than or equal to one acre may be granted by
the Township unless that action is approved in advance by the Department of
Environmental Protection (DEP) or the delegated county conservation district.

listed in Appendix A of the Pennsylvania DEP Technical Manual for Sewage
Enforcement Officers (as amended or replaced from time to time by DEP).
Â Â Â Floodwayâ€“the channel of the watercourse and those portions of the adjoining
floodplains that are reasonably required to carry and discharge the 100-year
flood. Unless otherwise specified, the boundary of the floodway is as indicated
on maps and flood insurance studies provided by FEMA. In an area where no FEMA
maps or studies have defined the boundary of the 100-year floodway, it is
assumedâ€“absent evidence to the contraryâ€“that the floodway extends from the
stream to 50 feet from the top of the bank of the stream.
Â Â Â Forest management/timber operationsâ€“planning and activities necessary for
the management of forestland. These include conducting a timber inventory,
preparation of forest management plans, silvicultural treatment, cutting
budgets, logging road design and construction, timber harvesting, site
preparation, and reforestation.
Â Â Â Green infrastructureâ€“systems and practices that use or mimic natural
processes to infiltrate, evapotranspire, or reuse stormwater on the site where
it is generated.
Â Â Â HEC-RAS (Hydrological Engineering Centre - River Analysis System)â€“is a one-
dimensional hydraulic modeling program based on four types of analysis in
rivers: steady flow, unsteady flow, sediment transport, and water quality
analysis. Models simulate the flow in natural riverbeds or artificial channels
to determine water levels using various data inputs. HEC-RAS analyses are
primarily developed for flood studies and determining potential drainage
impacts to waterways.
Â Â Â Hydrologic soil group (HSG)â€“infiltration rates of soils vary widely and are
affected by subsurface permeability as well as surface intake rates. Soils are
classified into four HSGs (A, B, C, and D) according to their minimum
infiltration rate, which is obtained for bare soil after prolonged wetting. The
NRCS defines the four groups and provides a list of most of the soils in the
United States and their group classification. The soils in the area of the
development site may be identified from a soil survey report that can be
obtained from local NRCS offices or conservation district offices. Soils become
less pervious as the HSG varies from A to D (NRCS1, 2).
Â Â Â Illicit connectionâ€“any physical connection to a municipal separate storm
sewer system that can convey illicit discharges into the system.
Â Â Â Illicit dischargeâ€“any discharge to a municipal separate storm sewer that is
not composed entirely of stormwater, except non-stormwater discharges as
described in the â€œdischarges authorized by this general permitâ€ section of this
general permit. Examples of illicit discharges include dumping of motor vehicle
fluids, household hazardous wastes, grass clippings, leaf litter, animal
wastes, or unauthorized discharges of sewage, industrial waste, restaurant
wastes, or any other non-stormwater waste into a municipal separate storm sewer
system. Illicit discharges can be accidental or intentional.
Â Â Â Impaired watersâ€“surface waters that fail to attain one or more of its
designated uses under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93 and as listed in Categories 4 and
5 of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report.
Â Â Â Impervious surface (impervious area)â€“a surface that prevents the
infiltration of water into the ground. Impervious surfaces (or areas) shall
include, but not be limited to: roofs; additional indoor living spaces, patios,
garages, tongue and groove trex deck, storage sheds, and similar structures;
and any new streets, driveway, access drives, parking areas, and sidewalks. Any
areas designed to be covered by loose surfacing materials such as gravel,
stone, and/or crushed stone and intended for storage of and/or travel by
motorized or non-motorized vehicles or travel by pedestrians shall be
considered impervious. Surfaces or areas designed, constructed, and maintained
to permit infiltration as specified herein may be considered pervious. For the
purposes of this Chapter, a surface or area, such as a wooden deck with gaps
between the boards, shall not be considered impervious if such surface or area
does not diminish the capacity for infiltration of stormwater for storms up to,
and including, a two-year, 24-hour storm event.
Â Â Â Infiltration testingâ€“that testing performed with a double-ring infiltrometer

two or more existing or prospective occupants by means of, or for the purpose
of streets, common areas, leaseholds, condominiums, building groups, or other
features; (ii) any subdivision of land; (iii) development in accordance with Â§
503(1.1) of the PA Municipalities Planning Code.
Â Â Â Low impact development (LID)â€“site design approaches and small-scale
stormwater management practices that promote the use of natural systems for
infiltration, evapotranspiration, and reuse of rainwater. LID can be applied to
new development, urban retrofits, and revitalization projects. LID utilizes
design techniques that infiltrate, filter, evaporate, and store runoff close to
its source. Rather than rely on costly large-scale conveyance and treatment
systems, LID addresses stormwater through a variety of small, cost-effective
landscape features located on-site.
Â Â Â Modified rational methodâ€“the modified rational method provides a way to
calculate the hydrograph from a catchment-based on rational method C values and
the peak intensity. There is no â€œloss methodâ€ associated with the modified
rational method. The underlying assumption is that the peak intensity is
maintained for a long enough duration to reach peak flow at the outlet of the
catchment. This results in a trapezoidal hydrograph, as shown below.

acres; Q = flow, cfs; and C is runoff coefficient, dimensionless. The time to
reach the peak is based on the time of concentration in the catchment, which
the user can manually enter or calculate using a variety of methods (Rational
method). The length of the recession leg is based on the time of concentration
times a recession multiplier which is set in the calculations options. The
intensity and duration are taken from the IDF curves (tables) based on the
duration and frequency (return period) of the storm.

Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â Normally dry, open top, storage facilities should completely drain
both the volume control and rate control capacities over a period of time not
more than 72 hours from the end of the design storm.
Â Â Â 11.Â Â Â The design storm volumes to be used in the analysis of peak rates of
discharge should be obtained from the latest version of the Precipitation-
Frequency Atlas of the United States, National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service, Hydrometeorological Design

(Ord. 2022-01, 7/25/2022)
Â§ 19-303.Â Â Â Volume Controls.
Â Â Â Green infrastructure and low impact development practices provided in the
BMP Manual4 shall be utilized for all regulated activities wherever possible.
Water volume controls shall be implemented using the Design Storm Method in
subsection A. or the Simplified Method in subsection B. below. This Chapter
establishes that only the Design Storm Method may be used for regulated
activities that add greater than one-half acre of new impervious area or
disturb greater than one acre of total area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual4) is applicable to
any size of regulated activity. This method requires detailed modeling based on
site conditions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the two-year, 24-hour duration precipitation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â For modeling purposes:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Existing (predevelopment) non-forested pervious areas must be
considered meadow in good condition.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Twenty percent of existing impervious areas to be disturbed
by the project, when present, shall be considered meadow in good condition in
the model for existing conditions. Regulated activities not requiring an NDPES
permit are exempt from this requirement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual4 ) provided below is
independent of site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm Method is
not followed. This method is not applicable for regulated activities that add
greater than one-half acre of new impervious area or for projects that require
routing of stormwater storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two
inches of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious
surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it shall not
be released into the surface waters of this Commonwealth. Removal options
include reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed runoff; however, in
all cases, at least the first half-inch of the permanently removed runoff
should be infiltrated.

19-304, Rate Controls.
(Ord. 2022-01, 7/25/2022)
Â§ 19-304.Â Â Â Rate Controls.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â For computation of pre-development peak discharge rates, 20% of
existing impervious areas to be disturbed by the project, when present, shall
be considered meadow. Regulated activities not requiring an NDPES permit are
exempt from this requirement.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â For areas not covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
Stormwater Management Plan: Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed
the pre-development discharge rates for the one-, two-, five-, ten-, 25-, 50-,
and 100-year, 24-hour storm events. If it is shown that the peak rates of
discharge indicated by the post-development analysis are less than or equal to
the peak rates of discharge indicated by the pre-development analysis for one-,
two-, five-, ten-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year, 24-hour storms, then the
requirements of this Section have been met. Otherwise, the applicant shall
provide additional controls as necessary to satisfy the peak rate of discharge
requirement.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â For areas covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
Stormwater Management Plan: For the one-, two-, five-, ten-, 25-, 50-, and 100-
year, 24-hour storm events, the post-development peak discharge rates will
follow the applicable approved release rate maps. For any areas not shown on
the release rate maps, the post-development discharge rates shall not exceed
the pre-development discharge rates.
(Ord. 2022-01, 7/25/2022)
Â§ 19-305.Â Â Â Riparian Buffers.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â In order to protect and improve water quality, a riparian buffer
easement shall be created and recorded as part of any subdivision or land
development that encompasses a riparian buffer easement located, in whole or in
part, in the Dover Township designated MS4 Area.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Except as required by Chapter 102, the riparian buffer easement shall
be measured to be the greater of the limit of the 100-year floodplain or a
minimum of 35 feet from the top of the streambank (on each side).
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Minimum management requirements for riparian buffers.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Existing native vegetation shall be protected and maintained within
the riparian buffer easement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Whenever practicable invasive vegetation shall be actively removed,
and the riparian buffer easement shall be planted with native trees, shrubs and
other vegetation to create a diverse native plant community appropriate to the
intended ecological context of the site.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The riparian buffer easement shall be enforceable by the Township and
shall be recorded in the appropriate County Recorder of Deeds Office so that it
shall run with the land and shall limit the use of the property located
therein. The easement shall allow for the continued private ownership and shall
count toward the minimum lot area required by zoning.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Any permitted use within the riparian buffer easement shall be
conducted in a manner that will maintain the extent of the existing 100-year
floodplain, improve or maintain the stream stability, and preserve and protect
the ecological function of the floodplain.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â The following conditions shall apply when public and/or private
recreation trails are permitted within riparian buffers:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Trails shall be for non-motorized use only.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Trails shall be designed to have the least impact on native plant
species and other sensitive environmental features.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Septic drainfields and sewage disposal systems shall not be permitted
within the riparian buffer easement and shall comply with setback requirements
established under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 73.
(Ord. 2022-01, 7/25/2022)
Â§ 19-306.Â Â Â Design Criteria.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Off-Site Areas. Off-site areas which drain through a proposed
development site are not subject to release rate criteria when determining
allowable peak runoff rates. However, on-site drainage facilities shall be
designed to safely convey off-site flows through the development site.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â On-Site Areas. On-site areas proposed to remain undisturbed as part of
the regulated activity, including previously developed areas, shall be
considered as existing conditions.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Downstream Hydraulic Capacity Analysis. Any existing downstream
capacity hydraulic analysis shall be conducted in accordance with this Chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All downstream facilities impacted by the total site area of the
regulated facility shall be studied to determine if the facility has adequate
capacity to handle existing and proposed flows. An impacted downstream facility
is one to which the runoff from the total site area of the regulated activity
comprises more than 50% of the total flow to such a facility. The study shall
end at a perennial stream unless directed otherwise by the Municipal Engineer.
Downstream facilities include, but are not limited to, man-made or natural
swales and open channels, pipes, inlets, culverts, bridges, and roadways.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If any private facility is found to be undersized, the applicant
shall be responsible for updating the facility in coordination with the
regulated activity.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â If any public facility is found to be undersized or inadequate, the
applicant shall work with the Township or State Agency on upgrading the
facility in coordination with the regulated activity.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Regional Detention Alternatives. For certain areas within the study
area, it may be more cost-effective to provide one control facility for more
than one development site than to provide an individual control facility for
each development site. The initiative and funding for any regional runoff
control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective developers. The
design of any regional control basins must incorporate reasonable development
of the entire upstream watershed. The peak outflow of a regional basin would be
determined on a case-by-case basis using the hydrologic model of the watershed
consistent with protection of the downstream watershed areas. â€œHydrologic
modelâ€ refers to the calibrated model as developed for the stormwater
management plan.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Capacity Improvements of Local Drainage Networks. In certain instances,
local drainage conditions may dictate more stringent levels of runoff control
than those based upon protection of the entire watershed. In these instances,
if the developer could prove that it would be feasible to provide capacity
improvements to relieve the capacity deficiency in the local drainage network,
then the capacity improvements could be provided by the developer in lieu of
runoff controls on the development site. Any capacity improvements would be
designed based upon development of all areas tributary to the proposed
improvement and the capacity criteria specified in Â§
19-308. In addition, all new development upstream of a proposed capacity
improvement shall be assumed to implement the applicable runoff controls
consistent with this Chapter except that all new development within the entire
subarea(s) within which the proposed development site is located shall be
assumed to implement the developerâ€™s proposed discharge control if any.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Capacity improvements may also be provided as necessary to implement
any regional or sub-regional detention alternatives.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Where the potential for groundwater and/or surface water contamination
exists, based on the proposed use of the regulated activity, safeguards shall
be incorporated into the site.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Roof drains, and sump pumps shall discharge to infiltration or
vegetative BMPs and to the maximum extent practicable satisfy the criteria for
DIAs.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Watershed Integrity. Stormwater runoff shall not be transferred from
one watershed to another unless the watersheds are sub-watersheds of a common
watershed which join together within the perimeter of the property. The
transfer of watersheds may be permitted in the event the transfer does not
alter the peak discharge onto downstream lands or drainage easements are
acquired from the affected landowners.
Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â All storm sewer pipes, culverts, bridges, gutters, and swales
(excluding outfall structures from stormwater management facilities) conveying
water originating only from within the boundaries of the project site shall be
designed for a 25-year storm event. All other storm sewer pipes, culverts and
bridges, gutters and swales (excluding detention and retention basin outfall
structures and excluding sole access structures) conveying water originating
from off-site shall be designed for a 50-year storm event. Sole access
structures shall be designed to convey the 100- year storm event without
roadway overtopping. Drainage and access easements shall be provided to
encompass the water surface limits of the 100-year storm event throughout the
project site and to provide access from a public street to the stormwater
facility. Easements shall begin at the furthest upstream property line of the
proposed development in the watershed.
Â Â Â 11.Â Â Â The maximum water depth for aboveground storage facilities shall not
exceed six feet measured at the emergency spillway.
Â Â Â 12.Â Â Â Flow velocities from any storm sewer may not result in erosion of the
receiving channel. Adequate erosion protection shall be provided along all open
channels and at all points of discharge.
Â Â Â 13.Â Â Â For all swales, capacities, and velocities shall be computed using the
Manning Equation. The following design considerations shall be met:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Two analysis of channel velocity and stability shall be provided
with each swale design. One analysis shall be based upon the swale in an
unvegetated state with control matting and the second shall consider the
channel in permanent, designed conditions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All swales shall have a minimum slope of 1% unless otherwise
approved by the Municipal Engineer.
Â Â Â 14.Â Â Â Design Standards. Facilities within the public street right-of-way:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Storm sewer pipes, other than those used for street subbase
underdrains, shall have a minimum diameter of 15 inches. Structural
calculations that address the actual design requirements will be required where
installation conditions merit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Storm sewer pipes and culverts shall be installed with a minimum
slope of 0.5%.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Allowable pipes, culvert, and bridge materials shall be as outlined
in the Townshipâ€™s Construction and Material Specifications
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â All storm sewer crossings of streets shall not deviate by more
than15 degrees from perpendicular to the street centerline.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â All storm sewer pipes and culverts shall be laid to a minimum depth
of 12 inches from finished subgrade to the crown of the pipe in paved and
grassed areas, or more if specified by the manufacturer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Curves or angle points in pipes or box culverts without the use of
an inlet or manhole are prohibited unless pre-approved by the Township. Tee
joints, elbows, and wyes shall be limited for use in constructing underground
detention facilities, underground retention facilities, underdrain systems, and
roof leader collection systems.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Manholes, inlets, headwalls, endwalls, and end sections shall
conform to the requirements of the PennDOT, Publication 408.
Â Â Â Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Inlets shall be placed on both sides of the street at low spots, at
a maximum of 600 feet apart along a storm sewer pipe or culvert, and at points
of abrupt changes in the horizontal or vertical directions of storm sewers.
Inlets shall normally be along the curb line at or beyond the curb radius
points. Within the street right-of-way, the gutter spread based on the 25-year
storm event shall be no greater than one-half of the travel lane width and have
a maximum depth of three inches at the curb line. A parking lane shall not be
considered as part of the travel lane. In the absence of pavement markings
separating a travel lane from the parking lane, the parking lane shall be
assumed to be eight-feet-wide if parking is permitted on the street. At
intersections and access driveways, the depth of flow across the through-
streets and across the access driveways (proposed and existing) shall not
exceed one and one-half inches for the 25- year storm event. Manholes may be
substituted for inlets at locations where inlets are not required to handle
surface runoff.
Â Â Â Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Placement or use of BMPs within the public street right-of-way shall
only be allowed after municipal approval.
Â Â Â 15.Â Â Â Design Standards. Facilities outside of the public street right-of-
way:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The design of all BMP facilities shall incorporate best engineering
practices. The design engineer shall utilize all available design criteria in
the BMP Manual to meet the requirements of this Chapter and shall provide all
the necessary backup documentation with their submittal.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The BMPs must be designed to protect and maintain existing uses and
maintain the level of water quality necessary to protect those uses in all
streams, and to protect and maintain water quality in â€œspecial protectionâ€
streams, as required by statewide regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Township shall
commence until approval by the Township of a plan that ensures post-
construction stormwater discharges do not degrade the physical, chemical, or
biological characteristics of the receiving waters.
Â Â Â 16.Â Â Â Design Standards. Subsurface Infiltration Facilities:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Positive overflow must be provided in the subsurface infiltration
facility. Overflow structures or pipes must be designed to convey the inflow
capacity of the facility. Volume control credits may not be used above the
lowest invert of the positive overflow structure or pipe.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The minimum allowable distance between a subsurface infiltration
facility and structure/building/retaining wall is ten feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The subsurface infiltration facility must be located at least two
feet above any limiting zone, i.e., seasonal high groundwater table, bedrock,
or poorly infiltrating soils.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Soils with rates exceeding ten inches per hour require soil
amendments. During construction, upon reaching the subgrade of the infiltration
facility, a two-foot thick layer of soil amendments must be spread across the
entire facility bottom area, below the designed bottom of the facility. Soil
media infiltration rate must be provided upon design.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The infiltration facility must include an acceptable form of
pretreatment before stormwater enters the facility. An acceptable form of
pretreatment includes an inlet with an 18-inch sump and one-inch diameter weep
holes. Other forms of pretreatment must be approved by the Municipal Engineer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Subsurface infiltration facilities may not use a geotextile liner to
separate the storage area from the subgrade. Geotextile liners may only be used
on the sides and top. AASHTO Class 1 or Class 2 geotextile is recommended.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Subsurface infiltration facilities must contain a cleanout or
observation well at the end of any portion of underdrain. The observation well
or cleanout must be placed at the invert of the stone bed and extend up to
grade. Adequate inspection and maintenance access to the observation well or
cleanout must be provided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â H.Â Â Â In subsurface infiltration facilities that include chamber, pipe, or
other storage system, a sufficient number of access features must be provided
to efficiently inspect and maintain the infiltration area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Perforated distribution pipes must contain a bedding of at least
four inches separating the pipe and subgrade.
Â Â Â Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Infiltration testing standards set forth in
Appendix 19-C shall be followed when designing a subsurface infiltration
facility.
Â Â Â 17.Â Â Â Design Standards; Water Carrying Facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â When a pipe or culvert is intended to convey the discharge from a
stormwater management facility, its required capacity shall be computed by the
rational method and compared to the peak outflow from the stormwater facility
for the 100-year storm. The greater flow shall govern the design of the pipe or
culvert.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â When a pipe is part of a storm sewer system and crosses the roadway,
it shall be designed as a storm sewer with the same design storm as the
remainder of the drainage system.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Greater design frequencies may be justified on individual projects.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â A 100-year storm frequency may be required for design of the
stormwater collection system to ensure that the runoff from the post-
development storm is directed into the intended management facility.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â In general, inlets shall be spaced such that, based upon the
rational method, tc=five minutes and ten-year rainfall intensity, the area
contributing to the inlet shall not produce a peak runoff of greater than four
cfs. Also, inlets shall be spaced so that their efficiency, based upon
efficiency curves published by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation,
is not less than 65%.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Proposed channels or swales must be able to convey the increased
runoff associated with a proposed 100-year return period event within their
banks at velocities consistent with protection of the channels from erosion.
Acceptable velocities shall be based upon criteria included in the PADEP
Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control Program Manual.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â All other storm sewer manholes and inlets shall have smooth flow
lines grouted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Inlets shall be placed on both sides of the street at low spots and
at the upper side of street intersections to prevent stormwater from crossing
an intersection. Other devices such as high efficiency grates or perforated
pipe may be required if conditions warrant. All inlets at low points along the
roadway shall have an eight-inch curb reveal and shall be equipped with
pavement base drain extending 50 feet in either direction, parallel to the
centerline of the roadway.
Â Â Â Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Headwalls and endwalls shall be used where stormwater runoff enters
or leaves the storm sewer horizontally from a natural or man-made channel. In
all cases where drainage is picked up by means of a headwall, the pipe shall be
designed as a culvert. Inlet and outlet conditions shall be analyzed. PennDOT
type â€œdwâ€ headwalls and endwalls shall be utilized for pipes 15 inches and
larger in diameter. End sections shall be utilized for pipes smaller than 15
inches in diameter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Guards shall be provided on all intake and outfall structures as
well as outlet structures. The guard bars shall be one-half-inch diameter
galvanized bars on six-inch centers attached to the structure with three-
eighths-inch diameter stainless steel anchors. Guards shall also be provided
for any pipe opening, 18 inches in diameter or larger.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Q.Â Â Â Manholes, inlets, headwalls, and endwalls shall conform to the
requirements of the PennDOT Publication 408, as modified by the Municipal
Construction and Materials Standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â R.Â Â Â Stormwater runoff on roadways (i.e., gutter spread, lane
encroachment, etc.) shall be controlled in accordance with PennDOT Publications
13M, â€œDesign Manual,â€ Part 2, Chapter 10, and 584, â€œDrainage Manual.â€
Â Â Â 18.Â Â Â Design Standards; Detention and Retention Basins.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Permanent detention and retention basins shall be designed to meet
the following standards:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The maximum permitted depth for detention or retention basins
shall be six feet, measured from the bottom of the emergency spillway to the
lowest point in the basin.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The minimum top width of all basin embankments shall be eight
feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The maximum permitted inside side-slopes for detention or
retention basins shall be four to one vertical. Three to one vertical inside
side-slopes may be approved upon furnishing an appropriate planting schedule.
The maximum permitted outside side-slopes shall be three to one vertical and
utilize a seed mix designed for embankments. Areas for vehicle access shall be
provided and encompassed by a 20-feet-wide easement and shall have slopes no
greater than five to one vertical. The proposed vegetation shall be low
maintenance varieties.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Any stormwater management facility (i.e., detention basin)
designed to store runoff and requiring a berm or earthen embankment required or
regulated by this Chapter shall be designed to provide an emergency spillway to
handle flow up to and including the 100-year, 24-hour design storm at post-
development conditions, assuming the principal outlet structure to be clogged.
The height of the embankment must be set as to provide a minimum of one foot of
freeboard above the maximum elevation computed. Should any stormwater
management facility require a dam safety permit under PADEP 25 Pa.Code, Chapter
105, the facility shall be designed in accordance with PADEP 25 Pa.Code,
Chapter 105, and meet the regulations of PADEP 25 Pa.Code, Chapter 105,
concerning dam safety which may be required to pass storms larger than the 100-
year event.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â A cutoff trench composed of four-feet-wide of impervious
material shall be provided within all basin embankments.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Where a basin embankment is constructed using fill on an
existing 15% or greater slope, the basin must be keyed into the existing grade.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â All outlet structures and emergency spillways shall include a
non-erosive means of energy dissipation at its outlet to assure conveyance and
flow without endangering the safety and integrity of the basin and the
downstream drainage area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â Plans for infiltration must show the locations of existing and
proposed septic tank infiltration areas and wells. A minimum 25-foot separation
from on-lot disposal systems (OLDS) infiltration areas, including replacement
areas, is desired and will be evaluated by the Township on a case-by-case
basis. However, the separation shall not be less than the PADEP required ten
feet. Infiltration rates shall be based upon perk and probe tests conducted at
the site of the proposed facility.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â Above-ground infiltration facilities shall provide a means of
emergency dewatering of the facilities to the bottom elevation. If amended
soils are used in the facility bottom, an underdrain shall be placed below or
at the bottom of the amended soils to dewater the amended soils in emergency
situations.
Â Â Â 19.Â Â Â Design Standards; Rain Gardens/Bioretention Facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A rain garden/bioretention facility is an excavated shallow surface
depression or storage area created by an earthen embankment in which amended
soils are planted with specific native vegetation to treat and capture runoff.
Rain gardens shall meet the following design standards (note: any SWM facility
exceeding these design standards shall be considered a retention/detention
basin and subject to their design standards):
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The maximum ponding depth shall be 12 inches.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Infiltration testing standards set forth in
Appendix 19-C shall be followed when designing a rain garden facility.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The bottom of the rain garden storage area must be located at
least two feet above any limiting zone, i.e., seasonal high groundwater table,
bedrock, or poorly infiltrating soils.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Pretreatment shall be used in the design of the facility.
Pretreatment can include structures such as sumped and trapped inlets,
sediment/grit chambers or separators, media filters, inlet inserts, or other
appropriate prefabricated or proprietary designs to remove sediment,
floatables, and/or hydrocarbons from stormwater runoff prior to being conveyed
to a rain garden/bioretention basin. A facility may be exempt from pretreatment
at the discretion of the Municipal Engineer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Maximum side slopes for surface storage areas shall be 4(H): 1
(V).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Any stone storage systems incorporated into the rain garden
design must be separated from the soil media by a geotextile liner. A
geotextile liner shall not be used to separate the stone storage system from
the subgrade. Stone storage systems shall have a level bottom or use a terraced
system if installed along slope.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â In the event a sand layer is to be used as part of the
underground filtration/storage system. The sand must be placed between the soil
medium and stone storage. All sides of the sand must be separated by a
geotextile liner.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â The planting soil medium must have a minimum depth of 18 inches.
Planting soil shall be a loam soil capable of supporting a healthy vegetative
cover. Soils shall be amended with a composted organic material. At minimum the
organic amended soil shall be combined with 20% to 30% organic material
(compost), and 70% to 80% soil base (topsoil) free of clay. Amended soils shall
be spread throughout the bottom floor of the facility.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â Underdrains must be provided for all rain gardens and extend
throughout the entire rain garden bottom. Underdrains must be surrounded by a
stone layer with a minimum of four inches above and below the pipe.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â Rain gardens and other above ground storage facilities that are
used for volume control credits shall have an underdrain with a valve that is
to remain closed at all times unless dewatering the facility to perform
maintenance or dewatering has not occurred within the maximum allotted 72
hours.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (11)Â Â Â A sufficient number of cleanouts must be provided to access
underdrains to allow for maintenance and inspection of the underdrain pipe.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (12)Â Â Â Native plants, capable of supporting the proposed ponding
depth, shall be utilized. The designer shall refer to the PA DEP BMP manual for
a list of potential native plant species.

Â§ 19-307.Â Â Â Regulations Governing SWM Facilities.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Any stormwater facility located on State highway rights-of-way shall be
subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT).
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this Chapter that
would be located in or adjacent to waters of the Commonwealth or wetlands shall
be subject to approval by PADEP through the joint permit application process
or, where deemed appropriate by PADEP, the general permit process. When there
is a question of whether wetlands may be involved, it is the responsibility of
the developer or his agent to show that the land in question cannot be
classified as wetlands; otherwise, approval to work in the area must be
obtained from PADEP.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Any stormwater management facility located within the vicinity of a
floodplain shall be subject to approval in accordance with PADEP 25 Pa.Code,
Chapter 105, â€œFloodplain Management,â€ of PADEPâ€™s rules and regulations and the
municipal floodplain management regulations.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The design of all stormwater management facilities shall incorporate
good engineering principles and practices. The Township shall reserve the right
to disapprove any design that would result in the occupancy or continuation of
adverse hydrologic or hydraulic conditions within the watershed.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â The existing points of concentrated drainage that discharge onto
adjacent property shall not be altered without permission of the adjacent
property owner(s) and shall be subject to any applicable discharge criteria
specified in this Chapter. New proposed discharge points shall be no closer
than ten feet to the property line in which they are located.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge shall be subject to any
applicable discharge criteria in the general direction of existing discharge,
whether proposed to be concentrated or maintained as diffused drainage areas,
except as otherwise provided by this Chapter. If diffused flow is proposed to
be concentrated and discharged onto adjacent property, the developer must
document that adequate downstream conveyance facilities exist to safely
transport the concentrated discharge or otherwise prove that no erosion,
sedimentation, flooding, or other harm will result from the concentrated
discharge.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Where a development site is traversed by watercourses, 20-feet-wide
minimum drainage easements (ten feet from top of bank out) shall be provided
conforming to the line of such watercourses. The terms of the easement shall
prohibit excavation, the placing of fill or structures, and any alterations
that may adversely affect the flow of stormwater within any portion of the
easement. Also, maintaining of vegetation in a natural state within the
easement shall be required, except as approved by the appropriate governing
authority.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural
drainage ways on the site cannot adequately provide for drainage, open channels
may be constructed conforming substantially to the line and grade of such
natural drainage ways. Work within natural drainage ways shall be subject to
approval by PADEP through the joint permit application process or, where deemed
appropriate by PADEP, through the general permit process.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Roof drains, and sump pumps shall discharge to infiltration or
vegetative BMPs wherever feasible. Roof drains and sump pumps must not be
connected to streets, sanitary or storm sewers, or roadside ditches to promote
overland flow and infiltration/percolation of stormwater where advantageous to
do so. When it is more advantageous to connect directly to streets or storm
sewers, then it may be permitted on a case by case basis by the Township.
Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â Special Requirements for areas falling within defined exceptional
value and high-quality subwatersheds. The temperature and quality of water and
streams that have been declared as exceptional value and high quality is to be
maintained as defined in 25 Pa.Code, Chapter 93, â€œWater Quality Standards,â€
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection rules and regulations.
Temperature-sensitive BMPâ€™s and stormwater conveyance systems are to be used
and designed with storage pool areas and supply outflow channels and should be
shaded with trees. This will require modification of berms for permanent ponds
and the relaxation of restrictions on planting vegetation within the
facilities, provided that capacity for volumes and rate control is maintained.
At a minimum, the southern half on pond shorelines shall be planted with shade
or canopy trees within ten feet of the pond shoreline. In conjunction with this
requirement, the maximum slope allowed on the berm area to be planted is ten to
one. This will lessen the destabilization of berm soils due to root growth. A
long-term maintenance schedule and management plan for the thermal control BMPs
is to be established and recorded for all development sites within defined
exceptional value and/or high-quality subwatersheds.
Â Â Â 11.Â Â Â The use of soil amendment, or amended soil, BMP shall not be utilized
on residential use lots, except for lots which include other BMP facilities
which utilize the soil amendment included in the facility design. Such as the
use of soil amendment within infiltration basins or rain gardens.
Â Â Â 12.Â Â Â No SWM facilities shall be installed over existing utility mains or
services.

Â§ 19-308.Â Â Â Calculation Methodology.
Â Â Â Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using the
rational method, modified rational method, or a soil cover complex methodology.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Any stormwater runoff calculations involving drainage areas greater
than 200 acres, including on- and off-site areas, shall use generally accepted
calculation technique that is based on the NRCS soil cover complex method. It
is assumed that all methods will be selected by the design professional based
on the individual limitations and suitability of each method for a particular
site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The Township may allow the use of the rational method or modified
rational method to estimate peak discharges from drainage areas that contain
less than 200 acres. When using the rational method, an ascending and
descending limb factor of three and seven shall be used, respectively.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â All calculations consistent with this Chapter using the soil cover
complex method shall use the appropriate design rainfall depths. If a
hydrologic computer model such as PSRM or HEC-RAS is used for stormwater runoff
calculations, then the duration of rainfall shall be 24-hours. The SCS Rainfall
Type II curve shall be used for the rainfall distribution. Those projects
proposing infiltration structures shall utilize this method.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â When routing a detention basin, the rational method or SCS method
may be used to determine peak rates through the primary outlet structure. Only
the SCS Method may be used to determine the peak water surface elevation during
the 100-year, 24-hour design storm, dictating the height of the embankment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Underground storage facilities that solely receive stormwater and
are designed to capture and infiltrate the entire 100-year, 24-hour SCS runoff
volume may have their drainage areas removed from the overall post-development
drainage area(s).
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â For the purposes of pre-development flow rate determination,
undeveloped land, including disturbed areas, shall be considered as â€œmeadowâ€ in
good condition, unless the natural ground cover generates a lower curve number
or rational â€œCâ€ value (i.e., forest), as listed in Tables 1 and 2,
respectively.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â All calculations using the rational method shall use rainfall
intensities consistent with appropriate times of concentration for overland
flow and return periods. Times of concentration for overland flow shall be
calculated using the methodology presented in Chapter 3 of Urban Hydrology for
Small Watersheds, NRCS, TR-55 (as amended or replaced from time to time by
NRCS). Time of concentration for channel and pipe flow shall be computed using
Manningâ€™s equation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Runoff curve numbers (CN) for both existing and proposed conditions
to be used in the soil cover complex method shall be obtained from Table 1.
Â Â Â Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Runoff coefficients (c) for both existing and proposed conditions
for use in the rational method shall be obtained from Table 2.
Â Â Â Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning equation shall be
used for hydraulic computations such as the capacity of open channels, pipes,
and storm sewers. Values for Manningâ€™s roughness coefficient (n) shall be
consistent with Table 3.
Â Â Â Â Â Â K.Â Â Â The design of any stormwater detention facilities intended to meet
the performance standards of this Chapter shall be verified by routing the
design storm hydrograph through these facilities, using either manual methods
or computerized routing. Routing shall be based upon the modified PULS method;
other routing methodologies shall be subject to the approval of the Municipal
Engineer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â L.Â Â Â The stormwater collection system shall be designed using the peak
discharge computed using the rational formula.

Â§ 19-309.Â Â Â Carbonate Geology.
Â Â Â In areas of carbonate geology, a geologist shall certify to the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No stormwater management facility will be placed in, over, or
immediately adjacent to the following features:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Closer than 100-feet from sinkholes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Closer than 100-feet from closed depressions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Closer than 100-feet from caverns, intermittent lakes, or
ephemeral streams.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Closer than 50-feet from lineaments in carbonate areas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Closer than 50-feet from fracture traces.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Closer than 25-feet from bedrock pinnacles (surface or
subsurface).
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Stormwater resulting from regulated activities shall not be
discharged into sinkholes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â If the developer can prove through analysis that the project site is
an area underlain by carbonate geology, and such geologic conditions may result
in sinkhole formations, then the project site is exempt from recharge
requirements as described in Â§19-304, â€œVolume Controlâ€ However, the project
site shall still be required to meet all other standards found in this Chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â It shall be the developerâ€™s responsibility to verify if the project
site is underlain by carbonate geology. The following note shall be attached to
all stormwater management plans and signed and sealed by the developerâ€™s
registered professional : â€œI,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â , certify that the proposed
stormwater management facility (circle one) is/is not underlain by carbonate
geology.â€
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Whenever a stormwater management facility will be located in an area
underlain by carbonate geology, a geological evaluation of the proposed
location by a geologist shall be conducted to determine susceptibility to
sinkhole formation. The evaluation may include the use of impermeable liners to
reduce or eliminate the separation distances listed in the BMP manual.
Additionally, the evaluation shall, at a minimum, address soil permeability,
depth to bedrock, seasonally high groundwater table, susceptibility for
sinkhole formation, suitability of stormwater management facilities, subgrade
stability, and maximum infiltration capacity in depth of water per unit area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â A detailed soils evaluation of the project site shall be performed
to determine the suitability of recharge facilities. The evaluation shall be
performed by a qualified professional, and at a minimum, address soil
permeability, depth to bedrock, susceptibility to sinkhole formation, and
subgrade stability. The general process for designing the infiltration BMP
shall be:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Site evaluation to determine general areas of suitability for
infiltration practices.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Provide field percolation tests throughout the area proposed for
development to determine appropriate percolation rate and/or hydraulic
conductivity. At least one infiltration test must be included in each soil
group and at least one infiltration test must be conducted for each five lots
proposed for development. Infiltration tests must be taken at the location and
depth of all proposed infiltration structures.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Design infiltration structure for required storm volume based on
all available data.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Extreme caution shall be exercised where infiltration is proposed in
geologically susceptible areas such as strip mine or limestone areas. It is
also extremely important that the design professional evaluate the possibility
of groundwater contamination from the proposed infiltration/recharge facility
and recommend a hydrogeologic study be performed if necessary. Whenever a basin
will be located in an area underlain by limestone, a geological evaluation of
the proposed location shall be conducted to determine susceptibility to
sinkhole formations. The design of all facilities over carbonate formations
shall include measures to prevent groundwater contamination and, where
necessary, sinkhole formation. The infiltration requirement in the high
quality/exceptional waters shall be subject to the Departmentâ€™s 25 Pa.Code,
Chapter 93, and anti-degradation regulations. A detailed hydrogeologic
investigation may be required by the Township, and where appropriate, the
Township may require the installation of an impermeable liner in detention
basins.

Â§ 19-310.Â Â Â Erosion and Sedimentation Control Requirements.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â As required in Â§
19-301.4., whenever the vegetation and topography are to be disturbed, such
activity must be in conformance with PADEP 25 Pa.Code, Chapter 105, rules and
regulations, Part I, Subpart C, â€œProtection of Natural Resources,â€ Article II,
â€œWater Resources,â€ Chapter 102, â€œErosion Control,â€ and in accordance with the
County Conservation District.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â It is extremely important that strict erosion and sedimentation control
measures be applied surrounding infiltration structures during installation to
prevent the infiltrative surfaces from becoming clogged. Additional erosion and
sedimentation control design standards and criteria must be applied where
infiltration BMPs are proposed shall include the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from
sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase so as to maintain
their maximum infiltration capacity.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Fencing for sedimentation basins or traps must comply with Â§
19-306.18.A.(7).
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The developer shall demonstrate that the post-development hydrograph
flows during erosion and sedimentation control phase are less than or equal to
the pre-development hydrograph flows to assure the rate and volume of runoff
leaving the site is controlled for the two-, five-, and ten-year frequency
storms. All calculation methodology shall be in accordance with Â§Â§
19-308 and
19-309.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â In the event a regulated activity falls under the Chapter 102
thresholds for requiring a written erosion and sedimentation plan and/or NPDES
permit, the applicant is still required to provide suitable erosion and
sedimentation best management practices to prevent an illicit discharge caused
by erosion during a precipitation event.

successors, heirs, personal representatives and assigns, including specifically
any future lot owner (â€œLandownerâ€), and Dover Township, a Township of the
Second Class, with municipal offices at 2480 West Canal Road, Dover Township,
York County; Pennsylvania, (â€œTownshipâ€).
Â Â Â WITNESSETH
Â Â Â WHEREAS, the Landowner is the owner of real property located in Dover
Township, York County, known as
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â with a UPI No.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (the â€œPropertyâ€).
ALTERNATE 1 (to be used with a SALDO plan):
Â Â Â [WHEREAS, the Landowner is proceeding to build and develop the Property; and
Â Â Â WHEREAS, the Subdivision/Land Development Plan (â€œSubdivision Planâ€) for the
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â [Name of Subdivision] which is expressly made a
part hereof, as approved or to be approved by the Township and recorded in part
with the land records of York County, Pennsylvania, provides for the management
of stormwater within the confines of the Property pursuant to a SWM Site Plan
(the â€œSWM Site Planâ€); and]
ALTERNATE 2 (to be used when there is no SALDO plan):
Â Â Â [WHEREAS, the Landowner is proceeding to build on and/or further develop
impervious surface on the Property; and
Â Â Â WHEREAS, the SWM Site Plan (the â€œSWM Site Planâ€) which is expressly made a
part hereof, as approved or to be approved by the Township, provides for the
management of stormwater within the confines of the Property; and]
Â Â Â WHEREAS, the SWM Site Plan includes a SWM Operation and Maintenance Plan
approved by the Township (the â€œO&M Planâ€) for the Property, [PICK ONE: which is
attached hereto as Appendix A and made a part hereof - OR - which is on file at
the Township offices and made a part hereof] provides for the establishment,
operation and maintenance of SWM facilities and BMPs; and
Â Â Â WHEREAS, the Township and the Landowner agree that the health, safety and
welfare of the residents of the Township and the protection and maintenance of
water quality require that SWM facilities and BMPs be established, constructed
and maintained on the Property; and
Â Â Â WHEREAS, the Township requires, through the implementation of the Townshipâ€™s
Stormwater Management Ordinance, Ordinance No. 2011-06, as amended (the
â€œStormwater Ordinanceâ€), that SWM facilities and BMPs as required by the SWM
Site Plan and the Stormwater Ordinance be established, constructed and
adequately operated and maintained by the Landowner in accordance with the O&M
Plan.
Â Â Â NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing promises, the mutual
covenants contained herein, and the following terms and conditions, the parties
hereto agree as follows:
Â Â Â Section 1.Â Â Â Unless otherwise defined in this Agreement, the terms used
herein shall have the meaning given to them in the Stormwater Ordinance, as
amended.
Â Â Â Section 2. Â Â Â The Landowner shall establish and/or construct the SWM
facilities and BMPs in accordance with the terms, conditions and specifications
identified in the SWM Site Plan. Except when expressly allowed by the
Stormwater Ordinance, the Landowner shall not alter, modify, replace, relocate
or in any way interfere with any SWM facilities or BMPs without the prior
written permission of the Township.
Â Â Â Section 3.Â Â Â The Landowner shall adequately maintain the SWM facilities and
BMPs shown on the SWM Site Plan in good working order in accordance with the
specific O&M requirements set forth in the O&M Plan. This includes all swales,
pipes, channels built to convey and control stormwater, as well as all SWM BMP
structures, improvements, and vegetation provided to control the quantity and
quality of the stormwater. Adequate O&M is defined as good working condition,
acceptable to the Township, so those facilities are performing their design
functions and not having any adverse effects either on water quality or on
adjoining or nearby roads, structures or properties. Adequate O&M will not be
demonstrated merely by strict compliance with the SWM Site Plan or O&M Plan
where the SWM Site Plan and O&M Plan are inadequate for stormwater management
in the field.
Â Â Â Section 4.Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The Landowner hereby grants to the Township an easement
over, along, and through the Property for the periodic inspections by the
Township and repair of the SWM facilities and BMPs, if necessary. The
Landowner, with prior notice to and approval by the Township, may choose and
periodically modify the easement location so long as the Landowner at all times
maintains or provides an unobstructed means for access to and emergency
maintenance of the SWM facilities and BMPs. The Township shall not be liable
for restoration of the Property in the event of emergency maintenance or for
any damages due to failure of the Landowner to provide unobstructed access to
the SWM facilities and BMPs. Whenever possible, the Township shall notify the
Landowner prior to entering the Property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The Township reserves the right to inspect the SWM facilities and
BMPs annually for the first five (5) years and every three (3) years thereafter
to ensure continued functioning. The Township may inspect the SWM facilities
and BMPs at more or less frequent intervals, and at other times as set out in
the Stormwater Ordinance, as amended from time to time.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â If inspections are conducted by the Township, the Township shall
give the Landowner, if requested, copies of the inspection report with findings
and evaluations. All reasonable costs for inspections of SWM facilities and
BMPs shall be borne by the Landowner and payable to the Township.
Â Â Â Section 5.Â Â Â In the event the Landowner fails to maintain the SWM facilities
and/or BMPs in accordance with Section 3 after thirty (30) days written notice
to do so (unless in the case of an emergency), the Township or its
representatives may enter upon the Property and take whatever action is deemed
necessary to maintain the SWM facilities and BMPs. It is expressly understood
and agreed that the Township is under no obligation to maintain or repair said
SWM facilities and BMPs, and in no event shall this Agreement be construed to
impose any such obligation on the Township. The Landowner shall be responsible
to provide the Township with a current mailing address if different than the
address stated above.
Â Â Â Section 6.Â Â Â In the event the Township, pursuant to this Agreement, performs
work of any nature, or expends any funds in performance of said work for labor,
use of equipment, supplies, materials, and the like on account of the
Landownerâ€™s failure to perform such work, the Landowner shall reimburse the
Township upon demand, within 30 days of receipt of invoice thereof, for all
costs, including engineer and attorney fees, incurred by the Township
hereunder. If not paid within said 30-day period, the Township may enter a
municipal lien against the property in the amount of such costs, or may proceed
to recover his costs through proceedings in equity or at law as authorized
under the provisions of the Municipal Claims and Tax Lien Act, 53 P.S.Â§ 7101 et
seq.
Â Â Â Section 7.Â Â Â The Landowner hereby releases, indemnifies and holds harmless
the Township, its supervisors, employees, officers, agents and representatives,
from all damages, accidents, casualties, occurrences or claims which might
arise or be asserted against said persons from the construction, presence,
existence or maintenance of the SWM facilities and BMPs by Landowner or
Township. The Township disclaims all liability for design, construction,
installation or operation defects. The grant of a permit or approval of a
subdivision and/or land development plan shall not constitute a representation,
guarantee, or warranty of any kind or liability upon the Township, its
officials, or employees. None of the conditions or covenants contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed a waiver of Townshipâ€™s rights or immunities granted
by statute.
Â Â Â Section 8.Â Â Â Should any provision of this Agreement be interpreted to
conflict with the Stormwater Ordinance, as amended or superseded, the
provisions and requirements of the Stormwater Ordinance shall control
interpretation. Should any provision of this Agreement be determined by a court
to be unenforceable, such provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to be
void; provided, however, the balance of the Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect.
Â Â Â Section 9.Â Â Â This Agreement may be recorded in the land records of York
County, Pennsylvania and shall constitute a covenant running with the Property
and/or equitable servitude, and shall be binding on the Landowner, its/his/her
successors, receivers, heirs, personal representatives and assigns, in
perpetuity. Landowner will reference this Agreement and recording information
in any deeds transferring or conveying the Property or any subdivided
outparcels thereof.
Â Â Â Section 10.Â Â Â The laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall govern the
interpretation of this Agreement. Jurisdiction and venue shall be exclusively
in the county in which the Property is located. The obligations and duties of
the Landowner under this Agreement shall be specifically enforceable by the
Township, and the Landowner agrees that a court shall have the specific
authority to order compliance with this Agreement in the form of a preliminary
injunction or other equitable relief.
Â Â Â Section 11.Â Â Â A violation or breach of this Agreement shall be deemed a
violation of the Stormwater Ordinance, as amended, which shall be subject to
all remedies and enforcement set forth therein. Landowner shall be responsible
for all costs of enforcement (including attorney fees) of this Agreement, which
costs shall be reimbursed to the Township upon demand within 30 days of the
receipt of an invoice thereof. All invoiced amounts due under this Agreement
for administration, maintenance, enforcement or otherwise that remain unpaid
after 30 days from the date of invoice shall be assessed interest at the legal
rate until paid in full.
Â Â Â Section 12.Â Â Â This Agreement may only be amended by a written amendment
executed by the party against whom enforcement is sought.
Â Â Â IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have set their hand and seals the day and
year written above.

Appendix 19-B
Disconnected Impervious Area (DIA)
B.1Â Â Â Â Â Â Rooftop Disconnection
Â Â Â Â Â Â When rooftop downspouts are directed to a pervious area that allows for
infiltration, filtration, and increased time of concentration, the rooftop may
qualify as completely or partially DIA and a portion of the impervious rooftop
area may be excluded from the calculation of total impervious area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A rooftop is considered to be completely or partially disconnected if it
meets the requirements listed below:
Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â The contributing area of rooftop to each disconnected discharge is
500 square feet or less, and
Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â The soil, in proximity of the roof water discharge area, is not
designated as hydrologic soil group â€œ0â€ or equivalent, and
Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â The overland flow path from roof water discharge area has a positive
slope of 5% or less, and
Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â The total proposed disconnection does not total an amount greater
than 5,000 square feet or does not exceed more than 5% of the tract area,
whichever is greater.
Â Â Â Â Â Â For designs that meet these requirements, the portion of the roof that
may be considered disconnected depends on the length of the overland path as
designated in Table B.1.
Table B.1: Partial Rooftop Disconnection
Length of Pervious Flow Path* Roof Area Treated as Disconnected
Table B.1: Partial Rooftop Disconnection
Length of Pervious Flow Path* Roof Area Treated as Disconnected
Â Â Â (ft)                    Â Â Â (% of contributing area)
0 â€“ 14                      0
15 â€“ 29                     20
30 â€“ 44                     40
45 â€“ 59                     60
60 â€“ 74                     80
75 or more                    100
* Flow path cannot include impervious surfaces and must be at least 15 feet
from any impervious surfaces.
Â 
B.2Â Â Â Â Â Â Pavement Disconnection
Â Â Â Â Â Â When pavement runoff is directed to a pervious area that allows for
infiltration, filtration, and increased time of concentration, the contributing
pavement area may qualify as a DIA that may be excluded from the calculation of
total impervious area. This applies generally only to small or narrow pavement
structures such as driveways and narrow pathways through otherwise pervious
areas (e.g., a walkway or bike path through a park).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Pavement is disconnected if the pavement, or area adjacent to the
pavement, meets the requirements below:
Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â The contributing flow path over impervious area is not more than 75
feet, and
Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â The length of overland flow is greater than or equal to the
contributing length, and
Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â The soil is not designated as hydrologic soil group â€œ0â€ or
equivalent, and
Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â The slope of the contributing impervious area is 5% or less, and
Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â The slope of the overland flow path is 5% or less, and
Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â The total proposed disconnection does not total an amount greater
than 5,000 square feet or does not exceed more than 5% of the tract area,
whichever is greater.
Â Â Â Â Â Â If the discharge is concentrated at one or more discrete points, no more
than 1,000 square feet may discharge to anyone point. In addition, a gravel
strip or other spreading device is required for concentrated discharges. For
nonconcentrated discharges along the edge of the pavement, this requirement is
waived; however, there must be a provision for the establishment of vegetation
along the pavement edge and temporary stabilization of the area until

INFILTRATION TESTING
Â 
C.1Â Â Â Â Â Â Infiltration BMPs shall be designed in the following manner: A
detailed soils evaluation of the project site shall be performed to determine
the suitability of recharge facilities. The evaluation shall be performed by a
qualified professional and, at a minimum, address soil permeability, depth to
bedrock, susceptibility to sinkhole formation, and subgrade stability,
seasonally high groundwater table, suitability of stormwater management
facilities and maximum infiltration capacity in depth of water per unit area.
The general process for designing the infiltration BMP shall be:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Site evaluation to determine general areas of suitability for
infiltration practices.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Infiltration tests must be taken at the location and elevation of
the facilityâ€™s bottom for each proposed practice. At least two separate tests
shall be taken at the location of each SWM facility.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â A double-ring infiltrometer test shall be used for all infiltration
tests in accordance with the current edition of the BMP Manual.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Upon completion of site evaluation and infiltration tests, the
design infiltration rate shall be determined from the tested infiltration rates
by using the geometric mean. The geometric mean, not the arithmetic mean, of
the multiple infiltration tests must be reported and used. In some situations,
a measured rate of zero may be obtained. In these cases, a default value should
be used based on one decimal digit less than the smallest detectable reading
for that particular test. For example, if the smallest detectable reading using
an infiltrometer is a 0.15 inch drop, then 0.14 inches should be substituted
for the zero reading. The geometric mean of a data set is the nth root of the
product of â€œnâ€ numbers:

Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The infiltration requirement in the high-quality/exceptional waters
shall be subject to Title 25, Chapter 93, of the Pennsylvania Code of
Regulations and the antidegradation regulations promulgated by DEP thereunder.

Part 2
Recyclable Materials
Â§ 20-201.Â Â Â Purpose of This Part.
Â Â Â The Board of Supervisors finds that the reduction of the amount of solid
waste and conservation of recyclable materials is an important public concern
and is necessary to implement the requirements of Pennsylvania and the County
plan. It shall be mandatory to recycle designated recyclable materials in the
Township of Dover, York County. This shall include any person owning, occupying
or using any property within this Municipality. The separation and collection
of used newspaper, paper, cardboard, glass, cans, plastic bottles and
vegetative yard waste for recycling from the residential, commercial and
institutional establishments in this Township will minimize the adverse
environmental effects of landfilling by reducing the need for landfills and
conserving existing landfill capacity, facilitate the implementation and
operation of other forms of resource recovery called for by the County plan,
conserve natural resources and reduce the cost of solid waste disposal
generally. The promotion and use of recyclable materials, goods produced from
recycled materials, and goods which facilitate recycling, including without
limitation, kraft paper grocery bags, will further serve the same purposes by
encouraging and facilitating recycling.

of final plans for the various phases shall subject any such phase to any and

Â§ 22-316.Â Â Â Fees.
Â Â Â The Board of Township Supervisors shall set fees, payable in advance, for
review of plans.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Such review fees may include reasonable and necessary charges by the
Townshipâ€™s professional consultants or engineer for review and report thereon
to the Township.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Such review fees shall be reasonable and in accordance with the
ordinary and customary charges by the Township Engineer or consultants for
similar service in the community, but in no event shall the fees exceed the
rate or cost charged by the Engineer or consultant to the Township when fees
are not reimbursed or otherwise imposed on applicants.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Such fees shall be based upon a schedule adopted by resolution of
the Board of Township Supervisors upon enactment of this Chapter, or as such
schedule may be amended. A copy of said fee schedule shall be available for
review at the Township office.
(Ord. 2011-05, 3/14/2011, Â§ 316)
Â§ 22-317.Â Â Â Disputes Over Fees.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â In the event the applicant disputes the amount of any such review fees,
the applicant shall, within 10 days of the billing date, pay the undisputed
amount and notify the Township of such fees that are disputed, in which case
the Township shall not delay or disapprove a subdivision or land development
application due to the applicantâ€™s request over disputed fees.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â In the event that the Township and the applicant cannot agree on the
amount of review fees which are reasonable and necessary, then the applicant
and the Township shall follow the procedure for dispute resolution as set forth
below:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â If within 20 days from the date of billing, the Township and the
applicant cannot agree on the amount of expenses which are reasonable and
necessary, then the applicant and Township shall jointly, by mutual agreement,
appoint another professional engineer licensed as such in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania to review such expenses and make a determination as to the amount
thereof which is reasonable and necessary.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The professional engineer so appointed shall hear such evidence and
review such documentation as the professional engineer in his or her sole
opinion deems necessary and render a decision within 50 days of the billing
date. The applicant shall be required to pay the entire amount determined in
the decision immediately.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â In the event that the Township and the applicant cannot agree upon
the professional engineer to be appointed within 20 days of the billing date,
then upon application of either party, the President Judge of the Court of
Common Pleas of York County (or if at the time there be no President Judge,
then the senior active judge then sitting) shall appoint such engineer, who, in
that case, shall be neither the Township engineer nor any professional engineer
who has been retained by, or performed services for, the Township or the
applicant within the preceding 5 years.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The fee of the appointed professional engineer for determining the
reasonable and necessary expenses shall be paid by the applicant if the amount
of payment required in the decision is equal to or greater than the original
bill. If the amount of payment required in the decision is less than the
original bill by $1,000 or more, the Township shall pay the fee of the
professional engineer, but otherwise the Township and the applicant shall each
pay one-half of the fee of the appointed professional engineer.

Â§ 22-401.Â Â Â Conservation Sketch Design Process.
Â Â Â Development of tracts of land consisting of 15 acres, or more, and where
required by the Dover Township Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27], must follow the conservation subdivision sketch design four-step
process used in determining the layout of open space areas, greenway land,
dwelling units, streets, stormwater management facilities, sanitary sewer
facilities and lot lines. The applicant shall submit four separate sheets
indicating the delineation of each step of the sketch design process to the
Township for review by the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors
prior to submission of a preliminary plan.
(Ord. 2011-05, 3/14/2011, Â§ 401)

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Topography. Contour line intervals shall be not more than 2
feet, determined by photogrammetry, for land and average natural slope of 10%
or less, and at intervals of not more than 5 feet for land with average slope
exceeding 10%. Ten foot intervals interpolated from U.S.G.S. published maps are
permissible beyond the parcel boundaries. Slopes between 15 and 25% and
exceeding 25% shall be clearly indicated. Slope shall be measured over three or
more 2-foot contour intervals. Topography shall be prepared by a profes sional
land surveyor or professional engineer from an actual field survey of the site
or from stereoscopic aerial photography and shall be coordinated with official
U.S.G.S. benchmarks. Datum to which contour elevations refer shall be noted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The location and delineation of wetlands, ponds, streams,

delineated.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Existing man-made features, including:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Location, dimensions, and use of existing buildings, driveways
and any other man-made features on the site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Location, names, widths, centerline courses, paving widths,
identifica tion numbers, and rights-of-way, of existing streets and alleys.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Locations of trails that have been in public use (pedestrian,
eques trian, bicycle) or are proposed on a municipal or county open space or
greenway plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Location and size of existing utilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Any easement, deed restrictions, rights-of-way, or any other
encumbrances upon the land, including location, size and ownership.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Site features or conditions such as hazardous waste, dumps,

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Locations of historically significant sites or structures on the
tract, including, but not limited to foundations, cellar holes, stone walls,
earthworks, and burial sites. Any portion of the site located within a historic
district, and historical resources identified in the municipal comprehensive
plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Planned or Proposed Features. Streets, trails, utility corridors and
other public infrastructure planned or proposed in local, regional or county
plans or official maps shall be delineated.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Open space areas shall include all environmentally sensitive areas plus
enough other open area to meet or exceed the minimum acreage requirement for
open space areas set forth in the Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27].
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The applicant shall prioritize natural and cultural resources in
terms of their highest to least suitability.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The locations and boundaries of environmentally sensitive areas
shall follow the actual boundaries of floodplains, wetlands, and steep slopes
over 25%.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The locations and boundaries of the following secondary conservation
area:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Significant habitat and species listed as endangered, threatened
or of special concern. Steep slopes 15â€“25%.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Healthy woodlands.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Hedgerows, groups of trees or other unique or significant
vegetation features.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â High quality agricultural soils.
shall be based on the priorities established above, practical considerations
given to the tractâ€™s configuration, its context in relation to resources on
adjoining properties, and the applicantâ€™s subdivision objectives. Secondary
resources with the highest significance shall be included in the open space
areas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Greenway land shall be delineated in a manner clearly indicating
greenway land boundaries as well as the types of resources included within
them.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Preferred locations for stormwater and wastewater management facilities
shall be identified using the ER/SA plan as a base map.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The design of these facilities should strive to use the natural
capacity and features of the site to facilitate the management of stormwater
and wastewater generated by the proposal.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Opportunities to use these facilities as a buffer between the
proposed open space areas and greenway land and development areas are
encouraged.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Stormwater management facilities should be located in areas
identified as groundwater recharges areas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Wastewater facilities shall comply with the requirements of the
Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27] and the municipal sewerage facilities plan update.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â These facilities located within the greenway land may be counted
toward the minimum common open space requirement only if they meet the
requirements of Â§ 27-618.4.B of the Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27].
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Development areas constitute the remaining lands of the tract outside
open space area where dwellings, streets, and lots are to be delineated in
accordance with the following site planning and design standards and Step 2, Â§
22-403, Step 3, Â§
22-404 and Step 4, Â§
22-405.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All subdivisions and land developments shall avoid or minimize
adverse impacts on the municipalityâ€™s natural, cultural and historic resources,
as defined below and shall incorporate the following site planning and design
standards:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Groundwater Resources. This Section is intended to ensure that
the municipalityâ€™s limited groundwater resources are protected for purposes of
providing water supplies for its residents and businesses, and to protect the
base flow of the municipalityâ€™s surface waters. These regulations shall be
applied in conjunction with those provided for in other sections of this
ordinance, dealing with groundwater conservation and replenishment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The proposed subdivision and land development of any tract
shall be designed to cause the least practicable disturbance to natural
infiltra tion and percolation of precipitation to the groundwater table,
through careful planning of vegetation and land disturbance activities, and the
placement of streets, buildings and other impervious surfaces in locations
other than those identified on the existing resources and site analysis plan as
having the greatest permeability where precipitation is most likely to
infiltrate and recharge the groundwater.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Stream Valleys, Swales, Springs, and Other Lowland Areas. The
municipalityâ€™s open space plan describes and maps stream valleys (which include
stream channels and floodplains), swales, springs and other lowland areas as
resources that warrant restrictive land use controls because of flooding
hazards to human life and property, their ground water recharge functions,
their importance to water quality and the health of aquatic communities, and
their wildlife habitats. They are generally poorly suited for on-site
subsurface sewage disposal systems.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The following activities shall be minimized:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1)Â Â Â Disturbance to streams and drainage swales.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2)Â Â Â Disturbance to year-round wetlands, areas with seasonally
high water tables, and areas of surface water concentration.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3)Â Â Â Because of their extreme limitations, stream valleys,
swales and other lowland areas warrant designation as greenway lands. They may
also require adjoining buffer lands to be included in the green way, to be
determined by an analysis of the protection requirements of such areas on a
case-by-case basis. In certain instances, seasonal high water table soils may
be excluded from the greenway where it can be demonstrated that they are
suitable for low density residential uses and conventional on-site sewage
systems.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Woodlands. Woodlands occur extensively throughout the
municipality, often in association with stream valleys and wet areas, poor and
erodible agricultural soils, and moderate to steep slopes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Woodland conditions within the municipality vary with respect
to species composition, age, stocking, and health. They range from relatively
recent post-agricultural young stands to mature mixed-age forests. Most
woodlands in the municipality represent one or more of the following resource
values:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1)Â Â Â As soil stabilizers, particularly on moderate to steep
slopes, thereby controlling erosion into nearby streams, ponds, impound ments
and roads. A closely related function is their enhancement of groundwater
recharge.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2)Â Â Â As a means of ameliorating harsh microclimatic conditions,
in both summer and winter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3)Â Â Â As a source of wood products, i.e., poles, sawtimber,
veneer and firewood.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 4)Â Â Â As habitats for woodland birds, mammals and other wildlife.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 5)Â Â Â As recreation resources for walkers, equestrians,
picnickers and other related outdoor activities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 6)Â Â Â As visual buffers between areas of development and adjacent
roads and properties.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Because of their resource values, all woodlands on any tract
proposed for subdivision or land development shall be evaluated by the
applicant to determine the extent to which such woodlands should be designated
partly or entirely as greenway or development lands. Evalua tion criteria shall
include:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1)Â Â Â Configuration and size.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2)Â Â Â Present conditions, i.e., stocking, health and species
composi tion.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3)Â Â Â Site potential, i.e., the siteâ€™s capabilities to support
wood lands, based upon its topographic, soil and hydrologic characteristics.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 4)Â Â Â Ecological functions: i.e., in protecting steep slopes,
erodible soils, maintaining stream quality and providing for wildlife habitats.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 5)Â Â Â Relationship to woodlands on adjoining and nearby
properties and the potential for maintaining continuous woodland areas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The evaluation of the tractâ€™s woodlands shall be undertaken
by a forester, landscape architect, horticulturist or another qualified profes
sional acceptable to the municipality. This evaluation shall be submitted as a
report and made a part of the application for a preliminary plan. At a minimum,
that report shall include one or more maps indicating boundaries and conditions
of woodland areas accompanied by a report addressing the criteria in
subparagraph (1) above.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â In designing a subdivision and land development plan for any
tract, the applicant shall be guided by the following standards:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1)Â Â Â Healthy woodlands exceeding 1 acre shall be preserved and
designated as greenway areas, to the maximum extent possible. Proposed site
improvements shall be located, designed and con structed to minimize the loss
or degradation of woodland areas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2)Â Â Â Subdivisions shall be designed to preserve woodlands along
roadways, property lines and lines occurring within a site such as streams,
swales, stone fences and hedgerows. Such lines and the native vegetation
associated with them shall be preserved as buffers between adjacent properties
and between areas being subdivided within a property. Preservation shall
include ground, shrub, under story and canopy vegetation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3)Â Â Â Disturbance or removal of woodlands occupying environmen
tally sensitive areas shall be undertaken only when approved by the Board and
on a limited, selective basis to minimize the adverse impacts of such actions.
This shall include but not necessarily be limited to, vegetation performing
important soil stabilizing functions on wet soils, stream banks and sloping
lands.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 4)Â Â Â No clearing or earth disturbance (except for soil analysis
for proposed sewage disposal systems) shall be permitted on a site before the
completion of subdivision and land development agreements. The determination of
sight distance clearances along roadways shall be made graphically and not by
clearing on-site prior to final plan approval.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Upland Rural-Agricultural Areas. These areas comprise fields,
pastures, meadows, and former agricultural areas in early stages of woodlands
succession, with fences, stone walls, tree copses and hedgerows, typically
bordered by stream valleys and upland woodlands. These comprise the
municipalityâ€™s historic working landscape, dotted with historic houses, barns
and other structures. They give the municipality much of its rural character.
They also contain the greatest concentration of prime agricultural soils.
Because of their openness and high visibility, development in these areas is
likely to be most readily seen and disruptive to the historic landscape. They
sometimes provide habitat for wildlife, in conjunction with nearby woodlands
and stream valleys. However, it is recognized that these areas also frequently
offer the fewest constraints for development.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Several elements of these working landscapes lend themselves
to incorporation into the municipalityâ€™s greenway network. These include prime
agricultural soils and natural features which visually punctuate the landscape,
such as hedgerows, tree copses, stone walls, and visually prominent places such
as knolls and hilltops.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â These areas can also accommodate development, with preferred
locations being the non-prime agricultural soils and lower topographic settings
where development will be visually less obtrusive. Compact clustered
residential designs, with coordinated architectural and landscape architectural
themes, are encouraged in highly visible locations where future development
cannot be avoided (such as at the far edge of open fields).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Slopes. Moderately sloping lands (15 to 25%) and steeply sloping
lands (over 25%) are prone to severe erosion if disturbed. Erosion and the
resulting overland flow of soil sediments into streams, ponds and public roads,
are detrimental to water quality and aquatic life, and a potential hazard to
public safety.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Areas of steep slope shall be preserved in accordance with Â§
22-712 of this Chapter and as required below.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â All grading and earthmoving on slopes exceeding 15% shall be
minimized.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â No site disturbance shall be allowed on slopes exceeding 25%
except grading for a portion of a driveway accessing a single-family dwelling
when it can be demonstrated that no other routing which avoids slopes exceeding
25% is feasible.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â On slopes of 15 to 25%, the only permitted grading beyond the
terms described above, shall be in conjunction with the siting of a single-
family dwelling, its access driveway and the septic system (which should
typically be designed with a long, narrow drainage field following the land
contours).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Grading or earthmoving on all sloping lands of 15% or greater
shall not result in earth cuts or fills whose highest vertical dimension
exceeds 6 feet, except where in the judgment of the Board no reasonable
alternatives exist for construction of roads, drainage structures and other
public improvements, in which case such vertical dimensions shall not exceed 12
feet. Roads and driveways shall follow the line of existing topography to
minimize the required cut and fill. Finished slopes of all cuts and fills shall
be as required to minimize disturbance of natural grades.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Significant Natural Areas and Features. Natural areas containing
rare or endangered plants and animals, as well as other features of natural
significance exist throughout the municipality. Some of these have been
carefully documented, e.g., by the Statewide Natural Diversity Inventory,
whereas for others, only their general locations are known. Subdivision
applicants shall take all reasonable measures to protect significant natural
areas and features by incorporating them into proposed greenway areas or
avoiding their disturbance in areas proposed for development.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Historic Structures and Sites. The municipalityâ€™s documented
historical resources begin with native Indians in the early 18th century and
extend through its colonial agricultural, residential and industrial develop
ment in the late 18th and 19th centuries. Many of the municipalityâ€™s historic
structures and sites have been extensively researched and remain intact. The
municipalityâ€™s extensive historic records are maintained by its Historical
Commission.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Plans requiring subdivision and land development approval
shall be designed to protect existing historic resources of all classes. The
protection of an existing historic resource shall include the conservation of
the landscape immediately associated with and significant to that resource, to
preserve its historic context. Where, in the opinion of the Board, a plan will
have an impact upon an historic resource, the developer shall mitigate that
impact to the satisfaction of the Board by modifying the design, relocating
proposed lot lines, providing landscape buffers, or other approved means.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Municipal participation, review and approval of the
applicantâ€™s interaction with the State Historical and Museum Commission with
regard to the preservation of historic resources, as required for DEP approval
of proposed sewage disposal systems, shall be required prior to detailed final
plan approval.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â Historic Rural Road Corridors and Scenic Viewsheds. The
municipal ityâ€™s open space plan identifies a number of historic rural roads in
various parts of the municipality. All applications for subdivision and land
develop ment shall attempt to preserve the scenic visual corridors along such
roads by incorporating them into greenway areas or otherwise providing for
building setbacks and architectural designs to minimize their intrusion. In
instances, where such designs fail to satisfactorily protect corridors,
applicants will be required to provide naturalistic landscape buffers to
minimize their adverse visual impacts. The species specified for such buffers
shall be selected on the basis of an inventory of tree and shrub species found
in existing hedgerows and along wooded roadside edges in the vicinity of the
development proposal.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â Trails.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â When a subdivision or land development proposal is traversed
by or abuts an existing trail customarily used by pedestrians and/or
equestrians, the governing body may require the applicant to make provisions
for continued recreational use of the trail.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The applicant may alter the course of the trail within the
tract for which development is proposed under the following conditions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1)Â Â Â The points at which the trail enters and exits the tract
remain unchanged.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2)Â Â Â The proposed alteration exhibits quality trail design
accord ing to generally accepted principles of landscape architecture (for

shall be protected by a permanent conservation easement on the properties on
which they are located. The width of the protected area in which the trail is
located should be a minimum of 10 feet. The language of the conserva tion
easement shall be to the satisfaction of the governing body upon recommendation
of the municipal solicitor.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â An applicant may propose and develop a new trail. If said
trail is available for use by the general public and connects with an existing
trail, the land area protected for said trail may be credited toward the open
space requirement described in Â§ 27-618.4.B of the Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27].
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Trail improvements shall demonstrate adherence to principles
of quality trail design.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Trails shall have a vertical clearance of no less than 10
feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â Width of the trail surface may vary depending upon type of
use to be accommodated, but in no case shall be less than 3 feet or greater
than 6 feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â No trail shall be designed with the intent to accommodate

and 50 feet from open space area and greenway land.
(Ord. 2011-05, 3/14/2011, Â§ 403)
Â§ 22-404.Â Â Â Step 3: Alignment of Streets and Trails.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Once dwelling units have been located, applicants shall delineate a
street system that provides a safe pattern of vehicular and pedestrian access
to each dwelling unit. Streets and trails shall conform to the tractâ€™s natural
topography and provide for a safe pattern of circulation to, from and within
the tract.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Streets and driveways crossing wetlands and traversing slopes over 15%
shall be avoided to the greatest extent practicable.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Street connections are strongly encouraged in order to eliminate new
cul-de- sacs and to facilitate easy access to and from homes in different parts
of the tract and on adjoining parcels. Three way intersections shall be
preferred over 4-way intersec tions.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Lots shall generally be accessed from interior streets, rather than
from roads bordering the tract. Open space area and greenway land may be exempt
from this requirement, as determined by the governing body.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â A tentative network of trails shall be shown, where appropriate,
providing access to natural and cultural features in the open space area and
greenway land. Potential trail connections to adjacent parcels shall also be
shown in areas where a county or municipal trail network is envisioned.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Open space area and greenway land shall be consistent with the Dover
Township/Dover Borough Joint Comprehensive Plan, the Dover Township Zoning
Ordinance [
Chapter 27] and this Chapter.

Design and Construction Standards
Â§ 22-701.Â Â Â Application.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The standards of design and construction in this Part shall be used to
judge the adequacy of development proposals and shall be considered to be the
minimum criteria in achieving the purpose and objectives of this Chapter.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â In addition to the standards included herein, development proposals
shall also comply with such construction and material specifications as are or
shall be adopted by the Board of Township Supervisors and are contained in the
Dover Township Construction Specifications.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Variations or modifications to these criteria may be granted by the
Board of Township Supervisors in accordance with the provisions set forth in
Part 13 of this Chapter. Where questions should arise regarding the
interpretation of these design standards, the determination of the Board of
Township Supervisors shall prevail.
(Ord. 2011-05, 3/14/2011, Â§ 701)
Â§ 22-702.Â Â Â General Standards.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Land. No land shall be subdivided or developed for any purposes unless
adequate safeguards against flood, fire and disease have been taken to minimize
hazards to life, health, or property.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Use. The proposed use of the land in any land development must conform
to the Township Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27].
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Development. Proposed projects shall be integrated with existing and
proposed neighborhoods so that the community as a whole may develop
harmoniously and no development is to occur until a building permit is obtained
from the Building Code Official.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Natural and Historic Features. Reasonable measures shall be taken to
ensure the preservation of natural and historic features, areas and structures
as determined by Dover Township to be worthy of such preservation and to ensure
public access to such features, areas and structures, where appropriate.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Source Water Protection. Reasonable measures shall be taken to ensure
the protection of the groundwater supply within the wellhead protection area.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Conformance with Comprehensive Plan. The layout or arrangement of the
subdivision or land development shall conform to the Dover Township
Comprehensive Plan and subsequent updates and any regulations or maps adopted
in furtherance thereof.
(Ord. 2011-05, 3/14/2011, Â§ 702)
Â§ 22-703.Â Â Â Street Systems; General.
Â Â Â All streets proposed to be constructed within the Township shall conform to
the following general design requirements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Proposed streets shall be planned with regard to the existing street
system, public convenience in terms of fire protection and pedestrian traffic,
projected volumes of traffic, existing and proposed use of land on abutting
properties and future development extensions of the street systems.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Residential streets shall be so laid out as to discourage through
traffic; however, the arrangement of streets shall provide for continuation of
existing or platted streets and for proper access to adjoining undeveloped
tracts suitable for future development.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Proposed streets, which are aligned with existing streets, shall
bear the name of the existing street. In the event a proposed street is not
aligned with an existing street, it shall not bear a name similar to any
existing street located within the Township and/or the same postal service
area, regardless of the suffix street, avenue, boulevard, drive, place, court,
etc.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Streets shall be logically related to topography so as to produce
reasonable grades, satisfactory drainage and suitable building sites. A drawing
of the same scale as the subdivision plan shall be provided showing topography
and street profile as it relates to any proposed street(s) whether proposed for
dedication or to be held in private right.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The streets must be properly located and built with regard to the
proposed traffic functions as shown in the Dover Township Comprehensive Plan,
including the minimizing of through-traffic on minor streets and the protection
of major street capacities from excessive marginal access.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of
all streets and highways must conform to their functional classification as
identified in the Dover Township Comprehensive Plan, and as defined herein.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Reverse frontage shall be provided on all subdivisions abutting an
arterial, except minor subdivisions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Streets are generally described below. For design of streets, the
Dover Township Comprehensive Plan (August 22, 1994, Addendum, or as amended)
should be consulted to obtain the functional classification of a particular
street and to determine whether the street is located in the urban or rural
area. The arterial and collector streets are further classified as principal,
major or minor based on the State classification system. Again these
classifications are further identified in the Township Comprehensive Plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Urban Street. The term â€œurbanâ€ indicates that the street is
located in the Urban Growth Area as identified in the Township Comprehensive
Plan referenced above. Such streets will normally include curbs and sidewalks
and are generally wide enough to allow for on-street parking.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Rural Street. The term â€œruralâ€ indicates that the street is
located outside the Urban Growth Area in the Resource Protection Area or the
Reserve Area identified in the above-referenced Comprehensive Plan. These
streets may or may not have curbs and sidewalks. The streets are generally
designed to provide two travel lanes and adequate shoulders for emergency
stopping.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Arterial. A higher order, interregional road in the street
hierarchy. Arterial roads are intended to carry large traffic volumes at steady
speeds with minimum interruptions to traffic flow.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Collector. This classification includes highways that provide
connections with local access roads, arterials and State highways. They may
serve a traffic corridor connecting villages, small boroughs, shipping points,
mining and agricultural areas on an intra-county or township basis. Many trips
destined to such points originate in widely diffused locations and a highway in
this class function is considered a collector. Traffic volumes and trip lengths
vary greatly depending upon size and distance between localities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Local. This classification is intended to include streets that
provide direct access to abutting land and includes connections from farms,
individual residences and commercial properties to higher classes of roadways.
Trip lengths are short and operating speeds are low. Spacing between roads of
this classification and traffic volumes vary widely depending upon the
intensity of land development and the distance to population centers. In
general, this classification includes all public roads which are not included
in higher classifications.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Alley and Service Drive. This classification is intended to
include minor streets which provide secondary access to the back or side of
properties abutting a street. These streets should be designed for operating
speeds of 15 miles per hour or under.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Cul-de-Sac. This classification is intended to include streets
which have a turn-around area at their termini. Use of cul-de-sacs and will not
be permitted when other layout options are available. Use of cul-de-sacs
require specific authorization from the Board of Supervisors. Alternative
designs to the circular cul-de-sac will be considered only if they meet the
requirements of the Liquid Fuels Tax Municipal Allocation Law, 72 P.S. Â§ 2615.1
et seq., for obtaining liquid fuels tax allocations. Standards presume light
traffic at speeds under 25 miles per hour. Cul-de-sac snow storage areas shall
be required where directed by the Township Engineer. Signs to designate storage
areas shall be installed by the developer prior to street adoption.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â Dead-End Streets. Shall be prohibited, except when designed as
temporary cul-de-sac streets by the developer on his own land in order to
permit future street extensions into adjoining tracts. These temporary dead end
streets must be approved by the Township and indicated on the plans. Also, they
must be constructed with a stabilized all weather turnaround of the same radius
as that which would be required for a permanent street; the turnaround to be
removed when the street is continued.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â Half-streets will not be permitted except where dedication is
for widening of an existing publicly maintained road and the remaining half of
such ad to the full width of right-of-way required is free and clear of
existing buildings or other structures to the required setback line and the
dedication or acquisition of the remaining half street is otherwise possible.
Whenever there is an existing half-street adjacent to a tract to be developed,
then the other half of the street shall be platted and dedicated with such
tract unless otherwise determined by the Board of Supervisors.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â Private streets shall be permitted only in the agriculture and
conservation zones and shall provide access to no more than three residential
units. Such private streets shall be constructed with a minimum cartway width
of 16 feet and shall have a paved or gravel surface. Otherwise private streets
are not permitted unless they conform to the specifications and requirements of
local streets as specified in this Chapter or by approval of the Board of
Supervisors and designated as â€œopen for public access to adjacent property.â€ A
legal agreement shall be established to ensure access to all properties and to
guarantee maintenance of the street. Such agreement shall be filed and recorded
with the approved plans.
(Ord. 2011-05, 3/14/2011, Â§ 703)
Â§ 22-704.Â Â Â Street Design Criteria.

Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Slope of Banks Along Streets. The slope of banks along streets
measured perpendicular to the street center line shall be no steeper than the
following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â One foot of vertical measurement for 3 feet of horizontal
measurement for fills.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â One foot of vertical measurement for 2 feet of horizontal
measurement for cuts.

Table 22-7-2, and the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Clear Sight Triangle. Proper sight lines must be maintained at
all street intersections. Measured along the center line, there must be a clear
sight triangle of 75 feet (150 feet for arterial streets) from the point of
intersection of the two street lines, and no buildings or, obstructions or
plantings which could grow higher than 3 feet above the grade of the center
line of the streets shall be permitted in this area. Where not located within a
public right-of-way, the area shall be recorded as an easement on the plat at
the time of subdivision and/or land development.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Maximum grade within any intersection shall not exceed 4% in any
direction, and approaches to any intersection shall follow a straight course

regardless of whether private recreational facilities are also provided.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Proposed recreation areas shall:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Be easily and safely accessible from all areas of the development to
be served, have good ingress and egress, and have direct access to a public
roadway. However, no public roadways shall traverse the site(s).
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Be contiguous and regular in shape.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Have suitable topography and soil conditions for use and development
as active play areas. The Board of Supervisors may allow 25% of the site to be
comprised of floodplains, approved stormwater management facilities, and/or
slopes exceeding 3%, as defined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Develop mentâ€™s Flood Insurance Rate Maps provided that such area is otherwise
suitable for soil conditions and topography for an active play area. An
unimproved site shall be provided with a healthy and vibrant grass ground
cover, suitable for recreation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Be located and designed to conveniently access proximate public
utilities (e.g., sewer, water, power, etc.). However, no part of any overhead
utility easement, nor any above-ground protrusion of an underground utility,
should be permitted in active play areas of the site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Not include any required setback, yard, and/or open space for
adjoining lots or uses as regulated by the Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27], as part of the calculated area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Protect important natural resources (e.g., streams, ponds, wetlands,

Township shall not be accepted, unless opportunities exist to combine them with
other recreation areas.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â The Board of Supervisors, after having conferred with the Planning
Commis sion and the Recreation Board, may find dedication to be impractical
because of the size, shape location, access topography, drainage, or other
physical features of the lands, or that such dedication would adversely affect
the subdivision or land development and its future residents or occupants, or
that there is not other land area within the proposed subdivision which is
practical for dedication to the public because of size, access, topography, or
other physical characteristics. In such cases, the Board of Supervisors shall
require a payment of a fee in-lieu of land dedication.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â All approved recreation areas shall be completed and dedicated before
50% occupancy has been reached in any applicable subdivision. Withholding of
occupancy permits may occur to insure compliance with this provision.
Developers required to dedicate land for recreation shall also develop the
recreation areas according to the National Park, Recreation, and Open Space
Standards and Guidelines published by the National Recreation and Park
Association in 1983, and any succeeding updates or revisions in accordance with
other Township ordinances, and as approved by the Township Supervisors.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â In cases where the opportunity exists to combine dedicated recreation
areas, the developer shall be required to escrow funds that will pay for later
construction of facilities on a combined recreation area according to the
subdivisionâ€™s percentage contribution to the ultimate combined recreation area.
The Township will then develop the combined recreation area with the escrowed
funds when all portions thereof have been deeded over to the Township.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Actual size, number, placement and other specifications of recreation
facilities to be developed shall be in general conformance with subsection .12
herein, and as recommended by the Recreation Board and staff to the Planning
Commission and Board of Supervisors after negotiations with the developers. The
specifications of recreational facilities to be developed shall bear a
reasonable relationship to the anticipated use of the facilities by future
inhabitants of the development or subdivision.
Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â Final subdivision and/or development plans shall indicate location and
specifications of all recreation facilities to be constructed and metes, bounds
and acreage(s) of the recreation area(s).
Â Â Â 11.Â Â Â Recreation facilities shall be bonded and have improvement guarantees
posted or deposited as with other subdivision improvementsâ€“streets, sidewalks,
curbs, drainage facilities, utilities, etc.
Â Â Â 12.Â Â Â The developer shall install, as a minimum, the following number of
recreation facilities on the land which has been set aside for this purpose.
Dwelling Units Total Number of Recreational Facilities
Dwelling Units Total Number of Recreational Facilities

areas, basketball and/or volleyball courts, tennis courts, softball and/or
baseball diamonds, pavilions, soccer and/or football fields. The mix of
facilities shall be determined and approved by the Township.
Â Â Â 14.Â Â Â Fee in-lieu of payments shall be arrived at by resolutions adopted by
the Board of Supervisors that will set the average developed lot price per
acre. Amounts established shall remain in effect until a succeeding resolution
establishing other rates is adopted.
Â 
Area required (0.025 acre x average developed lot = Fee in-lieu per dwelling
per dwelling unit         price per acre          unit
Â Â Â 15.Â Â Â Fee In-Lieu-of Dedication.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All monies paid to the Township under this manner shall be kept in
an interest-bearing account identifying the recreation facilities for which the
fee was received. Interest earned on such accounts shall become funds of that
account. Funds from such accounts shall be expended only in properly allocable
portions of the cost incurred to construct specific recreation facilities for
which the funds were collected.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Upon request of any person who has paid a fee under this subsection,
the Township shall refund such fee, plus interest accumulated thereon from the
date of payment, if the Township has failed to utilize the fee paid for the
purposes set forth in this Section within 3 years from the date such fee was
paid.

Floodplain Area Regulations
Â§ 22-901.Â Â Â Purpose.
Â Â Â The specific purposes of these special provisions are:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â To regulate the subdivision or development of land within any
designated floodplain area in order to promote the general health, welfare and
safety of the community.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â To require that each subdivision lot in any designated floodplain
areas be provided with a safe building site with adequate access; and that
public facilities which serve such uses be designed and installed to preclude
flood at the time of initial construction.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â To protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuitable for
use because of flood by prohibiting the improper subdivision or development of
unprotected lands within the designated floodplain areas.
(Ord. 2011-05, 3/14/2011, Â§ 901)
Â§ 22-902.Â Â Â Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.
Â Â Â This Part supplements the Uniform Construction Code [
Chapter 5, Part 1] as well as the Township Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27] and the Floodplain Building Regulations [Chapter 4, Part 1]. To the
extent that this Part imposes greater requirements or more complete disclosure
in any respect, or to the extent that the provisions of this Part are more
restrictive, it shall be deemed and interpreted to control such other
provisions of this Chapter, the Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27], the Floodplain Building Regulations [
Chapter 4, Part 1] or the Uniform Construction Code [
Chapter 5, Part 1].
(Ord. 2011-05, 3/14/2011, Â§ 902)
Â§ 22-903.Â Â Â Design Standards and Improvements in Designated Floodplain Areas.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â General.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Where not prohibited by this or any other laws or ordinances, land
located in any designated floodplain area may be platted for development with
the provision that the developer construct all buildings and structures to
preclude flood damage in accordance with this Chapter, the Uniform Construction
Code [
Chapter 5, Part 1], the other ordinances of the Township and any other laws and
ordinances regulating such development. Specifically, FEMA regulations shall be
considered.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â No subdivision or land development, or part thereof, shall be
approved if the proposed development or improvements will individually or
collectively increases the 100-year flood elevation:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â By any height, when the subdivision or land development occurs
within an identified floodway area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â By more than 1 foot, if the subdivision or land development
occurs in any other portion of the identified floodplain area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Building sites for residences or any other type of dwelling or
accommoda tion shall not be permitted in any floodway area. Sites for these
uses may be permitted outside the floodway area in a floodplain area if the
lowest habitable floor (including basement) is elevated to the regulatory flood
elevation. If fill is used to raise the elevation of a site, the fill area
shall extend laterally for a distance of at least 15 feet beyond the limits of
the proposed structure, and access shall meet the requirements of Â§
22-903.3 below.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Building sites for nonresidential structures or buildings shall not
be permitted in any floodway area. Sites for such structures or buildings
outside the floodway in a floodplain area shall be protected as provided for in
Â§
22-903.1.C above. However, the Board of Township Supervisors may allow the
subdivision or development of areas or sites for commercial and industrial uses
at an elevation below the regulatory flood elevation if the developer otherwise
protects the area to that height, or assures that the buildings or structures
will be flood-proofed to the regulatory flood elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â If the Board of Township Supervisors determines that only a part of
a proposed plan can be safely developed, it shall limit development to that
part and shall require that development proceed consistent with this
determination.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â When a developer does not intend to develop the plan himself, and
the Board of Township Supervisors determines that additional controls are
required to ensure safe development, it may require the developer to impose
appropriate deed restrictions on the land. Such deed restrictions shall be
inserted in every deed and noted on every recorded plan.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Drainage Facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Storm drainage facilities shall be designed to convey the flow of
surface waters without damage to persons or property. The system shall insure
drainage at all points along streets, and provide positive drainage away from
buildings, on- site water supply systems and on-lot disposal sewage systems.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Plans shall be subject to the approval of the Board of Township
Supervi sors. The Board of Township Supervisors may require a primarily
underground system to accommodate frequent floods and a secondary surface
system to accommodate larger, less frequent floods. Drainage plans shall be
consistent with local and regional drainage plans. The facilities shall be
designed to prevent the discharge of excess runoff onto adjacent properties.
All drainage facilities shall be designed in accordance with Part 10 of this
Chapter and the Township Stormwater Management Ordinance [
Chapter 19].
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Streets and Driveways. The finished elevation of proposed streets and
driveways shall not be greater than 1 foot below the regulatory flood
elevation. Profiles and elevations of streets and driveways to determine
compliance with this requirement, and as required by other provisions of this
Chapter, shall be submitted with the preliminary plan. Drainage openings shall
be sufficient to discharge flood flows without unduly increasing flood heights.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Sewer Facilities. All sewage systems located in any designated
floodplain area, whether public or private, shall be floodproofed up to the
regulatory flood elevation.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Water Facilities. All water systems located in any designated
floodplain area, whether public or private, shall be floodproofed up to the
regulatory flood elevation.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Other Utilities and Facilities. All other public or private utilities
and facilities, including gas and electric, shall be elevated or floodproofed
up to the regulatory flood elevation.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Excavation and Grading. Where any excavation or grading is proposed or
where any existing trees, shrubs, or other vegetative cover will be removed,
the developer shall consult the York County Conservation District
representative concerning plans for erosion and sediment pollution control, and
to also obtain a report on the soil characteristics of the site so that
determination can be made as to the type and degree of development the site may
accommodate.
(Ord. 2011-05, 3/14/2011, Â§ 903)
Â§ 22-904.Â Â Â Application Procedures and Requirements.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Pre-application Procedures.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Prior to the preparation of any plans, it is suggested that
prospective developers consult with PADEP concerning soil suitability when on-
site sewage disposal facilities are proposed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Prospective developers shall consult the York County Conservation
District representative concerning erosion and sediment pollution control and
the effect of geologic conditions on the proposed development. At the same
time, a determina tion should be made as to whether or not any flood hazards
either exist or will be created as a result of the subdivision or development.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Preliminary Plan Requirements. The following information shall be
required as part of the preliminary plan and shall be prepared by the
appropriate responsible professional:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Name of engineer, surveyor or other qualified person responsible for
providing the information required in this Section.

Stormwater Management Plan Requirements
Â§ 22-1001.Â Â Â Scope.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A stormwater management plan (SWMP), prepared in accordance with the
Dover Township Stormwater Management Ordinance (SWM Ord.) [
Chapter 19] shall be required for each subdivision or land development plan at
the preliminary plan submittal stage. As an integral part of the SWMP, erosion
and sediment pollution control measures shall be included. A SWMP must be
approved prior to the construction of any improvements.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â All SWMPs shall be prepared and certified by the appropriate design
professional.
(Ord. 2011-05, 3/14/2011, Â§ 1001)
Â§ 22-1002.Â Â Â Content.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The SWMP shall contain all items required by the SWM Ord. [
Chapter 19].
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The subdivison or land development plan shall contain the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Staging or implementation schedule for constructing the proposed
stormwater control system.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Detailed maintenance requirements and schedule to ensure adequate
maintenance of stormwater management facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Reference to the approved SWMP including:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Title.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Preparer.

a general drainage plan for the entire tract shall be provided with the first
stage and appropriate development stages for the drainage system indicated
thereon.
(Ord. 2011-05, 3/14/2011, Â§ 1002)
Â§ 22-1003.Â Â Â Design Standards.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Design standards shall be those contained within the Stormwater
Management Ordinance [
Chapter 19].
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Basin low-flow channels shall be designed to filter sediment and
pollutants from site discharge. Appropriate vegetation should be chosen for
this purpose and the channel should meander through the basin to maximize the
amount of pollutant removal. Impervious low-flow channels are prohibited in
basins collecting more than two drainage acres. Each basin design should
include landscaping considerations, such as plant lists, to promote pollutant
removal.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Stormwater management basins with side slopes steeper than 4:1 are
prohibited.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Residential homes located in the designated growth area as defined in
the Township Comprehensive Plan and homes located in the appropriate well-head
protection areas shall be provided with roof drain seepage pits unless the soil
is determined to be unsuitable for infiltration. Suitable soil infiltration
rates would range from 2-6 inches/hour.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Subsurface infiltration shall not be permitted in areas where it will
adversely affect subsurface sewage disposal or well heads.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â All natural drainage ways and existing contouring of pre-development
drainage patterns shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible, and post-
development drainage patterns shall simulate pre-development patterns. Where
existing (on/off site) wetlands accept runoff from the site, there shall be no
reduction in the runoff volume of surface flows after development. Drainage
easements shall be provided to protect these natural drainage courses and
wetland areas.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Generally, significant horizontal and vertical alignment changes of the
collection system shall be achieved through the use of manholes and/or inlets.
Inlets shall be placed at the end of the radii of intersecting streets.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â The minimum slope for unlined, open channels shall be 2%; minimum slope
for pipes and lined channels shall be .5%.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Energy dissipaters/erosion control devices shall be placed at the
outlets of all pipes where flow velocities exceed maximum permitted channel
velocities.
Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â Vertical pipes, inlets and other surface water receiving structures
shall be installed with trash racks, or so designed to control trash
accumulation. Headwalls and endwalls, in residential areas, shall be
constructed with grates so as to limit access to open pipes.
Â Â Â 11.Â Â Â Storm sewer inlets which direct flow off-site and the last inlet prior
to a stormwater management facility shall be designed as water quality inlets
to provide sediment control and pollutant removal. All such inlets shall be
accompanied by a note on the plans concerning maintenance.
Â Â Â 12.Â Â Â In wellhead protection areas as identified on the Dover Township
Wellhead Protection Overlay Map, water quality inlets shall be provided to
collect and remove pollutants from parking lot runoff.
Â Â Â 13.Â Â Â Use of parking lots for detention storage may be approved by the Board
of Township Supervisors, after review and recommendations from the Township
Engineer.
Â Â Â 14.Â Â Â No stormwater runoff or natural drainage water shall be so diverted as
to overload existing drainage systems, or create flooding or the need for
additional drainage structures on other private properties or public lands.
(Ord. 2011-05, 3/14/2011, Â§ 1003)
Â§ 22-1004.Â Â Â Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control.
Â Â Â In those areas involving residential development where there are no new
improvements being proposed (i.e., no new streets, drainage ways, detention
ponds, etc.) and/or other stormwater management facilities, a typical
individual lot erosion and sediment pollution control plan or notation shall be
placed on the subdivision or land development plan. In all instances, the York
County Conservation Districtâ€™s require ments for submittal and review of the
erosion and sediment pollution control plan shall be met. York County
Conservation Districtâ€™s approval of the erosion and sedimentation plan must be
obtained prior to final preliminary plan approval.
(Ord. 2011-05, 3/14/2011, Â§ 1004)
Â§ 22-1005.Â Â Â Ownership and Maintenance Program.
Â Â Â Each SWMP shall contain provisions which clearly set forth the ownership and
maintenance responsibility of all temporary and permanent stormwater management
facilities and erosion and sedimentation control facilities, including:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Description of temporary and permanent maintenance requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Establishment of suitable easements for access to all facilities by
County and Township officials.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Identification of the responsible party or entity for ownership and
maintenance of both temporary and permanent stormwater management and erosion
control facilities. In meeting this requirement, the following priority is
herein established:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Maintenance by Private Entity. In cases where permanent control
facilities are owned by a private entity (such as a homeowners association),
such entity shall be responsible for maintenance. In this case, a legally
binding agreement between the entity and the Township shall be made providing
for maintenance of permanent control facilities, including the inspection by
the Township of all such facilities deemed critical to the public welfare on a
regular basis and after each major flood event.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Maintenance by Individual Lot Owners. When stormwater manage
ment facilities are located on individual lots, and when they are the responsi
bility of the landowner to maintain, a description of the facility or system
and the terms of the required maintenance shall be recorded with the approved
subdivision plan among the deed records of York County, Pennsylvania.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â If the Township determines at any time that any permanent stormwater
management facility as provided under Â§
22-1005.C(1) and (2) above has been eliminated, altered, or improperly
maintained, the owner of the property shall be advised of the corrective
measures required and given a reasonable period of time to take necessary
action. If such action is not taken by the property owner, the Township may
cause the work to be done and a lien for costs may be placed against the
property in accordance with the requirements of the Municipal Claims and Tax
Liens Act, 55 P.S. Â§ 7101 et seq.
(Ord. 2011-05, 3/14/2011, Â§ 1005)
Â§ 22-1006.Â Â Â Stormwater Management Construction Standards.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Construction standards of stormwater management and erosion control
facilities shall be in accordance with the approved plans and accompanying
specifica tions if any.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The construction details and standards of the following publications in
their most recent revision shall control.

(Ord. 2011-05, 3/14/2011, Â§ 1102)
Â§ 22-1103.Â Â Â Landscape Requirements.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The locations, dimensions and spacing of required plantings should be
adequate for their proper growth and maintenance, taking into account the sizes
of such plantings at maturity and their present and future environmental
requirements, such as wind, moisture and sunlight.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The type(s) of plantings shall be limited to species that will not
disturb or contribute to conditions hazardous to the public safety within
critical locations. Such locations include, but shall not be limited to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Public street rights-of-way.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Underground and above-ground utilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Sight triangle areas required for unobstructed views at street
intersec tions.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Obstructions to Vision. No bushes or shrubs which, when mature would
obstruct the vision of motorists, shall be permitted within any required clear
sight triangle nor within 10 feet of the right-of-way line adjacent to access
drives; and all street trees shall be kept free of branches and foliage from
the ground level to a height of at least 8 feet.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â All plant materials used shall, at the time of planting, meet minimum
size requirements as stated in Â§Â§
22-1104 and 1105.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Street Trees.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Street trees shall be planted for any subdivision or land
development where suitable street trees do not exist, as part of the design and
construction of:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â New streets.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â New sidewalks or pedestrian ways.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Existing streets, sidewalks, pedestrian ways, highways, bike
trails or path when they abut or lie within the subdivision or land
development.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Spacing. Street trees in residential developments shall be provided
at one per lot frontage or an equivalent number may be planted in an informal
arrange ment approved by the Board of Supervisors. In nonresidential
developments, street trees shall be placed at 60-foot intervals on each side of
the street.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Setback. Street trees shall be planted a minimum distance of 5 feet
outside and parallel to the right-of-way line, unless otherwise approved by the
Board of Supervisors. Trees located at intersections shall respect the clear
sight triangles.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Existing trees along a street which would be suitable as street
trees and can be counted toward the street tree requirement shall be over 4
inches in caliper (see
Figure 4) and shall be within 25 feet of the curb or road edge.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Plants shall not be placed where they might interfere with the
construction, use, or maintenance of any public or private sewage disposal
system, water supply or other utility/facility including sidewalks. Trees shall
maintain a 10-foot separation from all sanitary or storm sewers and water
lines.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â All shrubbery and plants shall have a normal habit of growth, and shall
be sound, healthy, vigorous and free of disease, insects of any form, and any
other pests and problems.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â All street and shade trees shall have a minimum trunk diameter of 2Â½
inches at a height of 6 inches above finished grade.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â All plantings shall be performed in conformance with good nursery and
landscape practices and to other standards that are established by the
Township.
Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â Requirements for the measurement, branching, grading, quality and
burlapping of all shrubbery shall follow the code of standards recommended by
the American Association of Nurserymen, Inc., in the American Standard Nursery
Stock, ANSIZ60, 1-1973, as amended.
Â Â Â 11.Â Â Â Screen Buffer. Wherever vegetative screening is being provided to meet
a screening requirement of the Township Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27], the following landscape requirements must be adhered to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Buffer yard shall be the minimum width required by the Dover
Township Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27] or greater if required to adequately accommodate the level of
screening required.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Screening between zones shall be as required in
Table 22-1103.11-1 below.

Â Â Â The type of buffer planting strips shown in the above table have been
designed to provide different levels of screening and are illustrated on the
following pages. The intent of each type of strip is as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Buffer Planting Strip #1 shall be utilized as a conceptual
buffer. The buffer will not provide full screening but will restrict the view
from the adjoining use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Buffer Planting Strip #2 shall block 50% of the view at eye
level through use of trees and shrubs at the time of planting.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Buffer Planting Strip #3 shall provide 100% opaqueness of the
adjoining use at a height of 8 feet (measured from the outside edge of the
berm) through the use of dense planting of trees and shrubs or other structural
elements. A minimum 3-foot high earthen berm with maximum 3 to 1 slopes shall
be utilized.
Â Â Â The minimum number of plant units required per 100 linear feet of planting
strip area specified. The required plant material shall be distributed over the
entire length and width of the buffer area. Buffer plant material may be
arranged symmetrically (formal) or asymmetrically (informal) and may be grouped
to form plant clusters. However, informal grouping that reflect the natural
character of the region are encouraged. Plants shall be spaced to provide
optimum growing conditions. Additional plants may be required, at the Township
Engineerâ€™s discretion, to fulfill the intent of the required visual screening.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Walls, ornamental structures, fences and berms, appropriate
vegetative material or a combination of these, not less than 6 feet in height
may be used with respect to a specific land use, or as approved by the Township
Board of Supervisors. When a fence or wall is used, 50% of the required
vegetative material may be eliminated. The remaining vegetative material shall
be divided equally with one- half placed on each side of the wall or fence.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Innovative means of screening are encouraged; however, as a
guideline to quantity of materials required, a minimum of one plant shall be
provided 12 feet on center along the property line. Straight rows of trees are
discouraged.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Windbreaks. The use of planting rows to serve as windbreaks to
control the drifting of snow across public and private thoroughfares is
encouraged.

Â Â Â 12.Â Â Â Off-Street Parking Areas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Off-street parking lots shall be screened in accordance with the
above regulations relating to buffers. Further, any parking lot within 100 feet
of a public street or intersection shall be screened with a hedge, berm or
other measure to prevent distraction or confusion from parking carsâ€™
headlights.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â No parking lot shall be located closer to a building than 6 feet to
allow adequate room for landscaping.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â No more than 20 parking spaces shall be placed in a continuous row
without an intervening planting island of at least 10 feet in width and the
length of the parking stall.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â A minimum of 10% of any parking lot facility over 2,000 square feet
in gross area (measured as a rectangular area formed by the intersection of the
outermost edges of the paving) shall be devoted to landscaping. This
landscaping shall include a minimum of one tree per 20 parking spaces and all
planting beds within a parking lot shall be surfaced in lawn or ground cover
planting.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â For any land use where the total number of parking spaces exceeds
100 stalls, the parking area shall be divided by continuous islands
perpendicular to the spaces every 128 feet (128 feet assumes four rows of
parking at 20 foot length and two aisles at 24-foot width). These divider
islands shall be a minimum of 10 feet wide.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â All areas between the street right-of-way line and parking lot shall
be planted.
Â Â Â 13.Â Â Â Pedestrian Spaces. The objectives of landscape architectural treatment
of pedestrian access shall be to promote free and safe movement of pedestrians
and bicycles into, in between, and through the proposed and existing facilities
and to provide pedestrian spaces at building entrances and nodes. The following
guidelines should be considered:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Pedestrian and bicycle access should be provided from public
roadways, parking lots, and adjacent land uses where appropriate.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The layout of pedestrian walkways should be consistent with the
overall design. In natural landscapes, walkways should meander through
plantings and berms. Formal landscapes may require long straight walkways. The
views for the pedestrian should be visually pleasing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Plantings along pathways should maximize, orient and exploit
desirable views as well as provide shade.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Benches and sitting areas along pathways should be placed where
appropriate and particularly where they can incorporate or provide views of a
significant landscape feature, recreational facility, or interesting site
design of the project.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Connections to common open space areas and facilities on adjacent
properties should be provided. Pedestrian easements between lots with a paved
walkway may be required.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Pedestrian bridges over streams, ravines, or drainage swales are
encouraged and should be required when necessary to make connections in
pedestrian systems if they can be reasonably constructed without impeding flood
waters and other anticipated flows. They are subject to all regulatory agency
permit requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Other pedestrian amenities such as kiosks, water fountains,
pedestrian scale lighting, and gazebos should be provided where appropriate.
Â Â Â 14.Â Â Â Service, Loading and Trash Disposal Areas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All service, delivery, loading and outdoor storage and trash
disposal areas shall be screened from all residential districts, public
streets, parking lots and pedestrian walkways.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â These areas shall be totally screened from the above listed places
by the use of fences, walls, berms, evergreen plant material, or a combination
of these, not less than 6 feet in height.
(Ord. 2011-05, 3/14/2011, Â§ 1103)

Improvement and Construction Assurances
Â§ 22-1201.Â Â Â Completion of Improvements or Guarantee Thereof Prerequisite to
Final Plan Approval.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â No plan shall be finally approved unless the streets shown on such plan
have been improved to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable condition,
or improved as may be required by this Chapter, and any walkways, curbs,
gutters, street lights, fire hydrants, shade trees, water mains, sanitary
sewers, storm sewers and other improvements as required by this Chapter have
been installed in accordance with this Chapter. In lieu of the completion of
any improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a plan, the
developer shall provide for the deposit with the Township of financial security
in an amount sufficient to cover the costs of such improvements or common
amenities including, but not limited to, roads, stormwater detention and/or
retention basins and other related drainage facilities, recreational
facilities, open space improvements, or buffer or screen plantings which may be
required.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â When requested by the developer, in order to facilitate financing, the
Board of Township Supervisors shall furnish the developer with a signed copy of
a resolution indicating approval of the final plan contingent upon the
developer obtaining a satisfactory financial security. The final plan or record
plan shall not be signed nor recorded until the financial improvements
agreement is executed. The resolution or letter of contingent approval shall
expire and be deemed to be revoked if the financial security agreement is not
executed within 90 days unless a written extension is granted by the Board of
Township Supervisors; such extension shall not be unreasonably withheld and
shall be placed in writing at the request of the developer.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Without limitation as to other types of financial security which the
Township may approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
Federal or Commonwealth chartered lending institution irrevocable letters of
credit and restrictive or escrow accounts in such lending institutions shall be
deemed acceptable financial security for the purposes of this Section.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Such financial security shall be posted with a bonding company or
Federal or Commonwealth chartered lending institution chosen by the party
posting the financial security, provided said bonding company or lending
institution is authorized to conduct such business within the Commonwealth.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Such bond, or other security shall provide for, and secure to the
public, the completion of any improvements which may be required on or before
the date fixed in the formal action of approval or accompanying agreement for
completion of the improvements.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of the
required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost of completion
estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for completion by the
developer. Annually, the Township may adjust the amount of financial security
by comparing the actual cost of the improvements which have been completed and
the estimated cost for completion of the remaining improvements as of the
expiration of the ninetieth day after either the original date scheduled for
completion or a rescheduled date of completion. Subsequent to said adjustment,
the Township may require the developer to post additional security in order to
assure that the financial security equals said 110%.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â The amount of financial security shall be based upon an estimate of the
cost of completion of the required improvements, submitted by an applicant or
developer and prepared by a professional engineer licensed as such by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The engineer shall certify the amount of security
to be a fair and reasonable estimate of such cost. The Board of Township
Supervisors, upon the recommendation of the Township Engineer, may refuse to
accept such estimate for good cause shown. If the applicant or developer and
the Township are unable to agree upon an estimate, then the estimate shall be
recalculated and recertified by another professional engineer licensed as such
in the Commonwealth and chosen mutually by the Township and the applicant or
developer. The estimate certified by the third engineer shall be presumed fair
and reasonable, and shall be the final estimate. In the event a third engineer
is so chosen, fees for the services of said engineer shall be paid equally by
the Township and the applicant or developer.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â If the party posting the financial security requires more than one year
from the date of posting of the financial security to complete the required
improvements, the amount of financial security may be increased by an
additional 10% for each one year period beyond the first anniversary date from
posting of financial security or to an amount not exceeding 110% of the cost of
completing the required improvements as re- established on or about the
expiration of the preceding 1-year period by using the above procedure.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â In the case where development is projected over a period of years, the
Board of Township Supervisors may authorize submission of final plan by section
or stages of development subject to such requirements or guarantees as to
improvements in future sections or stages of development as it finds essential
for the protection of any finally approved section of the development.
Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request the Board of Township
Supervisors to release or authorize the release, from time to time, such
portions of the financial security necessary for payment to the contractor or
contractors performing the work. Any such requests shall be in writing
addressed to the Board of Township Supervisors, and the Board of Township
Supervisors shall have 45 days from receipt of such request within which to
allow the Township Engineer to certify, in writing, to the Board of Township
Supervisors that such portion of the work upon the improvements has been
completed in accordance with the approved plan. Upon receipt of such
certification the Board of Township Supervisors shall authorize release by the
bonding company or lending institution of an amount as estimated by the
Township Engineer fairly representing the value of the improvements completed
or, if the Board of Township Supervisors fails to act within said 45-day
period, the Board of Township Supervisors shall be deemed to have approved the
release of funds as requested. The Board of Township Supervisors may, prior to
final release at the time of completion and certification by its engineer,
require retention of 10% of the estimated cost of the aforesaid improvements.
Â Â Â 11.Â Â Â Where the Board of Township Supervisors accepts dedication of all or
some of the requirements following completion, the Board of Township
Supervisors may require the posting of financial security to secure structural
integrity of said improvements as well as the functioning of said improvements
in accordance with the design and specifications as depicted on the final plan
for a term not to exceed 18 months from the date of acceptance of dedication.
Said financial security shall be of the same type as otherwise required in this
Section with regard to installation of such improvements, and the amount of the
financial security shall not exceed 15% of the actual cost of installation of
said improvements.
Â Â Â 12.Â Â Â If financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion of
improve ments required as a condition for the final approval of a plan as set
forth in this Section, the Township shall not condition the issuance of
building, grading or other permits relating to the erection or placement of
improvements, including buildings, upon the lots or land as depicted upon the
final plan upon actual completion of the improvements depicted upon the
approved final plan. Moreover, if said financial security has been provided,
occupancy permits for any building or buildings to be erected shall not be
withheld following the improvement of the streets providing access to and from
existing public roads to such building or buildings to a mud-free or otherwise
permanently passable condition, as well as the completion of all other
improvements as depicted upon the approved plan, either upon the lot or lots or
beyond the lot or lots in question if such improvements are necessary for the
reasonable use of or occupancy of the building or buildings.
(Ord. 2011-05, 3/14/2011, Â§ 1201)
Â§ 22-1202.Â Â Â Inspection During Construction.
Â Â Â The Board of Township Supervisors shall authorize and direct the Township
Engineer to cooperate with the applicant in arranging for the Engineerâ€™s
periodic presence at the site of the work and construction of the required
facilities and improvements during such phases thereof as in the judgment of
the Engineer will enable him to determine whether or not such construction is
in general conformity with the final plan and all Township requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No construction shall begin until after the preconstruction meeting
between the developer, the contractor, the Township Engineer/Inspector, and
others as may be requested to attend. The preconstruction meeting will be
scheduled upon request of the developer, and will only be held if all of the
above named participants are represented.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Notice shall be given to the Township at least 48 hours in advance
of commencement of any construction operation to provide for required
inspection. If construction is intermittent, separate notice will be required
each time the contractor restarts work. If scheduled work is not canceled 24
hours prior to the scheduled time or if the work is otherwise not performed,
the Engineer will be compensated for 4 hours.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â There will be full-time inspection for the installation of sanitary
sewer, water, storm sewer and roadway paving. General site work will be
inspected on a part-time basis, except when additional inspection is directed
by the Township.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â No underground pipes, structures, subgrades, binders or base courses
shall be covered until inspected and approved by the duly authorized official
of the Township. Failure in compliance with this regulation shall provide cause
for uncovering of such work, at the applicantâ€™s expense, to permit the required
inspection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â In those cases where the Township Engineer deems necessary, the
developer, through his contractor, shall retain the services of a certified
soils engineer to perform moisture and density testing in order to determine
compaction or the extent thereof as related to the requirements of such
Township construction and materials specifications as have been or may be
adopted by the Board of Township Supervisors.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The wearing course on all streets proposed to be dedicated to the
Township shall not be placed until at least 90% of the lots within the
development or a phase of the development have been built upon, or upon the
expressed desire of the Board of Township Supervisors.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Whenever any work or materials are found to be not in compliance
with the final approved preliminary plan, final plan and/or applicable Township
requirements, the Township Engineer or any other duly authorized Township
representative, will as such non-compliance becomes known notify the
contractor. If the work in question is not corrected, a written non-compliance
report will be issued to the contractor and the developer. A â€œnon-compliance
reportâ€ will serve as official notice that the work in question will not be
accepted by the Township. Upon correction of the non-complying work a
â€œcompliance reportâ€ will be issued to the contractor and the developer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â H.Â Â Â When a contractor or developer wishes to make a change to the
approved drawings, a request shall be submitted in writing to the Township
Engineer. The Township Engineer will review the request and submit their
recommendation to the Township. The Township Supervisors will act on the
request and determine whether or not a plan revision is necessary.
Â Â Â Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Whether or not such construction or work shall have been
accomplished in accordance with Township requirements shall be determined by
the Township Engineer upon the basis of his onsite inspections during such
phases thereof as in his judgment will enable him to make such determination.
The Engineer shall submit a written report to the Board of Township Supervisors
in regard thereto.
(Ord. 2011-05, 3/14/2011, Â§ 1202)
Â§ 22-1203.Â Â Â As-Built Plan.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â After final preliminary plan approval and upon the completion of all
required improvements, the applicant shall submit an as-built plan prepared by
a professional engineer or professional land surveyor. Said plan shall indicate
that the constructed improvements are in conformance with the previously
approved drawings and specifications. Said plan shall also note any and all
deviations from the previously approved drawings and specifications. The plans,
if prepared electronically, shall be so developed to be transmittable in a
format compatible with the Township GIS system the owner shall provide a shape
file, NAD 1983 datum Southcentral Pennsylvania, and a .PDF or .TIFF file. Also,
one reproducible and two copies of the as-built plan shall be filed with the
Township.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The as-built plan set shall include an overall site plan and shall be
drawn to the same scale as the final plan, certified to by the designer of the
plan, and approved by the Township Engineer. Said plan shall indicate the
actual location, dimensions, type of material and elevations of all completed
improvements, including but not limited to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Concrete monuments and other survey markers.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The edge of the cartway and top of the curb for both sides of each
street.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Sanitary sewer mains, manholes and laterals (manhole inlet, outlet
and top elevations).
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Storm sewers, inlets and culverts.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Water mains, valves, fire hydrants and appurtenances.

Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â When the developer has completed all of the required and necessary
improvements and submitted the required as-built plan, the developer shall
notify the Board of Township Supervisors, in writing, by certified or
registered mail, of the completion of the aforesaid improvements and shall send
a copy thereof to the Township Engineer.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The Board of Township Supervisors shall, within 10 days after receipt
of such notice, direct and authorize the Township Engineer to inspect all of
the required improvements.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The Township Engineer shall, thereupon, file a report, in writing, with
the Board of Township Supervisors, and shall promptly mail a copy of the same
to the developer by certified or registered mail. The report shall be made and
mailed within 30 days after receipt by the Township Engineer of the
authorization for inspection by the Board of Township Supervisors.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The report shall be detailed and shall indicate approval or rejection
of said improvements, either in whole or in part, and if said improvements, or
any portion thereof, shall not be approved or shall be rejected by the Township
Engineer, said report shall contain a statement of reason for non-approval or
rejection.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â The Board of Township Supervisors shall notify the developer, within 15
days of receipt of the Township Engineerâ€™s report, in writing by certified mail
or registered mail, of the action of the Board with relation thereto.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â If the Board of Township Supervisors or the Township Engineer fails to
comply with the time limitation provisions contained herein, all improvements
will be deemed to have been approved and the developer shall be released of all
liability, pursuant to its performance guaranty bond or other security
agreement.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â If any portion of the said improvement shall not be approved or shall
be rejected by the Board of Township Supervisors, the developer shall proceed
to complete the same, and upon completion, the same procedure of notification
as listed above shall be followed.

Â Â Â In the event that any improvements which may be required have not been
installed as provided in this Chapter or in accordance with the approved final
plan, the Board of Township Supervisors shall have the power to enforce any
corporate bond, or other security by appropriate legal and equitable remedies.
If proceeds of such bond, or other security are insufficient to pay the cost
of, installing or making repairs or corrections to all the improvements covered
by said security the Board of Township Supervisors may, at its option, install
part of such improvements in all or part of the subdivision or land development
and may institute appropriate legal or equitable action to recover the moneys
necessary to complete the remainder of the improvements. All of the proceeds,
whether resulting from the security or from any legal or equitable action
brought against the developer or both, shall be used solely for the
installation of the improve ments covered by such security, and not for any
other Township purpose.

with the inspection of improvements, the applicant shall, within 10 working
days of the date of billing, pay the undisputed amount and notify the Township
of such expenses that are disputed as unreasonable or unnecessary, in which
case the Township shall not delay or disapprove a subdivision or land
development application or any approval or permit related to development due to
the applicantâ€™s request over disputed engineer expenses.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â In the event that the Township and the applicant cannot agree on the
amount of expenses which are reasonable and necessary, then the applicant and
the Township shall follow the procedure for dispute resolution as set forth
below:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â If within 20 days from the date of billing, the Township and the
applicant cannot agree on the amount of expenses which are reasonable and
necessary, then the applicant and Township shall jointly, by mutual agreement,
appoint another professional engineer licensed as such in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania to review such expenses and make a determination as to the amount
thereof which is reasonable and necessary.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The professional engineer so appointed shall hear such evidence and
review such documentation as the professional engineer in his or her sole
opinion deems necessary and render a decision within 50 days of the billing
date. The applicant shall be required to pay the entire amount determined in
the decision immediately.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â In the event that the Township and the applicant cannot agree upon
the professional engineer to be appointed within 20 days of the billing date,
then upon application of either party, the President Judge of the Court of
Common Pleas of York County (or if at the time there be no President Judge,
then the senior active judge then sitting) shall appoint such engineer, who, in
that case, shall be neither the Township Engineer nor any professional engineer
who has been retained by, or performed services for, the Township or the
applicant within the preceding 5 years.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The fee of the appointed professional engineer for determining the
reasonable and necessary expenses shall be paid by the applicant if the amount
of payment required in the decision is equal to or greater than the original
bill. If the amount of payment required in the decision is less than the
original bill by $1,000 or more, the Township shall pay the fee of the
professional engineer, but otherwise the Township and the applicant shall each
pay one-half of the fee of the appointed professional engineer.

to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, the prior ordinance, or portion
thereof, levying a similar tax shall remain in full force and effect and shall
not be affected by the adoption of this Part. Nothing contained herein shall
affect, impair or otherwise abrogate any act done or liability incurred, nor

prosecution pending, whether or not currently initiated, to enforce any right,

of the rate and such Â½ rate shall become effective without any action on the
part of Dover Township provided, however that Dover Township and any other

agree that, instead of limiting their respective rates Â½ of the rate herein
provided, they will impose respectively different rates, the total of which
shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted under the Local Tax Enabling Act.

(Ord. 2009-08, 11/23/2009, Â§ 1)
Â§ 24-804.Â Â Â Exemptions.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Exemption. Any person whose total earned income and net profits from
all sources within the Township is less than $12,000 for any calendar year in
which the local services tax is levied is exempt from the payment of the tax
for that calendar year. In addition, the following persons are exempt from
payment of the tax:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Any person who served in any war or armed conflict in which the
United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or released under
honorable circumstances from active service if, as a result of military
service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double or quadruple amputee or
has a service connected disability declared by the United States Veteransâ€™
Administration or its successor to be a total 100% permanent disability.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Any person who serves as a member of a reserve component of the

A â€œreserve component of the armed forcesâ€ shall mean the United States Army

States Coast Guard Reserve, United States Air Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania
Army National Guard or the Pennsylvania Air National Guard.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax must
annually file an exemption certificate with the collector of the tax for the
political subdivision levying the tax and file a copy of the certificate with
the personâ€™s employer affirming that the person reasonably expects to receive
earned income and net profits from all sources within the Township of less than
$12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is filed. The
exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of all of the employeeâ€™s
last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment within the Township for the year
prior to the fiscal year for which the employee is requesting to be exempted
from the local services tax.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise
instructed by the collector of the tax for the Township the employer shall not
withhold the tax from the person during the calendar year or remainder of the
calendar year for which the exemption certificate applies. With respect to a
person who claimed an exemption from the local services tax, upon notification
to an employer by the person or by the collector of the tax for the Township,
that the person has received earned income and net profits from all sources
within the Township that are equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar
year or that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employerâ€™s payment to the person of earned income
within that Township in an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that
calendar year, an employer shall withhold the local services tax from the
person as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year from
the local services tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year the
employer shall withhold the tax for the remainder of that calendar year.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The employer shall withhold from the person, for the first payroll
period after receipt of the notification under the above paragraph, a lump sum
equal to the amount of the tax that was not withheld from the person due to the
exemption certificate filed by the person, plus the per payroll amount due for
that first payroll period.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The amount of tax withheld per payroll period for the remaining
payroll periods in that calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for
other employees.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â In the event the employment of a person subject to withholding of the
local services tax under this exception is severed in that calendar year, the
person shall be liable for any outstanding balance of tax due and the Township
may pursue collection under this Act.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Except as provided for in subsection .4 above, employers shall not be
responsible for investigating exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption
eligibility or exempting any employee from a local services tax.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Employers shall be responsible for retaining a copy of all exemption
certificates filed by employees within a given calendar year for a minimum of 3
years. Employers who have failed to withhold the local services tax from an
employee or employees, and do not have copies of the employee exemption
certificate or certificates, will be held responsible for the payment of the
local services tax as if the tax had been originally levied against the
employer.
(Ord. 2009-08, 11/23/2009, Â§ 1)
Â§ 24-805.Â Â Â Duty of Employer.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Each employer within the Township and each employer situate outside the
Township who engages in business within the Township, is hereby charged with
the duty of collecting the tax from each of the employees engaged by the
employer and performing work for the employer within the Township. Each person
subject to the tax shall be assessed a pro rata share of the tax for each
payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person for a payroll
period shall be determined by dividing the combined rate of the local services
tax levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods established
by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of determining the pro rata
share, an employer shall round down the amount of the tax collected each
payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of a dollar.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Employer collection of the local services tax shall be made on a
payroll period basis for each payroll period, beginning with the first payroll
period in which the person is engaging in an occupation.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the local
services tax or for the payment of the withheld tax money to the Township if
the failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employeeâ€™s place or places of employment, the employeeâ€™s
principal office or where the employee is principally employed.
(Ord. 2009-08, 11/23/2009, Â§ 1)
Â§ 24-806.Â Â Â Returns.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Employers are required to make and file a local services tax quarterly
return 30 days after the end of each quarter of a calendar year. The local
services tax quarterly return shall list the name, address, Social Security
number of the employee; the physical address of the employeeâ€™s place of
employment; the number of payroll periods for which the local services tax was
withheld and the amount of local services tax being remitted for each employee.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Each employer shall use his employment and payroll records from the
first day of January to March 31 each year for determining the number of
employees from whom said tax shall be deducted and paid over to the collector
on or before April 30 of the same calendar year. Supplemental reports shall be
made by each employer on or before July 31, October 31 and January 31 for new
employees as reflected on his employment and payroll records from April 1 to
June 30, July 1 to September 30 and October 1 to December 31, and payments on
these supplemental reports shall be made on or before July 31, October 31 and
January 31, respectively.
(Ord. 2009-08, 11/23/2009, Â§ 1)
Â§ 24-807.Â Â Â Persons Engaged in More than One Occupation.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â In the event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person working in
more than one political subdivision during the payroll period, the priority of
claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the following order:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The political subdivision in which a person maintains his or her
principal office or is principally employed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The political subdivision in which the person resides and works, if
the tax is levied by that political subdivision.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The political subdivision in which a person is employed and which
imposes the tax nearest in miles to the personâ€™s home.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the local services tax, if the employee provides:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A recent pay statement from a principal employer that includes the
name of the employer, the length of the payroll period and the amount of local
services tax withheld.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â A statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employeeâ€™s principal employer and the employee will notify other employers of a
change in principal place of employment within 2 weeks of its occurrence.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day
the person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. It is the
intent of this Section that no person shall be subject to the payment of the
local services tax by more than one political subdivision during each payroll
period.
(Ord. 2009-08, 11/23/2009, Â§ 1)
Â§ 24-808.Â Â Â Self-Employed Persons.
Â Â Â All self-employed persons and persons whose employer is not required to
withhold local taxes (certain State and Federal agencies) will be billed
quarterly for the local services tax. The full amount of tax must be paid by
the date indicated on such billing. If such taxpayer qualifies for a low-income
exemption, the taxpayer may complete the required exemption certificate or make
application for a refund of the tax paid.
(Ord. 2009-08, 11/23/2009, Â§ 1)
Â§ 24-809.Â Â Â Employees and Self-Employed Persons Residing Beyond the Limits of

Â Â Â All employers and self-employed persons residing or having their place of
business outside the Township but who engage in any occupation within the
Township, do by virtue thereof agree to be bound by and subject themselves to
the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under this Part with the
same force and effect as though they were residents of the Township. Further,
any person engaged in an occupation within the Township and an employee of a
non-resident employer may for the purpose of this Part be considered a self-
employed person and in the event this tax is not paid, the collector shall have
the option of proceeding against either the employer or employee for collection
of this tax as hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 2009-08, 11/23/2009, Â§ 1)
Â§ 24-810.Â Â Â Administration of Tax.

this tax and keep a record thereof showing the amount received by him from each
employer or self-employed person, together with the date the tax was received.
It shall be the duty of the collector to accept and keep a record of the
information submitted by employers relating to the number of employees subject
to the tax, the number of employees exempt from the tax, the employee exemption
certificates and refunds of the tax paid to persons and employers. It further
shall be the duty of the collector, on behalf of the Township, to provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon written request of the taxpayer.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The collector is hereby charged with the administration and enforcement
of this Part and is hereby empowered to prescribe, adopt, promulgate and
enforce rules and regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the
administration and enforcement of this Part, including provisions for the
examination of the payroll records of any employer subject to this Part; the
examination and correction of any return made in compliance with this Part; and
any payment alleged or found to be incorrect or as to which overpayment is
claimed or found to have occurred. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the
collector shall have the right to appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of York
County as in other cases provided.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return made by
an employer; or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax due. Each employer
is hereby directed and required to give the collector the means, facilities and
opportunity for such examination.
(Ord. 2009-08, 11/23/2009, Â§ 1)
Â§ 24-811.Â Â Â Suit for Collection.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â In the event any of the tax under this Part remains due or unpaid 30
days after the due date set forth above, the collector may sue for the recovery
of such tax due or unpaid together with interest and penalty.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of
6% per annum on the amount of said tax, and an additional penalty of 10% shall
be added to the flat rate of said tax for non-payment thereof. Where suit is
brought for the recovery of this tax, the person liable therefore shall, in
addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of collection, including, but
not limited to, attorneyâ€™s fees.
(Ord. 2009-08, 11/23/2009, Â§ 1)
Â§ 24-812.Â Â Â Fine and Penalty.
Â Â Â Whoever makes any false or untrue statement on any return required by this
Part, or who refuses inspection of his books, records or accounts in his
custody and control in order to determine the number of employees subject to
this tax who are in his employment, or who fails or refuses to file any return
required by this Part, or fails or refuses to pay the tax herein levied shall,
upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $600 plus costs
and, in default of payment of said fine and costs, be sentenced to a term of
imprisonment not to exceed 30 days. It is further provided that the action to
enforce the fine and penalty herein provided may be instituted against any
person in charge of the business of any employer who has failed or refused to
file a return required by this Part.
(Ord. 2009-08, 11/23/2009, Â§ 1)
Â§ 24-813.Â Â Â  Refunds.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Refunds are to be paid within 75 days of a refund request or 75 days
after the last day the employer is required to remit the local services tax for
the last quarter of the calendar year, under Â§ 9 of Act 7 of 2007, whichever is
later and shall not be subject to interest if paid within the allowed time.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Refunds shall only be provided for amounts overpaid in a calendar year
that exceed $1.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Refund Due to Duplication of Payment. If at any time during the
calendar year a taxpayer pays more than $52 in combined LST, the taxpayer may
apply for a refund of the amount over $52. The proper refund request form must
be completed and signed by the taxpayer and necessary documentation must be
included. These refunds may be processed at the time they are received, unless
there is reason to believe the Township will not receive the tax from the
employer.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â When a personâ€™s â€œearned income and net profitsâ€ only, for the calendar
year is less than the $12,000 exemption, at the end of the calendar year, any
taxpayer who qualifies may complete a refund application and include a copy of
the necessary documentation.

(Ord. 97-7, 5/27/1997, Â§ 12.8; as amended by Ord. 2005-08, 10/24/2005; by Ord.
2007-07, 9/24/2007, Â§ 2; and by Ord. 2020-02, 3/23/2020, Â§ 1)
Â§ 26-113.Â Â Â Regulations Governing Connections to the Water System.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Regulations; Ownership of Facilities and Responsibility Therefor. Upon
the request of the owner of any property within the corporate limits of the
Township, abutting upon a street wherein a water main exists or reasonably
adjacent thereto, the Township will make connection to the main at the ownerâ€™s
expense. All piping from the main to the curb shut-off shall be installed by
the Township at the ownerâ€™s expense. The meter or meter pit shall be installed
by the Township at the ownerâ€™s expense. The Township shall own and maintain the
water service line from the main to the curb stop, and shall own and maintain
the meter or meter pit. The owner shall be responsible for maintaining,
repairing or replacing the water service line from the curb stop to the
building, with the exception of the meter or meter pit. The Township reserves
the right to repair, at the ownerâ€™s expense, any leak on a customerâ€™s service
pipe from the curb stop to the meter if the owner fails to do so after written
notice from the Township. A water meter shall be installed in such piping
located inside the building or within a meter pit, if the meter is equipped
with an outside remote reading device which conforms to municipal standards.
Each new water meter shall be furnished by the Township at the expense of the
property owner. The Township shall have the right to remove any such water
meter for testing or for maintenance and may furnish in its place another meter
substantially the equal thereto as the need for such replacement may occur,
without incurring liability therefor to the owner. [Ord. 2008-05]
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Inspect. The Township shall inspect, test, adjust, maintain, and/or
replace such meters at its own expense, except that any meter damaged in
service through the negligent act or omission of the property owner or his
tenant or agent, shall be replaced by the Township at the expense of the
property owner. Meter damage resulting from freezing or back-flow of hot water
shall be considered to be the result of negligence on the part of the owner or
tenant.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Where water meters are presently installed inside buildings, the
Township may at its option require the installation of a meter with the
approved outside remote reading device. In such cases, the Township will
provide installation at its expense.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Meter Accuracy. The accuracy of the water meters on the Township's
system shall be determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the
Public Utility Commission of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Upon request of
any user, the Township will remove the meter from the premises and test the
accuracy thereof. If said meter is found to register a greater quantity of
water than passed through it, to a degree exceeding the tolerance of accuracy
prescribed by the AWWA standards for such cases, no charge shall be made for
such test, and the bills for water rendered on the basis of the registration of
said meter for a period of not more than 3 months preceding the removal thereof
may be adjusted on an equitable basis. If the said meter is found to register a
smaller quantity of water than that passed through it, or to be within the
prescribed tolerances of accuracy, a charge shall be paid by the user for the
testing of the meter in accordance with the schedule of charges adopted from
time to time by the Township. Upon prior request, the water user may witness
the water test during normal working hours.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Access to Premises. As long as water is piped to any building,
authorized personnel of the Township shall at all reasonable times have access
to the meters or service pipes to inspect, test, read, repair, remove, or
replace the same, whether or not the occupant of the building is a water user,
and such access shall not be impeded by coal, ashes, or rubbish, nor in any
other manner. Failure to provide such free access shall be cause for
termination of service until suitable access is provided.
Â Â Â 4. Â Â Â Â Estimated Bill. In the event that a customer's water meter fails to
register or is not read at the scheduled time, the Township may issue an
estimated bill for the period involved based upon the records of the same
customer's usage for comparable past periods. Any inaccuracy resulting from
failure to read a user's meter at the regularly scheduled time will be
corrected in the preparation of the bill based upon the next reading of the
meter.

Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â  In the event that the reserve capacity of any developer shall be
determined to be insufficient for the subdivision or land development during
the term of any permit, and the developer shall request additional reserve
capacity, such request shall be processed as a new application in accordance
with the provisions of Â§
26-116.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If, after 5 years from the date of final approval by the Township, a
subdivision or land development is still in need of all or a portion of the
water capacity originally reserved, the developer shall make application to the
Township for continued reserve capacity which shall be processed as a new
application in accordance with the provisions of Â§
26-116.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Transfer/Resale. A developer may not sell or transfer reserve water
capacity to other land owners without prior written approval of the Township
except if a purchaser of reserve water capacity sells the real property to
which the rights have been granted, the rights must be transferred to the
purchaser of the property with notice to the Township.

the Township. [Ord. 2005-08]
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â A separate sewer rental or charge shall be made for each type of use
made by an occupied building in accordance with the above schedule of rental
rates and charges.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The volume of water to be used for billing sewer rentals or charges in
those cases where water consumption is used as a basis of sewer rentals or
charges shall include any and all water purchased from any water company and in
addition all water obtained from any other source (wells, springs, streams,
etc. as determined: by meters installed and maintained by a water company; or
by meters installed and maintained by the Township; or by meters maintained and
installed by the owner of the occupied building, as approved by the Township;
or for estimates or measurements made by the Township, where the Township
considers metering impractical.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Exclusion from the sewer system of non-contaminated waste waters may be
required by the Township or such exclusion may be optional with the owner of
the occupied building if not required by the Township. When such waters are so
excluded, the sewer rentals or charges will be based on total water consumed,
less water excluded. Water excluded may be determined from meters installed and
maintained by the owner of the occupied building, as approved by the Township,
from estimates or measurements made by the Township, or the owner of the
occupied building may elect to measure the volume of wastes actually discharged
to the sewer system as provided for below.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â The Township may require an owner of an occupied building or the owner
of an occupied building may elect to install, pay for and maintain a meter
approved by the Township for measuring wastes discharged into the sewer system
in which case the sewer rentals or charges shall be based on the actual
quarterly volume of wastes discharged into the sewer system; said rentals or
charges shall be computed at the rate as established from time to time by
resolution of the Township. [Ord. 2005-08]
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â The measurement by two or more meters of the quantity of water used in
or on the property by one owner or user may be combined and the sewer rental or
charge billed to said owner or user as though the quantity of water was
measured by one meter if the Township so elects.

or on a property from sources other than the water company, such owner or user
shall, after a written request from the Township, at no expense to the
Township, install and maintain a water meter or meters satisfactory to the
Township, for measuring all water used other than that obtained from the water
company, and the quantity of water used to determine the sewer rental or charge
shall be the quantity of water measured by all such meters plus the quantity of
water obtained from the water company.

the sewer rental or charge because of water not entering the sewer system shall
make written application to the Township for such consideration, giving the
name and address of such person, and setting forth supporting data fully
describing other sources of water, if any, as well as the disposition of water
alleged not to be entering the sewer system. The application shall be
accompanied by a sketch to approximate scale showing the plan of the property,
the water distribution system, sewer layout, existing meters, and proposed
meters in the scheme to determine the quantity of flow entering or not entering
the sewer system. The cost of furnishing, installing and maintaining any meters
other than those utilized to measure water purchased from the water company
shall be borne by the applicant. The type, size, location, arrangement, and
maintenance of such meters shall be subject to the approval of the Township.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Additional classifications and sewer rentals or charges or
modifications of sewer rentals or charges may be established by the Township
from time to time as deemed necessary. Nothing contained herein shall be
construed as prohibiting special agreements between the Township and owners of
occupied buildings connected to the sewer system under conditions and
circumstances making special arrangements advisable and necessary.

unit of apartment-office use within the Township shall be the sum of an amount
to be established from time to time by resolution of the Township Board of for
each unmetered unit or, if metered for water consumption, a minimum in an
amount to be established from time to time by resolution of the Township Board
of Supervisors.
Â Â Â 12.Â Â Â Commercial Use. The quarterly sewer service charges for each unit of
commercial use within the Township shall be the sum of an amount to be
established from time to time by resolution of the Township Board of
Supervisors.
Â Â Â 13.Â Â Â Industrial Use. The quarterly sewer service charges for each unit of
industrial use within the Township shall be the sum of an amount to be

minimum in an amount to be established from time to time by resolution of the
Township Board of Supervisors.
Â Â Â 14.Â Â Â Measurement of Water Used from Sources Other than Water Company. In
the event an owner or user obtains part or all of the water used in or on a
property from sources other than the Township water, such owner or user may,
after written approval from the Township, at no expense to their Township
water, install and maintain a water meter or meters satisfactory to the
Township for measuring all water used other than that obtained from the
Township water and the quantity of water used to determine the sewage service
charges shall be the quantity of water measured by all such meters plus the
quantity of water obtained from the Township water. In lieu of such additional
meters the Township may establish a flat rate charge which shall be applicable
to such nonmetered water usage.

within such period. If the end of such 15 calendar day period shall fall on a
local holiday or a Sunday, payment made on or mailed and postmarked on the next
succeeding business day which is not a legal holiday shall constitute payment
within such period.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Whenever service to any occupied building shall begin after the
first day or shall terminate before the last day of any quarterly billing
period, sewer rentals or charges for such period shall be pro rated equitably,
if appropriate, for that portion of the quarterly billing period during which
such occupied building was served by the sewer system.

system initially shall provide the Township with and thereafter shall keep the
Township advised of his correct address. Failure of any person to receive
quarterly bills for sewer rentals or charges shall not be considered an excuse
for nonpayment nor shall such failure result in an extension of the period of
time during which the net bill shall be payable.

(Ord. 97-7, 5/27/1997, Â§ 12.24; as amended by Ord. 98-5, 11/23/1998, Â§ 12.24;
and by Ord. 2005-08, 10/24/2005)
Â§ 26-130.Â Â Â Industrial Wastes.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The economy and desirability of the combined treatment of industrial
waste and domestic sewage is recognized. However, not all types and quantities
of industrial waste can be so treated. Hence it shall be the established policy
of the Township to admit those types and quantities of industrial wastes that
are not harmful or damaging to the structures, processes, or operation of the
POTW, or are not specially prohibited by this Part. It is also recognized that
to provide this service, additional facilities are required, the cost of which
shall be borne by those persons receiving benefits. Additionally Township and
users shall abide by Federal pretreatment regulations.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Approval Required for Industrial Wastes. In order to control the
admission of industrial wastes, the discharge into the POTW of any industrial
waste having:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A BOD greater than 300 mg/L.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â A suspended solids concentration greater than 350 mg/L.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â An average daily flow greater than 25,000 gallons per day.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Any toxic pollutants as defined pursuant to Â§ 307 of the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq. or any hazardous wastes as
defined pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. 6901
et seq.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Any wastes which are considered by the pretreatment coordinator to
offer possibilities of harm to structures, processes, or operation of the POTW
or to have significant impact, either singly or in combination with other
wastes, on the treatment process, the quality of sludge, the systemâ€™s effluent
quality or air emissions generated by the system, shall be prohibited unless an
industrial waste permit is obtained in the manner hereinafter described. Such
permit shall be granted by the Township upon the review and approval of the
pretreatment coordinator. The Township may deny any application for an
industrial waste permit.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Survey Date Required. All users shall upon request of the pretreatment
coordinator, fill in and file with the pretreatment coordinator, a
questionnaire which furnishes pertinent information inclusive of quantity of
flow and analysis of industrial wastes discharged. Any person desiring to make
a new connection or a significant change in the quality of an existing
connection to the POTW for the purpose of discharging industrial waste shall
fill in and file with the pretreatment coordinator, a questionnaire which
furnishes pertinent information inclusive of predicted quantity of flow and
wastewater characteristics.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Industrial Waste Permits.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Any person required to obtain approval for wastes as described under
subsection .2, or who is or would be a significant industrial user is required
to obtain an industrial waste permit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In order to receive an industrial waste permit a written application
shall be filed with the pretreatment coordinator in a form prescribed. Any
person discharging industrial waste into the POTW at the time of passage of
this Part and requiring a permit shall apply within 90 days after the effective
date of this Part. All such persons are considered to have a valid permit until
such time as the Township shall act on the permit application.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Prior to the issuance or renewal of an industrial waste permit, the
applicant shall pay to Dover Township the nonrefundable sum of $50.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â No permit shall be granted to any person unless he agrees to
indemnify and to save Township, its officers, employees, and agents harmless
from any and all claims, costs, damages, and liabilities which may accrue or be
claimed to accrue by reason of the permitted waste disposal activity.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Permit holders shall comply with the conditions of the permit and
failure to do so constitutes a violation of this Part.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â A permit holder shall notify the pretreatment coordinator or waste
water treatment plant superintendent of any planned significant changes to its
operations which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its industrial
waste at least 30 days before the change. In response to such a notice the
pretreatment coordinator or waste water treatment plant superintendent may
modify the permit or require application for a new permit. For purposes of this
requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow
increases of 25% or greater and the discharge of any previously unreported
pollutants. [Ord. 2005-08]
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â A permit may be suspended or revoked in whole or in part by the
pretreatment coordinator or waste water treatment plant superintendent for
cause including, but not limited to: [Ord. 2005-08]
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Violation of any terms or conditions of the permit, Federal or
State pretreatment requirements, or this Part.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Obtaining the permit by misrepresentation or failure to disclose
fully all relevant facts.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â A change in any condition including, but not limited to, changes
in State or Federal regulations or changes in the POTW that require either a
temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the permitted discharge.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Knowingly making any false statement, representation, or
certification in any record or other document submitted or required by the
permit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Tampering with or knowingly rendering inaccurate any monitoring
device or method required to be maintained under the permit or used by the
Township to monitor the discharge.
Â Â Â Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Permit Conditions. Industrial waste permits shall be expressly
subject to all provisions of this Part and all other applicable State, Federal
and local regulations, user charges and fees and the Township industrial
pretreatment plan as may now exist or as may be modified in the future. Where
Federal or State pretreatment regulations impose additional requirements or
more stringent requirements than those state in the industrial waste permit,
these requirements and limits become part of the permit whether or not they are
stated in the permit. Obtaining an industrial waste permit does not relieve a
permit holder of the obligation to comply with all Federal and State
pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other requirements of
Federal, State, and local law. Permits shall contain the following: [Ord. 2005-
08]
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The term of the permit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A statement that the wastewater discharge permit is
nontransferable without prior notification to Township in accordance with
paragraph .K of this Section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Effluent limits based on applicable pretreatment standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Self monitoring, sampling, reporting, notification, and record-
keeping requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â A statement of applicable civil and criminal penalties for
violation of pretreatment standards and requirements, and any applicable
compliance schedule. Such schedule may not extend the time for compliance
beyond that required by applicable Federal, State or local law.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Wastewater discharge permits may contain, but need not be
limited to, the following conditions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Limits on the average and/or maximum rate of discharge, time
of discharge, and/or requirements for flow regulation and equalization.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Requirements for the installation of pretreatment technology,
pollution control, or construction of appropriate containment devices, designed
to reduce, eliminate, or prevent the introduction of pollutants into the
treatment works.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Requirements for the development and implementation of spill
control plans or other special conditions including management practices
necessary to adequately prevent accidental, unanticipated, or nonroutine
discharges.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Development and implementation of waste minimization plans to
reduce the amount of pollutants discharged to the POTW.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â The unit charge or schedule of user charges and fees for the
management of the wastewater discharged to the POTW.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Requirements for installation and maintenance of inspection
and sampling facilities and equipment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the pretreatment
coordinator to ensure compliance with this Part, and State and Federal laws,
rules and regulations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Permit Duration. An industrial waste permit shall be issued for a
specified time period not to exceed 5 years. A permit holder shall apply for
permit reissuance a minimum of 120 days prior to the expiration of the existing
permit if he desires to avoid lapses in the permit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Change in Conditions. The terms and conditions of a permit may be
subject to modification by the Township during the term of the permit should
changes in Federal or State pretreatment regulations occur or other just cause
exist. The permit holder shall be informed of any proposed changes in his
permit at least 30 days prior to the effective date of the change. Any changes
or new conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for
compliance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â K.Â Â Â Permit Transfer. Industrial waste permits may be transferred to a
new owner or user only if the permittee gives at least 30 days advance notice
to the pretreatment coordinator and the pretreatment coordinator approves the
wastewater discharge permit transfer. The notice must include a written
certification by the new owner or user which:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â States that the new owner and/or user has no immediate intent to
change the facilityâ€™s operations and processes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing
industrial waste permit. Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer
renders the industrial waste permit void as of the date of facility transfer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â L.Â Â Â Certification of Reports. All industrial waste permit applications
and user reports must be signed by an authorized representative of the user and
contain the following certification statement:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â€œI certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments
were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system
designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the
information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage
the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the
information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and
belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant
penalties for submitting false information, including possibility of fine and
imprisonment for knowing violations.â€
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Reporting, Sampling and Testing. The holder of an industrial waste
permit shall furnish the pretreatment coordinator with written and signed
reports of sample testing at a frequency specified in the industrial waste
permit. Samples shall be collected, preserved, and analyzed promptly in
accordance to 40 CFR, Part 136. Users shall also furnish other reports as
required by Federal or State pretreatment regulations.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Control Manhole. Any person discharging industrial waste into the POTW
shall construct and maintain at his expense a suitable control manhole or
manholes downstream from any treatment works to facilitate observation,
measurement, and sampling of all wastes from the facilities. The control
manhole or manholes shall be located and built in a manner approved by the
pretreatment coordinator. The control manhole shall be accessible to the
pretreatment coordinator or his representatives at all times. Failure of a user
to provide such access is a violation of this Part.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Slug Loading. A user shall notify the pretreatment coordinator
immediately of any planned or unplanned discharge of waste of a strength or
character unusual for that user or in violation of an industrial waste permit.
A written follow-up report thereof shall be filed by the user within 5 days.
The report shall specify:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Description of the discharge, the cause thereof, and the impact on
the userâ€™s compliance status.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times, and if
noncompliance continues, the time by which compliance is reasonably expected to
occur.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
recurrence of the discharge.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Inspections. The pretreatment coordinator and other duly authorized
agents of the pretreatment coordinator bearing proper credentials and
identification shall be permitted to enter upon all properties for the purposes
of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, and testing, and to examine
and copy records of operation required by Township, Federal, or State agencies
in accordance with the provisions of this Part.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Enforcement Response. Enforcement actions taken by Township shall be
consistent with an enforcement response plan maintained by the pretreatment
coordinator.
Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â Notice of Violation. Whenever the Township finds that any user has
violated any provision of this Part, an industrial waste permit, or a
compliance order, the pretreatment coordinator may serve or cause to be served
upon such person, a written notice either personally or by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested, stating the nature of the alleged
violation. Within 30 days of the date of receipt of the notice, the user shall
submit an explanation of the violation and a plan for the correction and
prevention of violations of this Part.
Â Â Â 11.Â Â Â Administrative Fines (Civil Penalties). Notwithstanding any other
Section of this Part, any user or waste hauler who is found to have violated
any provision of this Part, or an industrial waste permit, or a waste hauler
license shall be fined in an amount not to exceed $25,000 per violation. Each
day on which noncompliance shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate
and distinct violation. All fine money shall be made payable to the Dover
Township sewer fund and shall be added to the next scheduled sewer bill.
Persons who desire to dispute such fines must file a request before the
Township to reconsider the fine within 10 working days of being notified of the
fine. Where the Township believes the request has merit, it shall convene a
hearing on the matter within 15 working days of receiving the request. The
Township shall include with any notice of an assessment of a civil penalty a
notice of the appeals process to be followed, including the name, address and
telephone number of the person responsible for accepting such appeal. The
Township shall include as part of its pretreatment program procedures a civil
penalty assessment policy and shall provide notice of this policy in each
industrial waste permit. Civil penalties collected pursuant to this Part shall
be placed in the sanitary sewer fund and shall be used for the repair of damage
and any additional maintenance needed or any additional costs imposed as a
result of the violation for which the penalty was imposed, to pay any penalties
imposed on the POTW by the Federal or State government for violation of
pretreatment standards, for the costs incurred by the POTW to investigate and
take the enforcement action that resulted in a penalty being imposed for the
monitoring of discharges in the pretreatment program, and for capital
improvements to the treatment works, including sewage collection lines, which
may be required by the pretreatment program. Any remaining funds may be used
for capital improvements to the treatment works, including collection lines.
Â Â Â 12.Â Â Â Administrative and Consent Orders. When the pretreatment coordinator
finds that a user has violated any provisions of this Part, the pretreatment
coordinator may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharging
directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the
user does not come into compliance, sewer service may be discontinued.
Administrative orders may also contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, such as management practices and additional self-monitoring. The
Township may also enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary
compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user
responsible for noncompliance. Such document shall include specific action to
be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period
specified by the document. Such documents shall be judicially enforceable. Such
orders or agreements may not extend a deadline for compliance established by a
Federal or State pretreatment standard; nor do they relive a user of liability
for any violation(s).
Â Â Â 13.Â Â Â Suspension and Termination of Service.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Emergency Suspension of Service. Township may before good cause
suspend the wastewater treatment service to any user when it appears to the
Township that an actual or threatened discharge presents or may present an
imminent or substantial danger to the health or welfare of persons or to the
environment interferes with the operation of the POTW, or violates any
pretreatment limits imposed by this Part. Continued discharge by a user after
receipt of an order to cease a discharge to the POTW is a violation of this
Part. If a user shall fail to comply with a suspension order, the Township may
commence judicial proceedings to compel compliance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Revocation of Treatment Services. In addition to the provisions of
paragraph .A hereof, a user who violates the following conditions is subject to
discharge termination:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Violation of the conditions of this Part or any order entered
with respect thereto.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Failure to report significant changes in wastewater constituents
and characteristics.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Failure to permit reasonable access to the userâ€™s premises for
th purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Judicial Proceedings. Whenever a user has violated the provisions of
this Part, the Township may petition the court for the issuance of a
preliminary or permanent injunction (or both, as may be appropriate), which
restrains or compels the activities on the part of the user. Following the
entry of any order by the Township with respect to violations of this Part,
Township may commence an action for legal and/or equitable relief in any
appropriate court.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Show Cause Hearing. The pretreatment coordinator may order a user
which has violated any provision of this Part to appear before the pretreatment
coordinator to show cause why a proposed enforcement action, including
termination of services, should not be taken. Notice of the meeting shall be
served personally or by registered mail, return receipt requested, at least 7
days prior to the hearing. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
Â Â Â 14Â Â Â Criminal Penalties. With or without notice, any person who shall
violate the provisions of this Part, an industrial waste permit, a waste hauler
license, or order shall, upon conviction thereof by a magisterial district
judge, be subject to punishment as provided in Â§ 1.4 of the Dover Township Code
of Ordinances. [Ord. 2005-08]
Â Â Â 15.Â Â Â Fees and Surcharges for Wastes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Surcharges. Certain wastes may increase the cost of operating the
POTW. Therefore there shall be imposed upon each user discharging such waste a
surcharge, or surcharges, to cover such additional costs. The surcharges shall
be in addition to the regular sewage charges and shall be payable as herein
provided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Determination of Surcharges. The strength of any waste, discharge of
which is to be subject to surcharge, shall be determined quarterly or more
frequently as the Township shall determine, based upon sampling and analysis by
the Township or its designees. However, the Township may if it so elects,
determine the strength of the sewage based upon the results of routine sampling
and analysis by the producer of such sewage or the results of analysis from
previous quarters or the results of analysis of sewage from similar customers.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Calculation of Surcharges. Surcharges shall made for all sewage or
waste discharged into the POTW by nonresidential users that have concentration
limits as listed below:
Parameters Concentration Limits in mg/L
Parameters            Concentration Limits in mg/L
Ammonia (as Nitrogen) 15
BOD                   300
Phosphate             10
Suspended Solids      350
Surcharges for each parameter in excess of its concentration limit shall be
calculated using the formula below:
Surcharge = .00000834 x Q x (Concentration - Concentration Limit) x K
Â Â Â Q=Volume in gallons
Â Â Â K=Cost factor for parameter
Cost factors shall be set through a resolution set by the Board of Supervisors
based on costs, toxicity, and impact on sludge disposal
Â 
Â Â Â 16.Â Â Â Sampling fees and schedules for users requiring an industrial waste
permit shall be assessed a fee for service charge for sampling scheduled in the
permit and for unscheduled compliance sampling to be performed by the Township.
The charge to each user for each sampling shall be set through a resolution by
the Board of Supervisors.
Â Â Â 17.Â Â Â Waste Hauler Licenses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The economy and desirability of the combined treatment of septage
and holding tank wastes is recognized. In general, septage, holding tank waste,
and trucked commercial wastes, on a case-by-case basis, may be discharged to
the POTW except those that are deemed harmful to the system or are specifically
prohibited by this Part. The acceptance of trucked wastes is based solely on
the ability of the POTW to assimilate those wastes without potential for
interference and pass through. If and when the Township determines that the
acceptance of any trucked waste has a potential to cause interference and pass
through, the wastewater treatment plant operator/superintendent may deny the
discharge of said waste without any prior notice to the licensed waste hauler
or waste generator regardless of permits or licenses held. [Ord. 2005-08]
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All persons desiring to transport and discharge waste to the POTW
through use of a truck or means of conveyance other than a sewer shall first
make application with the Township for a waste hauler license on a form
approved by the Township. No trucked waste shall be discharged to any discharge
point in the POTW except those specifically designated by the Township and at a
time approved by the Township.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Waste hauler licenses shall be issued for a specific time period not
to exceed 1 year and shall contain limits considered appropriate by the
pretreatment coordinator. Licenses shall not be assigned or transferred or sold
without approval of the Township. Any succeeding owner shall comply with the
terms and conditions of the existing license.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Any waste hauler who violates any provisions of this Part or of
their waste hauler license or of any additional requirements set by the
Township, may be subject to immediate license revocation. In addition, Township
may immediately and without notice revoke any waste hauler license if the
Township determines that the acceptance of the waste is detrimental to the
operation of the POTW.
[Ord. 2005-08]
Â Â Â 18.Â Â Â Hazardous Wastes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and State
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR, Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste
number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user
discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the
POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the
extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an
identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an
estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the
wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the
mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the
following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days
after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be
submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications
of changed conditions must be submitted under subsection .4.H of this Part. The
notification requirement in this Section does not apply to pollutants already
reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-
monitoring requirement of this Part.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph .A above,
during a calender month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of
hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in
40 CFR Â§Â§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of non-
acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR Â§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a
one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more
than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional
notification.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â In the case of any new regulations under Â§ 3001 of RCRA identifying
additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional
substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the pretreatment
coordinator, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and
State hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90
days of the effective date of such regulations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â In the case of any notification made under this Section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance
not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this Part, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable Federal or State law.
Â Â Â 19.Â Â Â Confidential Information. Information and date on a user obtained from
reports, surveys, wastewaster discharge permit applications, wastewaster
discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from Townshipâ€™s inspection and
sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction,
unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the pretreatment coordinator , that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable State law. Any such
request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or date.
When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such
information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might
disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for
inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request
to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment
program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the
report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other â€œeffluent dateâ€
as defined by 40 CFR Â§ 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information
and will be available to the public without restriction.
Â Â Â 20.Â Â Â Publication of Users in Significant Noncompliance. The Township shall
publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the Municipality,
a list of the users which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant
noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term
significant noncompliance shall mean:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of wastewater measurements taken during a 6-month
period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant
parameter by any amount.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
with 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter
during a 6-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum
limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD,
TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH).
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Any other discharge violation that the pretreatment coordinator
believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges,
interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW
personnel or the general public.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the pretreatment
coordinatorâ€™s exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a
discharge.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement
order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final
compliance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any required
reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with
categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports,
and reports on compliance with compliance schedules.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Failure to accurately report noncompliance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Any other violation(s) which the pretreatment coordinator determines
will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment
program.
Â Â Â 21.Â Â Â National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The national pretreatment
standards and categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR, Chapter 1,
Subchapter N, Parts 403-471, are hereby incorporated.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
pretreatment coordinator may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in
accordance with 40 CFR Â§ 403.6(c).
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â When wastewater subject to categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the pretreatment
coordinator shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream
formula in 40 CFR Â§ 403.6(e).
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment
standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive
provisions in 40 CFR Â§ 403.13 that factors relating to its discharge are
fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the
categorical pretreatment standard.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard
in accordance with 40 CFR Â§ 403.15.
Â Â Â 22.Â Â Â Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in
any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless
expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The
pretreatment coordinator may impose mass limitations on users who are using
dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other
cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
Â Â Â 23.Â Â Â Reporting Requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Baseline Monitoring Reports.

ground water to the sanitary sewer system;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If there is such an improper connection, whether such connection
has been permanently disconnected from the sanitary sewer system.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The Township shall impose a surcharge on properties with improper
connections to the system, or for failure to provide to the Township the proper
certification that there are no improper connections. The surcharge shall be
imposed upon properties when inspection uncovers improper connections,
including sump pumps, downspouts, floor drains, foundation drains, or other
sources of storm or ground water, or the surcharge shall be imposed for failure
to provide the proper certification that there are no improper connections.
Such surcharge shall continue until the improper connection is certified as
permanently corrected by either the Township or a licensed plumber under
subsection 2.B. above, or until the proper certification is provided that there
are no improper connections to the sanitary sewer system.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The surcharge shall consist of a fraction of the sewer rental fee
for each quarter in which the improper connection exists. The surcharge shall
be as in an amount as established from time to time by resolution of the Board

of such information as the Township shall deem necessary.
(Ord. 2015-05, 4/13/2015, Â§ 2)
Â§ 26-148.Â Â Â Connection Fee.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Where the Township or the authority is required to construct a lateral
for the purpose of connecting an improved property to the Township's sewage
system, the connection fee shall be an amount of money equal to the actual cost
of the construction.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â In lieu of payment of a connection fee, the Township may require the
owner of the improved property to construct the lateral to the Township's or
Authority's specifications and dedicate the same to the authority. In such
case, the owner of the improved property shall pay the Township's cost of
inspecting the construction of the lateral. Such charge for inspections shall
be established by resolution of the Board of Supervisors.
(Ord. 2015-05, 4/13/2015, Â§ 2)
Â§ 26-149.Â Â Â Customer Facilities Fee.

Â Â Â A tapping fee shall be based upon the capital recovery study and any
revisions or updates thereto prepared by the Township's sewer consulting
engineer and in effect at the time application is made to connect an improved
property to the sewer system as provided in this subpart. The tapping fee in
each case shall consist of a capacity component and a distribution-collection
component, and may include other components as authorized under the Act.
(Ord. 2015-05, 4/13/2015, Â§ 2)
Â§ 26-151.Â Â Â Tapping Fee Imposed.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Imposed. A tapping fee is hereby imposed upon the owner of an improved
property for each EDU of sewage volume hereafter connected to the sewer system.
The tapping fee based on the capital recovery study shall be in an amount to be
established by resolution of the Township Board of Supervisors.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Payable for each distinct unit. Tapping fees are payable for each
distinct or separate unit of use within any improved property. In the case of
domestic use, a tapping fee shall be paid for each dwelling unit. In the case
of a commercial use, industrial use or any other nonresidential use, a tapping
fee shall be paid for each unit of use intended for separate and distinct
occupancy whether or not so occupied.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Means of estimating tapping fee for nonresidential uses. The owner of
any improved property proposing to make connection to the sewer system for an
office use, commercial use, industrial use or any other nonresidential use
shall estimate the average daily volume of sewage in gallons that each unit of
use will discharge into the sewage system. The tapping fee for each unit shall
be multiples of an EDU (fractions shall be rounded to the next highest number)
as the estimated volume of sewage shall be based, where applicable, upon the
most recent version of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection's â€œPublic Water Supply Manual 383-2125-108, Part II, Community
System Design Standardsâ€; or, in lieu thereof upon approval of the Township,
any applicable national or regionally recognized engineering standards or
manuals along with specifications from the manufacturers of equipment and
plumbing fixtures installed or to be installed. However, no unit shall pay a
tapping fee of less than the amount established for one EDU. An owner shall
provide to the Township documentation to justify the estimated average daily
usage. The average daily usage shall be based in the projected three- month
maximum average.Â Â 
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Adjustment of fees for nonresidential uses. After four quarterly sewer
service billings to the owner of an improved property with a commercial use,
industrial use or any other nonresidential use for which sewage volume has been
estimated for tapping fee purposes, the Township may adjust the tapping fee
upwards to account for the average daily flow of sewage actually discharged
from the improved property in excess of the amount estimated at the time
application was made for the connection and the owner shall pay the difference
to the Township within 30 days of the date of invoice.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Additional fees for nonresidential uses for additions and expansions.
Where an improved property is connected to the sewage system on the effective
date of this subpart and thereafter an expansion of, addition to or a change of
use occurs which results in an increase in the number of units of use or in the
volume of sewage discharged from such property, additional tapping fee shall be
payable for each additional unit of use or for the increased volume of flow
generated by such expansion, addition or change to the improved property.
(Ord. 2015-05, 4/13/2015, Â§ 2)
Â§ 26-152.Â Â Â Special Purpose Facilities.
Â Â Â In the event that the improved property requires or is in an area served by
special purpose facilities as defined in the Act, the Township may designate
such sewer facilities as special purpose facilities. All improved properties
benefitted by the special purpose facilities thereafter connected to the sewer
system shall pay a tapping fee, which shall include a special purpose
facilities component part in addition to the component parts imposed pursuant
to this subpart.
(Ord. 2015-05, 4/13/2015, Â§ 2)
Â§ 26-153.Â Â Â Reimbursement for Certain Distribution or Collection Facilities.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â In the event that the owner of an improved property constructs any
distribution or collection facilities, and the facilities so constructed result
in sewer service being made available to the owner or owners of other property
by direct connection to the constructed facilities, then the owner or owners of
such other property shall upon making connection to the same pay a tapping fee
which shall include a reimbursement component part in addition to the other
component parts of the tapping fee.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The reimbursement component part and time period for reimbursement
shall be determined in accordance with the Act.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The reimbursement component part of any tapping fee collected by the
Township during any fiscal year shall be paid to the owner of the improved
property constructing the distribution or collection facilities on or before
the last day of such fiscal year; less, however, a charge equal to 5% of the
amount thereof which shall be retained by the Township as an administrative
fee.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The Township and the owner of the improved property entitled to
reimbursement pursuant to this section shall enter into an agreement containing
such provisions as the parties shall agree.

under this article with respect to any improved property proposed to be served
by the Township's sewer system shall be due and payable in full at the time
application is made for connection to the sewer system.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Where the owner of an improved property is notified to connect to such
property to the sewer system pursuant to this subpart, all fees shall be due
and payable within the time specified in such notice whether or not application
for or connection has been made to the sewer system.
(Ord. 2015-05, 4/13/2015, Â§ 2)
Â§ 26-155.Â Â Â Assurance of Capacity; Prohibition of Connections; Refundability;
Assignability.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â No assurance of sufficient capacity. Until such time as the owner of an
improved property shall pay to the Township a tapping fee for the connection of
any unit of use to the sewer system, such owner is given no assurance that
there is or will be sufficient capacity in the sewage system or any part
thereof to accept any sewage from the improved property.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Liability of Township upon state prohibition of connections.
Notwithstanding the acceptance of a tapping fee and the issuance of a
certificate allocating capacity in the sewer system for the use of the improved
property, the Township shall not incur any liability to the owner of such
property should the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection for any
reason impose a ban or otherwise prohibit connections to or extensions of the
sewer system. In such event, the only remedy available to the owner of the
improved property shall be to receive a refund of the tapping fee paid.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Tapping fees not refundable; assignation and transferability. A tapping
fee shall not be refundable nor shall it be assignable or transferable to or
for the use of any property other than the improved property for which it was
allocated.
(Ord. 2015-05, 4/13/2015, Â§ 2)
Â§ 26-156.Â Â Â Enforcement and Collection.

property connected to the sewer system and shall be enforced and collected in
the manner provided in the Municipal Claims and Tax Lien Act, 53 P. S. Â§7501et
seq.. In addition, the payment of such fees may be enforced by any appropriate
action in law or in equity.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â For a violation of any provision of this subpart enforcement shall be
brought before a magisterial district judge in the same manner provided for the
enforcement of summary offenses under the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal
Procedure. Upon conviction thereof, a violator shall be subject to a criminal
fine not to exceed $1,000 per violation plus costs, or to a term of

Â§ 26-308.Â Â Â  Construction and Abandonment Standards.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Source.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The source of supply shall be from a water bearing formation drawn
not less than 100 feet from the ground surface, with at least 20 feet of
properly grounded well casing, and from no formation which is subject to
pollution.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â New hand dug wells are prohibited.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Casing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The well shall have a water-tight and durable wrought iron, steel,
or other type of approved casing with a nominal thickness of 3/16 (.1875)
inches and 6 inches, outside diameter. The sections shall be joined together by
threaded couplings, joints, by welding or any other water-tight approved joint
or coupling. Plastic well casing shall be polyvinylchloride (PVC) minimum
schedule 40.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Casing shall be installed 20 feet from the finished grade or in any
case shall be extended 10 feet into bedrock or other impervious strata. Driven
wells shall be provided with a drive shoe or other effective casing seal.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â An annular space shall be provided between the well casing and the
earth formation of a radius at least 1Â½ inches greater than the casing radius,
excluding coupling for internal pressure grouting, or 1Â½ inches greater than
the casing radius, excluding coupling for external grouting. The annular space
shall be completely filled with impervious cement grout or equivalent sealing
material from bottom of the casing to the ground surface. External grouting
shall be accomplished utilizing a tremie pipe and grout pump to force out any
standing water on the outside of the well casing. The casing shall be sealed
effectively against entrance of water from water-bearing formations which are
subject to pollution, through which the casing may pass. If casings of smaller
diameter are used in the lower portions of the well, effective water-tight
seals shall be provided between the casings where they telescope. In such
instances, sections of casings shall telescope for a minimum distance of 4
feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â If plastic well casing is used, the annular space shall be pressure
grouted to the full depth of the casing using bentonite grout.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The top of the well casing shall extend a minimum of 12 inches above
the finished grade of the lot so that contaminated water or other substances
cannot enter the well through the annular opening at the top of the well case.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â In areas where flooding is likely to occur, including 100-year flood
plains, the casing shall reach a height of at least 2 feet above the
predetermined 100-year flood elevation or, in the absence of a pre-determined
flood elevation, a minimum of 2 feet above the finished ground surface.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Drainage. The ground surrounding the top of the well casing for a
radius of not less than 10 feet shall be sloped away from the well to prevent
surface runoff from entering the completed well.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Well Covers. Every domestic use water well shall be equipped with an
insect proof cover at the top of the well casing. Covers shall extend downward
at least 2 inches over the outside of the well casing. Any restoration/repair
of wells with casing terminating below grade shall be raised above grade to 12
inches minimum. Electrical wiring for well pumps shall be encased in conduit
from the bottom of the water supply pipe trench to the well cap.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Abandonment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A well is considered abandoned or permanently discontinued if a pump
was not installed in a new well that was constructed or if an existing well has
not been utilized for a period of 1 year or more.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Every domestic water well which is abandoned, if not grouted with
the casing in place, shall have the casing removed and be filled to a depth of
10 feet below grade with ASHTO #57 crushed stone and then grouted from 10 feet
below grade to the top of the well.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Every abandoned hand dug domestic water well shall be filled with
environmentally safe material free of debris or waste materials (ASHTO #57
crushed stone).
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Springs. This Section of the standards is to be used for reconstruction
of existing springs only. Before rehabilitation shall begin on an existing
spring, a report shall be made to determine the advisability of said
reconstruction, which shall include as a minimum, quality and quantity of
water. Springs for new construction are not considered an adequate water supply
and will not be considered as valid for the issuance of a building permit.
Reconstructed springs shall be completely enclosed by walls and a cover of
reinforced concrete or equally durable water-tight material. This cover shall
have a firm foundation so as to effectively prevent settling. The uphill wall
shall be so constructed as to prevent entrance of surface water. Where manhole
covers are used, the manhole shall be at least 24 inches in diameter. It shall
extend at least 3 inches above the surrounding ground surface and be covered by
an impervious durable cover of concrete, steel or equivalent material which
overlaps the manhole vertically by at least 2 inches. The manhole cover shall
be effectively secured to the manhole by bolting, locking or equivalent means,
and shall be kept so secured.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Pump Enclosure. Any pump room or any enclosure around a well pump shall
be drained and protected from freezing by heating or other approved means. Well
pits shall be prohibited.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Geothermal Borehole Grouting. Geothermal boreholes shall be completely
filled with either of the following 2 options:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The geothermal borehole shall be completely filled with impervious
cement grout or equivalent sealing material from the bottom of the borehole to
the bottom of the header trench.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The geothermal borehole shall be filled with Â½ inch clean crushed
stone to a minimum of 10 feet below the point at which the borehole enters the
rock. The remainder of the borehole above the top of the crushed stone shall be
completely filled with impervious cement, grout or equivalent sealing material
to the bottom of the header trench.

Â§ 26-309.Â Â Â Inspections.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A report for each well shall be prepared by the driller and shall be
submitted to the water quality coordinator for evaluation and approval. The
well report shall contain the following pertinent information:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Owner of property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Address of property.

Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The SEO may, at any time during which the well is under construction or
major repair, enter the premises to inspect the work in progress.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Upon the completion of construction or major repair, the contractor
shall request and, within 48 hours, the SEO shall perform a final inspection of
the permitted work to determine whether there has been compliance with the
requirements of this Chapter and any additional conditions contained in the
permit.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Upon completion of the inspection, the SEO shall either:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Authorize use of the well; or,
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Deny such use due to non-compliance with the ordinance or permit and
shall, within 3 days, notify the applicant in writing of reasons for such
denial.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Any time the SEO determines that any isolation distance or materials
specification has not been met, he may issue a verbal stop work order and
shall, within 24 hours, issue a written stop work order citing the isolation
distance that has been violated.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â If a stop work order is issued, work shall not resume until the work
has been brought into compliance with the terms of this Chapter and the permit.

Â§ 27-402.Â Â Â CV - Conservation District.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Purpose. The purpose of this district is to prescribe a zoning category
for those areas where because of natural geographic factors and existing land

the roadway, other natural resources, and farmland. This district may include
steeply sloped areas, stream valleys, water supply, sources, wooded areas, and
farmed areas adjacent thereto.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The purpose of this district shall be consistent with the
conservation and agricultural land use classification descriptions associated
with the Rural Resource Areas (Natural and Rural Landscapes) contained in the
Future Land Use Plan of the Dover Borough/Dover Township Joint Comprehensive
Plan Growth Management Plan, 2007.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Bulk and Area Regulations. The following shall be the standards for the
CV District.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Lot area:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Minimum lot area: five acres for single family dwellings.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Minimum lot area: five acres for an agribusiness.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Minimum lot frontage and width: 300 feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Minimum setbacks:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Front setback: 40 feet.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Side setback: 40 feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Maximum lot coverage: Not more than 20% of the lot shall be covered
by impervious coverage. If more than 50% of the site possesses slopes in excess
of 15%, the maximum lot coverage shall be 10%.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Maximum Building Height:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Agriculture structure, wind turbine and OTARD: 150 feet provided
the structure is setback a distance at least equal to its height, from all
property lines.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Other structures, and single-family detached dwellings: not to

Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Purpose.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â In areas where agricultural activity remains strong, Agricultural
Districts are established to protect and stabilize agriculture as an ongoing
economic activity by generally permitting only those land uses and activities
which are either agricultural in nature or act in direct support of
agricultural activity. The purpose of this district shall be consistent with
the conservation and agricultural land use classification descriptions
associated with the Rural Resource Areas (Natural and Rural Landscapes)
contained in the Future Land Use Plan of the Dover Borough/Dover Township Joint
Comprehensive Plan Growth Management Plan, 2007.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The regulations for this district are designed to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Protect and stabilize the essential characteristics of these
areas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Minimize conflicting land uses detrimental to agricultural
enterprises.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Limit development which requires highways and other public
facilities in excess of those required by agricultural uses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Maintain agricultural parcels or farms in sizes which will
permit efficient agricultural operations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Maintain the rural and scenic character of the agricultural
community.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Meet the objectives of the Dover Township Comprehensive Plan.

Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Use Limitations for Single-family Detached Dwellings. Single-family
detached dwellings shall be permitted in the Agricultural District subject to
the following limitations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Permitted number of dwellings: Upon each parcel as it existed on May
23, 1988 (date of enactment of Dover Township's first agricultural preservation
zoning ordinance), there shall be permitted the subdivision of lots for the
purpose of constructing single-family detached dwelling units subject to the
requirements of this Section. If development activity between May 23, 1988, and
the effective date of this Chapter have added more dwelling units than allowed
herein, no additional residential subdivisions shall be allowed from the area
of the original tract.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â For each 25 acres of contiguous ownership, there may be one lot
sold or utilized for a single-family detached dwelling subject to the
requirements of this Section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â For each tract of contiguous land and in single ownership that
is 1.5 acres or more, but less than 25 acres, there may be only one lot
subdivided provided that both the lot to be subdivided and the residual lot
meet all applicable requirements of this Part.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The provisions of subsections 1. and 2. of this Section shall
apply to all parcels of land legally existing on May 23, 1988. Regardless of
size, no lot subsequently subdivided from its parcel shall qualify for
additional single-family, detached dwellings pursuant to this Section.
Similarly, any subsequent owner of any parcel of land legally existing on May
23, 1988, shall be bound by the actions of previous owners in that such current
ownership may subdivide for purposes of additional single-family dwellings only
that number of lots, if any remaining from the original number permitted by
this Section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Each such additional dwelling shall be located upon a separate and
approved lot whether intended for transfer of title or not.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â A farm tenant dwelling unit shall be allowed as an accessory use to
the principal agriculture/farm operation; therefore, shall not require a
subdivision or land development plan under the definition of land development
and shall be exempt from all other regulations of Â§27-403. The farm tenant
dwelling unit shall meet the following requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The unit shall be required to meet all applicable local, State
and Federal requirements for the siting of on-lot wastewater and water
facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The tenant dwelling unit shall be located contiguous to existing
buildings of the agriculture/farm operation and where possible utilize shared
driveways. Furthermore, the tenant dwelling shall not be located in a remote
area of the farm parcel which would cause the need to cross prime farmland to
provide new access to the dwelling unit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â If the tenant dwelling is abandoned as an accessory use, the
property owner is no longer exempt from meeting the requirements of this
Chapter regarding single-family detached dwellings and shall either meet these
regulations or remove the dwelling unit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Soil and land characteristics. The applicant shall have the burden
of proof that the land to be utilized for the location of the single-family
dwelling meets the criteria set forth in this subsection. Any landowner
disagreeing with the classifications set forth in the Soil Survey of York
County, Pennsylvania, may submit an engineering analysis of the affected soils
and seek reclassification to the Conservation District, Soil Conservation
Service and the Township. Lots for the single-family dwellings shall consist of
one of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â No more than 20% of a lot shall consist of soils listed in TABLE
5 - Prime Farmlands contained in the United States Department of Agriculture
Natural Resource and Conservation Services (NRCS) York County soil survey,

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The lot shall consist in its entirety of lands which cannot
feasibly be farmed for one or more of the following reasons:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Due to existing features of the site such as rock
outcroppings, steep slopes (15% or greater), woodlands.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Due to the fact that the size or shape of the area suitable
for farming is insufficient to permit efficient use of farm machinery (for
purposes of the application of this subsection the land to be contained in the
lot shall be considered as a part of the original tract).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â In cases where more than 20% of the lot consists of soils
listed in TABLE 5 - Prime Farmlands contained in the United States Department
of Agriculture Natural Resource and Conservation Services (NRCS) York County
soil survey, issued 2003 and does not meet the requirements of subsections (a)
or (b) above, up to two dwelling units may be provided as follows:

area, date of approval and recording data for each subdivision. The location of
each lot shall be indicated on a deed plotting of the parcel as it existed on
May 23, 1988.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Soil types and classification as mapped in the Soil Survey of
York County, Pennsylvania.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Subdivision for the transfer of land between two contiguous property
owners shall be allowed to resolve on-lot wastewater and/or water problems, or
correct irregular lot lines (maximum transfer of one acre) with the following
regulations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â As a result of the subdivision, no lot shall be created which is
less than the minimum lot size for the district; however, the newly created lot
with the wastewater or water problem may exceed the maximum lot size to obtain
suitable area for a replacement site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â An area over the two-acre maximum on a subdivision will only be
permitted and limited to what is necessary for the resolution of on-lot
wastewater/water problems. Under no circumstances shall additional property be
transferred between property owners.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The subdivided area shall be added to an existing lot and shall
not be interpreted as a new lot; therefore, the subdivision shall not affect
the calculation of allowable dwelling units or special exceptions in the
agriculture district.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The property owner with the on-lot system problem must show
written documentation to the Township that they have received all required
local, State and Federal approvals before the subdivision will be granted.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Use Limitations for Special Exceptions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Parcels may be subdivided for nonagricultural/nonresidential uses as
special exceptions in accordance with Â§
27-403.A., and the following regulations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The calculation of the number of lots which may be subdivided
for nonagricultural/nonresidential purposes shall be based on the number of
permitted dwellings calculated in Â§
27-403.5.B.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â One lot utilized for a nonagricultural/nonresidential special
exception use shall be equivalent to two residential lots. Thus, the maximum
number of residential lots permitted for a specific parcel shall be reduced by
two for each permitted nonagricultural/ nonresidential special exception use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Special exception uses shall be permitted on lands considered
unsuitable for agricultural purposes as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The lot shall consist in its entirety of land included within

in the creation of any lot containing less than 25 acres.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Any new division line being created between two "farms" shall be
agriculturally reasonable and shall not be so as to render the agricultural use
of the tracts less efficient; i.e., under normal circumstances, fields and
contour strips shall not be split.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Land transferred to a farm parcel pursuant to this Section shall not
subsequently be separated from such farms.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â A property owner submitting a subdivision plan shall be required to
specify which lot or lots shall carry the right to erect or place any unused

Â§ 27-411.Â Â Â FP - Floodplain Overlay Section.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Purpose. The purpose of this overlay is to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units, and its residents, by preventing excessive development in areas subject
to flooding.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Comply with Federal and State floodplain management requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in
order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of these
regulations are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
acceptable engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur. Flood heights
may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge
openings restricted by debris. This Chapter does not imply that areas outside
any identified floodplain areas, or that land uses permitted, within such area
will be free from flooding or flood damages.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â This Chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Township
or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that results from
reliance on this Chapter, or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Identification of Floodplain Areas. The identified floodplain areas
shall be those areas of Dover Township, which are subject to the 100-year
flood, as identified in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated September 25,
2009, and the accompanying maps prepared for Dover Township by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), or the most recent revision thereof.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Description of Floodplain Areas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following
specific areas:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â FW (Floodway Area). The areas identified as "Floodway" in the AE
Zone in the Flood Insurance Study prepared by FEMA. The term shall also include
floodway areas which have been identified in other available studies or sources
of information for those floodplain areas where no floodway has been identified
in the Flood Insurance Study.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â FF (Flood-Fringe Area). The remaining portions of the 100-year
floodplain in those areas identified as an AE Zone where a floodway has been
delineated in the Flood Insurance Study. The basis for the outermost boundary
of this area shall be the 100-year flood elevations as shown in the flood
profiles contained in the Flood Insurance Study.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â FA (General Floodplain Area). The areas identified as Zone A in
the FIS for which no 100-year flood elevations have been provided. When
available, information from other Federal, State, and other acceptable sources
shall be used to determine the 100-year elevation, as well as a floodway area.
When no other information is available, the 100-year elevation shall be
determined by using a point on the boundary of the identified floodplain area
which is nearest the construction site in question.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The Township shall require the applicant to determine the elevation
with hydrologic, and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses shall be undertaken by professional engineers or others of
demonstrated qualification who shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses,
computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the Township Engineer.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Changes in Identification of Area. The identified floodplain area may
be revised or modified by the Board of Supervisors where studies or information
provided by a qualified agency or person documents the need for such revision.
However, prior to any such change, approval must be obtained from the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Boundary Disputes. Should a dispute concerning any identified
floodplain boundary arise, an initial determination shall be made by the
Township Zoning Officer and any party aggrieved by this decision may appeal to
the Zone Hearing Board. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Technical Provisions; General.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse until all adjacent municipalities which may be affected
by such action have been notified by the Applicant, and until all required
permits or approvals have been first obtained from the Department of
Environmental Protection and the Department of Conservation and Natural
Resources or the responsible State agency. In addition, the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and Pennsylvania Department of Economic and Community
Development shall be notified prior to any alteration or relocation of any
watercourse. A copy of all such notifications, permit applications,
recommendations and approvals shall be submitted to the Township.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Any new construction, development, uses or activities allowed within
any identified floodplain area, shall be undertaken in strict compliance with
the provisions contained in this Chapter and the Floodplain Building
Regulations [Chapter 4, Part 1].
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Existing Structures in Identified Floodplain Areas. The provisions of
this chapter do not require any changes or improvements to be made to lawfully
existing structures. However, when an improvement is made to any existing
structure, the provisions of Â§ 4-161 shall apply.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Variance Procedures and Conditions. Requests for variances shall be
considered by the Zoning Hearing Board in accordance with the procedures
contained in Â§
27-1003 and the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No variance shall be granted for any construction, development, use,
or activity within any floodway area that would cause any increase in the 100-
year flood elevation.

Â§ 27-412.Â Â Â AH - Airport Hazard Overlay Section.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Purpose. The purpose of these zones is to prevent injury and/or the
loss of property and life and to avoid safety hazards by:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Regulating the height of buildings, structures, and natural plant
growth within all AH zones which might otherwise have the potential for
endangering the lives and property of the users of all public airports within
Dover Township and the surrounding vicinity, and the property or occupants of
land in the vicinity of the public Airports. (Such hazards might be created by
an obstruction which could reduce the size of areas available for the landing,
takeoff, and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the
utility of the public airports).
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Encouraging and/or requiring the removal, alteration, or marking and
lighting of obstructions, whether manmade or natural, which are potential
hazards to air navigation in the vicinity of all public Airports.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Endeavoring to protect individuals who intend to buy or acquire
interest in lands, buildings, or structures which are located within an Airport
Hazard Zone.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The degree of protection from danger, loss, or injury sought by the
provisions of this Chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on information provided by the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation's Bureau of Aviation pursuant to Act 164, 1984 Pa. Laws 164,
Chapter 59, Subchapter B, 74 Pa.C.S.A. Â§5915(a). This Chapter does not imply
that accidents involving aircraft utilizing public Airports and hazards or
obstructions in the vicinity of that airport will be or can be avoided solely
by the adoption and/or enforcement of the regulations contained herein.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â This Section shall not create liability on the part of Dover
Township or any officer or employee thereof for any airport and/or airport
hazard related damage, loss, or injury that results from reliance on this
Section of any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Definitions. The following definitions relate solely to the airport
hazard regulations and shall not apply universally nor shall said regulations
be used to interpret other sections of this Part which do not directly apply to
airport hazard zoning.

The affected area of Dover Township related to the Lazy B Ranch Airport is Bull
Road at the Township and eastern boundary, south to the Bull Road crossing of
the Little Conewago Creek, west to the Dover Elementary School and north to
Brehmer Road/Bull Road intersection, containing Â± 3,000 acres of area. (refer
to the Airport Hazard Overlay Maps at the end of this section).
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Description of Zones.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Basis of Zones. The various Airport Hazard Zones shall include
all defined areas delineated below with limitations based on elevations,
specified in this Section of the Chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Approach Surface Zone. Established beneath the visual
approach surface. The inner edge of this zone coincided with the width of the
primary surface and is 250 feet wide. The zone expands outward uniformly to a
width of 1,250 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary
surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Horizontal Surface Zone. Established beneath the horizontal
surface, 150 feet above the established airport elevation, the perimeter of
which is constructed by swinging arcs of 5,000 feet radii from the center of
each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs
by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal surface zone does not
include the approach surface and transitional surface zones.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Conical Surface Zone. Established beneath the conical
surface. This zone commences at the periphery of the horizontal surface and
extends outward there from a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Transitional Surface Zone. Slopes seven feet outward for each
foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary
surface and approach surface, and extending to a height of 150 feet above the
airport elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Overlay Concept.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The aforementioned Airport Hazard Zones shall be overlays to
the existing and underlying zones as shown on the Official Zoning Map of Dover
Township, and as such, the provisions for the Airport Hazard Zones shall serve
as a supplement to the underlying zone provisions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Where there exists any conflict between the provisions of any
Airport Hazard Zones and those of any underlying zone the more restrictive
provisions shall apply.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Inclusion in Zoning Map. The boundaries of the Airport Hazard Zones
are established as shown on the York Airport Hazard Overlay Map and the Lazy
"B" Ranch Airport Hazard Overlay Map, attached hereto.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Zone Boundary Changes. The delineation of any of the airport hazard
areas may be revised by the Board of Supervisors only in instances where
natural or manmade changes have occurred or corrections are required and
detailed studies have been conducted by the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation, Bureau of Aviation, the Federal Aviation Administration or
another qualified agency(s) or individual(s) approved by the Bureau and the
FAA, and both the Bureau and the FAA recommend and document the advisability of
such change.

Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Interpretation of Zone Boundaries. Initial interpretations of the
boundaries of the Airport Hazard Zones shall be made by the Zoning Officer.
Should a dispute arise concerning the boundaries of any of the zones, the
person questioning or contesting the location of the zone boundary should be
given a reasonable opportunity to present his/her case to the Township Zoning
Hearing Board and to submit his/her own technical evidence if he/she so
desires.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Status of Airport. If a change in the airport is proposed, through
improvements to lighting, runways, etc., that would affect airport hazard
zoning (i.e., that would necessitate a modification of height and/or distance
requirements), the owner and/or operator of the airport must notify the
Township's Board of Supervisors in order that this Section may be amended to
reflect such changes.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Provisions. All uses, activities, and development occurring within an
Airport Hazard Zone shall be undertaken only in strict compliance with the
provisions of this Chapter and with all other applicable codes and ordinances
(such as the Uniform Construction Code) where applicable.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Use Restrictions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section,
no use may be made of land or water within any zone established by this Chapter
in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals
or radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for
pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the
eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the
airport, create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or
interfere with the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to
use the airport
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Nonconforming Uses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Regulations Not Retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this
Section shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other change
or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of
the effective date of this Chapter, or otherwise interfere with the continuance
of any nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in
the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the
construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of
this Chapter and is diligently executed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed. Whenever the Zoning
Officer determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or
more than 75% torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall
be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable
height limit or otherwise deviate from this Section.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Permits.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Except as specifically provided hereunder, no material change shall
be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise
established, and no tree shall be planted in any Airport Hazard Zone hereby
created unless a permit therefore shall have been applied for and granted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for
which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be
determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the
regulations herein prescribed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be
granted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â No permit for a use inconsistent with provisions of this Chapter
shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with Â§
27-410.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The following permit exception applies:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and
conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than
75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain,
land contour, or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend
above the height limits prescribed for such zones.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a
horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the runway,
not permit shall be required for any trees or structure less than seventy-five
feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land
contour or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the
height limit prescribed for such approach zones.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones
beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zones, no permit shall be required for
any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground
except when such a tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour or
topographic feature, would extend above the height limit prescribed for such
transition zones.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Nothing contained in the foregoing exception shall construed as
permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any
structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits
established by this Chapter, except that no permit is required to make
maintenance repairs or to replace parts of existing structures which do not
enlarge or increase the height of an existing structure.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Existing Uses. Before any nonconforming structure may be replaced,
substantially altered or rebuilt or tree allowed to grow higher or replanted, a
permit must be secured from the Township authorizing the replacement or change.
No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an
obstruction or permit a nonconforming use, structure or tree to become a
greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of this
Chapter or any amendments thereto, or than it is when the application for a
permit is made.
Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â Variances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Any person, desiring to erect any structure, increase the height of
any structure, permit the growth of any object of natural growth or otherwise
use his property in violation of airport zoning regulations, may apply to the
Zoning Hearing Board for a variance from the zoning regulations in question. A
variance shall be granted only after the requirements of this Section and Â§
27-1102 of this Chapter are satisfied.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The application for variance from a provision of this Section shall
be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration
(based on Form 7460-1, "Notice of Proposed Construction or Alteration," or the
form acceptable to that Administration) and a determination from the Bureau of
Aviation of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (based on Form AV-57,
"Notice of Proposed Construction or Alterations" or other form acceptable to
that Bureau) as to the effect of the proposal on the operation or air
navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of
this Section may be considered by the Zoning Hearing Board unless a copy of the
application has been furnished to the airport manager (or person of equivalent
description) for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the
airport manager (or person of equivalent description) does not respond to the
application within 15 days after receipt, the Zoning Hearing Board may act
without such input to grant or deny said application.
Â Â Â 11.Â Â Â Hazard Marking and Lighting. In granting any permit or variance under
this Section, the Zone Hearing Board shall permit or grant a variance as to
require the owner of the structure or object of natural growth in question to
permit the airport owner operator, at its own expense, or require the person or
persons requesting the permit or variance, to install, operate and maintain
thereon such markers and lights as may be required by guidelines or regulations
adopted by the FAA.
Â Â Â 12.Â Â Â Enforcement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Local Enforcement. It shall be the duty of the Zoning Officer to
administer and enforce the regulations prescribed herein. Applications for
permits and variances involving Airport Hazard Zones shall be made to the
Zoning Officer upon a form published for that purpose.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Notice to Department. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a
municipality or board which decides to grant an airport hazard zoning permit or
variance under this Section shall notify the Department of Transportation.
Â Â Â 13.Â Â Â Acquisition of Air Rights. In any case in which it is desired to
remove, lower or otherwise terminate a nonconforming structure or use, or the
approach protection necessary cannot, because of constitutional limitations, be
provided by airport zoning regulations, or it appears advisable that the
necessary approach protection be provided by acquisition of property rights,
rather than by airport zoning regulations, Dover Township may acquire by
purchase, grant or condemnation, in the manner provided by the law under which
municipalities are authorized to acquire real property for public purposes,
such air right, aviation easement or other estate or interest in the property
or nonconforming structure or use in question as may be necessary to effectuate
the purpose of this Section. In the case of the purchase of any property or any
easement or estate, or interest therein, or the acquisition thereof by the
power of eminent domain, Dover Township shall, in addition to the damages for
the taking, injury or destruction of property, also pay the cost of removal and
relocation of any structure or any public utility which is required to be moved
to a new location.
Â Â Â 14.Â Â Â Airport Surface Zone Height Limitations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Approach Surface Zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the end of an at the same elevation as the primary surface and
extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet along the extended runway
centerline.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Transitional Surface Zone. Slopes seven feet outward for each foot
upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary
surface and the approach surface and extending to a height of 150 feet above
the airport elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Horizontal Surface Zone. Established at 150 feet above the
established airport elevation or a height of 750 feet above mean sea level.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Conical Surface Zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the periphery of the horizontal surface, and at 150 feet above the
established airport elevation, and extending to a height of 350 feet above the
established airport elevation or at a height of 950 feet above mean sea level.
Â Â Â 15.Â Â Â Maximum Allowable Height. The following figure and formulas have been
prepared for determining the maximum allowable heights of objects within the
airport's vicinity. The formulas are used in conjunction with the figure; where
a formula is assigned a number, that formula corresponds with a point location
of the same number on the figure. By using the formulas and following the steps
outlined below, the maximum allowable height at a point location can be
determined.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Locate the point (object) in question on the figure (sample point
locations identified by numbers are given in various coded airport zones).
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Apply the formula having the same number as the chosen point
location to calculate the maximum allowable height for an object at that point
(some formulas will have letter variables (e.g., "A") shown on the figure).

Â§ 27-503.Â Â Â Lot Standards.
Â Â Â The following regulations apply to the development of lots throughout the
Township:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Lots of Record. On a lot held in single and separate ownership on
the effective date of this Chapter, or any amendment thereto, which does not
fulfill the requirements for the minimum lot area, lot width, and lot depth for
the zone in which it is located, a building may be erected, altered and used
and the lot may be used for a conforming (permitted) use providing the setback
requirements are not less than the minimum specified herein for the district in
which the lot is located.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Area Regulations. The area, width and depth of lots shall provide
adequate area for off-street loading, unloading, and/or parking space. When
necessary, on-lot wastewater facilities shall be provided with areas in
addition to the space provided for off-street parking and other paved areas and
the area covered by the principal and accessory structures.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Setback Modifications. The following standards and requirements
apply to all uses in all zones:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Front Yards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Front Setbacks from All Arterial Roads (As Identified in
Dover Township Comprehensive Plan). For the purpose of protecting residential
uses from adverse influences of traffic and for the purpose of protecting all
arterial roads for their traffic functions, buildings (including residential
and nonresidential buildings) along these thoroughfares must be set back at
least 50 feet from the right-of-way line of the thoroughfare.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Infill Lots. Where at least two adjacent buildings, along
the same street line and within 100 feet of a property line are set back a
lesser distance than required, the average of the distances of the adjacent
buildings becomes the required front setback for that property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Agriculture and Farm Operation. No stable or similar
animal housing building(s) is permitted within 25 feet of any property line. In
addition, such setback modifications are subject to Â§

two or more faces, the area of all faces shall be included in determining the
area of the sign, except that where two such faces are placed back to back and
at no point more than three feet from one another, the area of the sign shall
be taken as the area of one face if the two faces are of equal area, or as the
area of the larger face if the two faces are of unequal size.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Prohibited in Right-of-Way. Signs shall not be erected within or

of a double-faced sign, only one side shall be considered, provided both faces
are parallel and not more than 12 inches apart. Otherwise, all sides shall be
considered in calculating the total permitted square foot area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Location/Projection of Signs.

it does not obstruct the vision of motorists.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Signs which are illuminated in the colors red, green, or amber,
either by colored bulbs or tubing, or in high reflection by the use of special

the center of any street intersection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Freestanding internally illuminated signs shall be dimmable at
night so as not to cause an objectionable glare to adjacent residential uses or
motorists along a roadway.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Signs Painted on Buildings. Advertising painted upon, or displayed
upon, a barn or other building or structure shall be regarded as wall sign and
the regulations pertaining thereto shall apply.

Â§ 27-1003.Â Â Â Variances.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Filing of Variance Applications. An application may be made to the
Zoning Hearing Board for a variance where it is alleged that the provisions of
this Chapter inflict unnecessary hardship upon the applicant.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The application must be on a form provided for that purpose by the
Zoning Officer. It must be filed with the Board and copies given to the Zoning
Officer. The applicant must provide all the information requested on the form,
together with any other information and data that may be required to advise the
Board on the variance, whether such information is called for by the official
form or not.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Unless otherwise specified or extended by the Board, a variance
authorized by it expires if the applicant fails to obtain a building permit or
use certificate, or file for subdivision or land development approval within
six months from the date of authorization of the variance.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Standards for Variances. Where there is unnecessary hardship, the Board
may grant a variance in the application of the provisions of this Chapter,
provided, that the following findings are made where relevant in a given case:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â There are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar
to the particular property, and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such
conditions and not due to circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of this Chapter in the neighborhood or zone in which the property is
located.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no
possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of this Chapter and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The unnecessary hardship is not financial in nature and has not been
created by the appellant.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character
of the neighborhood or zone in which the property is located, nor substantially
or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property,
nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance
that will afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of
the regulation in issue.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Conditions. In granting any variance, the Board may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards as it considers necessary to implement the
purposes of this Chapter or the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53
P.S. Â§ 10101 et seq. These conditions shall be enforceable by the Zoning
Officer and failure to comply with such conditions shall constitute a violation
of this Chapter and subject to the penalties described in Â§
27-1110 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 2024-01, 5/13/2024)
Â§ 27-1004.Â Â Â Special Exceptions.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â General Standards for Considering a Special Exception. A special
exception may be granted when the Zoning Hearing Board finds from a
preponderance of the evidence produced at the hearing that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The proposed use, including its nature, intensity and location, is
in harmony with the orderly and appropriate development of the district.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Adequate water supply, sewage disposal, storm drainage, fire and
police protection are or can be provided for the use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The use of adjacent land and buildings will not be discouraged and
the value of adjacent land and buildings will not be impaired by the location,
nature, and height of buildings, walls, and fences.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The use will have proper location with respect to existing or future
streets giving access to it, and will not create traffic congestion or cause
commercial or industrial traffic to use residential streets.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The specific standards set forth for each particular use for which a
special exception may be granted have been met.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The applicant for a special exception shall have the burden of proof,
which shall include the burden of going forward with the evidence and the
burden of persuasion on all questions of fact which are to be determined by the
Zoning Hearing Board.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â For any use permitted by special exception, the special exception shall
be granted or denied by the Board pursuant to standards and criteria set forth
in Part 6.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â In granting a special exception, the Zoning Hearing Board may attach
such reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to standards referenced
in Â§ 27-1004.1.A., as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this
Chapter, the Dover Township Comprehensive Plan, or the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. Â§10101 et seq.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Unless otherwise specified or extended by the Zoning Hearing Board, a
special exception authorized by the Board expires if the applicant fails to
obtain, where required to do so, a building permit or use certificate, or file
for a subdivision or land development permit approval within six months of the
date of the authorization of the special exception.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Upon submission of a special exception application for a
tower-based WCF or pole facility and the scheduling of the public hearing upon
the application, the WCF applicant shall provide notice of said public hearing
pursuant to the special exception notice requirements of Â§
27-1002.1. of the Dover Township Zoning Code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Prior to the Board's approval of a special exception
authorizing the construction and installation of tower-based WCF or pole
facility, it shall be incumbent upon the WCF applicant for such special
exception approval to prove to the reasonable satisfaction of the Board that
the WCF applicant cannot adequately extend or infill its communications system
by the use of equipment such as redoes, repeaters, antenna(s) and other similar
equipment installed on existing structures, such as utility poles or their
appurtenances and other available structures. The WCF applicant shall further
demonstrate that the proposed tower-based WCF or pole facility must be located
where it is proposed in order to serve the WCF applicant's service area and
that no other viable, less-intrusive alternative location exists.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The special exception application shall be accompanied by a
description of the type and manufacturer of the proposed transmission/radio
equipment, the frequency range (megahertz band) assigned to the WCF applicant,
the power in watts at which the WCF applicant transmits, and any relevant
related tests conducted by the WCF applicant in determining the need for the
proposed site and installation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â The special exception application shall also be accompanied
by documentation demonstrating that the proposed tower-based WCF or pole
facility complies with all state and federal laws and regulations concerning

or at a minimum be made as a condition attached to any approval given such that
the certification be provided prior to issuance of any building permits.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â Collocation and Siting. An application for a new tower-based
WCF or pole facility shall demonstrate that the proposed tower-based WCF cannot
be accommodated on an existing or approved structure or building, or sited on
land owned and maintained by the Township. The Board may deny an application to
construct a new tower-based WCF or pole facility if the WCF applicant has not
made a good faith effort to mount the antenna(s) on an existing structure. The
WCF applicant shall demonstrate that it contacted the owners of tall
structures, buildings, and towers within a one-quarter- mile radius of the site
proposed, sought permission to install an antenna on those structures,
buildings, and towers and was denied for one of the following reasons:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1)Â Â Â The proposed antenna and accessory equipment would exceed
the structural capacity of the existing building, structure or tower, and its
reinforcement cannot be accomplished at a reasonable cost.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2)Â Â Â The proposed antenna and accessory equipment would cause
radio frequency interference with other existing equipment for that existing
building, structure, or tower and the interference cannot be prevented at a
reasonable cost.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3)Â Â Â Such existing buildings, structures, or towers do not have
adequate location, space, access, or height to accommodate the proposed
equipment or to allow it to perform its intended function.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 4)Â Â Â A commercially reasonable agreement could not be reached
with the owner of such building, structure, or tower.

Part 13
Planned Residential Development
Â§ 27-1301.Â Â Â Purpose.
Â Â Â The purposes of the planned residential development, otherwise known as PRD,
are to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Encourage innovations in residential and commercial development and
renewal so that the growing demand for live/work/shop communities and housing
may be met by greater variety in type, design and layout of dwelling, and by
the conservation and more efficient use of open space ancillary to said
dwellings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Provide greater opportunities for better housing and recreation for
all who are or will be residents of the PRD and/or the Township.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Encourage a more efficient use of land and public services, so that
the economies secured may inure to the benefit of those who need homes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â To encourage more flexible land development which will respect and
conserve natural resources such as streams, lakes, floodplains, groundwater,
wooded areas, steep sloped areas, and areas of natural beauty or importance to
the natural ecosystem.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â In aid of these purposes, provide a procedure which can relate the
type, design, and layout of residential and commercial development to the
particular site and the particular demand for housing existing at the time of
development in a manner consistent with the preservation of the property values
within existing residential areas and ensure that the increased flexibility of
the regulations over land development established hereby is carried out
pursuant to sound, expeditious and fair administrative standards and
provisions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Reduce the excessive sprawl of development and the segregation of
land uses that cause unnecessary traffic congestion.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Promote the creation of places which are oriented to the pedestrian,
thereby promoting citizen security and social interaction.
Â Â Â Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Preserve the remaining rural, historic and agricultural character of
the community by directing new development to appropriate locations and
minimizing the visual impact of development upon the viewsheds of public
roadways.
Â Â Â Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Promote alternative land development practices, which will otherwise
promote the public health, safety, and welfare. Neotraditional neighborhoods
and developments, including hamlets and villages, with well-designed and
connected open spaces for community gathering and recreation are the desired
alternative to conventional, modem use-segregated developments, such as large
lot suburban subdivisions and strip commercial developments.
Â Â Â Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Discourage the development of drive-through facilities which
encourage the use of private automobiles, which contribute to traffic
congestion.
Â Â Â Â Â Â K.Â Â Â Discourage generic-type modem suburban development that bears no
relation to the historic development pattern of York County.
Â Â Â Â Â Â L.Â Â Â Promote the creation of new neighborhoods and developments that
exhibit the design features of traditional neighborhoods, hamlets, villages and
small towns of York County.
Â Â Â Â Â Â M.Â Â Â Promote developments with a mix of residential dwelling types, a
range of lot sizes, mixed-use structures with offices and/or apartments above
ground level, retail uses surrounding a community green and related community
facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â N.Â Â Â Promote developments where the physical, visual and spatial
characteristics are established and reinforced through the consistent use of
compatible urban design and architectural design elements. Such elements shall
relate the design characteristics of an individual structure or development to
other existing and planned structures or developments in a harmonious manner,
resulting in a coherent overall development pattern and streetscape.
Â Â Â Â Â Â O.Â Â Â Promote the creation of developments that are identifiable in the
landscape, surrounded by open space and help preserve sensitive natural
features.
Â Â Â Â Â Â P.Â Â Â Address the design principles embodied in Article VII-A of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code pertaining to traditional
neighborhood development.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Q.Â Â Â The planned residential development shall be generally consistent
with the Dover Township Comprehensive Plan or any specific plan.
(Ord. 2024-01, 5/13/2024)
Â§ 27-1302.Â Â Â Definitions.
Â Â Â Zero lot line single-family detached - a building containing only one
dwelling unit and having two side yards. A zero-lot-line property is one where
a home or building has at least one wall placed on the boundary line of the
property, leaving virtually no room between the building and the boundary line.
This can occur when individual plots are small, and it maximizes living space
at the expense of the yard.
Â Â Â Zero lot line single-family semi-detached - a portion of a building
containing one dwelling unit, having one side yard and having one party wall in
common with another dwelling unit. Each dwelling unit is located on its own
lot. A zero-lot-line property is one where a home or building has at least one
wall placed on the boundary line of the property, leaving virtually no room
between the building and the boundary line. This can occur when individual
plots are small, and it maximizes living space at the expense of the yard.

whether those are recorded by plat, covenant, easement or otherwise shall be
subject to the following provisions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The provisions of the development plan relating to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The use, bulk and location of buildings and structures;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The quantity and location of common open space, except as

residents of the planned residential development but only to the extent
expressly provided in the development plan and in accordance with the terms of
the development plan, and to that extent said provisions, whether recorded by
plat, covenant, easement or otherwise, may be enforced at law or equity by said
residents acting individually, jointly, or through an organization designated
in the development plan to act on their behalf; provided, however, that no
provisions of the development plan shall be implied to exist in favor of
residents of the planned residential development except as to those portions of
the development plan which have been finally approved and have been recorded.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â All those provisions of the development plan authorized to be
enforced by the Township under this section may be modified, removed, or
released by the Township, except grants or easements relating to the service or
equipment of a public utility, subject to the following conditions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No such modification, removal or release of the provisions of the
development plan by the municipality shall affect the rights of the residents
of the planned residential development to maintain and enforce those
provisions, at law or equity, as provided in this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â No modification, removal or release of the provisions of the
development plan by the municipality shall be permitted except upon a finding
by the Board of Supervisors following a public hearing thereon pursuant to
public notice called and held in accordance with the provisions of this Part,
that the same is consistent with the efficient development and preservation of
the entire planned residential development, does not adversely affect either
the enjoyment of land abutting upon or across the street from the planned
residential development or the public interest, and is not granted solely to
confer a special benefit upon any person.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Residents of the planned residential development may, to the
extent and in the manner expressly authorized by the provisions of the
development plan, modify, remove or release their rights to enforce the
provisions of the development plan but no such action shall affect the right of
the Township to enforce the provisions of the development plan in accordance
with the provisions of this section.
(Ord. 2024-01, 5/13/2024)
Â§ 27-1317.Â Â Â Violations.

violated the provisions of this Part shall, upon being found liable therefor in
a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the Township, pay a judgment of not
more than $500 plus all court costs, including reasonable attorney fees
incurred by the Township as a result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be
imposed, levied or payable until the date of the determination of a violation
by the district justice. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the
judgment, the Township may enforce the judgment pursuant to the appropriate
rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute
a separate violation, unless the district justice determining that there has
been a violation further determines that there was a good faith basis for the
defendant violating the ordinance to have believed that there was no such
violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have been only one such
violation until the fifth day following the date of the determination of a
violation by the district justice, and thereafter each day that a violation
continues shall constitute a separate violation. All judgments, costs and
reasonable attorney fees collected for the violation of planned residential
development provisions shall be paid over to the Township.
