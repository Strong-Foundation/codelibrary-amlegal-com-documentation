Section 7.09 Amendments after Adoption.
   (a)   Emergency Appropriations. To meet a public emergency affecting life,
health, property, or the public peace, the council may make emergency
appropriations. Such appropriations may be made by emergency ordinance in
accordance with the provisions of Section 3.14. To the extent that there are no
unappropriated revenues to meet such appropriations, the council may by such
emergency ordinance authorize the issuance of emergency notes, which may be
renewed from time to time, but the emergency notes and renewals of any fiscal
year shall be paid not later than the last day of the fiscal year next
succeeding that in which the emergency appropriation was made.
   (b)   Reduction of Appropriations. If at any time during the fiscal year it
appears probable to the manager that the revenues available will be
insufficient to meet the amount appropriated, he/she shall report to the
council without delay, indicating the estimated amount of the deficit, any
remedial action taken by him/her and his/her recommendations as to any other
steps to be taken. The council shall then take such action as it deems
necessary to prevent or minimize any deficit and for that purpose it shall have
the power by ordinance to reduce one or more appropriations.
   (c)   Transfer of appropriations. After the first day of September of the
current fiscal year the manager may transfer part or all of any unencumbered
appropriation balance among programs within a department, office, or agency
and, upon written request by the manager, the council may by resolution
transfer part or all of any unencumbered appropriation balance from one
department, office, or agency to another, provided that such transfer does not
exceed 5% of the total adopted budget. Any transfer in excess of 5% shall be by
ordinance.
   (d)   Limitations; Effective Date. No appropriation for debt service may be
reduced or transferred, and no appropriation may be reduced below any amount
required by law to be appropriated or by more than the amount of any
unencumbered balance thereof. Emergency appropriations and reduction or
transfer of appropriations authorized by this section may be made effective
immediately upon adoption of the required ordinance.
   (e)   After the adoption of the budget, if projected revenue and other funds
available for appropriation result in a projected surplus, any tax of the
Township may be reduced or repealed consistent with the requirements of Section
7.07(d) of this Charter. *

Section 7.10 Administration of Budget.
   (a)   Work Programs and Allotments. At such time as the manager shall
specify, each department, office, or agency shall submit a schedule for the
ensuing fiscal year showing the requested allotments of its appropriation by
periods within the year for each work program. The manager shall review and
authorize such allotments with or without revision as early as possible in the
fiscal year. He/she may revise such allotments during the year if necessary and
shall revise them with respect to any emergency, reduced, or transferred
appropriations made pursuant to Section 7.09.
   (b)   Payments and Obligations Prohibited. No payment shall be made or
obligation incurred against any allotment or appropriation except in accordance
with appropriations duly made and unless the manager or his/her designee first
certifies that there is a sufficient unencumbered balance in such allotment or
appropriation and that sufficient funds therefrom are or will be available to
cover the claim or meet the obligation when it becomes due and payable. Any
authorization of payment or incurring of obligation in violation of the
provisions of this charter shall be void and any payment so made illegal; such
action shall be cause for removal of any officer who knowingly authorized or
made such payment or incurred such obligation, and he/she shall also be liable
to the Township for any amount so paid. However, except where prohibited by
law, nothing in this charter shall be construed to prevent the making or
authorizing of payments and making of contracts for capital improvements to be
financed wholly or partly by the issuance of bonds or notes or to prevent the
making of any contract or lease providing for payments beyond the end of the
fiscal year, provided that such contract or lease was provided for in the
budget as adopted and that such action is made or approved by ordinance.
Section 7.11 Lapse of Appropriations.
Every appropriation, except an appropriation for a capital expenditure, shall
lapse at the close of the fiscal year to the extent that it has not been
expended or encumbered. An appropriation for a capital expenditure shall
continue in force until the purpose for which it was made has been accomplished
or terminated. Any appropriation for a capital project which is terminated or
abandoned shall be treated as surplus funds pursuant to Section 7.07(d). Any
appropriation for a capital expenditure shall lapse when the purpose of which
the appropriation is made is removed from the capital program of the Township.

   1.   Overtime Pay. At times there may be unexpected or emergency situations
which may require the Township employee to work in excess of eight 8 hours in 1
day or 40 hours in 1 week. When this occurs, hourly and non-exempt salary
employees will be compensated for overtime pay at 1½ times your hourly rate.
Because the Township employee's job directly affects the operation of the local
government or the quality of service the public receives, he will be expected
to work overtime when asked. Refusal to work overtime could result in
disciplinary action.
   2.   Comp Time. Full time (non-office) employees shall have the option of
accumulating comp time for overtime hours in lieu of payment of wages for the
same. Comp time shall accrue
   at a rate of 1.5 times the number of overtime hours worked. Accumulated comp
time hours may be used for paid time off. Requests for compensatory time off

hours not used by the end of a calendar year will be paid out to the employee
at their hourly rate. In the event of retirement or other termination of
employment, unused comp time hours will be paid out with the final paycheck.
(Ord. 83, § 7, 4-9-80; as amended by Ord. 212, 5-11-88; by Ord. 604, 12/5/2018;

      A.   Except as provided in (B), the Township employee will not be
eligible for vacation until he has completed 1 year of continuous service with
the Township and his vacation must be taken in groups of at least 5 days or at
the discretion of the Township Manager. The following is the amount of vacation
accrued after so many years of service:
 
Years of Full Time Service      Weeks of Vacation
0 - Year                        0 - Days
1 Year, But Less Than 5 Years   10 - Work Days
5 Years, But Less Than 15 Years 15 - Work Days
15 or more                      20 - Work Days
 
      B.   The Township Manager shall be eligible for paid vacation after he
has completed three months of continuing service for the Township as follows:
 
Full Time Service                 Weeks of Vacation
0-3 Months                        0 Days
3 Months, but less than 15 months 15 Work Days per year
15 Months or more                 20 Work Days per year
 
   2.   Accumulation of Vacation Time. Any vacation the Township employee has
earned should be taken in the 1-year period between the anniversary date on
which he became entitled to the vacation and his succeeding anniversary date.
Commencing in the year 2002, Township employees will not be permitted to carry
over vacation time into the next year. Any unused vacation at the end of a
given calendar year will be paid to the employee at the time of the last
payroll of the year. [Ord. 413]
   3.   Scheduling. Approval for the scheduling of vacations rests with the
Township Manager, who will, in making his decision, take into account your
performance as well as the efficient management of the work force. If a
vacation is taken during a week which contains a paid holiday, one additional
day vacation will be given in all circumstances.
   4.   Unused Time. If the Township employee terminates his employment and has
unused vacation time, he will be compensated for it, but he must give at least
2 weeks notice of his intended termination. Formula for compensation of
vacation at termination: number of days entitled per year divided by 12 (months
per year), times the number of full months worked.
   5.   Emergency Recall. It is hoped it will never be necessary, but unusual
or emergency situations may require the Township Manager or Maintenance
Supervisor to recall the Township employee to work during his scheduled
vacation. If this happens, the Township employee will be compensated at
overtime pay at 1½ times your hourly rate. Arrangements as to the scheduling of
the remainder of your vacation will be made.

observances.
   3.   Ineligibility. If the Township employee is absent from work the day
before or the day after the holiday for any unauthorized reason, he will not be
eligible for holiday pay.
   4.   Working on Holidays. If the Township employee is required to work on a
holiday, he will be compensated at overtime pay at double time his hourly rate.

feels the Township employee is abusing sick leave, require the Township
employee to provide a certificate from his doctor stating his illness and his
inability to report to work. Sick leave in excess of 5 continuous work days
requires a doctor's certificate stating that the Township employee is fit to
return to work.
   3.   Abuse of Benefit. Patterns of sick leave usage that indicate abuse of

2001, § 3; and by Ord. 652, 12/20/2023, § 3)
§ 1-730.   Leave of Absence Without Pay.
   1.   Circumstances. In certain circumstances the Township will approve leave
of absence without pay. These circumstances might include pregnancy, special
training, educational pursuits or a bona fide injury or illness when all
accumulated sick leave has been used by the employee and there may be other
valid reasons for allowing a leave of absence without pay. Request for this
leave must be made to the Township Manager.
   2.   Requests. A written request to the Township Manager for a leave of
absence without pay will be granted at the Township Manager's discretion. The
Township Manager may request advice from the Personnel Board with respect to
any requests for leave of absence. [Ord. 439]
   3.   Eligibility for Benefits. When the Township employee is on leave of
absence without pay, he may be eligible for life insurance and hospitalization
coverage up to a maximum of 90 days; however, the Township employee cannot earn

(Ord. 83, § 12, 4-9-80; as amended by Ord. 212, 5-11-88; and by Ord. 439, 7-2-
2003)
§ 1-731.   Military Leave.
   1.   Providing Copy of Orders. If for any reason the Township employee is
called to active military service during his employment with the Township, he
will be granted military leave without pay. Before this leave can be granted,
however, the Township employee must provide the Township Manager with a copy of
his orders. Upon completion of his military obligation, the Township employee
may return to his job if, once again, the Township employee provides the
Manager a copy of his orders and provide this copy within ninety (90) days of
his discharge from the service.
   2.   Enlistment. The Township employee will have the same opportunities for
reemployment with the Township if he enlists in times of war, armed conflict,
or in an emergency, proclaimed by the President of the United States or the
Governor. In cases of enlistment, however, the Township employee must request
to be reemployed within 90 days after his first enlistment or when the
emergency or armed conflict was or is concluded.
   3.   Training Leave. If the Township employee is a member of the
Pennsylvania National Guard or other Military Reserve, he will be granted up to
15 days per year of compensated military leave to attend required training,
less any military pay received. This is in addition to his vacation leave. The
Township employee must give a copy of his orders to the Township Manager.
(Ord. 83, § 13, 4-9-80; as amended by Ord. 212, 5-11-88)
§ 1-732.   Jury Duty.
The Township employee will receive no pay for the number of work days he is on
jury duty. After a receipt for his services is submitted to the Township
Manager, he will receive at the next regular pay period, a supplemental pay
which will reflect his regular pay lost minus his jury duty monies. Mileage
paid to the employee while attending jury duty will not reflect in this
deduction.
(Ord. 83, § 14, 4-9-80)
§ 1-733.   Employee Grievances.
   1.   Procedure. In the event of a disagreement between the Township and an
employee, the employee may file a grievance in writing. Within 72 hours after
receiving the employee's written grievance, the Township Manager will then
forward the written grievance to the Personnel Board, who will within 10 work
days after receipt from the Manager respond in writing to the employee's
grievance, agreeing or disagreeing with the employee's appeal and explaining
the reason why. A copy of the board's decision will also be sent to the
Township Manager. If the employee or Township Manager disagrees with the
Personnel Board's decision, or if the Board fails to respond, either may, by
the next regularly scheduled meeting, submit his grievance to the Hanover
Township Council who shall either agree or disagree with the Personnel Board's
decision. The Township employee and Manager will receive a reply in writing
from the Council 3 work days after such scheduled meeting.
   2.   If a CDL employee shall have a grievance regarding:
      A.   His dismisal or discipline by the Township Manager for violation of
the Township's Drug and Alcohol Policy and Testing Program, Stat. Code, Chap.
1, § 770 et seq., or a positive test result thereunder; or,
      B.   The Township's administration of the aforesaid Drug and Alcohol
Policy and Testing Program;
   the employee must submit his grievance directly to the Hanover Township
Council at its next regularly scheduled meeting, instead of submitting his
grievance to the Personnel Board. The Council shall respond and send notice of
its response as provided in Subsection (1) to this Section. For purposes of
this subsection, the phrase "next regularly scheduled meeting" shall mean the
first Council meeting occurring more than 72 hours after the administrative act
or omission which allegedly causes employee's grievance.
   3.   Employee's Status During Grievance Procedure. If the employee's
grievance concerns a reprimand, suspension, demotion or dismissal by his
supervisor, such reprimand, suspension, demotion or dismisaal shall remain in
effect during the grievance procedure. Invocation of the grievance procedure in
no way acts as a supersedeas of the supervisor's action.
(Ord. 83, § 15, 4-9-80; as amended by Ord. 212, 5-11-88; and by Ord. 324, 12-
20-95, § 4)
§ 1-734.   Disciplinary Actions.
   1.   By Township Manager. The Township Manager may reprimand, suspend,
demote or dismiss, if necessary, for just cause. Violation of work rules set
forth in § 735 will be grounds for immediate dismisaal. [Ord. 324]
   2.   Minor Offenses. Except for violation of the work rules which are
grounds for dismissal, employees will receive warning notices from the Township
Manager as follows:
      A.   One oral warning for the first minor offense followed by:
      B.   One written warning for the second minor offense followed by:
      C.   One day off without pay for the third minor offense followed by:
      D.   Three days off without pay for the fourth minor offense. (Ord. 83, §
16, 4-9-80; as amended by Ord. 324, 12-20-95, § 3)
§ 1-735. Employees Work Rules.
   1.   At times it is necessary to discipline a Township employee in order to
maintain an orderly and efficient Township operation, one which will be healthy
and safe for all employees and will ensure the Township's good reputation and
protect its property. Failure to obey these rules will subject the violating
Township employee to disciplinary action up to and including discharge. The
Township intends to enforce them fairly. When discipline is to be taken against
an employee, the Township will consider the seriousness of the action, the
employee's past conduct record, and the circumstances under which the violation
occurred. If the Township employee has a question concerning these work rules,
he may discuss them with the Township Manager.
      A.   The Township employee must be at his appointed work place, ready to
work at his regular starting time and must remain there, except during lunch
periods, until the regular quitting time.

Council.
(Ord. 83, § 29, 4-9-80; as amended by Ord. 212, 5-11-88; and by Ord. 324, 12-
20-95, § 2)
§ 1-736.   Demotions.
Demotions may result from the Township employee's inability to perform his
assigned work, from disciplinary action, etc. The Township employee will be
given priority to be reappointed to his previous job if that job becomes
available within 1 year after his demotion period. The level of his priority
will depend on his work performance in relation to the work performance of
other co-workers.
(Ord. 83, § 17, 4-9-80; as amended by Ord. 212, 5-11-88)
§ 1-737.   Promotions.
New job opportunities may arise and the Township Manager will inform the
Township employee of them. If the Township employee is interested in this
opportunity, his application must be in writing and include his name and the
vacancy for which he is applying. The Township Manager will decide who is to be
promoted after comparing the skills and abilities (taking into consideration
seniority) necessary to perform the job. If promoted, the Township employee
will be required to successfully complete a probationary period of 6 months. If
for some reason the Township employee does not successfully complete the
probationary period, he will be terminated unless a lower level job is
available.
(Ord. 83, § 18, 4-9-80; as amended by Ord. 212, 5-11-88)
§ 1-738.   Provisional Appointments.
Occasionally other departments may be in need of extra help. When this happens,
the Township employee may be temporarily assigned elsewhere. The Township
employee's pay will not change as a result of a temporary assignment.
(Ord. 83, § 19, 4-9-80; as amended by Ord. 212, 5-11-88)
§ 1-739.   Temporary Change in Status.
Sometimes ongoing operations require that the Township Manager temporarily
promote a lower level employee to a position in a higher pay range. Examples of
occurrence of this type might be an approved leave of absence or a long term
disability of the higher level employee. However, such promotion shall be at
the discretion of the Township Manager. If the employee is promoted for a
period exceeding 5 working days, he will at the next following pay period be
paid at the higher rate. The first 5 working days, however, will be reflected
at the employee's present rate.
(Ord. 83, § 20, 4-9-80)
§ 1-740.   Lay Offs.
Lay-offs of permanent Township employees occur only on rare occasions, mainly
as a result of budget cutbacks. When this happens, lay-offs decisions will take
into consideration operational needs, seniority and an employee's work
performance. If a Township employee is laid off, he will have priority for
appointments to any Township jobs which become available for which he is
qualified. This priority is limited to 18 months. If the Township employee is
laid off for more than 18 months, he will be paid for any vacation leave due
which he has not used, but will not be compensated for unused sick leave. If
rehired within the 18 month period, the Township employee will resume his
vacation seniority and sick leave which he had when he was laid off. However,
the Township employee's anniversary date will become his date of rehire and he
must complete one year of continuous service before earning vacations.
(Ord. 83, § 21, 4-9-80; as amended by Ord. 212, 5-11-88)
§ 1-741.   Resignations and Retirements.
   1.   Resignation in Good Standing. To resign in good standing, the Township
employee must submit his resignation to the Township Manager at least 10
working days before leaving. Resignation in good standing is important because
it may affect your eligibility for reinstatement.
   2.   Reinstatement After Resignation. Providing a vacancy exists, the
Township employee may be reinstated to his job or a similar (or lower) job
within one year after resigning without going through the regular selection,
testing and probationary period.
   3.   The Township employee's previous termination or resignation must have
been made under honorable circumstances, and the Township employee must have
successfully completed the initial probationary period. By resigning, the
Township employee relinquishes all vacation, seniority and sick leave, but will
be compensated for all unused vacation time. The Township employee will begin
to earn vacation and sick leave upon reinstatement as if he was a new employee.
(Ord. 83, § 22, 4-9-80; as amended by Ord. 212, 5-11-88)
§ 1-742.   Political Activity.
Each compensated Township employee may participate or refrain from
participating in political activity but no compensated Township employee shall
engage in political activity while performing the duties of his position with
the Township or service as a Township Committee person of a political party. No
employee in any way shall solicit any assessment, subscription, or contribution
for any political party, organization, committee, or candidate from any
compensated officer or Township Employee.
(Ord. 83, § 23, 4-9-80)
§ 1-743.   Outside Jobs.
The Township employee is allowed to have a part-time or full-time outside job,
but must first have, in writing, the approval of the Township Manager who will
decide if his outside employment will not conflict in any way with his Township
job. A note of caution needs to be stated. If the Township employee is injured
while on his other job, the Township is not liable to pay for any disability
incurred.
(Ord. 83, § 24, 4-9-80; as amended by Ord. 212, 5-11-88)

§ 1-745.   Insurance.
   1.   Life Insurance. The Township shall provide to the Township employee a
$35,000 term life insurance policy at the beginning of his employment. At that
time, the Township employee should inform the Manager of whom the beneficiary
(s) will be.

short term and long term disability insurance. Short term shall be limited to
90 days: long term shall commence upon lapse of short term.

injured while performing Township duties, the Township employee is eligible to
receive two-thirds of his base salary (subject to allowable maximum and minimum
benefit levels at the time of the injury and other conditions of the Act) for a
period of time depending upon the seriousness of the injury. All reasonable
medical expenses are also paid. If the Township employee is injured on the job
or is disabled in any way as a result of his job, he must immediately report
this to the Township Manager. Failure to report an injury or a disability
within the time limits could result in the Township employee becoming
ineligible for Compensation Benefits.
(Ord. 83, § 27, 4-9-80; as amended by Ord. 212, 5-11-88)
§ 1-747.   Inservice Training.

§ 1-748.   Dental and Vision Insurance.

The Township recognizes that upon the death of an employee, termination of pay
may have a sudden adverse effect on employee's immediate family until insurance
or other resources can be accessed. Accordingly, Council shall award an amount
equal to two week's base salary for a salaried employee or two week's normal
compensation for an hourly employee, for the benefit of employee’s immediate
family (spouse and dependent children, stepchildren or parents living in the
decedent employee's household). Council may make such award to be used for the
benefit of the entire immediate family to any member of the immediate family,
guardian of a member of the immediate family, or other person or persons deemed

of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, and the employment provisions of

Employment Opportunity Policy is to prevent and eliminate unlawful,
discriminatory practices in employment, because of race, color, religion,
ancestry, age, sex, national origin, non-job related disability, known
association with a disabled individual, possession of a diploma based on
passing a general education development test or willingness or refusal to
participate in abortion or sterilization.
      B.   To conform the employment policies of this Township with the require
ments of said laws and regulations.
(Ord. 399, 10/4/2000, § 797.1)
§ 1-797.2.   Application.
This policy shall apply to all Township employees and applicants for
employment.
(Ord. 399, 10/4/2000, § 797.2)
§ 1-797.3.   Equal Employment Opportunity Policy.
Hanover Township is an equal opportunity employer. This means that Hanover
Township does not discriminate against employees or job applicants on the basis
of race, color, religion, ancestry, age, sex, national origin, non-job related
disability, known association with a disabled individual, possession of a
diploma based on passing a general education development test or willingness or
refusal to participate in abortion or sterilization or on any other basis
prohibited by law. This nondiscrimination policy applies to all terms and
conditions of employment which include, but are not limited to, compensation,
hours, recruitment, selection, training, assignment, evaluation, promotion,
discipline and termination. Harassment based on any status or condition
protected by applicable laws as a form of discrimination prohibited by this
policy. Any employee who becomes aware of any incidence of harassment or
discrimination must bring the matter to the attention of their supervisor or
the Township Manager or as outlined below so that prompt and effective
corrective action may be taken.
(Ord. 399, 10/4/2000, § 797.3)
§ 1-797.4. Sexual Harassment Policy.
   1.   Sexual harassment in the workplace is a form of employment
discrimination. It is the policy of Hanover Township that sexual harassment of
employees or applicants for employment is strictly prohibited and will not be
tolerated. Under this policy, all employees share the responsibility for
assuring that the workplace is free from all forms of sexual harassment.
   2.   Sexual Harassment includes unwelcome sexual advances, request for
sexual favors and/or other verbal or visual or physical conduct of a sexual
nature where:
      A.   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a
term or condition of an individual's employment.
      B.   Submission to or rejection of such conduct of an individual is used
as a basis of employment decisions effecting such individuals.
      C.   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering
with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive working environment.
   3.   Such conduct may also include action by members of the employee's own
sex. Thus, no manager, supervisor or other employee shall threaten or suggest,
either explicitly or implicitly, that another employee or applicant's refusal
to submit to sexual harassment in any form will adversely affect that person's
employment, performance evaluation ratings, wages, compensation, advancement,
assigned duties or any other term or condition of employment. In addition,
offering, promising or granting favored treatment to any other employee or
applicant for employment as a result of that person's engaging in or agreeing
to engage in sexual conduct as well as seeking in any way to make the
performance of a person's job more difficult because of that person's sex or
the refusal of that person to submit to sexual advances is strictly prohibited.
   4.   The following behavior is also prohibited: physical assaults of a
sexual nature, other unwanted and unnecessary contact with another employee,
unwelcomed propositions or sexual flirtation, direct or subtle pressure or
requests for dates of sexual activity, verbal abuse of a sexual nature
including, but not limited to, inappropriate verbal comments about an
individual's body or sexual activities, the inappropriate use of sexually
explicit or offensive language in discussions with or to describe an
individual, sexually explicit offensive jokes and the display in the workplace
of sexually suggestive objects or pictures.
(Ord. 399, 10/4/2000, § 797.4)
§ 1-797.5. Reporting Procedures.
   1.   Any individual that feels that he/she has been a victim of harassment
in any form, including sexual harassment, by any manager, supervisor, co-
worker, customer, client or any other person in connection with his/her
employment should bring the problem immediately to the attention of the
Township Manager.
If the complaint involves the Township Manager, or if the employee is
uncomfortable for any reason with discussion of such matters with the Township
Manager, the employee may bypass the Township Manager and instead should report
the matter promptly to the Chairperson of the Hanover Township Council.
   2.   Hanover Township will investigate all allegations of harassment in as
prompt and confidential a manner as possible and will take appropriate action
when warranted. Any employee that is found, as a result of such investigation,
to have engaged in harassment or discrimination in violation of this policy
will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including
termination of employment. Furthermore, retaliation in any form against an
employee or applicant who exercises his/her right to make a complaint under
this policy or who cooperates in the investigation of any such complaint is
strictly prohibited and will itself be cause for appropriate disciplinary
action.
   3.   Any question regarding this policy should be addressed to the Township
Manager. (Ord. 399, 10/4/2000, § 797.5)

This Part shall be known and cited as the "Hanover Township Emergency Costs
Recovery Ordinance."

§ 712. Declaration of Purpose and Findings.
The Hanover Township Emergency Costs Recovery Ordinance is adopted for the
purpose of promoting the health, safety and welfare of the citizens within
Hanover Township, Lehigh County. The Township Council finds that Han-Le-Co
Volunteer Fire-Rescue Company No. 1 ("Han-Le-Co Fire Company") provides
valuable emergency services, including fire protection, to the persons of this
Township. These services promote the welfare of the Township, preserve the
health and lives of persons and protect property from damage and destruction.
The continued financial stability of Han-Le-Co Fire Company is of paramount
importance to the members of the Township. The Han-Le-Co Fire Company is
required to respond to an increasing number of emergency incidents or false
alarms. The costs of such responses, as well as the costs for the purchase and
maintenance of fire company equipment and supplies, has increased because of
increased responses to emergency calls for accidents on State and Federal
highways in the Township and compliance requirements for new State and Federal
regulations. It is necessary, therefore, for Han-Le-Co Fire Company's financial
stability that Han-Le-Co Fire Company charge a fee for its response to an
emergency incident or false alarm.

Part 1
Floodplain Regulation
§ 100. Statutory Authorization.
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage of the
Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978, delegated the responsibility
to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations to
promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its citizenry.
(Ord. 414, 1/16/2002; as added by Ord. 531, 2/15/2012)
§ 101. Short Title.
This Chapter shall be known as the “Hanover Township Floodplain Ordinance.”
(Ord. 414, 1/16/2002)
§ 102. General Provisions.
   1.   The intent of this Chapter is to:
      A.   Promote the general health, welfare and safety of the community.
      B.   Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in
order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
      C.   Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.
      D.   Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmen tal
units and its residents, by preventing excessive development in areas subject
to flooding.
      E.   Comply with Federal and State floodplain management requirements.
   2.   Applicability. The provisions of this Chapter shall be applicable to
any building, structure, improvement or other use located within an identified
floodplain area.
   3.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This Chapter supersedes any other
conflicting provisions which may be in effect in identified floodplain areas.
However, any other ordinance provisions shall remain in full force and effect
to the extent that those provisions are more restrictive. If there is any
conflict between any of the provisions of this Chapter, the more restrictive
shall apply. [Ord. 531]
   4.   Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause
of phrase of this Chapter shall be declared for any reason whatsoever, such a
decision shall not affect the remaining portions of the ordinance, which shall
remain in full force and effect, and for this purpose the provisions of this
Chapter are hereby declared to be severable.
   5.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
sought by the provisions of this Chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on acceptable engineering methods of study.
Larger floods may occur, flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural
causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This Chapter
does not imply that areas outside any identified floodplain areas, or that land
uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages.
This Chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Township or any
officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on
this Chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 414, 1/16/2002, Pt. I; as amended by Ord. 531, 2/15/2012)
§ 103. Administration.

municipal laws and ordinances. He shall make as many inspec tions during and
upon completion of the work as are necessary. [Ord. 531]
      B.   In the discharge of his duties, the Floodplain Administrator or
other authorized municipal representative shall have the authority to enter any
building, structure, premises or development in the identified floodplain area,
upon presentation of proper credentials, at any reasonable hour to enforce the
provisions of this Chapter. [Ord. 531]
      C.   A record of all such inspections and violations of this Chapter
shall be maintained.
      D.   If the Floodplain Administrator or other authorized representa tive
discovers that the work does not comply with the permit application or any
applicable laws and ordinances, or that there has been a false statement or
misrepresentation, the Floodplain Administrator shall revoke the building
permit and report such fact to the Zoning Officer for whatever action it
considers necessary. [Ord. 531]
   8.   Placards. In addition to the building permit, the Floodplain
Administrator shall issue a placard which shall be displayed on the premises
during the time construction is in progress. This placard shall show the number
of the building permit, the date of its issuance, and be signed by the
Floodplain Administrator. [Ord. 531]
   9.   Actual Start of Construction. Work on the proposed construction or
development shall begin within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of
issuance and shall be completed within twelve (12) months after the date of
issuance of the building permit or the permit shall expire unless a time
extension is granted, in writing, by the Floodplain Administrator. The actual
start of construction means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufacture home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first,
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
Time extensions shall be granted only if a written request is submitted by the
applicant, which sets forth sufficient and reasonable cause for the Floodplain
Administrator to approve such a request.
[Ord. 531]
   10.   Enforcement.
      A.   Notice. Whenever the Floodplain Administrator or other authorized
municipal representative determines that there are reasonable grounds to
believe that there has been a violation of any provisions of this Chapter, or
of any regulations adopted pursuant thereto, the Floodplain Administrator or
other authorized municipal representative shall give notice of such alleged
violation as hereinafter provided. Such notice shall:
         (1)   Be in writing.
         (2)   Include a statement of the reasons for its issuance.
         (3)   Allow a reasonable time not to exceed a period of thirty (30)
days for the performance of any act it requires.
         (4)   Be mailed to the property owner or his agent as the case may
require; provided, however, that such notice or order shall be deemed to have
been properly served upon such owner or agent when a copy thereof has been
served with such notice by any other method autho rized or required by the laws
of this State.
         (5)   Contain an outline of remedial actions, which, if taken, will
effect compliance with the provisions of this Chapter.
      B.   Penalties. Any person who fails to comply with any or all of the
requirements or provisions of this Chapter or who fails or refuses to comply
with any notice, order of direction of the Floodplain Administrator or any
other authorized municipal representative shall be guilty of an offense and,
upon conviction, shall pay a fine to the Township of not less than twenty-five
dollars ($25.00) nor more than six hundred dollars ($600.00) plus costs of
prosecution. In default of such payment, such person shall be imprisoned in
county prison for a period not to exceed ten (10) days. Each day during which
any violation of this Chapter continues shall constitute a separate offense. In
addition to the above penalties all other actions are hereby reserved including
an action in equity for the proper enforcement of this Chapter. The imposition
of a fine or penalty for any violation of, or noncompliance with, this Chapter
shall not excuse the violation or noncompliance or permit it to continue and
all such persons shall be required to correct or remedy such violations and
noncompliance within a reasonable time. Any development initiated or any
structure or building constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered or
relocated, in noncompliance with this Chapter may be declared by Council to be
a public nuisance and abatable as such.
[Ord. 531]
   11.   Appeals.

enforcement.
(Ord. 414, 1/16/2002, Pt. II; as amended by Ord. 531, 2/15/2012)
§ 104. Identification of Floodplain Areas.
   1.   Identification. The identified floodplain area shall be:
      A.   Those areas of Hanover Township, Lehigh County, which are subject to
the one hundred (100) year flood, as identified in the Flood Insurance Study
(FIS) dated July 16, 2004, and the accompanying maps prepared for the Township
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision
thereof; and, [Ord. 531]
      B.   Any community identified flood hazard areas. [Ord. 531]
   2.   Description of Floodplain Areas. The identified floodplain area shall
consist of the following specific areas:
      A.   FW (Floodway Area) - the areas identified as “Floodway” on the FIRM
as well as those floodway areas which have been identified in other available
studies or sources of information for those special floodplain areas where no
floodway has been identified in the Flood Insurance Study. The floodway
represents the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must
be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively
increasing the water surface elevation by more than one (1) foot at any point.
[Ord. 531]
      B.   The AE Area/District without floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS and/or which base
flood elevations have been provided in the FIS but no floodway has been
delineated. [Ord. 531]
      C.   The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS and for which no one percent (1%) annual chance
flood elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and floodway
information from other Federal, State, or other acceptable source shall be used
when available. Where other acceptable information is not available, the
elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary
of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction site. [Ord.
531]
      In lieu of the above, the Township may require the applicant to determine
the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic
and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or
others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical
methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies,
analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow
a thorough technical review by the Township. [Ord. 531]
      D.   Community Identified Flood Hazard Areas - the areas the Township has
identified as local flood hazard or ponding areas, using the best available
topographic data and locally derived information such as flood of record,
historic high water marks, soils, or approximate study methodologies. [Ord.
531]
      E.   Shallow Flooding Area/District - the areas identified as Zones AO
and AH in the FIS and the accompanying maps prepared for the Township by FEMA.
These areas are subject to inundation by one percent (1%) annual chance shallow
flooding where average depths are between one (1) and three (3) feet. In Zones
AO and AH, drainage paths shall be established to guide floodwaters around and
away from structures on slopes. [Ord. 531]
   3.   Changes in Identification of Area. The identified floodplain area may
be revised or modified by the Township Council where studies or information
provided by a qualified agency or person documents the need for such revision.
However, prior to any such change, approval must be obtained from FEMA.
Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six (6) months after
the date such information becomes available, the Township shall notify the FEMA
of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data. [Ord. 531]
   4.   Boundary Disputes. Should a dispute concerning any identified
floodplain boundary arise, an initial determination shall be made by the
Township Planning Commission and any party aggrieved by this decision or
determination may appeal to the Township Council. The burden of proof shall be
on the appellant.
   5.   Jurisdictional Boundary Changes. Upon annexation or other corporate
boundary changes, the Township shall review flood hazard data affecting the
lands subject to boundary changes and incorporate such land in designated
floodplain areas where appropriate, which land so incorporated shall be subject
to the provisions of this Chapter. [Ord. 531]
(Ord. 414, 1/16/2002, Pt. 3; as amended by Ord. 531, 2/15/2012)
§ 105. Technical Provisions.
   1.   General.
      A.   Any new construction, development, uses or activities allowed within
any identified floodplain area, shall be undertaken in strict compliance with
the provisions contained in this Chapter and any other applicable codes,
ordinances and regulations.
      B.   The requirements of this Chapter are in addition to regulations set
forth in §
27-410 of the Zoning Ordinance [
Chapter 27] pertaining to flood hazard areas as defined therein. [Ord. 531]
      C.   Any construction started after the Township’s initial FIRM adoption
and before July 16, 2004, the effective date the most recent Township FIRM was
issued by FEMA, is subject to the ordinance in effect at the time the building
permit was issued, provided the start of construction was within one hundred
eighty (180) days of building permit issuance.[Ord. 531]
   2.   Letter of Map Revision. Technical or scientific data shall be submitted
by the Township to FEMA for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) as soon as
practicable but within six (6) months of any new construction, development, or
other activity resulting in changes in the one hundred (100) year flood
elevation. The situations when a LOMR or a Conditional Letter of Map Revision
(CLOMR) are required are:
      A.   Any development that causes a rise in the one hundred (100) year
flood elevations within the floodway; or,
      B.   Any development occurring in areas identified by FEMA’s Flood
Insurance Study as Zones A1-30 and Zone AE without a designated floodway, which
will cause a rise of more than one (1) foot in the one hundred (100) year flood
elevation; or,
      C.   Alteration or relocation of a stream (including, but not limited to,
installing culverts and bridges).
[Ord. 531]
   3.   Construction Near Watercourse. Within any identified floodplain area,
no new construction or development shall be located within the area measured
fifty (50) feet landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse, unless a
permit is obtained from the Department of Environment Protection Regional
Office. [Ord. 531]
   4.   Alteration or Relocation of Watercourse.
      A.   No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse until all adjacent municipalities which may be affected
by such action have been notified by the municipality, and until all required
permits or approvals have been first obtained from the Department of
Environmental Protection Regional Office.
      B.   No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse unless it can be shown that the activity will not
reduce or impede the flood carrying capacity of the watercourse in any way.
      C.   In addition, the FEMA and Pennsylvania Department of Community and
Economic Development, shall be notified prior to any alteration or relocation
of any watercourse.
[Ord. 531]
   5.   Special Requirements for FW and AE Areas.
      A.   Within any FW (Floodway Area), the following provisions apply:
         (1)   No new construction, development, use, activity, or encroachment
shall be allowed unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice
that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels
within the Township during the occurrence of a one hundred (100) year flood
discharge.
         (2)   No new construction or development shall be allowed, unless a
permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection Regional
Office.
         (3)   In AE Area/District without floodway, no new development, shall
be permitted unless it can be demonstrated that the cumulative effect of all
past and projected development will not increase the BFE by more than one (1)
foot.
         (4)   No permit shall be granted for any construction, develop ment,
use, or activity within any AE Area/District without floodway unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development would not,
together with all other existing and antici pated development, increase the BFE
more than (1) foot at any point.
[Ord. 531]
   6.   Elevation and Floodproofing Requirements; Building Construction
Standards. The provision of this subsection (6) shall be enforced as part of
the building code by the building official. [Ord. 531]
      A.   Residential Structures.
         (1)   Within AE, A1-30 and AH Zones as designated on the FIRM any new
construction or substantial improvement of a residential structure shall have
the lowest floor (including basement) elevated up to or above the regulatory
flood elevation. [Ord. 531]
         (2)   In A Zones where there are no BFE’s specified on the FIRM, any
newy construction or substantial improvement shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated up to, or above, the regulatory flood elevation
determined in accordance with subsection (6)(C)(2)(b). [Ord. 531]
         (3)   The design and construction standards and specifications
contained in the 2009 International Building Code (IBC) and in the 2009
International Residential Code (IRC) or the most recent revisions thereof and

of a named insured for fire damage to a structure located within the Township
where the amount recoverable for the fire loss to the structure under all
policies exceeds seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500.00) unless the
insuring agent is furnished with a certificate pursuant to subsection (2.) of
this Section and unless there is compliance with the procedures set forth in
subsections (1.) and (4.) of this Section.
   2.   A.   The Tax Collector shall, upon the written request of the named
insured specifying the tax description of the property, name and address of the
insuring agent and the date agreed upon by the insurance company, association
or exchange and the named insured as the date of the receipt of a loss report
of the claim, furnish the insuring agent either of the following within
fourteen (14) working days of the request:
         (1)   A certificate or, at the discretion of the Township in writing
by the insurer to the effect that, as of the date specified in the request,
there are no delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties or user charges against
the property and that, as of the date of the Tax Collector’s certificate, the
Township has not incurred by the municipality for the removal, repair or
securing of a building or other structure on the property; or,
         (2)   A certificate and bill showing the amount of delinquent taxes,
assessments, penalties and user charges against the property as of the date
specified in the request that have not been paid as of the date of the
certificate and also showing, as of the date of the Tax Collector’s
certificate, the amount of the total costs, if any, that have been incurred by
the Township for the removal, repair or securing of a building or other
structure on the property. For the purposes of this subparagraph, the Tax
Collector shall certify the total amount, if any, of such costs. A tax,
assessment, penalty or user charge becomes delinquent at the time and on the
date a lien could otherwise have been filed against the property by the
Township under applicable law.
      B.   (1)   Upon the receipt of a certificate pursuant to paragraph (A.)
(1) of this subsection, insuring agent shall pay the claim of the named insured
in accordance with the policy terms, unless the loss agreed to between the
named insured and the insuring agent or exceeds sixty per centum (60%) of the
aggregate limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or
other structure. In the case of such a loss, the insuring agent, the insured
property owner and the municipality shall follow the procedures set forth in
subsections (3.) and (4.) of this Section.
         (2)   Upon the receipt of a certificate and bill pursuant to paragraph
(A.)(2) of this subsection, insuring agent shall return the bill to the Tax
Collector and transfer to the Township an amount from the insurance proceeds
necessary to pay the taxes, assessments, penalties, charges and costs as shown
on the bill. The Township shall receive the amount and apply or credit it to
payment of the items shown in the bill.
   3.   When the loss agreed to between the named insured and the insuring
agent equals or exceeds sixty per centum (60%) of the aggregate limits of
liability on all fire policies covering the building or other structure, the
insuring agent shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the Tax Collector
in the aggregate two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) for each fifteen thousand
dollars ($15,000.00) and each fraction of that amount of a claim, or, if at the
time of a loss report the named insured has submitted a contractor’s signed
estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other
structure in an amount less than the amount calculated under the foregoing
transfer formula, the insuring agent shall transfer from the insurance proceeds
the amount specified in the estimate. The transfer of proceeds shall be on a
pro rata basis by all companies, associations or exchanges insuring the
building or other structure. Policy proceeds remaining after the transfer to
the Township shall be disbursed in accordance with the policy terms. The named
insured may submit a contractor’s signed estimate of the costs of removing,
repairing or securing the building or other structure after the transfer, and
the Tax Collector shall return the amount of the fund in excess of the estimate
to the named insured if the Township has not commenced to remove, repair or
secure the building or other structure.
   4.   Upon receipt of proceeds by the Township as authorized by this Section,
the Tax Collector shall place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used solely
as security against the total cost of removing, repairing or securing incurred
by the Township. Such costs shall include, without limitation, any engineering,
legal or administrative costs incurred by the Township in connection with such
removal, repair or securing of the building or any proceedings related thereto.
When transferring the funds as required in subsection (3.) of this Section, an
insuring agent shall provide the Township with the name and address of the
named insured, whereupon the Township shall contact the named insured, certify
that the proceeds have been received by the Township and notify the named
insured that the procedures under this subsection shall be followed. The fund
shall be returned to the named insured when repairs, removal or securing of the
building or other structure have been completed in accordance with all
applicable ordinances, regulations and orders of the Township and the required
proof of such completion received by the Tax Collector, and if the Township has
not incurred any costs for repairs, removal or securing. If the Township has
incurred costs for repairs, removal or securing of the building or other
structure, the costs shall be paid from the fund, and, if excess funds remain,
the Township shall transfer the remaining funds to the named insured. Nothing
in this Section shall be construed to limit the ability of a Township to
recover any deficiency. Further, nothing in this subsection shall be construed
to prohibit the Township and the named insured from entering into an agreement
that permits the transfer of funds to the named insured if some other
reasonable disposition of the damaged property has been negotiated.
   5.   Proof of payment by the insuring agent of proceeds under a policy in
accordance with subsection (3. of this Section is conclusive evidence of the
discharge of its obligation to the insured under the policy to the extent of
the payment and of compliance by the company, association or exchange with
subsection (3.) of this Section.
   6.   Nothing in this Section shall be construed to make an insuring agent
liable for any amount in excess of proceeds payable under its insurance policy
or for any other act performed pursuant to this Section or to make a Township
or public official an insured under a policy of insurance or to create an
obligation to pay delinquent property taxes or unpaid removal liens or expenses
other than as provided in this Section.
   7.   An insuring agent making payments of policy proceeds under this Section
for delinquent taxes or structure removal liens or removal expenses incurred by
the Township shall have a full benefit of such payment, including all rights of
subrogation and of assignment.
   8.   Subsections (1.) and (2.) of this Section shall apply only to fire
losses that occur after the effective date of this Part 8.
(Ord. 575, 6/17/2015, § 2)
§ 803. Enactment.

provisions of this Part shall, upon conviction, be fined not less than five

thereof, shall be imprisoned for not more than ninety (90) days.

tapping fee and connection fee for such average daily discharge for the year in
which the excess first occurred and the discharge allocation of the said permit
shall be revised to the higher amount.

   1.   Prohibited Discharge Standards.
      A.   General Prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be
introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater which causes pass through
or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW
whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any
other National, State or local pretreatment standards or requirements.
      B.   Specific Prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be
introduced into the POTW the following pollutants, substances or wastewater:
         (1) Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the POTW
including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed-cup flashpoint of
less than 140° F (600°C) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR § 261.21.
         (2) Wastewater having a pH less than five (5.0) or more than twelve
(12.0), or otherwise causing corrosive structural damage to the POTW or
equipment.
         (3) Solid or viscous substances in amounts which, alone or in
combination with other substances, will cause obstruction of the flow in the
POTW resulting in interference.
         (4) Pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.),
released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which,
either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause interference
with the POTW.
         (5) Wastewater having a temperature that will inhibit biological
activity in the treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case
wastewater which causes the temperature at the introduction into the treatment
plant to exceed 104°F (400°C).
         (6) Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil or products of mineral
oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference or pass through.
         (7) Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors or
fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and
safety problems.
         (8) Trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points
designated by the Township Manager in accordance with §
18-603(4) of this Part.
         (9) Noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids or other wastewater

create a public nuisance or a hazard to life, or to prevent entry into the
sewers for maintenance or repair.
         (10) Wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by the
treatment process such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning
solutions, which consequently imparts color to the treatment plant's effluent,
thereby violating the Township's NPDES permit.
         (11) Wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes except
in compliance with applicable State and Federal regulations.
         (12) Stormwater, surface water, ground water, artisan well water, roof
runoff, subsurface drainage, significant quantities of condensate, deionized

authorized by the Township Manager.
         (13) Sludges, screenings or other residues from the pretreatment of
industrial wastes.
         (14) Medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by the Township
Manager in a wastewater discharge permit.
         (15) Wastewater causing, along or in conjunction with other sources,
the treatment plant's effluent to fail a toxicity test.
         (16) Detergents, surface-active agents or other substances which may
cause excessive foaming in the POTW or its discharge.
         (17) Fats, oils or greases of animal or vegetable origin in
concentrations greater than two hundred (200) mg/l. Pollutants, substances or
wastewater prohibited by this Section shall not be processed or stored in such
a manner that they could be discharged to the POTW.
      C.   Surcharge.
         (1) Nothing contained in this Section shall prohibit any special
agreement or arrangement between the Township and any person under which waste
of unusual strength or character may be admitted into the POTW. Such waste will
be subject to payment of a surcharge therefore by such persons, or by proper
and continuous pretreatment before discharge into the sewerage system. However,
no such special agreement or arrangement shall allow violation of Federal
pretreatment requirements. The surcharge shall be revised annually, and shall
be initially determined by the following formula:
      QUARTERLY SURCHARGE = 8.34 Q [(BOD-300) $0.085 + (85-360) $0.076 + (TKN -
85) $0.1841
      Where:   8.34 is a constant used to convert waste strength expressed in
mg/I of BOD and/or SS and/or TKN into pounds of BOD and/or SS and/or TKN per
million gallons of waste.
      Q   is the quarterly waste flow from an unproved property expressed in
millions of gallons.
      BOD   is the biochemical oxygen demand of the waste in mg/l.
      SS   is tile suspended solids of the waste in mg/1
      TKN   is the total Kjeldahl nitrogen of the waste in mg/l.
         The allowable waste strengths in mg/I prescribed in this Section for
biochemical oxygen demands, suspended solids, and total Kjeldahl nitrogen are
300, 360 and 85.
            (a) To determine the strength of every waste requiring a surcharge,
the Township shall sample and analyze 4 times each year. For users discharging
more than 1,000,000 gallons per day, sampling shall consist of seven 24 hour
composite samples taken every day for seven consecutive days. For users
discharging less than 1,000,000 gallons per day, the Township will determine
appropriate sampling and analyses periods. The Township will consider any
relevant factors an industry brings forth in deciding the sampling period. The
average of said analyses shall be used to establish the surcharge for the
quarter during which the samples are taken and quarterly billings shall be made
by the Township.
            (b) A penalty of 5% shall be added to bills not paid within 30 days
of the date of the bill. If the bill is not paid within 60 days, a second
penalty of 5% shall be added to the amount of the bill. Commencing with the
61st day of the unpaid bill, there shall be a carrying charge of 1% per month
or fraction of a month of the outstanding balance added to the amount of the
bill.
         (2) Waste from any source in any of the following categories shall not
be discharged into the sewerage system:
            (a) Waste having BOD greater than 300 mg/1, unless permitted by a

of an improved property shall provide at the owner's expense such facilities
for preliminary treatment and processing of industrial waste as may be
necessary to:
            (a) Reduce BOD to 300 mg/1 and suspended solids to 360 mg/1 and
total Kjeldahl nitrogen to 85 mg/l.
   2.   National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The categorical
pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR, Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471,
are hereby incorporated.
      A.   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
Township Manager may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in
accordance with 40 CFR § 403.6 (c).
      B.   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the Township Manager
shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40
CFR § 403.6 (e).
      C.   A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment
standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive
provisions in 40 CFR § 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are
fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the
categorical pretreatment standard.
      D.   A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard
in accordance with 40 CFR § 403.15.
   3.   State Pretreatment Standards. Reserved.
   4.   Local Limits. Limits for discharging pollutants which are of concern to
the POTW will be made using headworks loading analyses which has been reviewed
and approved by the Township Manager. Allocations for discharging such
pollutants will be made to each significant industrial user. Limits may be in
the form of monthly average concentration, daily maximum concentration or
instantaneous maximum concentration. Limits will be contained in the wastewater
discharge permits issued. All concentrations for metallic substances are for
"total" metal unless indicated otherwise. The Township Manager may impose mass
limitations in addition to, or in place of, the concentration based limitations
above.
   5.   Township's Right of Revision. The Township reserves the right to
establish, by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent
standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW.
   6.   Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in
any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless
expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The
Township manager may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to
meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when
the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
(Ord. 339, 7/3/1996, § 4)
§ 18-603. Pretreatment of Wastewater.
   1.   Pretreatment Facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as
necessary to comply with this Part and shall achieve compliance with all
categorical pretreatment standards, local limits and the prohibitions set out
in §
18-602(1) of this Part within the time limitations specified by the EPA, the
State or the Township Manager, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities
necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated and maintained at the
user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating
procedure shall be submitted to the Township Manager for review, and shall be
acceptable to the Twonship Manager before such facilities are constructed.
Review and acceptance of plans are not an endorsement of the effectiveness of
any facilities set forth therein and the Township shall not be held liable in
any way for the performance of said facilities. The review of such plans and
operating procedures shall in no way relieve the riser from the responsibility
of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to
the Township under the provisions of this Part.
   2.   Additional Pretreatment Measures.
      A.   Whenever deemed necessary, the Township Manager may require users to
restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate
points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams,
and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine
the user's compliance with the requirements of this Part.
      B.   The Township Manager may require any person discharging into the
POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a
suitable storage and flow control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A
wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
      C.   Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Township Manager, they are necessary for the proper handling of
wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that
such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception
units shall be of type and capacity approved by the Township Manager and shall
be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such

concentration, and/or mass, where required by the standard or by the Township
Manager, of regulated pollutants in tile discharge from each regulated process.
Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long-term average concentrations, or mass,
where required, shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily
operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in §
18-606(1) of this Part.
            (c) Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set
out in §
18-606 (11) of this Part.
         (6) Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized
representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not,
whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
         (7) Compliance Schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be
required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the
user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion date
in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for
the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this
Section must meet the requirements set out in §
18-606(2) of this Part.
         (8) Signature and Certification. All baseline monitoring reports must
be signed and certified in accordance with §
18-604(6) of this Part.
   2.   Compliance Schedule Progress Reports. The following conditions shall
apply to the compliance schedule required by §
18-606(1)(B)(7) of this Part:
      A.   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to,
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts
for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation).
      B.   No increment referred to above shall exceed 9 months.
      C.   The user shall submit a progress report to the Township Manager no
later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of
compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it compiled with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps
being taken by the user to return to the established scheduled.
      D.   In no event shall more than 9 months elapse between such progress
reports to the Township Manager.
   3.   Reports on Compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standard Deadline.
Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source, following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject
to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the Township
Manager a report containing the information described in §
18-606(1)(B)(4) through (6) of this Part. For users subject to equivalent mass
or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR
§ 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-
term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the
user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance
reports must be signed and certified in accordance with §
18-604 (6) of this Part.
   4.   Periodic Compliance Reports.
      A.   All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by
the Township Manager but in no case less than twice per year (in June and
December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of
pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the
measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period.
All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with
§
18-606(4) of this Part.
      B.   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
      C.   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this Section
monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the Township Manager,
using the procedures prescribed in §
18-606(10) and §
18-606(11) of this Part, the results of this monitoring shall be included in
the report.
   5.   Reports of Changed Conditions. Each user must notify the Township
Manager of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system
which might alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater at least 90
days before the change.
      A.   The Manager of Water Resources may require the user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition,
including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under §
18-604(5) of this Part.
      B.   The Township Manager may issue a wastewater discharge permit under §
18-604(7) of this Part or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under
§
18-605(4) of this Part in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed
conditions.
      C.   For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but
are not limited to, flow increases of 20% or greater, and the discharge of any
previously unreported pollutants.
   6.   Reports of Potential Problems.
      A.   In the case of any discharge including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge or a slug load that may cause potential problems
for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the Township
Manager of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the
discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective
actions taken by the user.
      B.   Within 5 days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the Township Manager, submit a detailed written report describing the
cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent
similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, natural resources or any other damage to person or
property, nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties
or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this Part.
      C.   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a
discharge described in subsection (A), above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees who may cause such a discharge to occur are advised of the emergency
notification procedure.
   7.   Reports from Unpermitted Users. All users not required to obtain a
wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the Township
Manager as the Township Manager may require.
   8.   Notice of Violation/Repeat Sampling and Reporting. If sampling
performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the lbwnship
Manager within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also
repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis
to the Township Manager within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation.
The user is not required to resample if the Township Manager samples between
the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this
sampling.
   9.   Notification of the Discharge of Hazardous Waste.
      A.   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director and State
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR, Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste
as set forth in 40 CFR, Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type
of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the user discharges more than 100
kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also
shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known
and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that
calendar month, and an estimation of tile mass of constituents in the
wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All
notifications must take place no later than 180 days after tile discharge
commences. Any notification under this subsection need by submitted only once
for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notification of changed
conditions must be submitted under §
18-606(5) of this Part. This notification requirement in this Section does not
apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §
18-606(1), §
18-606(3), and §
18-606(4) of this Part.
      B.   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (A),
above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15
kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity
of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR s§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e),
requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user
discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
      C.   In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA identifying
additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional
substances as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the Township Manager, the
EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director and State hazardous waste
authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective
date of such regulations.
      D.   In the case of any notification made under this Section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
      E.   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance
not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this Part, a permit issued
thereunder or any applicable Federal or State law.
   10.   Analytical Requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR, Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR, Part 136, does not contain
sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA.
   11.   Sample Collection.
      A.   Except as indicated in subsection (B), below, the user must collect
wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In
the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the Township Manager may
authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab
samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative
sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be
required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
      B.   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenola,
sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
   12.   Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the
date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern.
   13.   Record Keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
Part shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records
of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this
Part and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring
activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records
shall include the date, exact place, method and time of sampling, and the name
of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who
performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used and the
results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of
at least 3 years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration
of any litigation concerning the user or the Township, or where the user has
been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Township
Manager.
(Ord. 339, 7/3/1996, § 4)
§ 18-607. Compliance Monitoring.
   1.   Right of Entry; Inspection and Sampling. The Township Manager shall
have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user
is complying with all requirements of this Part and any wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the Township Manager ready
access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
      A.   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the Township Manager will be permitted to enter
without delay for the purposes or performing specific responsibilities.
      B.   The Township Manager shall have the right to set up on the user's
property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
      C.   The Township Manager may require the user to install monitoring
equipment necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at
its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall
be calibrated annually to ensure their accuracy.
      D.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
user at the written or verbal request of the Township Manager and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user.
      E.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Township Manager access to the
user's premises shall be a violation of this Part.
   2.   Search Warrants. If the Township Manager has been refused access to a
building, structure or property, or any part thereof, and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
Part, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program of the Township designed to verify compliance
with this part or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the
overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the Township
Manager may seek issuance of a search warrant from the appropriate issuing
authority.
(Ord. 339, 7/3/1996, § 4)
§ 18-608. Confidential Information.
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits and monitoring
programs, and from the Township Manager inspection and sampling activities,
shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user
specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Township Manager, that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade
secrets under applicable State law. Any such request must be asserted at the
time of submission of tile information or data. When requested and demonstrated
by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held
confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or
secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but
shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for
uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement
proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents
and characteristics and other effluent data as defined by 40 CFR, § 2.302 will
not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the
public without restriction.
(Ord. 339, 7/3/1996, § 4)
§ 18-609. Publication of Users in Significant Noncompliance.
The Township Manager shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper
published in tile municipality where tile POTW is located, a list of the users
which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant
noncompliance shall mean:
      A.   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of wastewater measurements taken during a 6 month
period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant
parameter by any amount.
      B.   Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter
during a 6 month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum
limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD,
TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH).
      C.   Any other discharge violation that the Township Manager believes has
caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass
through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general
public.
      D.   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the Township Manager of
exercise of his emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge.
      E.   Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement
order for starting construction, completing construction or attaining final
compliance.
      F.   Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date any required
reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with
categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports
and reports on compliance with compliance schedules.
      G.   Failure to accurately report noncompliance.
      H.   Any other violation(s) which the Township Manager determines will
adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment
program.
(Ord. 339, 7/3/1996, § 4)
§ 18-610. Administrative Enforcement Remedies.
   1.   Notification of Violation. When the Township Manager finds that a user
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Part, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the Township Manager may serve upon that user a written notice
of violation. Within 20 days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of
the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention
thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user
to the Township Manager. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of
violation. Nothing in this Section shall limit the authority of the Township
Manager to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
   2.   Consent Agreements. The Township Manager may enter into consent
agreements, assurances of voluntary compliance or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such
documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the
noncompliance within a time period specified by the document.
   3.   Show Cause Hearing. The Township Manager may order a user which has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Part, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, to appear before the Township Manager and show cause why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the
user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement
action, the reasons for such action and a request that the user show cause why
the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least 10 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on
any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a
bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   4.   Compliance Orders. When the Township Manager finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Part, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the Township Manager may issue an order to the user responsible
for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a
specified time. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance
established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance
order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing
violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   5.   Cease and Desist Orders. When the Township Manager finds that a user
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Part, a wastewater
discharge permit order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, or that the users past violations are likely to recur, the
Township Manager may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and
desist all such violations and directing the user to:
      A.   Immediately comply with all requirements; and,
      B.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist
order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
   6.   Administrative Civil Penalties.
      A.   When the Township Manager finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this Part, a wastewater discharge permit
or other issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
the Township Manager may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $25,000
regardless of jurisdictional boundaries. Such penalties shall be assessed on a
per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average
discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of
violation. The penalties may be assessed whether or not the violation was
willful or negligent.
      B.   Notice of assessment of civil penalty shall state the appeal process
to be followed including the name, address and telephone number of the person
responsible for accepting such appeal. Said notice shall also contain the date
or dates of violation, the permit requirement that was violated and the amount
of civil penalty assessed. The notice shall state the time frame for appeal. It
shall be served personally on the violator or shall be sent by certified mail
to the address of the permit holder as noted on the permit.
      C.   The civil penalty shall be assessed in accordance with subsection
(D), below, which sets forth the City of Allentown's assessment policy
considering damage to air, water, land or other natural resources, cost of
restoration and abatement, savings resulting to the person for the violation,
history of past violations, deterrence of future violations and other relevant
factors.

Points shall be assessed for a violation in accordance with the above chart
which constitutes the Township of Hanover assessment policy.
Points shall be totaled and the civil penalty shall be assessed as follows:
 
Number of Points Penalty
25               $25,000
20               20,000
15               15,000
10               10,000
5                5,000
 
The assessment of penalties may include numbers which are not whole, such as
1.5, to allow flexibility and discretion by the Township Manager in arriving at
a fair and appropriate penalty. The above listed monetary civil penalties shall
be then prorated to reflect the less than whole number of points assessed.
Example: Total Points = 12.5 Civil Penalty = $12,500.
      E.   All civil penalties collected shall be placed in a restricted
account and shall only be used by the Township of Hanover to repair damage and
provide for additional maintenance and costs as a result of violations, to pay
penalties imposed by State or Federal government for violation of pretreatment
standards, for the costs of investigation and enforcement action resulting in
penalty for monitoring of discharge in the pretreatment program and for capital
improvement to the POTW.
      F.   Any party seeking to appeal the assessment of a civil penalty shall
do so by filing a notice of appeal with the Township Manager within 30 days
after receipt or service of said notice. The Appeal Board shall hear all such
appeals. A transcript shall be made of said hearing at the sole expense of the
appellant. Appellant shall pay the cost of appeal and the sum for estimate of
stenographer bills at the time of filing said appeal and the sum for estimate
of stenographer bills at the time of filing said appeal. Failure to pay said
sums at the time of filing shall make the appeal void. The charge for an appeal
and the advancement of stenographer costs shall be established by the Township
administrative regulations. After the hearing, any additional stenographer
charges shall be billed to appellant and shall be paid in full within 10 days
of receipt or appeal shall be null and void. The Appeals Board shall either
affirm the decision of the Township Manager or reverse or modify the same as
the substantial evidence indicates in accordance with the assessment policy
adopted by the Township. Appeals from the decision of the Appeals Board shall
be in accordance with State law.
      G.   Each permit holder shall keep the Township appraised in writing of
any change in mailing address. The address on the permit shall be used to send
all correspondence and notice of civil assessment to permit holders. The
sending of a notice of civil assessment to a permit holder's address on permit
shall conclusively be presumed to be valid service; thus, if the certified mail
sent to such address is not accepted or picked up by permit holder, the date of
service shall be the date that the certified mail was rejected or returned
unclaimed.
      H.   The Township shall charge all costs for reestablishing the operation
of the publicly owned treatment works after a user has violated, or continues
to violate any provision of this Part, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement. These costs
shall be paid by user within 10 days after notice of assessment of tile same.
Notice and appeal rights shall be the same as in the case of assessment of
civil penalties. Any user not paying said assessment shall pay an additional
penalty of 5% of the penalty per month or any part thereof.
      I.   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 339, 7/3/1996, § 4)
§ 18-611. Judicial Enforcement Remedies.
   1.   Injunctive Relief. When the Township Manager finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Part, a wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the Township Manager may petition the Lehigh County Court of
Common Pleas through the Township Solicitor's Attorney for the issuance of a
temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels
the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order or other
requirement imposed by this Part on activities of the user. The Township
Manager may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or
equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental
remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
   2.   Civil Penalties.
      A.   A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this Part, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the Township for
a maximum civil penalty of $25,000 per violation, per day. In the case of a
monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for
each day during the period of the violation.
      B.   The Township Manager may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court
costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred
by the Township.
      C.   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user and any other factor as
justice requires.
      D.   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
   3.   Criminal Prosecution.
      A.   A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this
Part, a wastewater discharge permit, or other issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
summary offense, punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 per violation,
per day or imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or both.
      B.   A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into
the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least
$1,000 or be subject to imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or both. The
penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury
or property damage available under State law.
      C.   A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations or
certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other documentation
filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this Part, wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with or
knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under
this Part shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000
per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or both.
   4.   Remedies Nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this Part are not
exclusive. The Township Manager may take any, all or any combination of these
actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations
will generally be in accordance with the Township's enforcement response plan.
However, the Township Manager may take other action against any user when the
circumstances warrant. Further, the Township Manager is empowered to take more
than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
(Ord. 339, 7/3/1996, § 4)
§ 18-612. Supplemental Enforcement Action.
   1.   Performance Bonds. The Township Manager may decline to issue or reissue
a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any
provision of this Part, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user
first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the Township, in a sum not to
exceed a value determined by the Township Manager to be necessary to achieve
consistent compliance.
   2.   Liability Insurance. The Township Manager may decline to issue or
reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with
any provision of this Part, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the
user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient
to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.
   3.   Contractor Listing. Users which have not achieved compliance with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements are not eligible to receive
a contractual award for the sale of goods or services to the Township. Existing
contracts for the sale of goods or services to the Township held by a user
found to be in significant noncompliance with pretreatment standards or
requirements may be terminated at the discretion of the Township Manager.
(Ord. 339, 7/3/1996, § 4)
§ 18-613. Affirmative Defenses to Discharge Violations.
   1.   Upset.
      A.   For the purpose of this Section, "upset" means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
      B.   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of subsection (C), below, are met.
      C.   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or
other relevant evidence that:
         (1) An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset.
         (2) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures.
         (3) The user has submitted the following information to the Township
Manager within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is
provided orally, a written submission must be provided within 5 days:
            (a) A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance.
            (b) The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times if
not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance or, is expected to
continue.
            (c) Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      D.   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
      E.   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
      F.   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or falls.
   2.   Prohibited Discharge Standards. A user shall have an affirmative
defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the
general prohibitions in §
18-602(1)(A) of this Part or the specific prohibitions in §
18-602(1)(B)(3) through (17) of this Part if it can prove that it did not know,
or have reason to know, that its discharge, along or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and
that either:
      A.   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through
or interference.
      B.   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when
the Township was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case
of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge user or disposal
requirements.
   3.   Bypass.
      A.   For the purpose of this Section:
         (1) "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
portion of a user's treatment facility.
         (2) "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
      B.   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provisions of subsections (C) and (D) of this Section.
      C.   Notification of Bypass.
         (1) If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Township Manager, at least 10 days before the date
of the bypass, if possible.
         (2) A user shall submit oral notice to the Township Manager of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within 5 days of the time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The Township Manager may waive the written report
on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
      D.   Bypass Prohibited.
         (1) Bypass is prohibited, and tile Township Manager may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
            (a) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury
or severe property damage.
            (b) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance.
            (c) The user submitted notices as required under subsection (C) of
this Section.
         (2) The Township Manager may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Township Manager determines that it
will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (D) (1) of this Section.
(Ord. 339, 7/3/1996, § 4)
§ 18-614. Hearing Board.
   1.   An Industrial Hearing Board shall be appointed by the Township Manager
with the advice and consent of Council, for resolution of differences between
the Industrial Waste Manager and owners of any improved property on matters

(Ord. 339, 7/3/1996, § 4)
B.   Industrial Cost Recovery Systems.
§ 18-621. Purpose and Scope.
   1.   This ICRS implements the requirements of § 204(b)(1)(B) of P.L. 92-500,
33 § 1284(b)(1)(B), the amendments of 1977 as well as the regulations and
guidelines issued pursuant thereto, in order to maintain eligibility for
Federal rants which provide necessary funds for the construction of wastewater
treatment works.
   2.   It is the intent of this ICRS to provide for payment by each industrial
user, in addition to the already established system of rates and charges
currently in effect, of such user's appropriate share of Federal construction
rant funds which are allocable to the treatment of industrial wastes by the
Township.
(Ord. 339, 7/3/1996, § 4)
§ 18-622. Effective Date.
The provisions of this ICRS shall become effective on the first day that any
Township treatment works assisted with a Federal grant awarded after March 1,
1973, shall become operational. For the purposes of the ICRS, treatment works
become operational on the day that the Township officially accepts the works
from the contractor responsible for their construction.
(Ord. 339, 7/3/1996, § 4)
§ 18-623. Definitions.
In addition to the term defined in §
18-601(4) of Hanover Township [Statutory Code], the following definitions apply
herein:
   EXPANSION—an increase in collection and/or treatment capacity.
   INFILTRATION—the water entering a sewer system from the ground, through such
means as, but not limited to, defective pipes, pipe joints, connections or
manhole walls. Infiltration does not include, and is distinguished from,
inflow.
   INFLOW—the water discharged into a sewer system, including service
connections from such source as, but not limited to, roof leaders, cellar, yard
and area drains, foundation drains, cooling water discharges, drains from
springs and swampy areas, manhole covers, cross connections from storm sewers
and combined sewers, catch basins, storm waters, surface runoff, street wash
waters or drainage. Inflow does not include, and is distinguished from,
infiltration.
   INDUSTRIAL COST RECOVERY (ICR)—recovery by the Township from the industrial
users of the treatment works of the grant amount allocable to the treatment of
wastes from such users pursuant to § 204 (b) of P.L. 92-500 as amended and
subsequent regulations.
   INDUSTRIAL COST RECOVERY PERIOD—that period during which the Federal grant
amount allocable to the treatment of wastes from industrial users shall be
recovered from industrial users of the Township sewer system, a period of 30
years from the first day that each such grant assisted treatment works shall
become operational (or, the useful like of the treatment works in the event
that such useful life is less than 30 years).
   INDUSTRIAL USER (This definition is contingent on EPA's eventual
finalization of ICR regulations pursuant to the 1977 Amendments to P.L. 92-
500.) As of September 27, 1978, the definition is as follows:
      (1) Any nongovernmental nonresidential user of treatment works owned by
the Township discharges more than the equivalent of 25,000 gallons per day
(gpd) of sanitary wastes and which is identified in the Standard Industrial
Classification MailLial, 1972, United States Office of Management and Budget,
as amended and supplemented under one of the following divisions:
         (a) Division A: Agricultural Forestry and Fishing.
         (b) Division B: Mining
         (c) Division D: Manufacturing.
         (d) Division E: Transportation, Communications, Electric, Gas and
Sanitary Services.
         (e) Division 1: Services. (For the purposes of industrial cost
recovery this definition of industrial user applied regardless of how a user is
classified for other purposes: e.g., commercial or public.)
      (2) Any nongovernmental user of treatment works owned by the Township
which discharges wastewater to the treatment works which contains toxic
pollutants or poisonous solids, liquids or gases in sufficient quantity, either
singly or by interaction with other wastes, to contaminate the sludge of any
municipal system, or to injure or to interfere with any sewage treatment
process, or which constitutes a hazard to humans or animals, creates a public
nuisance or creates any hazard in or has an adverse effect on the waters
receiving any discharge from the treatment works.
   PROCESS WASTEWATER—liquid wastes from industrial processes, such as cooling
water or water which has come in contact with an end-product or with materials
incorporated in an end product; distinct from domestic or sanitary wastes.
   SANITARY WASTES—of substantially such origin and strength as those typically
produced in households, including wastes from sanitary conveniences. Also
called domestic wastes and sometimes primarily separated domestic wastes.
   SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE—for the purposes of ICR, any change in strength, volume
or delivery flow rate which the Township Manager considers to be substantial.
Changes in characteristics which cause a 10% change in the annual ICR charge
may be presumed to be substantial.
   UPGRADING—an increase in the degree of treatment. (Ord. 339, 7/3/1996, § 4)
§ 18-624. Application.
   1.   Industrial cost recovery applies to all process wastewater introduced
by industrial users to the Township sewerage system.
   2.   lb the extent that an industrial user introduces sanitary or domestic
wastes to the Township sewerage system, such user shall be excluded from the
operation of this ICRS.
   3.   Throughout the implementation and operation of this ICRS, the Township
must determine which users are classified as industrial users for the purposes
of ICR. This determination shall be based on actual knowledge of the type of
industry, the wastewater volumes and characteristics and reasonable presumption
of no discharges identified in §
18-623.
   4.   For the purposes of determining which of the users discharge more than
25,000 gpd of equivalent sanitary wastes, the Township shall exclude domestic
wastes or discharges from sanitary conveniences. The exclusion shall be
computed in the same manner as the exclusion incorporated in the ICR charge
formula set forth in §
18-627 of this Section. After applying the sanitary waste exclusion, discharges
in the above divisions listed in §
18-623 (or that have a volume exceeding 25,000 gpd or the weight of biochemical
oxygen demand (BOD) or suspended solids (SS) equivalent to that weight found in
25,000 gpd of sanitary waste are considered industrial users. Sanitary wastes,
for purposes of this calculation of equivalency, are the wastes discharged by
"normal" users as defined in §
18-625 (3).
   5.   For the purposes of this ICRS, the following users are defined as
discharging primarily segregated domestic wastes and are excluded from the
operation of this ICRS:
      A.   Veterinary services (SIC: 0741, 0742).
      B.   Coin-operated Laundromats (SIC: 7215).
      C.   Beauty and/or barber shops (SIC: 723, 724).
      D.   Hospitals and other health care centers or clinics, and offices
associated with health services (SIC: 80, excluding 8071, 8072.)
      E.   Museums, botanical and zoological gardens (SIC: 84).
      F.   Office buildings. (Ord. 339, 7/3/1996, § 4)
§ 18-625. Industrial User Classification and Monitoring.
   1.   All industrial users subject to the operation of this ICRS shall be
classified as "exceptional" or "normal." An "exceptional" user is one who
discharges waste stronger than any of the following:
      A.   Three hundred milligrams per liter of 5 day biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD5).
      B.   Three hundred sixty milligrams per liter of suspended solids (SS).
      C.   Eighty-five milligrams per liter of total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN).
   2.   All industrial users who are classified as "exceptional" also are
subject to §
18-604(5) of the codified ordinances of the Township of Hanover, which provides
for a surcharge for pollutant concentrations in excess of these limits. The
monitoring under this ICR system and the sampling for waste surcharge shall be
the same. For reference only, the following provision, which is set forth in §
18604(5), is repeated here:
      "In order to ascertain the strength of every industrial waste requiring a
surcharge, the Township shall cause appropriate sampling and analyses to be
made 4 times each year. Said appropriate sampling shall consist of seven 24
hour composite samples taken every day for 7 consecutive days. Results of each
analysis shall be used to establish the surcharge for particular quarter during
which the particular sample is taken and quarterly billings shall be made by
the Township."
      The ICR charge shall be computed based on the concentrations found in
this sampling program.
   3.   All other industrial users, may be monitored on a random basis, as the
Township deems appropriate or at the user's request. The wastewater
characteristics for "normal" users shall be assumed to be 150 milligrams per
liter of 5 day biochemical oxygen demand, 150 milligrams per liter of suspended
solids, and 30 milligrams per liter of total Kjeldahl nitrogen, unless the
Township determines, based on actual monitoring, the specific concentrations of
pollutants for a particular "normal" user.
(Ord. 339, 7/3/1996, § 4)
§ 18-626. Computation of Industrial Cost Recovery Payments.
   1.   During the ICR 30 year recovery period, each industrial user shall pay
for its share of the total amount of Federal grant funds, including amendments
to grants, which are allocable to capacity used or reserved for use in the
treatment of its process wastewater. The payment for each industrial user shall
be computed in accordance with the formula set forth in §
18-626 of this Part. The average daily poundage of BOD5, suspended solids and
total Kjeldahl nitrogen, to be used in said formula, will be based on either
the concentrations of pollutants found during actual monitoring or the assumed
concentrations for "normal" users. Section 627 sets forth user classification
and monitoring.
   2.   For any industrial user which discharges into the Township system of
wastewater treatment works subject to this ICRS, the ICR charges for such user
shall accrue from the date of the user is initial discharge into the Township
system or the effective date of this ICRS, whichever occurs later, and shall
continue to accrue for the unexpired portion of the ICR period or until the
user ceases to use the Township system, whichever occurs first.
   3.   If there is a substantial change in the strength, volume or delivery
flow rate of wastewater introduced into the treatment works by an industrial
user, such user's share shall be adjusted accordingly, when the Township has
made such a determination. If any industrial user knows or has reason to
believe that a substantial change has occurred in its waste characteristics, it
shall report such knowledge to the Township department responsible for
assessing ICR charges.
   4.   If there is an expansion or upgrading of the treatment works, each
existing industrial user's share shall be adjusted accordingly.
   5.   An industrial user's share shall not include any portion of the grant
money allocable to capacity not used or not reserved by such user.
   6.   An industrial user's share shall not include an interest component.
(Ord. 339, 7/3/1996, § 4)
§ 18-627. Industrial Cost Recovery Charge Formula.
   1.   Each industrial user's share of the applicable Federal grant amount is
based on that proportion of the design capacity represented by such user's
discharge. The annual ICR charge shall be computed by the following formula.
For charges applicable to periods of less than 1 year, all references to
"annual" or "year" shall be understood to mean the appropriate period of time:
      ICRC = K(Q-QD) x cq + (BOD5-BOD5D) x cBOD5 + (SS-SSD) x css + (N-ND) x cn
where,
      ICRC =    Cost to be recovered from an industrial user per year.
      K=   1.0 or less depending on conditions defined in subsection (4).
      Q=   Gallons of wastewater flow contributed by the user during the year,
if K = 1.0, gallons of metered water consumption if K is less than 1.0.
      QD =   Gallons of wastewater flow that is certified as domestic waste
contributed by the user during the year.
      cq =   The charge for Federal grant costs allocable to hydraulic capacity
in dollars per thousand gallons.
      BOD5   The pounds of 5 day biochemical oxygen demand contributed by a
user during the year.
      BOD5D = The pounds of 5 day biochemical oxygen demand contributed by the
domestic waste component of a user's wastestream during the year.
      cBOD5 =   The charge for Federal grant costs allocable to BOD5 removal in
dollars per pound.
      SS =   The pounds of suspended solids contributed by a user during the
year.
      SSD = The pounds of suspended solids contributed by the domestic waste
component of a user's waste stream during the year.
      css =   The charge for Federal grant costs allocable to suspended solids
removal in dollars per pound.
      N =   The pounds of total Kjeldahl nitrogen contributed by a user during
the year.
      ND = The pounds of total Kjeldahl nitrogen contributed by the domestic
waste component of a user's waste stream during the year.
      cn =   The charge for Federal grant costs allocable to nitrification in
dollars per pound of total Kjeldahl nitrogen.
   2.   The applicable charges are:
      cq =   $0.00805 per thousand gallons.
      cBOD5 =   $0.00407 per pound.
      css =   $0.00356 per pound.
      cn =   $0.03590 per pound.
   3.   The average daily wastewater flow and pollutant poundage due to the
domestic wastes shall be computed for each industrial user by multiplying the
average number 40 hour per week employees times 35 gallons per day per employ
and assuming the following concentrations:
      BOD:   150 mg/l.
      SS:   150 mg/l.
      TEN:   30 mg/l.
   4.   If wastewater discharge is actually measured by means of a sewage meter
or other device acceptable to the Township, then K = 1.0 and Q is the measured
wastewater flow. If wastewater is not directly measured, then K shall be 0.95
and Q is the metered water consumption, except that the Township may agree with
a particular industrial user that K will be some other percentage, based on
reasonable estimation of waste discharged to other systems than the Township
sewerage system.
(Ord. 339, 7/3/1996, § 4)
§ 18-628. Administration.
The Township Manager is hereby charged with the administration and enforcement
of the provisions of this Section. He is empowered to prescribe, adopt,
promulgate and enforce rules and regulations relating to any matter pertaining
to the administration and enforcement of this Section, and to prescribe forms
necessary for the administration of this Section. The Township Manager may
delegate duties provided herein to other Township personnel or personnel of the
City of Allentown.
(Ord. 339, 7/3/1996, § 4)
§ 18-629. Industrial Cost Recovering Billing.
   1.   The payment of ICR charges shall be deemed a condition of discharge to
the Township sanitary sewer system. Industrial waste discharge permits issued
by the Township pursuant to §
18-628 of the Codified Ordinances of the Township of Hanover, are hereby
subjected to ICR. The continuation of existing and the issuance of new permits
shall require the agreement by each industrial user to pay his share of ICR, as
set forth in this Section.
   2.   Except as provided in Subsection (4) below, the first ICR bills shall
be issued to industrial users no later than 10 months from the effective date
of this ICRS. Thereafter, all industrial users shall be billed on their normal
wastewater user charge billing dates, or otherwise, but at least annually, as
determined b the Township Manager.
   3.   Except as provided in subsection (4) below failure to pay ICR bills
within 30 days of billing shall be subject to the same penalty procedures as
apply to the sewer rate charges, as set forth in §
18-605(5) of the Codified Ordinances of the Township of Hanover. Furthermore,
the Township may employ those lien procedures as are available for the
collection of municipal claims. In addition, the Township may institute any
action at law or equity or employ any other legal remedy available to it for
the collection of the ICR charges.
   4.   Industrial users shall not be required to pay ICR charges incurred for
any period during which a Federal moratorium pertaining to the industrial cost
recovery system exists pursuant to Federal law. ICR charges accrued during this
period or periods shall be payable by the industrial users in a lump sum at
such time as the Federal moratorium is lifted.
(Ord. 339, 7/3/1996, § 4)
§ 18-630. Appeals.
   1.   An industrial user or other aggrieved party may appeal to the Hearing
Officer, who may be an employee of the Township or the City of Allentown, on

pay the incremental costs of administration of the industrial cost recovery
system. The incremental costs of administration are those costs remaining after
deducting all costs reasonably attributable to the administration of the user
charge system. The incremental costs shall be segregated from all other
administrative costs of the Township.
      B.   A minimum of 80% of the amounts the Township retains after paying
the incremental costs of administration, together with any interest earned
shall be placed in an industrial cost recovery account entitled "expansion and
upgrading account." Funds in this expansion and upgrading account shall be
expended only for replacement or expansion of grant assisted treatment works
and shall not be spent without prior written approval of the Environmental
Protection Agency's Regional Administrator.
      C.   The remainder of the amounts retained by the Township are
discretionary and shall be used in the sewer fund for such uses as the Township
shall deem proper, except it shall not be used for the construction of
industrial pretreatment facilities or rebates to industrial users for costs
incurred by such users in complying with Federal user charge or industrial cost

When the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator determines that a user is
contributing to the POTW any of the above enumerated substances in such amounts
as to cause pass through or interference with the operation of the POTW and/or
POTW treatment plant, the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator shall: (A) Notify
the user of the impact of the contribution on the POTW and/or POTW treatment
plant; (B) Develop effluent limitation(s), as needed, for the user to correct
the pass through or interference with the POTW and/or POTW treatment plant; and
(C) Proceed with enforcement pursuant to the provisions of §
18-715 of this Part 7(B).
Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this Section shall not be
processed or stored in such a manner that they have a reasonable potential to
be discharged to the POTW or collection system.
   2.   National Pretreatment Standards and National Categorical Standards. All
industrial users are subject to the National Pretreatment Standards. The
National Categorical Standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts
405-471 are hereby incorporated into this Part 7(B) by reference as though set
forth in full. Industrial users must comply with all applicable categorical
standards and other requirements promulgated by EPA. Any categorical standard,
if more stringent than the limitations imposed under this Part 7(B), shall
immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this Part 7(B).
      A.   Where a categorical standard is expressed only in terms of either
the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the Industrial
Pretreat ment Coordinator may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c).
      B.   When wastewater subject to a categorical standard is mixed with
waste water not regulated by the same standard, the Industrial Pretreatment
Coordinator shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream
formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
      C.   An industrial user may obtain a variance from a categorical standard
from EPA if the industrial user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and
substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge
are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing
the categorical standard. If a variance is obtained, the City or Township
reserves the right to modify the industrial user’s permit to incorporate the
revised standards and requirements.
      D.   An industrial user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a
categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.
   3.   Modification of National Categorical Standards. Where the City’s POTW
treatment plant achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by National
Categorical Standards, the City may apply to the approval authority for
modification of specific limits in the National Categorical Standards.
“Consistent removal” is defined by EPA in 40 CFR 403.7(b). The City may then
modify pollutant discharge limits in the National Categorical Standards if the
require ments contained in 40 CFR, Part 403, § 403.7, are fulfilled and prior
approval from the approval authority is obtained.
   4.   Specific Pollutant Discharge Limitations - Local Limits. In accordance
with 40 CFR 403.5(c), the City and Township imposes the following specific
pollutant discharge limitations for all industrial users:
Pollutant (Total) Local Limit (mg/l)
Arsenic           0.11
Cadmium           0.05
Chromium          0.91
Copper            1.35
Lead              0.39
Mercury           0.007
Molybdenum        0.22
Nickel            1.36
Selenium          0.23
Silver            0.21
Zinc              2.58
Cyanide           0.38
 
      The specific pollutant discharge limitations listed above are the highest
allowable concentration in any type of sample, either a grab or composite,
collected over any time interval, unless otherwise specified in an IWDP.
      The specific pollutant discharge limitations listed above apply at the
point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW or at the point designated
by the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator.
      In addition to industrial users, the City and Township reserve the right
to apply the specific pollutant discharge limitations listed above to any
user’s wastewater discharge which is not composed of strictly domestic sewage.
      The City reserves the right to establish alternate specific pollutant
discharge limitations in individual industrial waste discharge permits, but
only in accordance with regulatory requirements. In no event shall any
alternate limit allow the total loading allocated to all industrial users for
any pollutant to exceed the maximum allowable industrial headworks loading as
determined in the City’s most recent local limits evaluation approved by the
approval authority. The specific pollutant discharge limitations, if more
stringent than the National Categorical Standards, shall immediately supersede
the National Categorical Standards.
   5.   State Requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges
shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than Federal requirements
and limitations or those in this Part 7(B).
   6.   City and Township’s Right of Revision. The City and Township reserve
the right to establish by ordinance more stringent limitations or requirements
on discharges to the POTW if deemed necessary.
   7.   Excessive Discharge. No user shall increase the use of process water
solely for the purpose of complying with this Part 7(B) or in any way attempt
to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the National
Categorical Standards, or in any other pollutant-specific limitation developed
by the Township, City or State. The Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator may
impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable
National Categorical Standards, or in any other pollutant-specific limitations
or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is
appropriate.
   8.   Accidental Discharges/Slug Loads. Each industrial user shall provide
protection from accidental discharges/slug loads of prohibited materials or
other substances regulated by this Part 7(B). Where facilities are provided to
prevent accidental discharges/slug loads of prohibited materials, these
facilities shall be provided and maintained at the industrial user’s own cost
and expense. In the case of an accidental discharge/slug loads, it shall be the
responsibility of the industrial user, upon discovery, and after assessing the
situation and taking initial corrective action, to immediately telephone and
notify the Industrial Pretreat ment Coordinator of the incident. The
notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, estimated
concentration and volume if known, and initial corrective actions taken by the
industrial user.
      A.   Written Notice. Within 5 days following a accidental discharge/slug
loads; the industrial user shall submit to the Industrial Pretreatment
Coordinator a detailed written report including the date, time, duration of the
discharge as well as describing the cause of the discharge, all corrective
measures implemented or attempted, and measures to be taken by the industrial
user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve
the industrial user of any expenses, loss, damage, or other liability which may
be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage
to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the industrial user
of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this
Part 7(B) or other applicable articles or laws.
      B.   Notice to Employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the
industrial user’s bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees
whom to call in the event of an accidental discharge/slug load. Employers shall
insure that all employees are advised of the emergency notification procedures.
   9.   Accidental Discharge/Slug Control Plans. An Accidental Discharge or
Slug Control Plan, as prescribed under 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(v), shall be
required:
      A.   For New Source Industrial Users. Detailed plans showing facilities
and operating procedures to provide protection from accidental discharges or
slugs shall be submitted to the City and Township for review as part of the
IWDP application, and shall be approved by the City and Township before
construction of the facility.
      B.   For Existing Industrial Users. The Industrial Pretreatment
Coordinator shall evaluate whether each industrial user needs a new or updated
accidental discharge/slug control plan.
   10.   Should the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator require the industrial
user to develop, submit for approval, and implement a new or updated accidental
discharge/slug control plan, the accidental discharge/slug control plan shall
address, at a minimum, the following:
      A.   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges.
      B.   Description of stored chemicals.
      C.   Procedures for immediately notifying the Industrial Pretreatment
Coordinator of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by §
18-712(8) of this Part 7(B).
      D.   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures shall include, but are not limited to, inspection
and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading
and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training,
building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic
organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for
emergency response.
When an existing industrial user is required by the Industrial Pretreatment
Coordinator to provide and/or modify an accidental discharge/slug control plan,
the industrial user shall provide the plan within 60 days of notification.
Should the plan require construction or implementation of measures to meet
compliance, the plan shall provide a schedule for those actions. After initial
review, should additional information be required to provide a complete plan,
it shall be furnished to the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator within 30 days
of the date of notification. Failure to submit a revised plan and/or failure to
provide a complete plan after the 30-day submission period may render the
industrial waste discharge permit void.
The City and Township’s review and approval of accidental discharge/slug
control plans shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to
modify the industrial user’s facility as necessary to meet the requirements of
this Part 7(B).
If not specifically required by the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator, the
information, requirements, etc., called for in a plan are not waived by the
City and Township and the industrial user shall provide all necessary items,
procedures, etc., to prevent any accidental discharge and/or slug discharge to
the POTW.
An approved State pollution prevention plan may substitute for all or a portion
of the contents of an accidental discharge/slug control plan to the extent that
it satisfies the requirements described herein.
All users are required to notify the POTW immediately of any changes at its
facility affecting potential for a slug discharge.
(Ord. 495, 6/17/2009)
§ 18-713.   Fees.
It is the purpose of this Section to provide for the recovery of costs from
users of the City’s POTW and Township’s collection system for the
implementation of the industrial pretreatment program established herein. The
applicable charges or fees are set forth below:
      A.   Service Charges and Fees. The charges and fees include:
      (1)   Fees for monitoring, inspections and surveillance procedures
completed by the City or the City’s contract laboratory to be billed at 1.15
times the actual cost.
      (2)   Fees for IWD Permit applications - $250.
      (3)   Fees for filing appeals - $200.
      B.   Program Fee. The City reserves the right to develop and institute a
program fee to recover operating costs associated with implementation of the
industrial pretreatment program which are separate from or in lieu of those
costs identified in §
18-713(A) or (C) of this Part 7(B). The Program Fee will be chargeable to all
users included in the industrial pretreatment program and will be billed and
updated at a frequency determined by the City.
The above fees relate solely to the matters covered by this Part 7(B) and are
separate from all other fees chargeable by the Township
      C.   Industrial Waste Surcharge. When approval is granted by the City and
Township to a user to discharge industrial waste into the POTW and collection
system, the user’s sewer rental will be based on the prevailing rate for normal
domestic sewage plus a quarterly surcharge based on the relative strength of
said industrial waste contribution and calculated as follows:
Surcharge = 0.00834 x Flow x {'{'}((BOD5 - 300) x BOD5 Cost) + (TSS - 350) x
TSS Cost) + (NI-13-N - 50) x NH3-N Cost){'}'}
Where:
Surcharge = Surcharge calculated quarterly;
   0.00834 = constant to convert industrial waste strength from mg/l to
thousand pounds;
Flow = total quarterly discharge flow of the industrial waste in million
gallons;
   BOD5 = biochemical oxygen demand (5-day) of the industrial waste in mg/l;
   300 = value expressing the BOD5 of normal domestic sewage in mg/l;
   BOD5 Cost = annual City treatment cost per thousand pounds of BOD5;
   TSS = total suspended solids of the industrial waste in mg/l;
   350 = value expressing the TSS of normal domestic sewage in mg/l;
   TSS Cost = annual City treatment cost per thousand pounds of TSS;
   NH3-N = ammonia-nitrogen of the industrial waste in mg/l;
   50 = value expressing the NH3-N of normal domestic sewage in mg/l;
   NH3-N Cost = annual City treatment cost per thousand pounds of NH3-N;
The City reserves the right to substitute the following formula for the
surcharge in the event that BOD5 is not the normal measure of the strength of
the industrial waste:
Surcharge = 0.00834 x Flow x {'{'}((COD - 600) x COD Cost) + ((TSS - 350) x TSS
Cost) + ((NH3-N - 50) x NH3-N Cost){'}'}
Where:
Surcharge = Surcharge calculated quarterly;
   0.00834 = constant to convert industrial waste strength from mg/l to
thousand pounds;
Flow = total quarterly discharge flow of the industrial waste in million
gallons;
   COD = chemical oxygen demand of the industrial waste in mg/l;
   600 = value expressing the COD of normal domestic sewage in mg/l;
   COD Cost = annual City treatment cost per thousand pounds of COD;
   TSS = total suspended solids of the industrial waste in mg/l;
   350 = value expressing the TSS of normal domestic sewage in mg/l;
   TSS Cost = annual City treatment cost per thousand pounds of TSS;
   NH3-N = ammonia-nitrogen of the industrial waste in mg/l;
   50 = value expressing the NH3-N of normal domestic sewage in mg/l;
   NH3-N Cost = annual City treatment cost per thousand pounds of NH3-N;
When actual industrial waste values of BOD5 and/or COD and/or TSS and/or NH3-
N are less than the normal domestic sewage values, then the normal domestic
sewage values of 300, 600, 350 and/or 50 mg/l, respec tively, shall be used in
the calculation of the Surcharge in place of the actual industrial waste
values.
The annual City treatment costs per thousand pounds of BOD5, COD, TSS and NH3-
N shall be determined at the beginning of each calendar year, based upon the
City Sewer Fund’s actual operating costs from the previous year.
In no instance shall the sewer rental for industrial waste be less than the
prevailing rate for normal domestic sewage.
In order to ascertain the strength of an industrial waste requiring a
Surcharge, the City shall cause appropriate analysis (BOD5, COD, TSS and NH3-N)
to be made quarterly, the average of which shall be used to establish the
Surcharge for the ensuing quarter. A more extensive analysis may be required
under §
18-714 of this Part 7(B). All sampling and analysis shall be completed in
accordance with the provisions of this Part 7(B). All expenses for these
analyses shall be borne by the user.
The City reserves the right to recalculate and adjust the surcharge of any user
at any time during the year due to the introduction of new wastewater
constituents or any substantial increase in the strength of the wastewater. A
substantial increase shall mean 15% or greater.
(Ord. 495, 6/17/2009)
§ 18-714.   Permits.
   1.   It shall be unlawful for any significant and/or categorical industrial
user to discharge to the POTW tributary to the City’s POTW Treatment Plant
without having first obtained a City industrial waste discharge permit (IWDP),
except as authorized by the Director of Water & Sewer Resources in accordance
with the provisions of this Part 7(B), subject to State and Federal laws and
regulations.
In addition to the IWDP, the industrial user shall obtain such additional
permits as required by applicable Sections of this Chapter and other applicable
Township ordinances.
   2.   When requested by the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator, any user
must submit information on the nature and characteristics of its wastewater
within 30 days of the request unless additional time is approved, in writing,
by the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator. The Industrial Pretreatment
Coordinator is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may
periodically require users to update this information.
   3.   Industrial Waste Discharge Permits. All significant and/or categorical
industrial users proposing to connect to or to contribute to the POTW or
collection system shall obtain an IWDP before connecting to or contributing to
the POTW.
The Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator may require other users to obtain an
IWDP as necessary to carry out the purposes of this Part 7(B).
Any violation of the terms and conditions of an IWDP shall be deemed a
violation of this Part 7(B) and shall subject the user to the enforcement under
§
18-715. Obtaining an IWDP does not relieve a user of its obligation to comply
with all Federal and State pretreatment standards or requirements or with any
other requirements of Federal, State, and local law.
   4.   Permit Application. Users required to obtain an IWDP shall complete and
file with the City an application in the form prescribed by the Industrial
Pretreat ment Coordinator, and accompanied by a fee as listed in §
18-713(A) of this Part 7(B). Existing users shall file a completed application
in accordance with §
18-714(22). Proposed new users shall file a completed application at least 90
days prior to connecting to or contributing to the POTW or within 60 days of
receipt of the application from the City, whichever is sooner. In support of
the application, the user shall submit, in units and terms appropriate for
evaluation, the following information:
      A.   Name, address, and location (if different from the address).
      B.   SIC number according to the Standard Industrial Classification

composite collection techniques. In the event that flow proportional sampling
is infeasible or not warranted in the opinion of the Industrial Pretreatment
Coordinator, the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator may authorize the use of
time proportional sampling, a minimum of four grab samples where the user
demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent
being discharged or a frequency of grab samples acceptable to the Industrial
Pretreatment Coordinator. The Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator may allow
grab samples to be composited prior to analysis.
      B.   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using standard grab
collection techniques.
      C.   Sampling techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, as amended, shall

tech niques, all samples collected inappropriately shall be discarded and
recollected at the sole expense of the user.
      F.   Sampling facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and
maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep
its sampling location or facility in good working order shall not be grounds
for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its
discharge.
      G.   All sampling locations utilized to meet the discharge monitoring
provisions of this Part 7(B) shall be approved by the Industrial Pretreatment
Coordinator.
   15.   Analytical Requirements. Wastewater pollutant analyses completed to
comply with any provision of this Part 7(B) shall meet the following
requirements:
      A.   All pollutant analyses shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an

expense of the user.
   16.   Flow Measurement. All wastewater flow monitoring data obtained to
comply with any provision of this Part 7(B) shall meet the following
requirements:
      A.   All new, required flow measuring devices shall be approved by the
Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator prior to installation. The flow measuring
device(s) shall be properly designed, compatible with the process involved and
accurate. The flow measuring device(s) shall be calibrated at least semi-
annually.
      B.   If a discrepancy in reported flow data is identified, the Industrial
Pretreat ment Coordinator may require that existing flow measuring devices be
serviced by a certified technician or replaced at the sole expense of the user.
      C.   Flow monitoring facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean,
and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to
keep its flow monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds
for the user to claim that the measurements are unrepresentative of its volume
of flow to the POTW.
      D.   If a user does not properly calibrate or maintain its flow
monitoring equipment or if flow measurements are deemed inaccurate by the
Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator, the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator
shall utilize the user’s metered water usage records to determine the volume of
wastewater flow to the POTW. In this case, all claims of product uptake,
evaporation or other water losses shall be precluded.
      E.   If a user does not have a flow measurement device, the Industrial
Pretreatment Coordinator may:
         (1)   Require installation of flow monitoring facilities in accordance
with the provisions of this Part 7(B).
         (2)   Rely on the user’s metered water usage records to determine the
volume of wastewater flow to the POTW. In this case, metered water losses may
be considered by the Industrial Pretreatment Coordina tor. Unmetered claims of
product uptake, evaporation or other losses shall be precluded unless
appropriated documentation can be provided by the user.
   17.   Monitoring Facilities. The City or Township shall require to be
provided and operated at the user’s own expense, sampling manholes or any other
device or facility suitable and appropriate to enable inspection, sampling, and
flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. Such
manhole device or facility should normally be situated on the user’s premises
in the user’s possession; but, the City or Township may, when a location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be
constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will
not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow
accurate sampling and preparation of sample for analysis. The facility,
sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
   18.   Inspection and Sampling. The City or Township shall inspect, at a
minimum annually, the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose
of this Part 7(B) is being met and all requirements are being complied with.
Persons or occupants of premises connected to the sewage collection system
shall allow the City or Township or its representative ready access at all
reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purpose of inspection,
sampling, or in the perfor mance of any duties. The user’s records of
monitoring activities and results shall be available for inspection and
copying. The City or Township shall have the right to set up on the user’s
property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspection,
compliance monitoring and/or metering operations without notifica tion to the
user.
Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper
identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon
presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the City or Township
will be permitted to enter and to perform their specific responsibilities
within 10 minutes of their initial time of arrival. Delaying City or Township
personnel for more than 10 minutes for any reason or to complete process
changes or to alter wastewater constituency prior to sample collection shall be
a violation of this Part 7(B) and shall subject the user to the sanctions set
forth in this Part 7(B).
Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility
to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the
written request of the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator and shall not be
replaced without approval of the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator. The costs
of clearing such access shall be born by the user.
   19.   If the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator has been refused any
records or access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof,
or if the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator believes that there is a need to
inspect and/or sample as part of a routine or specific inspection and sampling
program of the City or Township, designed to verify compliance with this Part 7
(B) or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety and welfare of the community, then the Director of Water and
Sewer Resources may seek issuance of a search warrant from the appropriate
judicial authority.
   20.   Pretreatment. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to
comply with this Part 7(B) and shall achieve compliance with all applicable
pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in §
18-712 of this Part 7(B) within the time limitations specified by the agency
issuing the standards. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be
provided, operated, and maintained at the user’s expense. Detailed plans
describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the
Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator for review, and shall be acceptable to the
Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator before such facilities are constructed. The
City or Township’s review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no
way relieve the user from the responsibility of additional or future
modifications of such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable
to the City or Township under the provisions of this Part 7(B).
Whenever deemed necessary, the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator may require
users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that
certain wastewater be discharged only at specific points of the POTW, relocate
and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate domestic sewage waste streams
from industrial waste streams, and/or such other conditions as may be necessary
to protect the POTW and determine the user’s compliance with the requirements
of this Part 7(B).
The Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator may require any person discharging into
the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a
suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A
IWDP may be issued solely for flow equalization.
Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when they are necessary
for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease
and oil, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for
residential sources. All interception units shall be of type and capacity
approved by the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator and shall be so located to
be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be
inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at their
expense.
   21.   Publication of Users in Significant Noncompliance. The City shall
annually publish, in a newspaper of general circulation that provides
meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by the POTW, all users
which at any time during the previous 12 months were in significant
noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. For the
purpose of this provision, a user is in significant noncompliance if its
violation meets one or more of the following criteria:
      A.   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as

in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may
present an imminent and substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons, to the environment, causes interference to the POTW or collection
system or causes the City to violate any condition of its NPDES Permit. In the
event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension
order, the City or Township shall take steps as deemed necessary including
immediate termination of water service and/or immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to
any individuals. The service and/or IWDP shall be restored within 5 working
days after, in the opinion of the City or Township, whichever suspends service,
the actual or threatened cause for the suspension has been removed. The above
actions shall be taken only as ordered by the Director of Water and Sewer
Resources.
   2.   Notice of Suspension. In the event that the City or Township decides it
is necessary to suspend its wastewater treatment service for reasons other than
as described above, the user shall be given a 15-day notice of such suspension.

IWDP shall stop or eliminate the contribution as required in the suspension
notice. Between the time of the notice of suspension of services and the date
services are terminated, the user shall have the right to have a show cause
hearing with the Hearing Board regarding the cause of the suspension.
The City or Township, whichever suspended service, shall reinstate the IWDP
and/or wastewater treatment service within 5 working days upon proof of the
elimination of the noncomplying discharge or in compliance with instruction of
the Hearing Board. A detailed written statement submitted by the user
describing the cause of the harmful contributions and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the City or Township,
whichever suspended service, within 5 days of the date of occurrence. In the
event of a failure of the user to comply with the suspension notice, the City
or Township may take such steps as deemed necessary to terminate the service.
   3.   Revocation of Permit. Any user who violates the conditions of this Part
7(B), or applicable State and Federal regulations, is subject to having the
user’s permit revoked as described in §

in the sole discretion of the Mayor of the City of Bethlehem.
   6.   Show Cause Hearing.
      A.   The City or Township may order any user who causes or allows an
unauthorized discharge to enter the POTW to show cause before the Hearing Board
why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be
served on the user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the
Hearing Board regarding the violation, the reasons why the action is to be
taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the user to show cause
before the Hearing Board why the proposed enforcement action should not be

order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a
specified time period, the sewer service be discontinued unless adequate
treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances shall have been
installed on existing treatment facilities, devices or other related
appurtenances are properly operated. Further and/or other orders and directives
as are necessary and appropriate may be issued.
   7.   Consent Orders. The City may enter into consent orders, assurances of
voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with
any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific
action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time
period specified by the document.
   8.   Compliance Orders. When the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator finds
that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Part 7
(B), an IWDP or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the City may issue an order to the user responsible for the
discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time.
If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, wastewater
service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or
other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance
orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance,
including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to
minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the POTW. A compliance schedule
contained in any compliance order shall not be construed as an extension of the
deadline for compliance established for any pretreatment standard or
requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any
violation, including any continuing violation.
   9.   Cease and Desist Orders. When the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator
finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
Part 7(B), an IWDP or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, or that the user’s past violations are likely to
recur, the City may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist
all such violations and directing the user to:
      A.   Immediately comply with all requirements.
      B.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations, terminating the discharge or hauling noncompliant discharges off-
site for proper disposal.
   10.   Administrative Fines.
      A.   When the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Part 7(B), an IWDP or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
City may fine such user in an amount not to exceed the amount set forth in the
§
18-716 of this Part 7(B) for each violation regardless of jurisdictional
boundaries. Such fines shall be assessed in accordance with the terms set forth
in this Part 7(B) and/or the City’s Enforcement Response Plan. In the case of
weekly, monthly or other long- term average discharge limits, fines shall be
assessed for each day during the period of violation.
      B.   A lien against the user’s property will be sought and other
enforcement collection action may be taken for unpaid fines.
      C.   Users desiring to dispute such fines shall file a written request
for the City to reconsider the fine along with the full payment of the fine
amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine. The Hearing Board may
convene to deliberate on the matter. In the event the appeal is successful, the
payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the
user. The City may add the costs of preparing administrative enforce ment
actions, such as notices and orders to the fine when the fine and/or a portion
of same, is substantiated.
      D.   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequi site for, taking any other action against the user.
   11.   Legal Action. The City or Township shall be able to seek injunctive
relief for noncompliance by users with pretreatment standards or requirements.
Injunctive relief is available for violations of any requirement stated in this
Part 7(B) or industrial waste discharge permits, including, but not limited to,
wastewater discharge violations, failure to allow access by the City or
Township to a user’s facility, failure to submit reports by a specified
deadline or any violation of any order of the City or Township. The City or
Township Solicitors may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or
equitable relief in the local Court of Common Pleas.
   12.   Remedies Nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this Part 7(B) are
not exclusive. The City or Township may take any, all, or any combination of
these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of industrial
pretreatment program violations will be in accordance with this Part 7(B) and/
or the City’s Enforcement Response Plan. However, the City or Township may take
other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the City
or Township is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any
noncompliant user. Where the Enforcement Response Plan does not provide
guidelines on enforcement action for a specific instance of noncompliance, the
City or Township may impose other appropriate enforcement action to address the
noncompliance.
   13.   Appeals. A user, may appeal the terms of an IWDP, administrative fine
or any administrative action within 30 days of notice of its issuance. The
written appeal request shall provide the name, address and telephone number of
the appellant as well the date that the City or Township took the action which
is the subject matter of the appeal. In its petition, the appealing party shall
also indicate the provisions objected to, the reasons for this objection, and
the alternative condition, if any.
      A.   Failure to submit a timely appeal for review shall be deemed to be a
waiver of the administrative appeal.
      B.   The conditions of the current IWDP shall remain in effect pending
the appeal of the new IWDP.

administrative decision must do so by filing a complaint with the local Court
of Common Pleas, within 30 days of the decision of the Hearing Board.
   14.   Conference Option. At the time an appeal is requested, the user may
also request a conference with the City or Township prior to the scheduling of
a Hearing Board hearing. Said conference will include appropriate members of
the City or Township staff and its agents. Violations and penalties will be
explained and discussed. Electing this option does not foreclose and/or affect
the user’s right to a hearing provided that the written request for the hearing
was filed within 30 days of service as noted above. The purpose of this option
is to provide the user with an informal forum within which to discuss the
alleged violations and expedite conclusion and/or resolution of outstanding
enforcement actions. If resolution is not reached within 90 days of the
scheduled conference, the City or Township shall schedule the matter for
Hearing Board hearing. In any event, either party may request a Hearing Board
hearing at any point during the conference proceedings.
   15.   Township Authority. The enforcement authority of the Township under
this Section shall be limited to matters related to the collection system.

      C.   The production or wastewater generating processes of the building,
structure, facility or installation is substantially independent of an existing
source at the same site. In determining whether these are substantially
independent factors such as the extent to which the new facility is integrated
with the existing plant, and the extent to which the new facility is engaged in
the same general type of activity as is the existing source, should be
considered.
Construction on a site at which an existing source is located results in a
modification rather than a new source if the construction does not create a new
building, structure, facility or installation meeting the criteria of
Subsections (B) or (C), above, but otherwise alters, replaces or adds to the
existing process or production equipment. Construction of a new source as
defined under this subsection has commenced if the owner or operator has:
      A.   Begun or caused to begin as part of a continuous onsite construction
program:
         (1)   Any placement, assembly or installation of facilities or
equipment; or,
         (2)   Significant site preparation work including clearing, excavation
or removal of existing buildings, structures or facilities which are necessary
for the replacement, assembly or installation of new source facilities or
equipment.
      B.   Entered into a binding contractual obligation for purchase of
facilities or equipment which are intended to be used in its operation within a
reasonable time. Options to purchase or contracts which can be terminated or
modified without substantial loss, and contracts for feasibility, engineering
and design studies do not constitute a contractual obligation under this
Subsection.
   PASS THROUGH—a discharge or pollutant which cannot be treated adequately by
POTW, and therefore exits into waters of the United States in quantities or
concentrations which, alone or in conjunction with the discharge or discharges
from other sources, is a cause of a violation of any requirement of the POTW’s
NPDES Permit (including an increase in the magnitude or duration of a
violation).
   PERSON—any individual, firm, company, partnership, corporation, association,
group or society and includes the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and agencies,
districts, commissions and political subdivisions created by or pursuant to
State law, and agencies of the United States Government and their agents.
   pH—the logarithm of the reciprocal of the concentration of hydrogen ions in
grams per liter of solution.
   POLLUTANT—any dredged spoil, solid waste, incinerator residue, sewage,
garbage, sewage sludge, munitions, medical waste, chemical waste, industrial
wastes, biological materials, radioactive material, heat, wrecked or discharged
equipment, rock, sand, cellar dirt, agricultural and industrial wastes, and the
characteristics of the wastewater (i.e., pH, temperature, TSS, turbidity,
color, BOD, chemical oxygen demand (COD), toxicity, odor).
   POLLUTANTS OF CONCERN (POCs)—any pollutant that might be reasonably expected
to be discharged to the treatment plant in sufficient amounts that pass through
or interfere with the plant, contaminates the sludge, causes problems in the
collection system, jeopardizes the worker or is otherwise designated as such by
the Borough. [Ord. 545]
   PRETREATMENT—the reduction of the amount of pollutants, the elimination of
pollutants or the alteration of the nature of pollutant properties in
wastewater prior to or in lieu of introducing such pollutants into the POTW.
This reduction or alteration can be obtained by physical, chemical or
biological processes, by process changes, or by other means, except by diluting
the concentration of the pollutants unless allowed by an applicable
pretreatment standard.
   PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS—any substantive or procedural requirement related
to pretreatment imposed on any industrial user, other than a pretreatment
standard.
   PRETREATMENT STANDARDS—all applicable Federal rules and regulations
implementing section 307 of the Act, as set forth in 40 CFR, Subchapter N,
Parts 401–471, as well as any nonconflicting State or local standards. In case
of conflicting standards or regulations, the more stringent thereof shall be
applied.
   PROACTIVE CONTROL OF POCs—non-domestic users shall identify actual or
potential POCs and bio-toxics, including any POCs and bio-toxics not
specifically identified in this permit, Township or Borough ordinances, to
prevent pass through and interference, personnel and public exposure and
collection system problems. [Ord. 545]
   PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS or PROHIBITED DISCHARGES—absolute
prohibitions against the discharge of certain substances.
   PUBLICLY OWNED TREATMENT WORKS (POTW)—a “treatment works” as defined by §

waste stream which makes up 5 percent or more of the average dry weather
hydraulic or organic capacity of the POTW treatment plant; or is designed as
such by the control authority as defined in 40 CFR § 403.12(a), a reasonable
potential for adversely affecting the POTW’s operation or for violating any
pretreatment standard or requirement (in accordance with 40 CFR § 403.8(f)(6)).
      B.   Upon the finding that an industrial user meeting the criteria in
Subsection (A)(2) of this definition has no reasonable potential for adversely
affecting the POTW’s operation for violating any pretreatment standard or
requirement, the control authority may at any time on its own initiative or in
response to a petition received from an industrial user or POTW and in
accordance with 40 CFR § 403.8(f)(6), determine that such industrial user is
not a significant industrial user.
   SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE—occurs when a significant industrial user (or any
other industrial user whose violation meets Subsections (C), (D), or (H) below)

(Ord. 396, 9/6/2000, § 851; as amended by Ord. 545, 4/17/2013, §§ 3, 4)
§ 18-852.   [Reserved].
(Ord. 396, 9/6/2000, § 852)
§ 18-853.   Prohibitions and Limitation on Wastewater Discharges.
      A.   Prohibitions on Wastewater Discharges. No user shall discharge or
deposit or cause or allow to be discharged or deposited into the wastewater
treatment system any wastewater which contains the following:
      (1)   Oils and Grease.

are prohibited.
      (2)   Fire/Explosive Hazard. Liquids, solids or gases which by reason of
their nature or quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by
interaction with other substances to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in
any other way to the wastewater treatment system or to the operation of the
system. At no time shall two successive readings on an explosion hazard meter,
at the point of discharge into the sewer system, be more than 5% nor any single
reading over 10% of the Lower Explosive Limit (L.E.L.) of the meter. Prohibited
materials include, but are not limited to, gasoline, kerosene, naphtha,
benzene, toluene, zylene, ethers, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides,

60º Celsius using test methods specified in 40 CFR § 261.21.
      (3)   Noxious Material. Noxious or malodorous solids, liquids or gases,
which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are capable of
creating a public nuisance or hazard to life, or are or may be sufficient to
prevent entry into a sewer for its maintenance and repair.
      (4)   Improperly Shredded Garbage. Garbage that has not been ground or
comminuted to such a degree that all particles will be carried freely in
suspension under flow conditions normally prevailing in the public sewers, with
no particle greater than ½ inch in any dimension.
      (5)   Radioactive Wastes. Radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-
life or concentration that they do not comply with regulations or orders issued
by the appropriate Federal and State agencies having control over their use and
which will or may cause damage or hazards to the sewage facilities or personnel
operating system.
      (6)   Solid or Viscous Wastes. Solid or viscous wastes which will or may
cause obstruction to the flow in a sewer, or otherwise interfere with the
proper operation of the wastewater treatment system. Prohibited materials
include, but are not limited to, grease, uncomminuted garbage, animal guts or
tissues, paunch manure, bones, hair, hides or fleshings, entrails, whole blood,
feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, spent lime, stone or marble dust, metal, glass,
straw, shavings, grass clippings, rags, spent grains, spent hops, waste paper,
wood, plastic, tar, asphalt residues, residues from refining or processing of
fuel or lubricating oil, and similar substances.
      (7)   Excessive Discharge Rate. Wastewater at a flow rate or containing
such concentrations or quantities of pollutants that exceed for any time period
longer than 15 minutes more than 5 times the average 24 hour concentration,
quantities or flow during normal operation and that would cause a treatment
process upset and subsequent loss of treatment efficiency; or the introduction
of any pollutant, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (such as BOD), released
in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which would cause
interference with the POTW.
      (8)   Toxic Substances. Any toxic substances in amounts exceeding
standards promulgated by the Administrator of the United States Environmental
Protection Agency pursuant to 307(a) of the Act, and chemical elements or
compounds, phenols or other taste or odor- producing substances, or any other
substances which are not susceptible to treatment or which may interfere with
the biological processes or efficiency of the treatment system, or that will
pass through the system.
      (9)   Unpolluted Waters. Any unpolluted water including, but not limited
to, cooling water or of storm water origin.
      (10)   Colored Discharge. If a non-domestic discharge causes unusual
color in the treatment plant’s influent samples, the wet well or the primary
clarifier inlets, the colored discharge is prohibited and must be ceased. BMP’s
to control color can be required. [Ord. 545]
      (11)   Corrosive Wastes. Any waste which will cause corrosion or
deterioration of the treatment system. All wastes discharged to the public
sewer system must have a pH value in the range of 6 to 9 standard units.
Prohibited materials include, but are not limited to, acids, sulfides,
concentrated chloride and fluoride compounds and substances which will react
with water to form acidic products.
      (12)   Interference. Any waste which would cause interference with the
biological processes or efficiency of the treatment system as defined in this
Part.
      (13)   Pass Through. Any waste which constitutes a pass through of the
system as defined in this Part.
      (14)   Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points
designated by the Borough in accordance with §
18-854(H).
      (15)   Temperature. Any wastewater having a temperature that will inhibit
biological activity in the treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no
case wastewater which causes the temperature at the introduction into the
treatment plant to exceed 104º Fahrenheit (40º Celsius).
      (16)   Any sludges, screenings or other residues from the pretreatment of
industrial waste.
      (17)   Any medical waste, except as specifically authorized by the
Township Manager in a wastewater discharge permit.
      (18)   Any wastewater causing the treatment plant’s effluent to fail a
toxicity test.
      (19)   Any wastes containing detergents, surface active agents or other
substances which may cause excessive foaming in the POTW.
      (20)   Toxic Gases/Vapors/Fumes. Pollutants which result in the presence
of toxic gases, vapors or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause
acute worker health and safety problems.
Wastes prohibited in this Section shall not be processed or stored in such a
manner that they would be discharged to the POTW. All floor drains located in
process or material storage areas must discharge to the industrial user’s
pretreatment facility before connecting with the POTW.
      B.   Limitations on Wastewater Discharges. Proactive control of influent
pollutants of concern must be given a high priority. Wastewater entering the
treatment plant is treated by biological organisms growing in slime like bio-
films which are susceptible to inhibition or destruction from relatively small
amounts of toxic influent materials. The plant does not have flow equalization
which increases the risk of harm from short duration, higher concentration
influent loadings. Very small amounts of bio-toxic materials, such as biocides,
bactericides, herbicides and pesticides can cause aquatic toxicity and inhibit
or kill the plant’s biological treatment processes. Therefore both the Borough
and non-domestic users have a responsibility to identify actual or potential
bio-toxics to prevent problems such as process interference, sludge quality,
aquatic toxicity, personnel and public exposure, collection system issues,
regulatory compliance, and water quality because discharges to the Lehigh River
and under the “Special Protection Waters Rules” as adopted by the Delaware
River Basin Commission.
Each industrial user is limited on the concentration of pollutants allowed to
be discharged as hereinafter detailed. The controlling limit is the lesser of
(1) the local limit or (2) the Federal categorical pre-treatment standard for
each pollutant. Dilution of any wastewater for the purpose of meeting the
limits hereinafter described, or the local limits or Federal categorical pre-
treatment standards, shall be considered a violation of this Part 8.
      (1)   The following are the maximum concentrations of pollutants
allowable, the action level guidelines for pollutants of concern and surcharge
levels of pollutants of concern in wastewater discharges to the wastewater
treatment system. Development of these limits and levels was done taken into
account the existing loading on our sludge of these pollutants, plant
efficiency, total combined flow from all industrial discharges. These local
limits will be reviewed periodically and may change as a result of changes in
the factors contributing to their development. If such changes are made in the
local limits for pollutants of concern, these changes, with the required EPA
approvals, can be adopted and used in new or revised permits without further
ordinance revisions.
         (a)   Local Limits for Pollutants of Concern.
 
Parameter                                 Daily Maximum Concentration
Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) 1          850 mg/l
Total Suspended Solids (TSS)              850 mg/l
pH                                        6-9 Standard Units
Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)              Monitor Only
Oil & Grease, Cyanide, Silver, Bio-Toxics Enforceable BMPs
 
   Action Level Guidelines for Pollutants of Concern
 
Parameter Action Level (mg/l)
Cadmium   0.104
Chromium  6.97
Copper    1.35
Silver    0.535
Zinc      2.96
Barium    715
 
   Surcharge Levels for Pollutants of Concern
 
Surcharge Parameter TSS      BOD      COD      NH3-N   TKN
Surcharge level     200 mg/l 200 mg/l 600 mg/l 30 mg/l 75mg/l
Action level        600      600      1,200    120     600
Prohibited level    850      850      2,500    200     1,000
 
   Discharges over the prohibited level are not allowed at any time and must be
ceased.
      1)   Action Level Appeal Process. The numerical action levels are
guidelines that when exceeded indicate that a CAP is necessary. The submission
of an acceptable CAP is an enforceable permit condition. If the sewer user
believes that the action level is not appropriate or that a CAP is not
necessary, the user can petition the Borough, or Township if the determination
was made by the Township, for reconsideration by submitting additional
information to the pretreatment coordinator to justify the change. If in the
opinion of the Borough or Township, as appropriate, the data submitted is not
sufficient to make a determination. the discharge above the action level may be
temporarily or permanently denied. In instances where the Township or Borough
must use an outside consultant to evaluate the information submitted, the user
must first agree to compensate the Township or Borough for the estimated
consultant fees. When the Township or Borough has determined that discharges
over the action level are not acceptable all such discharges must be ceased or
the permit can be revoked and service terminated. The permit can also be
amended to exclude any discharges of the specific materials exceeding the
action level.
      (2)   Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards. Any categorical
industry discharging to the POTW must also comply with the categorical
industrial limits established by EPA. There are too many types of categorical
industries for the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards to be listed
here. Any industrial user which would be regulated under the categorical
pretreatment standards will have those standards listed in its Industrial
Discharge Permit. The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR,
Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405–471, are incorporated by reference herein.
      (3)   Best Management Practices for Additional Pollutants of Concern.
Enforceable best management practices are required for discharges containing
significant amounts of materials such as Arsenic, Lead, Mercury, Molybdenum,
Nickel, Selenium, toxics, biocides, dissolved solids, and any material which in
the opinion of the Borough or Township is a POC because it will cause or have
the potential to cause environmental problems such as those listed in “action
levels.” BMPs must be pre-approved before any discharges will be authorized and
will be enforceable permit conditions.
[Ord. 545]
      C.   Special Agreements. Nothing in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the Borough and any
user of the wastewater treatment system whereby wastewater of unusual strength
or character is accepted into the system and specially treated to be
acceptable, subject to any payments or user charges as may be applicable. Local
standards set forth in this Chapter may be waived by special agreement but this
provision does not allow waiver of any National pretreatment standards.
      (1)   Any special agreement is prohibited from waiving any other Federal
retreatment requirements. [Ord. 545]
      (2)   One of the conditions of any special agreement is that the total
loading for any pollutant allocated to all users does not exceed the maximum
allowable industrial loading calculated as part of the most recently accepted
local limits evaluation. [Ord. 545]
      (3)   Any special agreement must be entered into and authorized in
writing. [Ord. 545]
      D.   Concentrations. Concentrations apply at the point where industrial
waste is discharged to the POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances are
for “total” metal unless indicated otherwise. At his discretion, the Borough
Manager may impose mass limitations in addition to or in place of the
concentration based limitations set forth above in Subsection (B) of this
Section.
      E.   Dilution. No industrial user shall ever increase the use of the
process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or
complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a
discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment
standard or requirement. The Borough Manager may impose mass limitations on
industrial users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass
limitations is appropriate.
      F.   Sludge Protection Requirements (SPRs). The following are the maximum
sludge protection requirement levels allowable in wastewater discharges to the
wastewater treatment plant. Each industrial or commercial user actively
discharging pollutants that could accumulate in the sludge must comply with the
SPRs. If the discharge level exceeds the SPRs, the user must develop a plan to
come into compliance within a reasonable period of time as approved by the
Borough of Catasauqua or cease discharging the problem waste stream.
Parameter EPA Clean Sludge (EO) Limit (mg/kg) Daily Max Concentration (mg/l)
Parameter  EPA Clean Sludge (EO) Limit (mg/kg) Daily Max Concentration (mg/l)
Zinc       2800                                1.25
Chromium   1500 1                              0.7
Copper     1500                                0.42
Nickel     420                                 0.15
Lead       300                                 0.07
Selenium   100                                 0.1
Molybdenum 75 2                                0.06
Arsenic    41                                  0.03
Cadmium    39                                  0.012
Mercury    17                                  0.007
 
The Borough shall have the right to revise these limits based on observational
data. The Borough also shall have the right to set more stingent limits for any
pollutant, such as reactive cyanide or reactive sulfide, if it finds actual or
potential discharges adversely effects sludge quality and the landfill or land
application of the sludge.
 
Reactivity Parameter EPA Sludge Limit Daily Max. Concentration
Reactive Cyanide     250 mg/kg        0.05 mg/l
Reactive Sulfide     500 mg/kg        0.1 mg/l
 
If reactive sulfide and/or reactive cyanide exceed or have the potential to
exceed 50% of their respective limits, pretreatment is required.
Being able to comply with an SPR is not an authorization to discharge a non-
domestic and/or toxic pollutant or domestic pollutant in quantities exceeding
the normal domestic levels. Authorization to discharges only granted by the
issuance of a permit, an amended permit or a letter of approval (which requires
a submission of a permit application or a notification of changed discharge).

Notes
  Notes: In situations where, in the opinion of the Township or Borough, BOD is
  not representative of the strength of industrial and commercial discharges. and/
  or COD tests are better for process control purposes, testing for COD may be
1 substituted for testing for BOD. Where monitoring for COD is required in a
  permit or permit amendment, the permittee will usually not be required to
  monitor for BOD. However, if there is need to know the site’s BOD loading as a
  percentage of the plant’s design capacity, testing both BOD and COD may be
  required.

§ 18-854.   Control of Prohibited Wastes.
      A.   Regulatory Actions. If wastewaters containing any substance
described in §
18-853 of this Part are discharged or proposed to be discharged into the sewer
system of the Borough of Catasauqua or any sewer system which is tributary
thereto, or if the industrial user due to plant setup or chemical storage
considerations might require a slug/spill prevention plan regardless of what
they are or plan to be discharging, Manager and the Borough Solicitor, while
informing the Township Manager may take all actions against the user necessary
to:
      (1)   Prohibit the discharge of such wastewater.
      (2)   Require a user to demonstrate that in-plant modifications will
reduce or eliminate the discharge of such substances in conformity with this
Part.
      (3)   Require pretreatment, including storage facilities, or flow
equalization necessary to reduce or eliminate the objectionable characteristics
or substances so that the discharge will not violate these rules and
regulations.
      (4)   Require the user making, causing or allowing the discharge to pay
any additional cost or expense incurred by the Township or Borough for handling
and treating excess loads imposed on the treatment system.
      (5)   Where the Borough Manager determines that an emergency condition
exists requiring the immediate cessation of an offending discharge into the
sewer system, the Borough Manager, while informing the Township manager, shall
proceed as follows:
         (a)   He shall immediately notify the offending user of the situation
and order him to immediately stop the discharge.
         (b)   If the offender fails to respond to the Borough Manager’s order,
the Borough Manager is empowered to do all acts necessary including shutting
off any flow from the offending user to the sewer system. Wherever practical,
the Borough Manager should give the offending user a second notice just prior
to terminating their flow into the system.
         (c)   If an offending user feels aggrieved by either actions of the
Township or Borough Manager, he may immediately appeal for a hearing before
Borough Council. Borough Council shall hold a hearing within 48 hours after
request of the same and shall either affirm the Borough or Township Manager’s
decision, reverse the decision, or modify the same.
It is the intent of this provision that the Township Manager and the Borough
Manager be given all necessary powers to terminate immediately any discharges
which create emergency conditions which may present an imminent danger to the
health or welfare of persons or society and/or which may do damage to the
sewage treatment facility.
      B.   Submission of Plans. Where pretreatment or equalization of
wastewater flows prior to discharge into any part of the wastewater treatment
system is required, plans, specifications and other pertinent data or
information relating to such pretreatment or flow-control facilities shall
first be submitted to the Township and Borough Managers for review and
approval. For matters relating to the Township’s collection system, the
Township has the final approval authority. For the treatment of wastestreams,
the Borough has the final approval authority. Such approval shall not exempt
the discharge or such facilities from compliance with any applicable code,
ordinance, rule, regulation or order of any governmental authority. Any
subsequent alterations or additions to such pretreatment or flow control
facilities, or changes to polluted discharges shall not be made without due
notice and prior approval of the Township and Borough Managers, and the
issuance of a new or modified permit as required.
      C.   Pretreatment Facilities Operations. If pretreatment or control of
waste flows is required, such facilities shall be maintained in good working
order and operated as efficiently as possible by the owner or operator at his
own cost and expense, subject to the requirements of these rules and
regulations and all other applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
      D.   Admission to Property. Whenever it shall be necessary for the
purposes of these rules and regulations, the Township Manager, Borough Manager
or their designee upon the presentation of credentials, may enter upon any
property or premises at reasonable times for the purpose of (i) copying any
records required to be kept under the provisions of this Part 8, (ii)
inspecting any monitoring equipment or method, and (iii) sampling any discharge
of wastewater to the treatment works. The Township Manager, Borough Manager or
their designee may enter upon the property at any hour under emergency
circumstances.
      E.   Protection from Accidental Discharge. Each user shall provide
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
regulated by this Part. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of
prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner or
operator’s cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating
procedures and any subsequent modifications thereto to provide this protection
shall be submitted to the Township and Borough Managers for review by the
Township and Borough Engineers, and shall be approved by the Township and
Borough Engineers before construction of the facility. Cost of this review
shall be paid by the user. Review and approval of such plans and operating
procedures shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify his
facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this Part. Any industrial
user required to develop and implement an accidental discharge/ control slug
plan shall submit a plan which addresses at a minimum the following:
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges.
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals.
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental or
slug discharge. Such notification must also be given for any discharge which
would violate any of the prohibited discharges in §
18-853 of this Part.
      (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants (including solvents) and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
      F.   Reporting of Accidental Discharge. If, for any reason, a facility
does not comply with or will be unable to comply with any publication or
limitations in this Part, the user responsible for such discharge shall
immediately notify the Township and Borough Managers so that corrective action
may be taken to protect the treatment system. In addition, a written report
addressed to both the Township Manager and Borough Manager detailing the date,
time and cause of the accidental discharge, the quantity and characteristics of
the discharge and corrective action taken to prevent future discharges, shall
be filed by the responsible facility within 5 days of the occurrence of the
noncomplying discharge.
      G.   Tenant Responsibility. Where an owner of property leases premises to
any other person or as a tenant under any rental or lease agreement, if either
the owner or the tenant is an industrial user, either or both may be held
responsible for compliance with the provisions of this Part.
      H.   Hauled Wastewater.
      (1)   Septic tank waste may be accepted into the POTW at a designated
receiving structure within a treatment plant area, and at such times as are
established by the Borough Manager; provided, such wastes do not violate other
Sections of this Part or any other requirement established or adopted by the
Borough. Wastewater discharge permits for individual vehicles to use such
facility shall be issued by the Borough Manager.
      (2)   The discharge of hauled industrial waste, as “industrial septate,”
requires prior approval and a wastewater discharge permit from the Borough. The
Borough Manager shall have authority to prohibit the disposal of such wastes,
if such disposal would interfere with the treatment plant operation. Waste
haulers are subject to all other Sections of this Part.
      (3)   Fees for dumping septate will be established as part of the
industrial user fee system as authorized under this Part.
      I.   Vandalism. No person shall maliciously or willfully or negligently
break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface, tamper with or prevent access to any
structure, appurtenance or equipment or other part of the POTW. Any person
found in violation of this requirement shall be subject to the sanctions set
out in §
18-857.
      J.   Responsibility for Environmental Compliance and Pollutant
Discharges.
      (1)   Responsibility for Environmental Compliance.
         (a)   The industrial or commercial user named on a municipal water/
sewer bill (named user) is responsible for compliance with Federal, State, and
local and environmental rules, regulations and ordinances. Each occupant at
that address also has the same responsibilities and must have a watershed
protection permit to discharge. If violations and/or environmental problems
occur at a multi-occupant site and the occupant responsible does not take
immediate corrective action or cannot be positively identified the named user
shall be fully responsible for correcting all of the site’s noncompliance and
pollution issues and is subject to all enforcement options. When required by
the Borough or Township, the named user must apply for and be issued a
watershed protection permit for the entire site by the Borough.
      (2)   Responsibility for Pollutant Discharges.
         (a)   Responsibility for Pollutant Discharges from Single Occupant
Sites. The occupant must obtain a Level I, II or III watershed protection
permit before commencing any discharges. In the event that materials harmful to
the environment and/or in violation of Federal, State and local government
rules and regulations are found in the effluent, the occupant, and if necessary
the named user, will be held responsible for taking action to control the
source and any costs of remediation or any damages caused and will be subject
to all actions in the enforcement response plan.
         (b)   Responsibility for Pollutant Discharges, Multiple Occupant
Sites. Each occupant must obtain a Level I, II or III watershed protection
permit before commencing any discharges. In the event that materials harmful to
the environment and/or in violation of Federal, State and local government
rules and regulations are found in the effluent of a multi-occupant building
(without individual sampling points for each occupant) and the occupant
responsible for the discharge cannot be identified, the named user will be held
responsible for taking action to control the source and any costs of
remediation for any damages caused and will be subject to all actions in the
enforcement response plan.
      (3)   Responsibility for the Costs of Compliance.
         (a)   Watershed Protection Permit Application Costs. Each sewer user
proposing to discharge new pollutants or increased levels of previously
approved pollutants is responsible for all of the application costs including,
but not limited to, sampling, laboratory tests and consultant services.
         (b)   Permit Compliance Costs. Each permitted sewer user is
responsible for the costs of sampling, analysis and any other expenses required
to comply with the site’s permit.
         (c)   Additional Analysis and Testing. If a sewer user discharges any
pollutant which requires additional sampling, analysis and other tests, the
sewer user is responsible for the additional costs.
         (d)   Site Specific NPDES Permit and Pretreatment Compliance Costs. If
a sewer user discharges any material for which the DEP and EPA specifies
additional or modified NPDES permit requirements and/or additional pretreatment
requirements, the sewer user is responsible for any additional costs incurred
by the Borough to implement and maintain compliance with these requirements.
         (e)   Costs of Identification and Correction of Violations. The sewer
user or users responsible for discharges that cause violations, harm to the
treatment plant and the environment are also responsible for all extra expenses
incurred by the Borough and Township to locate the source(s) and take the
necessary corrective actions. If a sewer user, who is not the property owner,
is found to be a source and does not promptly and properly assume these
responsibilities, the named user will be held responsible.
[Ord. 545]
      K.   Termination of Sewer Service. All sewage discharges to the Borough’s
treatment plant must be terminated on permit expiration or permit revocation or
when a cease and desist order is issued. Permits can be revoked or a cease and
desist order issued for illegal discharges (actual or potential), NPDES
violations and continued noncompliance with permit requirements, such as local
limits, action levels, enforceable BMPs and/or other applicable local, State
and Federal environmental regulations. When there are actual and/or potential
adverse effects, the Borough or Township can immediately terminate sewer
service with or without taking prior enforcement actions. This can be done by
issuing a cease and desist order that will stay in effect until compliance can
be assured. Cease and desist orders will usually be sent by certified mail, but
in unusual or emergency situations, they can be given verbally (in person or
over the phone), hand delivered or sent by fax or email.
      (1)   Actions That must Be Taken When Sewer Service Is Terminated.
         (a)   When a permit expires or has been revoked or a cease and desist
order has been issued the sewer user must terminate all wastewater discharges
to the Borough’s WWTP within 15 calendar days. The time to terminate all
discharges may be reduced where there is an indication that imminent harm will
occur. Any further violations found during the period during which termination
of all discharges must occur will be subject to additional escalating
enforcement as serious, willful violations.
         (b)   The sewer user must send a termination of discharge
certification letter to the Borough manager and Township Manager, each by
certified mail, as soon as possible but within 15 calendar days of permit
expiration or receipt of a cease and desist order signed by the person in
charge of the site’s operations certifying that all discharges to the WWTP have
been permanently stopped describing the actions taken so that further
discharges cannot occur. The timeframe to submit the termination of discharge
certification letter is separate and independent from the timeframe to
terminate all wastewater discharges set forth in Subsection (K)(1)(a). If after
16 days this termination of discharge certification letter has not been
received by the Borough and the Township, a civil penalty assessment of no less
than $200 per day of continued illegal discharge will be issued. This daily
penalty may be increased one or more times if illegal discharges continue and/
or the certification letter is not received.

      (1)   Inspection and Sampling. The Borough and Township shall have the
right to enter the facilities of any industrial user to ascertain whether the
purpose of this Part, and any permit or order issued hereunder, is being met
and whether the industrial user is complying with all requirements thereof.
Industrial users shall allow the Borough and Township Managers or their
representatives ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of
any additional duties.
         (a)   Where an industrial user has security measures in force which
required proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises,
the industrial user shall make necessary arrangement with the security guard so
that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the Borough
and Township, State and EPA will be permitted to enter without delay, for the
purposes of performing their specific responsibilities.
         (b)   The Borough, Township, State and EPA shall have the right to set
up on the industrial users property, or require installation of such devices as
are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user’s operations.
         (c)   The Borough or Township may require the industrial user to
install monitoring equipment, as necessary. The facility’s sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the industrial user at its own expense. All devices used
to measure waste water flow and quality shall be calibrated at least semi-
annually to insure their accuracy.
         (d)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access
to the industrial facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the industrial user at the written or verbal request of the Borough
or Township Manager or his representative and shall not be replaced. The costs
of clearing such access shall be born by the industrial user.
         (e)   Unreasonable delays in allowing Borough or Township personnel
access to the industrial user’s premises shall be a violation of this Part.
      B.   Reporting Requirements.
      (1)   Base Line Monitoring Reports.
         (a)   Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical
pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a categorical
determination under 40 CFR § 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing
significant industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment
standards, and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW,
shall be required to submit to the Borough and Township a report which contains
the information listed in Subsection (b), below. At least 90 days prior to
commencement of their discharge, new sources and sources that become industrial
users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard,
shall be required to submit to the Borough and Township a report which contains
the information listed in Subsection (b), below. A new source shall also be
required to report the method of pretreatment standards. A new source shall
also give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants
discharged.
         (b)   The industrial user shall submit the information required by
this Section including:
            (i)   Identifying Information. The name and address of the facility
including the name of the operator and owners.

POTW from the regulated processes.
            (iv)   Flow Measurement. Information showing the measured average
daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated
process streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined
waste stream formula set out in 40 CFR § 403.6(e).
            (v)   Measurement of Pollutants.
               a)   Identify the categorical pretreatment standards applicable
to each regulated process.
               b)   Submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the
nature and concentration (and/or mass, where required by the standard or by the
Borough and Township) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each
regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum and long term average
concentrations (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be
representative of normal discharges from the daily operations occurring during
the reporting period and shall be analyzed in accordance with the procedures
set out in Subsection (B)(10) of this Section. [Ord. 545]
               c)   Sampling must be performed in accordance with the
procedures set out in Subsection (B)(11).
            (vi)   Certification. A statement used by the industrial user’s
authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating
whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not,
whether additional operation and maintenance and/or additional pretreatment is
required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
            (vii)   Compliance Schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M
will be required to meet the pretreatment standards; the shortest schedule by
which the industrial user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M.
The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance
date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. The compliance
schedule pursuant to this Section must meet the requirements set out in §
18-856(D) of this Part.
            (viii)   All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and
certified in accordance with §
18-856(D)(9).
      (2)   Compliance Schedule Progress Report. The following conditions shall
apply to the schedule required in §
18-855(B)(1)(b)(vii). The schedule shall contain progress increments in the
form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to
the construction and operation of additional pretreatment re-required for the
user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events including
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts
for the major components, commencing and completing construction, beginning and
conducting routine operation). No increment referred to above shall exceed 9
months. The industrial user shall submit a progress report to the Borough and
Township Managers no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and
the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it
complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, (and, if
appropriate), the steps being taken by the industrial user to return to the
established schedule. In no event shall more than 9 months elapse between such
progress reports to the Borough and Township Managers.
      (3)   Report on Compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standard
Deadline.
         (a)   Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source,
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any
industrial user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall
submit to the Borough and Township a report containing the information
described in §
18-855(B)(1)(b)(iv)-(vi).
         (b)   For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration
limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR § 403.6(c), this
report shall contain a reasonable measure of the industrial user’s long term
production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per
unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include
the industrial user’s actual production during the appropriate sampling period.
All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with §
18-856(D)(9).
      (4)   Periodic Compliance Reports.
         (a)   Any significant industrial user subject to a pretreatment
standard shall, at a frequency determined by the Borough Manager but in no case
less than twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the
nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by
such pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average of maximum
daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be
signed and certified in accordance with §
18-856(D)(9). In cases where the applicable standard requires compliance with a
best management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall
submit documentation as required by the Borough or Township or the applicable
standard to determine compliance with the standard. [Ord. 545]
         (b)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the normal
discharges occurring during the reporting period. Wastewater monitoring and
flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean and
maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of an industrial
user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds
for the industrial user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of
its discharge. [Ord. 545]
         (c)   If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in
and of this Section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the
POTW, using the procedures prescribed in §
18-855(B)(11) of this Part, the results of this monitoring shall be included in
this report.
      (5)   Report of Changed Conditions. Each industrial user is required to
notify the Borough and Township Managers of any planned significant changes to
the industrial user’s operation or system which might alter the nature, quality
or volume of its wastewater, or impact the potential for slug discharge, at
least 90 days before the change. [Ord. 545]
         (a)   The Borough Manager may require the industrial user to submit
such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition,
including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under §
18-856(B).
         (b)   The Borough Manager may issue a wastewater discharge permit
under §
18-856(C) or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under §
18-856(I).
         (c)   No industrial user shall implement the planned changed condition
(s) until and unless the Borough Manager has responded to the industrial user’s
notice.
         (d)   For purposes of this requirement, flow increases of 10 percent
or greater and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants shall be
deemed significant.
      (6)   Reports of Potential Problems.
         (a)   In the case of any discharge including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load which may cause potential problems
for the POTW (including a violation of the prohibited discharge standards in §
18-853 of this Part), it is the responsibility of the industrial user to
immediately telephone and notify the Borough and Township of the incident. This
notification shall include the location of discharge, type of waste,
concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the
industrial user.
         (b)   Within 5 days following such discharge, the industrial user
shall, unless waived by the Borough and Township Managers, submit a detailed
written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be
taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such
notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage
or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW,
natural resources or any other damage to relieve the industrial user of any
fines, civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this Part.
         (c)   Failure to notify the Borough and Township of potential problem
discharges shall be deemed a separate violation of this Part.
         (d)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user’s
bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the
event of a discharge described in Subsection (a), above. Employers shall ensure
that all employees who may cause or suffer such a discharge to occur are
advised of the emergency notification procedures.
         (e)   Reports of potential problems as described in this Subsection
(6) shall also be required within the same timeframes and to the same agencies
whenever there are facility changes that affect the potential or slug
discharges. This notification requirement is in addition to any other
requirement relating to slug discharges contained elsewhere in this Part 8.
[Ord. 545]
      (7)   Reports from Nonsignificant Industrial Users. All industrial users
not subject to categorical pretreatment standards and not required to obtain a
wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the Borough
and Township as the Borough and Township Manager, respectively may require.
      (8)   Notice of Violation/Repeat Sampling and Reporting. If sampling
performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the industrial user must
notify the Borough and Township within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and
submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Borough and Township within 30
days after becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user is not required
to resample if the POTW performs monitoring at the industrial user’s [premises]
at least once a month, or if the POTW performs sampling between the industrial
user’s initial sampling and when the industrial user receives the results of
the sampling.
      (9)   Notification of the Discharge of Hazardous Waste.
         (a)   Any industrial user who commences the discharge of hazardous
waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division
Director and State hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into
the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be hazardous
waste under 40 CFR, Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the
hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR, Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste
number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the
industrial user discharges more than 10 kilograms of such waste per calendar
month to the POTW, the notification shall also include the following
information to the extent such information is known and readily available to
the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained
in the wastes, an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream
expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications
must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any
notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each
hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must
be submitted under §
18-855(B)(5), above. The notification requirement in this Section does not
apply to pollutant already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of
Subsections (B)(1), (3) and (4), above.
         (b)   Discharges are exempt from the requirements of Subsection (A) of
this Section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms of hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR § 261.30(d) and § 261.33
(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous waste specified
in 40 CFR § 261.30 and § 261.33(3) requires a one time notification.
         (c)   In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substances as hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the
POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and State
hazardous waste authorizes of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of
the effective date of such regulations.
         (d)   In the case of any notification made under this Section, the
industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the
volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical.
      (10)   Analytical Requirements. All pollutant analyses, including
sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR, Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR, Part 136, does not contain
sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA.
      (11)   Sample Collection.
         (a)   Except as indicated in Subsection (b), below, the industrial
user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite
collection techniques. The Borough Manager may authorize the use of another
sampling technique as long as the sample is representative of discharge. In
addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous
discharge limits. [Ord. 545]
         (b)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
toxicity, sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
      (12)   Determination of Noncompliance. The Borough Manager may use a grab
sample(s) to determine noncompliance with pretreatment standards.
      (13)   Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on
the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a
mail facility serviced by the U.S. Postal Service, the date of receipt of the
report shall govern.
      (14)   Record Keeping. Any industrial user subject to the reporting
requirements established in this Part 8 shall maintain and make available for
copying records of all information resulting from any monitoring the activities
required by this Part 8, including documentation associated with best
management practices. Such records shall include for all samples:
         (a)   The date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the
names of the person or persons taking the samples.
         (b)   The date(s) analyses were performed.
         (c)   Who performed the analyses.
         (d)   The analytical techniques/methods used.
         (e)   The results of such analyses.
Any industrial user subject to the reporting requirements established in this
Part 8 (including documentation associated with BMPs) shall be required to
retain for a minimum of 3 years any records of monitoring activities and
results whether or not such monitoring activities are required by this Section)
and shall make such records available for inspection and copying by the Borough
or Township. This period of retention shall be extended during the course of
any unresolved litigation concerning compliance with this Part 8, or where the
industrial user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by
the Borough Manager.
[Ord. 545]
      (15)   Additional Monitoring Data. Industrial users that monitor more
frequently than required, using appropriate procedure, are required to submit
such monitoring to the POTW. The timing, procedures and record keeping
requirements for such additional reports shall be the same as for the required
reporting.
      (16)   Confidential Information. Information and data on an industrial
user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications,
wastewater discharge permits and monitoring programs, and from City inspection
and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction
unless the industrial user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to
the satisfaction of the Borough that the release of such information, processes
or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under
applicable State law. When required and demonstrated by the industrial user
furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the
proportions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes
shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made
available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to
the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics and other “effluent data” as defined by 40 CFR § 2.302 will not
be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public
without restriction.
(Ord. 396, 9/6/2000, § 855; as amended by Ord. 545, 4/17/2013, §§ 9–15)
§ 18-856.   Wastewater Applications and Permits.
   1.   Wastewater Application. All commercial and industrial users must submit
information on the nature and characteristics of the wastewater, materials
stored on site and wastes sent for off-site disposal, by completing a permit
application prior to commencing any discharge, or within the time frames set
forth for existing users. The Borough Manager is authorized to prepare a form
for this purpose and may periodically require commercial and industrial users
to update their application. Failure to complete the application shall be
reasonable grounds for terminating service to the user and shall be considered
a violation of this Part.
      A.   Wastewater Discharge Permits Required.
         (1)   All significant industrial users proposing to connect to
discharge into any part of the wastewater treatment system must first obtain a
discharge permit therefor.
         (2)   All existing significant industrial users connected to or
discharging to any part of the Township’s system must obtain a Wastewater
Discharge Permit within 90 days from and after the effective date of this Part.
         (3)   Any existing permitted user which changes its discharge must
obtain a Discharge Permit prior to commencing any changed discharge.
         (4)   All nonsignificant industrial users, and all commercial users
shall be required to obtain a water pollution management permit, either Level
II or Level III.
            (a)   Existing users shall apply for said water pollution
management permit within 180 days of publication of this Part.
            (b)   New users shall apply for and obtain a water pollution
management permit prior to occupancy.
         (5)   The Borough Manager may require other industrial users,
including liquid waste haulers, to obtain wastewater discharge permits as
necessary to carry out the purposes of this Part. Any of the responsibilities
of the Township Manager or the Township under this §
18-856 may be performed by the Borough Manager upon agreement by the Township
Manager and Borough Manager.
      B.   Permit Application. Users seeking a wastewater discharge permit or
seeking a new permit due to revised discharges, shall complete and file with
the Borough Manager an application on a form prescribed by the Borough Manager
and accompanied by the applicable fee. Said application may require the
following general information, as well as additional user specific information:
         (1)   Name, address, and SIC number of applicant.
            (d)   Baseline Monitoring Report. All industrial users subject to
Categorical Pretreatment standards must submit a baseline monitoring report
(BMR) to the Borough within 180 days after the effective date of a Categorical
Pretreatment Standard or 180 days after the final administrative decision made
upon a category determination request, whichever is later.
            (e)   Compliance Monitoring. All limits must be complied with, but
periodic monitoring is usually required only for the parameters that are
actively discharged However, the Borough or Township can require either
temporary screening or periodic monitoring for any parameter with or without a
limit that is believed to have an actual or potential harmful effect on the
plant, its employees, the public, the sludge, the collection systems and the
Lehigh River. [Ord. 545]
         (6)   Daily average and daily maximum discharge rates, or other
appropriate conditions when pollutants subject to limitations and prohibitions
are proposed or present in the user’s wastewater discharge.
         (7)   Compliance schedules.
         (8)   Best Management Practices (BMPs).
            (a)   BMP Certification. Those users with BMP requirements in their
permits will be required to certify within 60 days and then annually that the
BMPs are being effectively implemented and submit all documentation required by
the BMP, such as process control, cleaning, maintenance and offsite disposal of
records which must be kept for at least 3 years. Copies must be shown to or
sent to the Borough or Township when requested. In the event that there is a
noticeable increase in the treatment plan influent of a parameter used by a
site with a BMP, the Borough or Township can require immediate monitoring and
other actions in accordance with the applicable monitoring requirements on a
temporary or permanent basis. Failure to comply with an approved BMP may result
in any one or more of the following: escalating enforcement actions, a
temporary or permanent change in permit level or permit fees, submission of a
new permit application may be required. In addition sewer service can be
terminated until the user conclusively demonstrates that a sustainable approved
BMP has been adopted and implemented.
            (b)   Customized BMPs. A sewer user who believes that a site
specific BMP could be more environmentally beneficial and/or more cost
effective than complying with a numerical discharge limit or action level
should contact the Borough’s Pretreatment Coordinator to determine if a BMP
would be appropriate. If the use of a BMP is found to be suitable the Borough
may work with the user to plan and implement an enforceable BMP.
            (c)   Enforceable BMPs for Bio-Toxic Materials. Dischargers of bio-
toxics must submit BMPs acceptable to the Borough before commencing any
discharges. The BMPs must assure that toxic amounts of these materials will not
be discharged at any time, or the user must use less toxic materials or zero
discharge.
            (d)   Enforceable BMPs for Cyanide Dischargers. Dischargers of
cyanide or cyanide containing materials must implement enforceable BMPs
acceptable to the Borough and Township before commencing any discharges. The
BMP ‘s must include the use of a pre-approved cyanide destruction system that
reduces the total cyanide destruction system that reduces the total cyanide to
non-detect (below a reporting limit of 0.005 mg/l). In some instances, the
Borough or Township may require that after the cyanide destruction process, the
treated waste water be held in sealed and secure containers until the cyanide
content has been tested and found to be <0.005 mg/l, if not the batch must be
retreated.
            (e)   Enforceable BMPs for Oil and Grease. All Level I and Level II
permittees discharging FOG (fats or oils or greases or a combination thereof)
must submit a BMP called a “FOG Management Plan” for Borough and Township
approval.
[Ord. 545]
         (9)   Signatory Requirement. Base line monitoring reports (BMR’s),
reports on compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standard deadlines, 90-day
Compliance Reports and periodic reports on continued compliance must be signed
and certified by a duly authorized representative of the industrial user. A
duly authorized representative is one who meets the criteria established at 40
CFR 403.12(1). The signature for these reports must be accompanied by the
following certification statement:
            “I certify under penalty of law that this document and all
attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with
a system designed to insure qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate
the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who
manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the
information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and
belief, true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant
penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fines
and imprisonment for knowing violations.”
         (10)   General Sewer Use Rules and Regulations.
         (11)   A statement of applicable civil, criminal and administrative
penalties for violation of pretreatment standards and requirements, and any
applicable compliance schedule. Such schedule may not extend the time for
compliance beyond that required by applicable Federal, State or local law, and
the statement of penalties may reference only those set forth hereafter in the
audience.
         (12)   A statement that compliance with the wastewater discharge
permit does not relieve the permittee of responsibility with compliance with
all applicable State and Federal pretreatment standards, including those which
become effective during the term of discharge permit.
         (13)   Conditional Discharge Permits for New or Increased POC
Discharges or Noncompliance. Conditional watershed protection permits can be
issued when, in the Borough’s judgment, it is necessary to protect the plant
and the environment when the harmful effects of new pollutants or increased
amounts of existing pollutants are not well known. Especially when the proposed
influent loadings are substantially higher than the usual background levels
and/or the discharge flow is higher or uneven throughout the day or has spikes
or slug discharges. An existing permit can also be revoked and reissued as a
conditional permit after a “letter of violation” and/or a “notice that
preventive action is required” has been issued because of noncompliance or
marginal compliance with permit requirements. Conditional permits are valid for
a period of up to 1 year and will only be renewed (either as a conditional or
multi-year conventional permit) if there is satisfactory compliance with the
requirements of the permit. [Ord. 545]
         (14)   Applicable slug control and slug discharges notification
requirements. [Ord. 545]
         (15)   Applicable BMP requirements. [Ord. 545]
         (16)   Other conditions to ensure compliance with this Part 8. [Ord.
545]
      E.   Duration of Permits. Permits shall be used for a specified time
period, not to exceed 5 years. A permit may be issued for a period of less than
1 year or may be stated to expire on a specific date. Any permittee desiring to
continue to discharge after the expiration date shall file an application for
reissuance of the permit not less than 120 days prior to the expiration of the
permit. The terms and conditions of the permit may be subject to modification
and change by the Borough Manager during the life of the permit, as limitations
or requirements as identified in Section 53 are modified and changed. The user
shall be informed of any proposed changes in his permit at least 30 days prior
to the effective date of the change. Any changes or new conditions in the
permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance. [Ord. 545]
         (1)   Subject to the general provisions on the duration of permits, it
is the intention of this subsection that Level I and Level III permits shall
have terms of up to 5 years and that Level II permits shall have terms of up to
3 years.
         (2)   Wastewater discharge permits shall be voidable upon nonuse,
cessation of operations or transfer of business ownership. All wastewater
discharge permits are void upon the issuance of a new wastewater discharge
permit.
      F.   Transfer of a Permit. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a
specific user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not
be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different
premises or a new or changed operation.
      G.   Revocation of Permit.
         (1)   Any user who violates the following conditions of his permit or
of this Part, or of applicable State and Federal regulations, is subject to
having his permit revoked. Violations subjecting a user to possible revocation
of his permit include, but are not limited to, the following:
            (a)   Failure of a user to accurately report the wastewater
constituents and characteristics of his discharge;
            (b)   Failure of the user to report significant changes in
operations, or wastewater constituents and characteristics;
            (c)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the
purpose of inspection or monitoring; or
            (d)   Violation of conditions of the permit.
            (e)   Failure to meet effluent limitations, pay fines, pay sewer
charges, meet compliance schedules, complete a wastewater survey or the
wastewater discharger permit application, or provide advanced notice of the
transfer of a permitted facility.
            (f)   Violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement, or any
terms of the wastewater discharge permit or this Part.
         (2)   Procedure for Revocation of Permit. Whenever the Borough Manager
or his designee finds that any person has violated or is violating this Part,
or any prohibition, limitation or requirement contained herein, and that person
has an industrial discharge permit, the Borough Manager shall inform the user
in writing of the violation(s) pursuant to the enforcement response guide
prepared by the Borough. The user shall be informed of the time in which to
make the necessary corrections. If the corrections are not made within the time
allotted, then the Borough Manager may revoke the discharge permit. The
revocation of industrial discharge permit by the Borough Manager may be
appealed by written request to the Borough Council within 10 days after the
permit has been revoked. Borough Council shall schedule a hearing thereon and
determination the proprietary of the Borough Manager’s decision for the
revocation of said permit. The Borough Manager shall notify the Township of any
revocations made pursuant to the subsection.
      H.   Permit Appeals. Any person, including the industrial user, may
petition the Borough to reconsider the terms of the wastewater discharge permit
within 30 days of its insurance. [Ord. 545]
         (1)   Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be deemed
to be a waiver of the administrative appeal.
         (2)   In its petition, the appealing party must indicate the
wastewater discharge permit provisions objected to, the reasons for this
objection and the alternative condition, if any, it seeks to place in the waste
water discharge permit.
         (3)   The effectiveness of the wastewater discharge permit shall not
be stayed pending the appeal.
         (4)   If the Borough fails to act within 30 days, a request for
reconsideration shall be deemed to be denied. Decision not to reconsider a
wastewater discharge permit, not to issue a wastewater discharge permit, or not
to modify a wastewater discharge permit shall be considered final
administrative action for purposes of judicial review.
         (5)   Aggrieved parties seeking judicial review of the final
administrative wastewater discharge permit decision must do so by filing a
complaint with the Court of Common Pleas for Lehigh County within the time
frame set forth by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for filing such appeals.
      I.   Wastewater Discharge Permit Modification.
         (1)   The Borough Manager may modify the wastewater discharge permit
for good cause including, but not limited to, the following:
            (a)   To incorporate any new or revised Federal, State or local
pretreatment standards or requirements.
            (b)   To address significant alterations or additions to the
industrial user’s operation, processes or wastewater volume or character since
the time of the wastewater discharge permit issuance.
            (c)   A change in the POTW that requires either a temporary or
permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge.
            (d)   Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a
threat to the Borough’s POTW, or Township personnel or the receiving waters.
            (e)   Violation of any terms or conditions of the wastewater
discharge permit.
            (f)   Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant
facts in the wastewater discharge permit application or in any required
reporting.
            (g)   Revision of or a grant of variance from categorical
pretreatment standards pursuant to 40 CFR § 403.13.
            (h)   To correct typographical or other errors in the wastewater
discharge permit.
            (i)   To reflect a transfer of the facility ownership and/or
operation to a new owner/operator.
            (j)   New or Increased POC Discharges as Prohibited Slug
Discharges. When new or increased pollutant loadings, with or without an action
level, substantially exceed the usual background levels and the effects on the
plant and the Lehigh River are unknown, the Borough can temporarily or
permanently classify them as prohibited slug discharges. The sewer user or
qualified others must provide documentation to the Borough and, if requested,
to the Township, to demonstrate that the discharge is acceptable for release to
the sewer. Proposals for flow equalization will be considered.
[Ord. 545]
The filing of a request by the permittee for a wastewater discharge permit
modification does not stay any wastewater discharge permit condition.
(Ord. 396, 9/6/2000, § 856; as amended by Ord. 545, 4/17/2013, §§ 16–21)
§ 18-857.   Enforcement.
      A.   General Enforcement Procedures.
      (1)   The Borough will prepare and adopt an enforcement response guide
for the purpose of assisting in identifying industrial user noncompliance and
responding with the appropriate enforcement measures. The enforcement response
guide may be adopted by resolution of Township Council and will be amended or
modified from time to time by resolution of Council. Enforcement options
available to the Township include suspension of wastewater treatment service,
revocation of industrial discharge permit, assessment of civil and/or criminal
penalties, assessment of administrative fines and issuance of administrative
orders and court action for injunctive relief.
      (2)   Remedies Nonexclusive. The provisions of this Section are not
exclusive remedies. The Borough and Township reserve the right to take any, all
or any combination of these actions against a non compliant user. Enforcement
of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the Borough’s
enforcement response plan. However, the Borough and Township reserve the right
to take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further,
the Borough and Township is each empowered to make more than one enforcement
action against any noncompliant user. These actions may be taken concurrently.
      (3)   Annual Publication of Significant Violators. A list of industries
which were in significant noncompliance and/or which were subject to
enforcement proceedings during the previous calendar year shall be annually
published by the Borough in a newspaper of general circulation that provides
meaningful public notice in the service area. [Ord. 545]
      B.   Administrative Enforcement Remedies.
      (1)   Whenever the Borough Manager finds that any user has violated or is
violating this Part, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder,
or any other pretreatment requirement, the Borough Manager or his agent may
serve upon said user a written notice of violation. Within 30 days of the
receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required
actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Borough and Township Manager or
designee. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for
any violations occurring before or receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing
in this Section shall limit the Borough or Town ship to take any action,
including emergency actions or any other enforcement actions, without first
issuing a notice of violation.
      (2)   Consent Orders. The Borough Manager is hereby empowered to enter
into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance or other similar
documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for
noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the user
to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order.
Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as the administrative
orders issued pursuant to subsection (B)(4) and (B)(5), below, and shall be
judicially enforceable.
      (3)   Show Cause Hearing. The Borough Manager may order any user which
causes to contributes to violation(s) of this Part, wastewater discharge
permit, or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, to appear before the Borough Manager and show cause why a proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user
specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action,
the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least 20 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on
any authorized representative of the user. Whether or not the user appears as
ordered, immediate enforcement action may be pursued following the hearing
date. A show cause hearing shall not be a prerequisite for taking any other
action against the user.
      (4)   Compliance Orders. When the Borough or Township Manager finds out a
user has violated or continues to violate the ordinance, wastewater discharge
permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Borough Manager may issue an order to the user responsible for
the discharge directing that the user come into compliance and setting forth a
time frame to achieve compliance. If the user does not come into compliance
within the required time frame, sewer service shall be discontinued unless
adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are
installed and properly operated. A compliance order may also contain other
requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring
and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants
discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for
compliance established for a Federal pretreatment standard or requirements, nor
does a compliance order release the user of liability from any violation,
including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be
a prerequisite to taking any other action against the user.
      (5)   Cease and Desist. When the Borough or Township Manager finds the
user is violating this Part, the user’s wastewater discharge permit, any order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that
the user’s past violations are likely to recur, the Borough or Township Manager
may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such
violations and directing the user to:
         (a)   Immediately comply with all requirements.
         (b)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventative action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any
other action against the user.
      (6)   Emergency Suspensions. The Borough and Township Managers may
immediately suspend a user’s discharge (after informal notice to the user)
whenever such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The Borough
Manager may also immediately suspend the user’s discharge (after notice and
opportunity to respond) that threatens to interfere with the operation of the
POTW, or which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment.
         (a)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Borough or
Township Manager shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream or endangerment to any individuals. The Borough or
Township Manager shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user
has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Township that the period of
endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings set forth in
Subsection (B)(7) are initiated against the user.
         (b)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any
discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence to the Borough and Township Managers,
prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under Subsection (B)
(3) and Subsection (B)(7).
Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to
any emergency suspension under this Section.
      (7)   Termination of Discharge.
         (a)   The provisions of §
18-856(G) of this Part relating to revocation of permit for violation of
certain conditions of this Part, also apply to any user whether a permit holder
or not. Any user that violates the conditions set forth in §
18-856(G) is subject to discharge termination.
         (b)   Any such user will be notified of the proposed termination of
its discharge and be offered an opportunity show cause under Subsection (B)(3)
of this Section why the proposed action should not be taken.
      C.   Judicial Enforcement Remedies.
      (1)   Injunctive Relief. Whenever a user has violated a pretreatment
standard or requirement or continues to violate the provisions of this Part,
wastewater discharge permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment requirement, the Borough Manager may petition the Court of Common
Pleas of Lehigh County through the Borough Solicitor for the issuance of a
temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels
the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order or other
requirement imposed by this Part on activities of the industrial user. Such
other action as appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief may also be
brought by the Borough and Township. A petition for injunctive relief need not
be filed as a prerequisite to taking any other action against the user.
      (2)   Civil Penalties. Civil penalties may be assessed against any user
who violates any provision of this Part including, but not limited to, any
provision of the pretreatment permit issued under the provisions of this Part.
      (3)   Criminal Prosecution.
         (a)   Any user that willfully or negligently violates any provision of
this Part, any orders or wastewater discharge permits issued hereunder or any
other pretreatment requirements shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 per violation per day
or imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or both.
         (b)   Any user that willfully or negligently introduces any substance
into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least
$1,000 and/or be subject to imprisonment for 90 days. This penalty shall be in
addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage
available under State law.
         (c)   Any user that knowingly makes any false statement or
certification in any application, record, report, plan or other documentation
filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this Part, wastewater
discharge permit or order, or who falsifies, tampers with or knowingly renders
inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this Part shall, upon
conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000 per violation per day
or imprisonment for not more than 90 days.
         (d)   In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be punished by
a fine of not more than $1,000 per violation per day or imprisonment for not
more than 90 days, or both.
(Ord. 396, 9/6/2000, § 357; as amended by Ord. 545, 4/17/2013, § 22)
§ 18-858.   Affirmative Defenses to Discharge Violations.
      A.   Upset.
      (1)   For the purpose of this Section, “upset” means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond a reasonable
control of the industrial user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the
extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance or careless
or improper operation.
      (2)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action taken
by the Borough or Township for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment
standards if the requirements of Subsection (3), are met.
      (3)   An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense
of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating
logs, or other relevant evidence, that:
         (a)   An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause
(s) of the upset.
         (b)   The facility was, at the time, being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with the applicable operation and
maintenance procedures.
         (c)   The industrial user has submitted the following information to
the POTW treatment operator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset, and
if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided
within 5 days:
            (i)   A description of the indirect discharge and a cause of
noncompliance.
            (ii)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue.
            (iii)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      (4)   In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof
      (5)   Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial
determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
      (6)   The industrial user shall control production or all discharges to
the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment
standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the
facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This
requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary
source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
      B.   GeneraUSpecific Prohibitions. An industrial user shall have an
affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for
noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in this Part, if it
can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, alone
or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through
or interference and that either: (i) a local limit exists for each pollutant
discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly
prior to and during the pass through interference; or, (ii) no local limit
exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or
constituents from the user's prior discharge when the Borough was regularly in
compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in
compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
      C.   Bypass.
      (1)   Definitions.
         BYPASS—the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of
an industrial users treatment facility.
         SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE—substantial physical damage to the treatment
facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent
loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the
absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused
by delays in production.
      (2)   An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not
cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it is
also for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses
are not subject to the provisions of Subsections (3) and (4), below.
      (3)   Notice.
         (a)   If an industrial user knows in advance of the bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the POTW, at least 10 days before the date of the
bypass, if possible.
         (b)   An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the POTW within 24
hours from the time the user becomes aware of that bypass. A written submission
shall also be provided within 5 days of the time the industrial user becomes
aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the
bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and
times and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is
expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on a
case-bycase basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
      (4)   Prohibited Bypass; Exceptions.
         (a)   Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take enforcement action
against an industrial user for bypass, unless:
            (i)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury or severe property damage.
            (ii)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as
the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance.
            (iii)   The industrial user submitted notices as required under
Subsection (3) of this Section.
         (b)   The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering
its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three
conditions listed in Subsection (4)(a) of this Section.

(Ord. 516, 6/1/2011; as amended by Ord. 563, 7/2/2014)
§ 18-905.   Food Service Establishment Requirements.
   1.   Grease Trap/Interceptor Requirements. All food service establishments
shall install, operate and maintain an approved type and adequately sized
grease trap/interceptor necessary to maintain compliance with the objectives of
this Part unless subject to an exemption expressly provided in this Part 9. All
grease trap/interceptors must meet the requirements of the Hanover Township
Plumbing Code and construction specifications. [Ord. 563]
   2.   Implementation. All food service establishments which intend to install
a grease trap or interceptor in a new or existing facility, whether required by
this Part 9 or at the discretion of the user, must obtain prior approval from
the Hanover Township Engineer for grease trap/interceptor sizing prior to
submitting plans for a building permit or application for an FSE permit.
   3.   Variance from Grease Interceptor Requirements.
      A.   Grease interceptors required under this Part 9 shall be installed
unless (a) a food service establishment has installed an adequate grease trap
as of the effective date of this Part 9, or (b) the Hanover Township Engineer
determines that the installation of a grease interceptor would not be feasible
and authorizes the installation of an indoor grease trap or other approved
alternate pretreatment technology.
      B.   An FSE may request approval by the Township Engineer of an alternate
grease removal device if a grease interceptor is not feasible. The food service
establishment bears the burden of demonstrating that the installation of a
grease interceptor is not feasible. Such written request shall contain the
following information:
         (1)   Location of sewer main and easement in relation to available
exterior space outside building.
         (2)   Existing plumbing at or in a site that uses common plumbing for
all services at that site.
         (3)   A plan showing the above and any other information required by
the Township Engineer.
      C.   The Township Engineer will determine whether to grant a variance on
the following criteria:
         (1)   Is there is adequate space?
            (a)   Adequate room for installation.
            (b)   Will property lines be an issue.
            (c)   Will proposed trap/interceptor be too close to building
foundation/footing.
         (2)   Is a sewer main accessible?
            (a)   Sewer main located within a workable distance.
            (b)   Depth of sewer main acceptable for proper installation and
pipe slope.
         (3)   Is the site sewer service acceptable?
            (a)   Building sewer lateral accessible.
            (b)   Will current plumbing layout without major re-plumbing
support exterior grease trap/interceptor.
            (c)   Tank location accessible for unhindered maintenance.
      D.   Alternative pretreatment technology includes, but is not limited to,
devices such as a grease trap that are used to trap, separate and hold grease
from wastewater and prevent it from being discharged into the sanitary sewer
collection system. All alternative pretreatment technology must be
appropriately sized and approved by the Hanover Township Engineer.
   4.   Existing Grease Trap. For purposes of subsection (3)(a), above, an
existing grease trap located within an FSE is adequate, if it meets the
following criteria below: [Ord. 563]
      A.   Has a stated rate of not more than 55 gallons per minute nor less
than 20 gallons per minute; and, [Ord. 563]
      B.   Meets the grease trap sizing requirements set forth by Hanover
Township; and, [Ord. 563]
      C.   The FSE has an adequate grease trap/interceptor set-up for the hot
water only pre-rinse wash procedure.
An existing grease trap located within an existing building is not adequate if
it does not meet the above criteria. A properly sized exterior grease
interceptor must be installed for any existing interior grease trap that is not
adequate. If the installation of an exterior grease interceptor is not
feasible, then the use of the hot water only pre-rinse wash procedure and an
adequately sized or additional approved grease trap/interceptor is required.
   5.   Existing FSEs.
      A.   Food service establishments which have been constructed or are under
construction as of the effective date of this Part and do not have grease
traps/interceptors installed or included in building plans shall be exempt from
the requirement to install grease traps and/or interceptors, unless:
         (1)   Plumbing improvements with a building permit valuation of
$10,000 or more are made to the building in which the FSE is located.
         (2)   The Hanover Township Engineer determines the sewer discharge
from the FSE has a reasonable potential to adversely impact the Hanover
Township’s sewer system or the POTW and the FSE has been notified in writing to
install a grease trap/interceptor within the specified period set forth in the
notification letter. [Ord. 563]
   6.   The Township Engineer shall make determinations of grease trap/
interceptor adequacy, need and other determinations required by this Part 9,
based on review of all relevant information regarding grease trap/interceptor
performance, facility site and building plan review and shall require repairs
to, or modification or replacement of such traps as he determines appropriate
in his professional judgment in accordance with the standards set forth or
referenced in this Part 9.
(Ord. 516, 6/1/2011; as amended by Ord. 563, 7/2/2014)
§ 18-906.   Non-Cooking Establishment Requirements.
Grease trap/interceptors may also be required in non-cooking establishments and
other industrial or commercial establishments when they are deemed necessary by
the Hanover Township Engineer for the proper handling of liquid wastes
containing grease. Any non-cooking establishment required to have a grease
trap/interceptor shall be considered an FSE for the purpose of this Part 9.

under process of construction and/or until said road or highway is accepted by
the Township, no permittee will be authorized to enter upon said highway for
the purpose of erecting poles, laying conduits, water, steam, oil, or gas pipes
or sewers, or doing any other work whatsoever which might interfere with the
construction of the road or highway, unless said permittee shall first file
with the Township a duly attested certificate signed by the contractor or other
authority constructing said road or highway, which certificate shall contain
full consent to such proposed operation of said permittee within the lines of
the said road or highway, together with a satisfactory waiver, release, and
quit-claim to the Township of all damages and all defenses whatsoever for
delays by reason of such operations and occupations of said roadway by said
permittee, or from any cause whatsoever resulting by reason of such operation
and occupation, provided that the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply
in case of emergency; in such case the permittee shall procure the written
consent of the Inspector to do such work as may be deemed necessary to correct
the existing emergency conditions.

surface within the Township right-of-way must be repaired immediately with a
temporary two inch (2") depth of bituminous material and shall be maintained
until permanent restoration is made.
   4.   The Township may at its option require the applicant immediately upon
the completion of the backfilling of a trench to permanently replace the base
course and wearing surface, or may within five (5) days from the date of the
completion of the backfilling require the applicant at any time thereafter to
temporarily close up or repair the openings in the pavement until such time as
the pavement surface may be permanently restored, the expense of such temporary
restoration of the surface, as well as the correction of any omissions in the
backfilling to be at the expense of the permittee. The laying of hot-mix
bituminous concrete and Portland cement concrete shall not be permitted between
November 1st and March 1st except by written permission of the Township
Inspector. Street excavations made during the period shall be filled with eight
(8) inches of crushed aggregate base course and surfaced with a temporary
bituminous cold patch material until Spring. At that time, the applicant shall

permittee shall cut back the surface and supporting base as far as may be
deemed necessary by the Township Engineer to afford a good support upon firm
earth or to remove any part of the surface and base which may become damaged by
reason of the said excavation.
   6.   If the Inspector finds that paving surfaces adjacent to the street
opening were damaged where trenches are made parallel to the street, or where a
number of cross trenches are laid in close proximity to one another, or where
the equipment used may cause such damage, he may require a negotiated
contribution from the permittee for the resurfacing in place of patching of
such street if the total area of the proposed patch or probably damaged area
exceeds twenty-five (25) percent of the total pavement surfacing between curb
faces or between concrete gutter edges in any block. Such negotiations shall be
carried on and contributions agreed upon prior to issuance of a permit.
(Ord. 97, 42, 1-14-81)
§ 157. Blasting.
   1.   If, in the construction work, the permittee will (1) be required to use
certain blasting operations in the excavation, the permittee agrees to make,
execute, and deliver to the Township a Bond in the sum stipulated by the

business in Pennsylvania, (2) that the permittee will save harmless the
Township from any damage whatsoever to its subgrade, special subgrade, sub-
base, drainage facilities, road metal, and any other installations or matter
in, under, or upon the highway right-of-way for a period of two years from the
date of the completion of the last work covered by the surety agreement to be
performed under these permits on account of blasting or am; other matter, cause
or thing, incidental to or connected with the blasting operations which may
result in apparent or latent damage as may appear within the period of two (2)
years from the date of the completion of the last work performed.

§ 158. Tunneling Under Improved Streets.
   1.   In case it is necessary to cross under any improved road or highway,
the opening for a pipeline shall be drilled, bored, or driven at a minimum
depth of. three (3) feet below the surface of the road or highway, or the
structure may be placed by tunneling when approved by the Inspector. Trenching
will be authorized by the Inspector, in writing, where boring is not deemed
necessary. When necessary to cross the improved road or highway by tunneling,
the crossing shall be made, except in solid rock formation, under one-half (1/
2) of the improved road width, and the pipe or structure placed and the hole
carefully backfilled with 1:3:6 concrete of a dry consistency thoroughly
tamped, and allowed to stand 24 hours before the traffic is permitted use of
the half of the road. The second half of the tunneling is to be completed in
the same manner, so at least one-half traffic will be maintained over one-half
of the improved road or highway while the second half is being tunneled. In
solid rock formation, the crossing may be made by trenching when approved by
the engineer representing the Township, but not more than one-half (1/2) of the
width of the pavement shall be opened, the structure placed, the trench
backfilled and tamped with an approved mechanical tamper, unless other methods
are approved before disturbing the remaining one-half of the road.
   2.   Openings made for the purpose of placing pipe lines or other structures
under the improved surface by drilling, boring, driving, or tunneling shall be
made at least three (3) feet from the edge of the road metal, unless the
Township and/or Inspector otherwise designate in writing.

four (24) hours in advance of the time at which backfilling will be started.
   2.   The backfilling of the trench shall follow as rapidly as possible with
2A modified stone or screenings and the placing of subsurface structures shall
be completed in such a manner as will conform to the earth shoulder. The method
used to compact shall be a mechanical tamping or vibrating device approved by
the Inspector. In all unimproved streets, the surface of the trenches after
being filled and settled shall be finished in a most workmanlike manner without
needless delay, and shall in every respect be equal in quality, character and
materials, to the street surface existing previous to making the excavation. In
all improved streets, the crown of the surface must conform to the adjacent
street surface until sufficient time has elapsed to warrant the restoration
either temporarily or permanently of the pavement surface. Sackfilling must be
in layers and tamped every 12 inches.

surface within the Township right-of-way must be repaired immediately with a
temporary two inch (2") depth of bituminous material and shall be maintained
until permanent restoration is made.
   4.   The Township may at its option require the applicant immediately upon
the completion of the backfilling of a trench to permanently replace the base
course and wearing surface, or may within five (5) days from the date of the
completion of the backfilling require the applicant at any time thereafter to
temporarily close up or repair the openings in the pavement until such time as
the pavement surface may be permanently restored, the expense of such temporary
restoration of the surface, as well as the correction of any omissions in the
backfilling to be at the expense of the permittee. The laying of hot-mix
bituminous concrete and Portland cement concrete shall not be permitted between
November 1st and March 1st except by written permission of the Townbship
Inspector. Street excavations made during the period shall be filled with eight
(8) inches of crushed aggregate base course and surfaced with a temporary
bituminous cold patch material until spring. At that time, the applicant shall
be required to remove the temporary cold patch and place the final hot-mix
bituminous concrete surface course.
   5.   In the replacement or restoration of permanent roadway surfaces, the

wider on each side than the equipment used.
(Ord. 97, § 2, 1-14-81)
§ 162. Maintenance of Facilities and Indemnity Clause.
After each and every excavation made by the permittee in any road or highway
covered by this permit incidental to the erection, repair, resetting or removal
of any poles, manholes, conduits, water, steam, oil, gas pipes, sewers, or any
other obstructions or construction, said permittee shall under the supervision
and direction of the Township, restore such road to previous condition unless
otherwise provided. So long as said permittee operates and leaves in place such
structures and appliances, in, upon, or along said highway, the permittee shall
maintain and keep in good order and repair, the said structures and appliances.
The permittee covenants and agrees to fully indemnify and save harmless the
Township from all liability for damages or injury occurring to any person or
persons or property at or on such roads through or in consequence of any act or
omission of any contractor, agent, servant, employee, or person engaged or
employed in, about, or upon the said work, by, at the instance, or with the
approval or consent of the permittee, or from the failure of the permittee to
comply with the provisions for maintenance as set forth in these regulations.

§ 163. Driveways, Access Roads, Etc.
   1.   Location and design standards for all modes of access except as

Subdivision and Land Development Regulations, and a street occupancy permit
shall be obtained.
   2.   Location and design standards for all modes of access onto Legislative
Routes shall comply with the current PennDOT Driveway Regulations and a PennDOT
Highway Occupancy Permit shall be obtained.
   3.   With respect to driveways'or other modes of access onto Legislative
Routes, the Township Engineer may make recommendations to PennDOT regarding
traffic safety, storm drainage, etc.
   4.   Driveways from private property onto existing alleys -- whether or not
open to traffic--must be authorized by a Street Occupancy Permit except that no
permit fee shall be charged and such driveways shall not be regulated by Parts
lA and 1B unless otherwise determined by the Inspector.
   5.   Driveways from private property onto privately owned subdivision
streets which are intended to remain private streets in mobile home parks,
industrial parks, schools, apartment projects, shopping centers, etc., must be
authorized by a Street Occupancy Permit except that no Occupancy Deposit shall
be required.
   6.   Existing driveways which do not conform to this Part because of width,
location, grades, etc., shall be brought into compliance at or before the time
that the Township orders high grade street pavement and/or curbs and/or
sidewalks constructed unless the applicant applies for and is granted a
relaxation of these standards.
   7.   The opening of unaccepted paper streets or alleys onto existing streets
must be authorized by a Street Occupancy Permit.
   8.   Location and design standards for private road for motels, shopping

the Zoning Ordinance as Collector and Arterial Streets, will in the future have
both wider cartways and right-of-ways. In some cases, the existing legal right-
of-way width is only 33 feet. It is the intention of the Township Council that
driveways not be authorized on certain of these streets unless the property
owner signs a statement acknowledging that his proposed driveway pavement must
be considered a temporary pavement, a portion or all of which may need to be
replaced when the street is reconstructed and widened. Additionally, this
statement will make it clear that the Township's issuing the driveway permit is
not to be construed as a financial obligation of the Township to reconstruct
the subject's driveway at the time of reconstruction or widening the street.
   10.   The Township in its discretion may make inspections of the
construction of driveways to insure compliance with these regulations.
   11.   The Township Manager, in his discretion, may authorize studies of
traffic, storm drainage, etc., before an Occupancy Permit for a given driveway
is issued.

Hanover Township Standards for Placement of Curbing and Sidewalks.
   2.   No curbing or sidewalk shall be installed without lines and grades
being established by the Township Engineer.
   3.   The Township Zoning Officer is empowered to notify property owners of
the deterioration of existing curbing and/or sidewalk and to order the repair
or replacement as may be deemed necessary.
   4.   Any new or replaced concrete curbing or sidewalks, concrete ramps and/
or crosswalks shall be installed at the property owners expense at locations
determined by the Township Engineer in accordance with Federal Guidelines for
the installation of access ramps for the handicapped. These are provided to
make the .transition from street to sidewalk easily negotiable for persons in
wheelchairs and others who have difficulty making the required step up.
   5.   The property owner shall cause the work to be done in regard to the
construction, reconstruction and repair of sidewalks and/or curbing so that the
Township Engineer shall inspect and approve the forms and rough layout work
prior to the installation and pouring of pavement materials. On the completion
of the permitted work, the Township Engineer shall be notified by the permittee
so that the work may be subject to final inspection and approval. The permit

Township Planning Commission and Township Council;
      J.   A signature block for certification of review of the plan by the
Joint Planning Commission;
      K.   Space shall be left along with lower edge of sheet, in order that
the County Recorder of Deeds may acknowledge receipt and recording of the plan
when it is presented;
      L.   If the Final Plan requires more than one sheet, a key diagram
showing the relative location of the several sections shall be drawn on each
sheet.
   4.   The Final Plan shall be accompanied by the following:
      A.   Plans showing:
         (1)   Location, size, and invert elevation of all sanitary sewer,
water distribution and storm drainage systems and the location of all manholes,
inlets, and culverts;
         (2)   Final profiles, cross-sections, and specifications for proposed
streets, sanitary sewers, water distribution systems, and storm drainage
systems shall each be shown on one or more separate sheets.
      B.   The existing points of natural drainage discharge onto adjacent
property shall not be altered without the written approval of the affected
landowners.
      C.   No stormwater runoff or natural drainage shall be so diverted as to
overload existing drainage systems, or create flooding or the need for
additional drainage structures on other private properties or public lands,
without approved provisions being made by the developer for properly handling
such conditions.
      D.   Storm drainage systems through the subdivision/land development
shall be designed to convey the peak runoff that will occur when all tributary
areas upstream are developed to the extent reasonably projected during the next
20 years. The calculation of this runoff rate shall take into account the land
use and development regulations including runoff controls in effect in the
tributary areas.
      E.   Where a subdivision is traversed by water courses other than
permanent streams, there shall be provided a drainage easement conforming
substantially with the line of such watercourse. The width of the easement
shall be adequate to provide for unimpeded flow of storm runoff based on
calculations made in conformance with §
22-406(4) and to provide a freeboard allowance of 1/2 foot above the design
water surface level. The terms of the easement shall prohibit excavation, the
placing of fill or structures, and any alterations which may adversely affect
the flow of stormwater within any portion of the easement. Also, periodic
cutting of vegetation in all portions of the easement shall be required.
      F.   Drainage facilities that are located on State highway rights-of-way
shall be approved by PennDOT and a letter indicating such approval shall be
directed to the Township Planning Commission.
      G.   All streets shall be designed so as to provide for the discharge of
surface water away from their rights-of-way.
      H.   When it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Township Engineer
that, due to topographic conditions, natural drainage swales on the site cannot
adequately provide for drainage, open channels may be constructed conforming
substantially to the line and grade of such natural drainage swales. Capacities
of open channels shall be calculated using the Manning equation as explained in
Appendix A.
      I.   Storm drainage facilities and appurtenances shall be so designed and
provided as to minimize erosion in watercourse channels and at all points of
discharge.
   5.   Stormwater Detention.
      A.   Stormwater detention facilities shall be used whenever increased
runoff from the land development would overload drainage systems or cause
significant increases in flood levels in any watercourses downstream. This
will be determined by comparing the increase in runoff caused by the land
development with the existing runoff rates and capacity of downstream drainage
systems and watercourse.
      B.   Whenever detention facilities are required under §
22-406(3)(A), facilities will be designed so that the peak runoff rate at all
points of discharge from the site, when developed, will not exceed the peak
runoff rate at each of those points prior to development.
      C.   Where detention facilities are included as part of the storm
drainage system, the following provisions will apply:
         (1)   Detention ponds shall be designed so that they return to normal
conditions within approximately 12 hours after the termination of the storm,
unless the Township Engineer finds that down stream conditions may warrant
other design criteria for stormwater release;
         (2)   The developer shall demonstrate that such ponds are designed,
protected and located to assure that public safety is maximized and health
problems are prevented;
         (3)   The developer shall verify that the operation of the detention
facilities will not aggravate potential downstream peaking conditions;
         (4)   Emergency overflow facilities shall be provided for detention
facilities to handle runoff in excess of design flows;
         (5)   If the lands of the proposed land development will remain in
common ownership, the developer shall provide written assurances to the
Township that the detention ponds will be properly maintained.
   6.   Calculations of Runoff and Design Storm Frequency.
      A.   Storm drainage systems required by this Chapter shall be designed to
provide protection from a 10 to 100 year storm as determined by the Township
Engineer. A 10 year design storm would be appropriate where a storm in excess
of the design storm would have minor impact such as inconvenience to traffic on
local streets. A 25 year design storm would be appropriate where a storm in
excess of the design storm would cause major inconvenience to people and
traffic in high use areas such as business districts and major highways. A 100
year design storm would be appropriate where a storm in excess of the design
storm would cause damage to existing or future structures or their contents.
      B.   Stormwater runoff from watersheds of 200 or less acres shall be
calculated by the rational method as described in Manual No. 37 of the American
Society of Civil Engineers. The rational method of runoff calculation is
explained in
Appendix A. The area within the perimeter of a ground- mounted solar energy
system shall be considered the same as concrete for such calculations. [Ord.
519]
      C.   Stormwater runoff from watersheds of more than 200 acres shall be
calculated using the soil cover complex method developed by the Soil
      Conservation Service or other appropriate method acceptable to the
Township Engineer.
      D.   The Manning equation explained in
Appendix A shall be used in calculating capacities of watercourses and storm
sewers, except culverts which shall be designed using methods acceptable to the
Township Engineer.
      E.   Complete detailed drainage calculations certified by the design
engineer shall be submitted to the Township Engineer.
      F.   Drainage facilities that are located on State Highway rights-of-way
shall be approved by PennDOT and a letter indicating such approval shall be
directed to the Township Planning Commission. Whenever stormwater control
regulations of an “Act 167 - Storm Water Management Plan” that has been adopted
by the ‘Township are more restrictive, the more restrictive provisions of such
plan shall apply. [Ord. 239]
   7.   Improvement Specifications.
      A.   Inlets shall be designed and located to prevent hazardous conditions
for vehicles, bicycles or pedestrians.
      B.   The Township Engineer shall add additional specifications which may
be necessary for spacing and type of inlets and manholes, minimum pipe sizes,
and materials and construction methods.
   8.   Perpetual Maintenance Responsibilities.
      A.   General. All privately owned stormwater management facilities shall
be maintained in the manner in which they were originally approved, and such
facilities shall be continuously operable and able to meet the purpose for
which they were originally designed.
      B.   Types of Facilities. All private detention basins, whether above or
in ground, as well as any piping, outlets, energy dissipaters or other
structures required to be constructed as part of the overall development and to
serve the purpose of detaining or channeling stormwater from the development
into the overall Township or public system shall be regulated by this Part.
      C.   Vegetation. All vegetation shall be kept at a level not to exceed 6
inches in height, and where vegetation is required within the basin it shall
not be allowed to be overrun with weeds and other vegetation not conducive to
the operation of the system. This shall include trees, bushes and other growth
that would hamper the operation of the system.
      D.   Fencing. All fencing required by the approved plans of the design of
the detention basin shall be maintained in good repair so as to preclude access
to the interior, except that provisions shall be made for authorized access for
necessary and required maintenance. Any damaged, falling or otherwise
deteriorated fencing shall be replaced.
      E.   Interior Liner. The required interior lining of all detention basins
must be maintained pursuant to original impervious design to provide maximum
effectiveness of the operation of the system.
      F.   Inspections. All stormwater management facilities will be subject to
an annual inspection by the Township and any violation noted shall be required
to be corrected within 10 days of written notification of same. If corrections
are necessary, the Township reserves the right of final approval of the
proposed corrections. The cost for these annual inspections and the review and
inspection of required corrections, if necessary, shall be borne fully by the
facility owner and shall be in accordance with the adopted Township fee
schedule in effect at that time.
      G.   Application. The maintenance requirements of this Part shall apply
to all privately owned stormwater management facilities regardless of approval
and installation date.

separation of residential development from arterial streets or to overcome
specific disadvantages of topography or other natural features of the proposed
subdivision tract.
      C.   All residential reverse frontage lots shall have a rear yard with a
minimum depth of 75 feet, measured along the shortest distance from the
proposed dwelling unit to the ultimate right-of-way and shall, within such rear
yard and immediately adjacent to the right-of-way, have a planting screen
easement of at least 10 feet in width, across which there shall be no right of
access.
   7.   Lot Access.
      A.   Residential lots having direct access to an arterial street shall be
avoided whenever possible. Where direct access to an arterial street cannot be

line.
         (3)   Access roads and driveways for large volume traffic generators
shall be of a width acceptable to the Township Engineer and Township Council,
or to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, as the case may require.
      D.   To provide save and convenient ingress and egress, access road and
driveway entrances shall be rounded at the following minimum radii:
         (1)   Access road entrances for multi-family residential developments,
mobile home parks, and most non-residential subdivisions shall be rounded at a
minimum radius of 10 feet; or at a radius determined by the Township Engineer,
or the PennDOT where such approval is required for large traffic generators.
         (2)   Driveway entrances for single family residential subdivision
shall be rounded at a minimum radius of 5 feet.
      E.   Access road grades or driveway grades shall not exceed the following
grades within 50 feet of intersection with the street:

(Ord. 52, Art. S-420, 3/8/78)
§ 22-403. Street Design Standards.
   1.   General Requirements.
      A.   Proposed streets shall be properly related to the road and highway
plans of the state, county, and the Township. Streets shall be designed to
provide adequate vehicular access to all lots or parcels and with regard for
topographical conditions, projected volumes of traffic, and further subdivision
possibilities in the area.
      B.   The street system of a proposed subdivision or land development
shall be designed to create a hierarchy of street functions which includes
collector and local streets.
      C.   The street system of a proposed subdivision or land development
shall be designed so as to minimize street intersections and pedestrian-
vehicular conflict points.
      D.   Proposed local streets shall be designed so as to discourage through
traffic and excessive speeds. However, the developer shall give adequate
consideration to provision for the extension and continuation of arterial and
collector streets into and from adjoining properties.
      E.   Where, in the opinion of the Township Planning Commission, it is
desirable to provide for street access to adjoining property, streets shall be
extended by dedication to the boundary of such property. Distances between
access points to adjoining property shall be based on Block Length Standards
set forth in § 22-402(2).
      F.   Where a subdivision abuts an existing street of improper width or
alignment, the Township Council may require the dedication of land sufficient
to widen the street or correct the alignment.
      G.   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
arterial traffic street, the 'Township may require marginal access streets,
reverse frontage lots, or other such treatment as will provide protection for
abutting properties, reduction in the number of intersections with the arterial
street, and separation of local and through traffic.
      H.   Private streets (streets not to be offered for dedication) may be
approved by the Township only if they meet the street design and improvement
standards set forth in this Chapter and if such private streets are acceptable
to the Township Council.
      I.   If the lots in the development are large enough for resubdivision,
or if a portion of the tract is not subdivided, suitable access and street
openings for such future development shall be provided.
   2.   Street Right-of-Way and Cartway Widths.
      A.   Street right-of-way and cartway widths in proposed subdivisions
shall conform to the general standards as follows:

                               curbing.
 
      B.   The general standards set forth in § 22-403(2)(A) may be modified by
the Township Planning Commission upon the recommendation of the Township
Engineer or the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation when an analysis of
proposed development densities, provisions for off-street parking, and
projected traffic volumes indicate a need for such modification. The burden of
proof shall be upon the developer to justify the adequacy of rights-of-way or
cartway widths which are less than those set forth in § 22-403(2)(A).
      C.   The rights-of-way shall be graded to their full width as deemed
necessary by the Township Council to provide suitable finished grades to the
tolerances herein specified.
   3.   Horizontal Curves.
      A.   Whenever street centerlines are deflected more than 5° within 500
feet, connection shall be made by horizontal curves.

Such leveling areas shall have a minimum length of 75 feet (measured from the
intersection of the centerlines), within which no grade shall exceed a maximum
of 4%.
      D.   Cul-de-sac Grade. Maximum grades within 100 feet of the outer
perimeter of a cul-de-sac bulb shall not exceed 4% measured along the
centerline of the street.
      E.   Minimum Radius, Maximum Grade. A combination of minimum radius
horizontal curves and maximum grades will not be approved.
   5.   Vertical Curves.
      A.   Vertical curves shall be used in changes of grade exceeding 1%.
      B.   Vertical curves shall be designed to produce the following minimum
sight distances:

curb arcs at intersections.
      F.   Depressed Curb. Whenever curbs are to be constructed across private
driveways within residential areas or driveway approaches of ingress or egress
from abutting industrial or commercial properties, the curb shall be depressed
to the driveway surface.
The maximum longitudinal length of depressed curb for private driveway
crossings shall be 20 feet and the maximum longitudinal length for driveway
crossings in commercial or industrial areas shall be 35 feet. Depressed curbs
shall conform to the dimensions and details of the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation Form 408 Specifications and Roadway Construction Standards, as
amended.
In major traffic generators where extra width is required the curb shall be
eliminated, and the configuration [made] in conformance with PennDOT Standards
for Commercial or Industrial Driveways.
      G.   Clear sight triangles shall be provided at all street intersections.
Within such triangles no object greater than 2 1/2 feet in height and no other
object that would obscure the vision of the motorist shall be permitted. Such
triangles shall be established from a distance of:
         (1)   Seventy-five feet from the point of intersection of the
centerlines of two streets where both are local streets;
         (2)   One hundred feet from the point of intersection of the
centerlines of two streets where one is a collector street;
         (3)   One hundred fifty feet from the point of intersection of the
centerlines of two streets where one is an arterial street.
      H.   Wherever a portion of the line of such triangles occurs within the
proposed building setback line, such portion shall be shown on the Final Plan
of the subdivision, and shall be considered a building setback line.
   7.   Cul-de-sacs.
      A.   Dead-end streets are prohibited unless designed as cul-de-sac
streets or designed for future access to adjoining properties.
      B.   Any dead-end street which is constructed for future access to an
adjoining property or because of authorized stage development, and which is
open to traffic and exceeds 200 feet in length, shall be provided with a
temporary, all-weather turning circle. The turning circle shall be completely
within the boundaries of the subdivision and the use of the turnaround shall be
guaranteed to the public until such time as the street is extended.
      C.   Cul-de-sac streets, permanently designed as such, shall not exceed
1,000 feet in length or shall not furnish access to more than 25 dwelling
units. In the case of the industrial parks, a cul-de-sac shall not furnish
access to more than 100 employees. Exemptions from these requirements may be
granted by the Township Council upon recommendation by the Township Engineer
where necessary due to unique characteristics of the site.
      D.   All cul-de-sac streets, whether permanently or temporarily designed
as such, shall be provided at the closed end with a fully paved turning circle.
The turning circle may be offset to the left but turnarounds offset to the
right shall be discouraged.
         (1)   If parking will be prohibited on the turning circle, the minimum
radius of the right-of-way line shall be 50 feet.
         (2)   If parking will be permitted on the turning circle, the minimum
radius to the pavement edge or curb line shall be 48 feet, and the minimum
radius of the right-of-way line shall be 60 feet.
   8.   Half Streets and Alleys.
      A.   The dedication of new half streets at the perimeter of a new
subdivision is prohibited.
      B.   The subdivider shall provide the entire required right-of-way, or as

(Ord. 52, Art. S-430, 3/8/78)
§ 22-404. Sanitary Sewage Disposal.
   1.   The developer shall provide the most effective type of sanitary sewage
disposal consistent with the Township's official plan for sewage facilities
prepared in accordance with the Pennsylvania Sewage Facilities Act (Act 537)
and Chapter 71 of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources
Regulations.
   2.   Connection to a public sanitary sewer system shall be required where
such a system is proposed by the Township's official plan for sewage
facilities, can feasibly be provided to the proposed subdivision tract, and
where such a system can adequately fulfill the sewage disposal needs of the
subdivision or land development.
   3.   Where a public sanitary sewer system is not yet accessible to the site
but is planned for extension within a 5 year period, the developer shall
install sanitary sewer lines within the subdivision boundary to the point where
the future connection to a public sewer system will be made. Lateral
connections shall be constructed for all lots. Connections shall be available
in the structures so as to allow the switch from the use of the on-lot systems
to the public system. Such sewer systems shall be capped until ready for use.
On-lot disposal facilities shall be provided for interim use. Required lot
sizes for on-lot disposal systems shall be provided.
   4.   Where a private centralized sanitary sewer system is proposed by the
developer, the Township Council may revise the official plan for sewage
facilities, by resolution indicating that the Township has approved the system
concept.
   5.   In subdivision/land developments where neither connection to a public
sewage system nor a private centralized sewage system is contemplated, on-lot
sewage disposal systems shall be provided in accordance with the Pennsylvania
Sewage Facilities Act, Chapter 73 of DER Regulations and the requirements of
the Township Sewage Enforcement Officer.
   6.   Sanitary sewerage systems shall be located and/or designed to minimize
flood damage and to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the
system or discharges from the system into flood waters.
   7.   On-lot sewage disposal systems shall be located and/or designed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
(Ord. 52, Art. S-440, 3/8/78)
§ 22-405. Water Supply and Distribution Systems.
   1.   The developer shall provide a water supply and distribution system to
service the proposed subdivision through one of the following methods:
      A.   Connection shall be made to a public water supply system where such
a system can feasibly be provided to the proposed subdivision tract and where
the capacity of such a system can adequately fulfill the water supply demands
of the proposed subdivision. A distribution system shall be designed to furnish
an adequate supply of water to each lot. The developer shall present evidence
that the subdivision or development is to be supplied by a certificated public
utility, a bone fida cooperative association of lot owners, or by a municipal
corporation, authority or utility. A copy of a Certificate of Public
Convenience from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission or an application
for such certificate, a cooperative agreement or a commitment or agreement to
serve the area in question, whichever is appropriate, shall be submitted with
the final plan. [Ord. 270]
      B.   Where a public water supply system is planned to serve the proposed
subdivision area within 10 years, a centralized water system will be provided
by the developer where the subdivision involves twenty or more dwelling units
unless the average residential lot size is one acre or larger. Whenever such a
system is provided, the water distribution lines should be dedicated to the
appropriate public authority and the authority will acquire other parts of the
water supply system such as wells, pumps and storage tanks that can be
integrated into the public water system. This will take place after the
improvements are completed so that the system can be operated by the public
authority. A copy of the approval of such a system by the appropriate public
authority shall be submitted with the Final Plan. Also, such a system shall be
designed and constructed in a manner that would permit adequate connection to a
public water supply system in the future. Design and construction standards for
centralized water supply systems are set forth in
Appendix A.
      C.   Where a public water supply is not proposed within 10 years in the
area of the proposed subdivision and where the average residential lot size is
to be less than one acre, a centralized water system will be provided by the
developer unless the subdivision involves less than twenty dwelling units which
may be provided for otherwise. Design and construction standards for
centralized water supply systems are set forth in
Appendix A.
      D.   All centralized water systems that remain privately owned shall be
organized in a manner as to fall within the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania
Public Utility Commission.
      E.   Water supply systems shall be located and/or designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters so as to meet Federal Insurance
Administration provisions.

   1.   Storm drainage systems shall be provided in order to:
      A.   Permit unimpeded flow of natural water course except as modified by
stormwater detention facilities required by § 22-406(3) or open channels
pursuant to § 22-406(2)(H);
      B.   Ensure adequate drainage of all low points along the line of
streets;
      C.   Intercept stormwater runoff along streets at intervals related to
the extent and grade of the area drained;
      D.   Provide positive drainage away from on-site sewage disposal systems;
      E.   Take surface water from the bottom of vertical grades, lead water
from springs and avoid excessive use of cross-gutters at street intersections
and elsewhere;
      F.   Prevent overloading of drainage systems and watercourses downstream
as a result of increased rate or runoff caused by the proposed development.
   2.   General Requirements.
      A.   A site drainage plan for the proposed subdivision tract shall be
prepared which illustrates the following information:
         (1)   Mapping of the watershed area or areas in which the proposed
subdivision is located;
         (2)   Calculations of runoff for all points of runoff concentration
within the site;
         (3)   Complete drainage systems for the subdivision. All existing
drainage features which are to be incorporated in the design shall be so
identified. If the subdivision is to be developed in stages, a general drainage
plan for the entire subdivision shall be presented with the first stage and
appropriate development stages for the drainage system shall be indicated.
      B.   The existing points of natural drainage discharge onto adjacent
property shall not be altered without the written approval of the affected
landowners.
      C.   No stormwater runoff or natural drainage shall be so diverted as to
overload existing drainage systems, or create flooding or the need for
additional drainage structures on other private properties or public lands,
without approved provisions being made by the developer for properly handling
such conditions.
      D.   Storm drainage systems through the subdivision/land development
shall be designed to convey the peak runoff that will occur when all tributary
areas upstream are developed to the extent reasonably projected during the next
20 years. The calculation of this runoff rate shall take into account the land
use and development regulations including runoff controls in effect in the
tributary areas.
      E.   Where a subdivision is traversed by water courses other than
permanent streams, there shall be provided a drainage easement conforming
substantially with the line of such watercourse. The width of the easement
shall be adequate to provide for unimpeded flow of storm runoff based on
calculations made in conformance with § 22-406(4) and to provide a freeboard
allowance of 1/2 foot above the design water surface level. The terms of the
easement shall prohibit excavation, the placing of fill or structures, and any
alterations which may adversely affect the flow of stormwater within any
portion of the easement. Also, periodic cutting of vegetation in all portions
of the easement shall be required.
      F.   Drainage facilities that are located on State highway rights-of-way
shall be approved by PennDOT and a letter indicating such approval shall be
directed to the Township Planning Commission.
      G.   All streets shall be designed so as to provide for the discharge of
surface water away from their rights-of-way.
      H.   When it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Township Engineer
that, due to topographic conditions, natural drainage swales on the site cannot
adequately provide for drainage, open channels may be constructed conforming
substantially to the line and grade of such natural drainage swales. Capacities
of open channels shall be calculated using the Manning equation as explained in
Appendix A.
Storm drainage facilities and appurtenances shall be so designed and provided
as to minimize erosion in watercourse channels and at all points of discharge.
   3.   Stormwater Detention.
      A.   Stormwater detention facilities shall be used whenever increased
runoff from the land development would overload drainage systems or cause
significant increases in flood levels in any watercourses downstream. This will
be determined by comparing the increase in runoff caused by the land
development with the existing runoff rates and capacity of downstream drainage
systems and watercourse.
      B.   Whenever detention facilities are required under § 22-406(3)(A),
facilities will be designed so that the peak runoff rate at all points of
discharge from the site, when developed, will not exceed the peak runoff rate
at each of those points prior to development.
      C.   Where detention facilities are included as part of the storm
drainage system, the following provisions will apply:
         (1)   Detention ponds shall be designed so that they return to normal
conditions within approximately 12 hours after the termination of the storm,
unless the Township Engineer finds that down stream conditions may warrant
other design criteria for stormwater release;
         (2)   The developer shall demonstrate that such ponds are designed,
protected and located to assure that public safety is maximized and health
problems are prevented;
         (3)   The developer shall verify that the operation of the detention
facilities will not aggravate potential downstream peaking conditions;
         (4)   Emergency overflow facilities shall be provided for detention
facilities to handle runoff in excess of design flows;
         (5)   If the lands of the proposed land development will remain in
common ownership, the developer shall provide written assurances to the
Township that the detention ponds will be properly maintained.
   4.   Calculations of Runoff and Design Storm Frequency.
      A.   Storm drainage systems required by this Chapter shall be designed to
provide protection from a 10 to 100 year storm as determined by the Township
Engineer. A 10 year design storm would be appropriate where a storm in excess
of the design storm would have minor impact such as inconvenience to traffic on
local streets. A 25 year design storm would be appropriate where a storm in
excess of the design storm would cause major inconvenience to people and
traffic in high use areas such as business districts and major highways. A 100
year design storm would be appropriate where a storm in excess of the design
storm would cause damage to existing or future structures or their contents.
      B.   Stormwater runoff from watersheds of 200 or less acres shall be
calculated by the rational method as described in Manual No. 37 of the American
Society of Civil Engineers. The rational method of runoff calculation is
explained in
Appendix A.
      C.   Stormwater runoff from watersheds of more than 200 acres shall be
calculated using the soil cover complex method developed by the Soil
Conservation Service or other appropriate method acceptable to the Township
Engineer.
      D.   The Manning equation explained in
Appendix A shall be used in calculating capacities of watercourses and storm
sewers, except culverts which shall be designed using methods acceptable to the
Township Engineer.
      E.   Complete detailed drainage calculations certified by the design
engineer shall be submitted to the Township Engineer.
      F.   Drainage facilities that are located on State Highway rights-of-way
shall be approved by PennDOT and a letter indicating such approval shall be
directed to the Township Planning Commission. Whenever storm water control
regulations of an "Act 167 - Storm Water Management Plan" that has been adopted
by the 'Township are more restrictive, the more restrictive provisions of such
plan shall apply. [Ord. 239]
   5.   Improvement Specifications.
      A.   Inlets shall be designed and located to prevent hazardous conditions
for vehicles, bicycles or pedestrians.
      B.   The Township Engineer shall add additional specifications which may
be necessary for spacing and type of inlets and manholes, minimum pipe sizes,
and materials and construction methods.
   6.   Perpetual Maintenance Responsibilities.
      A.   General. All privately owned stormwater management facilities shall
be maintained in the manner in which they were originally approved, and such
facilities shall be continuously operable and able to meet the purpose for
which they were originally designed.
      B.   Types of Facilities. All private detention basins, whether above or
in ground, as well as any piping, outlets, energy dissipaters or other
structures required to be constructed as part of the overall development and to
serve the purpose of detaining or channeling stormwater from the development
into the overall Township or public system shall be regulated by this Part.
      C.   Vegetation. All vegetation shall be kept at a level not to exceed 6
inches in height, and where vegetation is required within the basin it shall
not be allowed to be overrun with weeds and other vegetation not conducive to
the operation of the system. This shall include trees, bushes and other growth
that would hamper the operation of the system.
      D.   Fencing. All fencing required by the approved plans of the design of
the detention basin shall be maintained in good repair so as to preclude access
to the interior, except that provisions shall be made for authorized access for
necessary and required maintenance. Any damaged, falling or otherwise
deteriorated fencing shall be replaced.
      E.   Interior Liner. The required interior lining of all detention basins
must be maintained pursuant to original impervious design to provide maximum
effectiveness of the operation of the system.
      F.   Inspections. All stormwater management facilities will be subject to
an annual inspection by the Township and any violation noted shall be required
to be corrected within 10 days of written notification of same. If corrections
are necessary, the Township reserves the right of final approval of the
proposed corrections. The cost for these annual inspections and the review and
inspection of required corrections, if necessary, shall be borne fully by the
facility owner and shall be in accordance with the adopted Township fee
schedule in effect at that time.
      G.   Application. The maintenance requirements of this Part shall apply
to all privately owned stormwater management facilities regardless of approval
and installation date.

prevent accelerated erosion and the resulting sedimentation.
      B.   No changes shall be made in the contour of the land; no grading,
excavating, removal or destruction of the topsoil, trees or other vegetative
cover of the land shall be commenced until a plan setting forth erosion and
sedimentation control measures for the site has been developed.
      C.   The soil erosion and sedimentation control plan and measures used to
control erosion and sedimentation shall meet the standards and specifications
set forth in the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources Soil
Erosion and Sedimentation Control Manual and Chapter 102 of the Rules and
Regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources.
      D.   All erosion and sedimentation control plans shall be submitted with
the final plan as set forth in §
22-301(6)(D) of this Chapter.
      E.   Where the earthmoving activity affects 25 acres or more, the soil
erosion and sedimentation control plan must be submitted to the County
Conservation District, together with an application permit for an earthmoving
permit for review. An earthmoving permit must be granted by DER.
      F.   Where the earthmoving activity affects less than 25 acres, the
Township requires submission of the erosion and sedimentation control plan to
the County Conservation District and to the Township Engineer for review and
recommendations.
   2.   Natural Feature Preservation.
      A.   The design and development of all subdivisions and land developments
shall preserve, whenever possible, natural features which will aid in providing
adequate open space for recreation and conditions generally favorable to the
health, safety, and welfare of the residents. Some of these natural features
are the natural terrain of the site, woodland areas, large trees, natural
watercourses and bodies of water, wetlands, rock outcropping, and scenic views.
More detailed standards concerning the preservation of specific natural
features are set forth in the following sections.
      B.   Flood Plain Regulation.
         (1)   A map illustrating flood elevations for the tract for a 100-year
flood, where applicable, shall be submitted as part of the predevelopment
review materials as set forth in §
22-300. The flood elevation map shall be based on the Township flood insurance
rate map (FIRM). When not available, the map shall be based on estimated 100-
year flood elevations or estimated areas subject to flooding based on best
available data. All alluvial soil areas as shown in the Soil Survey for Lehigh
County which are located within the Township shall be considered as floodplain
area.
         (2)   A developer shall adhere to the following standards within areas
designed as regulatory floodways and flood fringe areas on the flood elevation
map.
            (a)   No buildings are to be constructed in regulatory floodways.
Other encroachments may be permitted provided that the encroachment will not
cause any increase in the 100-year flood elevation at any point. Consideration
of the effects of a proposed use shall be based on a reasonable assumption that
there will be an equal degree of encroachment extending for a significant reach
on both sides of the stream.
            (b)   Structures may be permitted in flood fringe areas provided
that the lowest floor including basement is elevated at least one foot above
the 100-year flood elevation and that the proposed improvements will not
increase the water surface elevation of the 100-year flood by more than one
foot at any point. The lowest floor of non-residential structures may be
constructed below the 100-year flood elevation provided that below this
elevation the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to
the passage of water and is designed with structural components having the
capability of resisting forces caused by floodwaters.
      C.   Lake, Stream, and River Frontage Preservation.
         (1)   Lake, stream, and river frontage shall be preserved as open
space whenever possible. This area may be credited toward the open space
requirement set forth in §

2 feet above grade) shall not be removed unless they are located within the
proposed cartway or sidewalk portion of a street right-of-way, or within 15
feet of the foundation area of a new building. Areas in which trees are
retained shall remain at original grade level and undisturbed wherever
possible.
         (2)   Where no existing trees are retained along street rights-of-way,
trees shall be planted at intervals of between 50 and 100 feet but in no
instance shall there be less than one tree per lot.
Trees shall not be retained or planted within 3 feet of the street curb or the
sidewalk. Trees may be retained or planted between the street curb and the
sidewalk if there is a minimum distance of 6 feet.
         (3)   A landscape plan shall be drawn for all commercial, industrial,
planned residential, mobile home park, and multi-family developments. The plan
shall show existing and proposed vegetative cover.
         (4)   The Landscape Plan shall include trees in addition to those
required along the street rights-of-way. The following standards are to be used
as a guide to the number, not the spacing or location, of additional trees
required.
            (a)   One tree per dwelling unit;
            (b)   One tree per 50 linear feet of newly constructed street.
      E.   Topography.
         (1)   The natural terrain of the proposed subdivision tract will be
retained wherever possible with cut and fill operations being kept to a
minimum. Areas with slopes greater than 15% shall generally not be planned for
development. If such land is planned for development, the natural slope of the
building site or sites shall be 15% or less.
      F.   Topsoil Protection. Topsoil shall not be removed from the
development site or used as fill. Topsoil shall be removed from the areas of
construction and stored separately. The topsoil shall be stabilized to minimize
erosion during storage. Upon completion of the construction, topsoil must be
uniformly redistributed on the site.
   3.   Open Space and Recreation Areas. The open space and recreation needs of
subdivisions and land developments shall be met as follows:
      A.   Open Space.
         (1)   Utility and storm water management easements, buffer zones,
areas within the 500 year floodplain and areas which are otherwise unsuitable
for development may be designated as open space. Some of this land may be
dedicated to the Township subject to the approval of the Township Council. If
floodplain is dedicated for open space uses, a credit of 1 square foot per each
2 square feet of floodplain area dedicated shall be applied to the recreation
area dedication requirements of §
22-409(3)(B). The credit may also be applied to the cash in lieu of recreation
land dedication as per §
22-409(3)(B)(3) at the above-cited ratio. In no case shall the floodplain open
space dedication satisfy more than 1/2 of the recreation area dedication
criteria. In no case shall the minimum area dedicated for recreation land be
less than 2 acres, exclusive of the floodplain open space land. The Township
Council shall consider the open space dedication offer relative to the
following factors:

subject to the approval of the Township Council, as follows:
            (a)   The cash in lieu shall be $1,200 per lot or dwelling unit
(the estimated value of 1,000 square feet of recreation land), or such other
amount that the Township Council may adopt by ordinance as shall be in effect
at the time of payment.
            (b)   The use of the monies shall be restricted to the purchase of
lands for recreation or open space accessible to the subdivision or land
development, the improvement of said areas, or other related capital
expenditures.
            (c)   The monies shall be deposited in a separate trust account set
up for this purpose by the Township Council.
            (d)   Cash in lieu of recreation land dedication shall be deemed as
an improvement subject to the provisions of this Part and following of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
            (e)   For each residential subdivision, there shall be a one lot
exemption for the cash in lieu of recreation land requirement.
      D.   Where cash in lieu of open space dedication is required the amount
of such fee shall be based upon the fair market value of the amount of land
which would otherwise be required to be dedicated in accordance with the
standards set forth in §
22-409(3)(A).
      E.   Fair market value shall be determined at the time the Final
Subdivision or Land Development Plan is submitted to the municipality and in
accordance with the following:
         (1)   The fair market value shall be determined by the Township
Council as based upon current appraisals; or
         (2)   If the developer objects to such amount of evaluation he may, at
his expense, obtain an appraisal of the property by a qualified real estate
appraiser approved by the Township Council, which appraisal may be accepted by

12/1989; and by Ord. 440, 9/17/2003)
§ 22-502. Improvements Guarantee Procedure.
   1.   Before the Township Council approves any Final Plan and as prerequisite
for approval, the developer shall execute a written agreement prepared by the
Township attorney to construct, install, and/or dedicate, as appropriate, all
improvements required by this Chapter and deliver to the Township Council for
its approval, a performance guarantee in the amount of 110% of the cost of all
improvements required by this Chapter, as estimated as of 90 days following the
date scheduled for completion by the developer, in a form and with such
security as is recommended by the Township attorney, guaranteeing the
construction and installation of all such improvements within a stated period
which shall not be longer that 1 year from the date of Final Subdivision
Approval. Upon written application in a form approved by the Township attorney,
signed by the developer and all parties whose agreement is necessary to
continue the security for the performance guarantee in effect during the
extended term, the Township Council may, at its discretion, extend said period
by not more than 3 additional years, or when the improvements have been
partially completed, reduce proportionately the amount of the performance
guarantee, by formal resolution. Annually, the Township may adjust the amount
of financial security by comparing the actual cost of the improvements required
by this Chapter which had been completed and the estimated cost for completion
of the remaining improvements as of the expiration of the ninetieth day after
either the original date scheduled for completion or a rescheduled date of
completion. Subsequent to said adjustment, the Township may require the
developer to post additional security in order to assure that the financial
security equals the said 110%. In the event of default under a performance
guarantee, the proceeds of the performance guarantee received by the Township
shall be used to construct and install the improvements. [Ord. 270]
   2.   Before the Township Council approves any Final Plan and as a
prerequisite for approval, the developer shall deliver to the Township Council,
for its approval, a maintenance guarantee in an amount of not less than 15% of
the actual cost of all improvements required by this Chapter, guaranteeing that
the developer shall maintain all such improvements in good condition for a
period of 18 months after completion of construction and installation of all
such improvements and approval of all such improvements by the Township
Council. [Ord. 270]
   3.   The amount of financial security shall be based upon an estimate of the
cost of completion of the required improvements, submitted by an applicant or
developer and prepared by a professional engineer licensed as such in this
Commonwealth and certified by such engineer to be a fair and reasonable
estimate of such cost. The Township, upon the execution recommendation of the
Township engineer, may refuse to accept such estimate for good cause shown. If
the applicant or developer and the Township are unable to agree upon an
estimate, then the estimate shall be recalculated and recertified by another
professional engineer licensed as such in this Commonwealth and chosen mutually
by the Township and the applicant or developer. The estimate certified by the
third engineer shall be presumed fair and reasonable, and shall be the final
estimate. In the event that a third engineer is so chosen, fees for the
services of said engineer shall be paid equally by the Township and the
applicant or developer. (Ord. 270]

§ 22-503. Approval of Improvements and Release of Performance Guarantee by the
Township Council.
   1.   When the developer has installed or constructed all required
improvements as set forth in §
22-501, the developer shall notify the Township Council, in writing, by
certified or registered mail, of the completion of the aforesaid improvements
and shall send a copy thereof to the Township Engineer. The Township Council
shall, within 10 days after receipt of such notice, direct and authorize the
Township Engineer to inspect all of the aforesaid improvements. The Township
Engineer shall, thereupon, file a report, in writing, with the Township Council
and shall promptly mail a copy of the same to the developer by certified or
registered mail. The report shall be made and mailed within 30 days after
receipt by the Township Engineer of the aforesaid authorization from the
Township Council; said report shall be detailed and shall recommend approval or
rejection of said improvements, either in whole or in part, and if said
improvements, or any portion thereof, shall not be recommended for approval by
the Township Engineer, said report shall contain a statement of reasons for
such nonapproval or rejection.
   2.   The Township Council shall notify the developer, in writing, by
certified or registered mail, of its action with relation thereto.
   3.   If the Township Council or the Township Engineer fails to comply with
the time limitation provisions contained herein, all improvements will be
deemed to have been approved and the developer shall be released from all
liability, pursuant to its performance guarantee.
   4.   If any portion of the said improvements shall not be approved or shall
be rejected by the Township Council, the developer shall proceed to complete
the same and, upon completion, the same procedure of notification as outlined
herein, shall be followed.
   5.   Nothing herein, however, shall be construed in limitation of the
developer's right to contest or question by legal proceedings or otherwise, any
determination of the Township Council or the Township Engineer.
   6.   In the event that any improvements which may be required have not been
installed as provided in this Chapter or in accord with the Final Plan, the
Township Council is hereby granted the power to enforce any corporate bond, or
other security by appropriate legal and equitable remedies.
If proceeds of such bond, or other security are insufficient to pay the cost of
installation or of making repairs or corrections to all the improvements
covered by said security, the Township Council may, at its option, install part
of such improvements in all or part of the subdivision or land development and
may institute appropriate legal or equitable action to recover the monies
necessary to complete the remainder of the improvements. All of the proceeds,
whether resulting from the security or from any legal or equitable action
brought against the developer, or both, shall be used solely for the
installation of the improvements covered by such security, and not for any
other Township purpose.

to the time of violation without regard as to whether such current owner had
actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
         (4)   The vendee or lessee of the current owner of record who acquired
the property subsequent to the time of violation without regard as to whether
such vendee or lessee had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.

of any such real property, the Township may require compliance with the
conditions that would have been applicable to the property at the time the
applicant acquired an interest in such real property.
   2.   Penalties.

development, whether by reference to or by other use of a plan of such
subdivision or land development or otherwise, or erect any building thereon,

violation, unless the district justice determining that there has been a
violation further determines that there was good faith basis for the person,
partnership or corporation violating the ordinance to have believed that there
was no such violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have been only
one such violation until the fifth day following the date of the determination
of a violation by the district justice and thereafter each day that a violation
continues shall constitute a separate violation.

            b.   Ductile iron pipe (cement lined)
            c.   Steel pipe (for large size mains)
            d.   Reinforced concrete pipe (for large size mains)
         2.   Main Sizes
            Water distribution mains shall be a minimum of 6 inches inside
diameter laid out in a well-gridded system. Whenever fire protection capability
is provided, main sizes shall be adequate so the system can meet the water
quantity and pressure standards in Sections
II-A and
II-C of this appendix. Supply mains not adequate for fire-fighting shall not be
connected to fire hydrants and can only be considered for use as special water
service lines.
         3.   Water Pressure
            A minimum static pressure during peak hourly flow of 50 pounds per
square inch is desirable, but the minimum of 20 pounds per square inch should
exist at any point in the system during periods of fire flow.
         4.   Customer Connections
            a.   All service connections from the main to a single dwelling
unit shall be a minimum of 1 inch ID. The diameter of service connections to
multiple units shall meet the approval of the municipal engineer.
            b.   Customer service connections shall be one of the approved
materials for mains. Heavy wall copper may be used for service connections
where soils are not permitted or subject to acidic ground drainage waters.
            c.   A curb stop shall be furnished for each customer service
connection.
            d.   Cross connections - A cross connection is any physical
connection, direct or indirect, which provided a potential opportunity for
nonpotable water to enter a conduit, pipe or receptacle containing potable
water. Such cross connections are prohibited.
         5.   Leakage Test
            a.   No installation shall be approved until the leakage is less
than the number of gallons per hour as determined in the formula:
               L=   ND √ P
                   3700
         where:
         L = allowable leakage in gallons per hour.
         N = number of joints in the length of pipe tested.
         D = nominal diameter of the pipe in inches.
         P = the average test pressure during test.
            b.   Leakage tests are conducted by measuring the amount of water
which enters the test section under normal working pressures for a period of at
least 2 hours.
      E.   Water Storage and Pumping Stations
         1.   Storage for finished water should be provided as an integral part
of each water supply system. Standards set forth in Part 14 of the Public Water
Supply Manual - Tanks, Standpipes, and Pressure Tanks, shall be used in
designing water storage systems. Equipment selected shall have been
manufactured in conformance with the latest standards and specifications issued
by the American Water Works Association.
         2.   Pumping stations within centralized water systems shall comply
with standards and specifications set forth in Part 13 of the Pa. DER Public
Water Supply Manual
      F.   Well Construction and Location
         1.   Well construction shall take place according to the standards set
forth in Part 3 of the Pa. DER Public Water Supply Manual.
         2.   The centralized water system well course shall be centrally
located within an open space water protection zone a minimum of 1 acre in size.
No structures other than water system pumping stations, standpipes, etc. shall
be located within the protected zone. No on-lot sewage disposal system shall be
constructed within 200 feet of the water source well.
      G.   Well Capacity Testing Procedures
         1.   A dynamic recovery rate and draw-down test shall be conducted to
determine the capacity and safe daily yield of the well source. The test
procedures shall be conducted as follows:
            a.   A water pump, capable of variable output, having sufficient
capacity to exceed the Dynamic Recovery Rate of the water source shall be
employed for said test. It is recommended that the capacity of the source pump
be such that draw-down to within 20 feet of the source pump be achieved in a
maximum of 3 hours.
            b.   A suitable calibrated water meter capable of measuring the
water output shall be connected to the water source pump outlet.
            c.   The exact location of the water source pump with respect to
the bottom of the well shall be recorded and maintained constant for the
duration of the test.
            d.   The water source pump shall be operated at maximum capacity
and output for the first 6 hours of the test or until the water level in the
source well reached a point 20 feet above the water source pump. The elapsed
time and rate of pumping shall be recorded at 60-minute intervals on the log
data sheet form supplied.
            e.   Draw-down of the source well in feet shall be recorded at 60-
minute intervals as well as the water draw-down of any required peripheral test
hole wells* on the log data form.
            f.   Reduce the maximum rate of pumping by 10 gallons per minute
(GPM) and continue pumping for the next 2 hours of test or until the water
level reached a point 20 feet above the water source pump. The elapsed time,
rate of pumping and draw-down of the source well and, where required, the
peripheral test hole wells* shall be recorded on the log data forms at 60
minute intervals.
            g.   Continue the above procedure using the 2 hour time periods or
the criteria of water level above the source pump until the conditions are such
that the Dynamic Recovery Rate of the water source equals the pumping rate
(dynamic equilibrium). The Township Engineer may increase the increment of GPM
reduction where on site review of the data warrants such action. Note, as the
Dynamic Recovery Rate is approached, the increment of GPM reduction will need
to be reduced from 10 GPM to 8 GPM to 5 GPM — to n GPM —> 0. At this point, no
detectable change in draw-down will occur. If any change in draw-down is
detected, either plus or minus, dynamic equilibrium has not been achieved.
            h.   When said Dynamic Recovery Rate is reached, recore elapsed
time, pumping rate and draw-down on log data sheet and continue pumping at this
rate for the remainder of the 72 hour test time or a minimum of 24 hours,
whichever is the greater time. Elapsed time, pumping rate and draw-down of the
source well, and where required, the peripheral test wells*, shall be recorded
hourly.
            i.   Measurements of static water level recovery shall be made on
the source well and peripheral test hole wells*, where required. Measurements
shall be taken hourly and the data recorded for a minimum time period of 24
hours upon cessation of the dynamic recovery rate test.
            j.   Calculations of Specific Capacity and safe daily yield of the
source well shall be submitted to the Municipal Engineer and the PDER by the
registered professional engineer employed by the Utility or developer for
review and analysis.
*Peripheral test hole wells may be required in order to determine the area of
influence of the source well and the capacity of the source well aquifer.
Peripheral test hole wells will generally be required in geological areas with
slate and shale formations. The test hole wells shall be situated according to
figure 1 and have a minimum diameter of 6 inches.
      H.   Improvements Requirements
         1.   Where a centralized water system is to be installed within a
proposed subdivision or land development, the improvement procedures and
requirements set forth within the township subdivision chapter shall be
followed. Improvements agreements, guarantees, inspections, and guarantee
releases shall include consideration of the centralized water company in
carrying out the procedures and requirements of the township subdivision- land
development chapter.
         2.   Final specifications for the design and installation of the
centralized water system shall be included as part of the improvements
agreement between the developer and the Township Council. Final approval of the
subdivision or land development plan shall not take place until such
specifications are finalized within the improvements agreement and until the
necessary improvements and maintenance guarantees are posted. Engineering
review of the specifications for the water system by an engineer independent of
the design engineer shall take place before signing of the improvements
agreement and before approval of the final development plan.

      B.   Construction.
         1.   Casing:
            a.   The well shall have a water-tight casing of steel, wrought
iron or other approved material.
            b.   The casing shall be carried into the bedrock or other
impervious strata a minimum of 5 feet. In no instances shall there be less than
20 feet of casing installed below the surface.
         2.   Grouting: An annular space between the well casing and the earth
formation shall be completely filled with impervious cement grout or equivalent
sealing material.
            a.   For internal pressure grouting the annular space shall be at
least 1 inch greater than the casing radius.
            b.   For external pressure grouting the annular space shall be at
least 2 inches greater than the casing radius.
            c.   The grout shall extend down to the top of the water-bearing
formation, bedrock, impervious strata or otherwise to a depth of at least 20
feet.
         3.   Screen: A screen of the appropriate type and size may be
desirable to exclude solid particles.
         4.   Pump Installation: Installation of the pump may be either at the
surface or below the surface.
            a.   All types of installations shall be appropriately drained and
water-tight so as to preclude contamination by surface and subsurface water.
            b.   For below the surface installations a pitless installation
employing a water-tight pitless adapter is preferred to a pit installation so
as to preclude contamination by surface and subsurface water.
            c.   Pit installations shall be adequately ventilated.
            d.   The pump suction opening shall be placed at least 2 feet below
the maximum draw down of the water in the well.
         5.   Storage Capacity: The size of the pressure tank needed is
somewhat dependent upon the well yield. A capacity of 40 gallons per living
unit shall generally be required.
      C.   Backflow Disinfection, and Quality.
         1.   Every potable water distributing pipe shall be protected against
backflow from any plumbing fixture or other piece of equipment or appliance
capable of affecting the quality of the potable water by having the outlet end
from which the water flows spaced a minimum distance of twice the diameter of
the water supply pipe above the flood level rim of the receptacle into which
the potable water flows.
         2.   Where it is not practicable to provide this minimum air gap, the
connection to the fixture, equipment, or appliance shall be equipped with
backflow preventor assembly of an approved type.
         3.   Following construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of an
individual water supply system, the well should be pumped continuously until
water discharged is clear. The well, pump, piping system, and other fixtures,
shall be filled with water containing a concentration of not less than 50 parts
per million of available chlorine for a period of at least 12 hours. Other
disinfectant concentrations and time intervals which are known to be equally
effective may be used.
         4.   After flushing the disinfected system, a water sample should be
taken for laboratory examination. The laboratory examination should determine
the safety and suitabilty of the water for domestic use. If the laboratory
analysis shows that the water is not suitable for domestic use, treatment to
render the water safe for use may be feasible.
   IV.   DESIGN STANDARDS FOR ON-LOT SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEM
      A.   On-lot sewage disposal systems shall conform to the standards of the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources as set forth in Title 25,
Chapter 73 entitled "Standards for Sewage Disposal Facilities". The results of
the percolation tests and soil profiles shall be recorded on forms supplied by
the Township S.E.O. or the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources,
and the fee for the application shall be paid to the township in advance of all
testing.
      B.   For evaluating subdivisions there shall be one soil profile per soil
type or per acre and a minimum of two percolation tests per lot or per acre.
The procedure for eveluating subdivisions shall be approved before any testing
is done, and the results recorded on forms supplied by the Township S.E.O. or
the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources.
   V.   STORM DRAINAGE RUNOFF CALCULATIONS
      A.   Rational Formula.
         1.   The rational formula used in calculating runoff is Q=CIA. In this
equation, Q is the peak runoff in cubic feet per second, C is a runoff
coefficient which depends on the nature of the land cover, I is the intensity
of rainfall in inches per hour for a duration equal to the time of
concentration for the drainage area involved and A is the watershed area
increase. The time of concentration is the time required for runoff from the
upper reaches of the watershed to reach the point for which runoff rates are
being calculated.
      B.   Values of Coefficient "C".
         1.   Runoff coefficients used in the rational formula shall be based
on the guidelines in the following table and acceptable to the Township
Engineer.

   VI.   STORM DRAIN SIZES AND MATERIALS
      A.   Inlet Capacity and Type.
         Inlets shall be 4 foot or 6 foot special inlets as indicated in
PennDOT Design Standards Publication 72 - Plate RC - 34. The design capacity of
all 4 foot special inlets shall be 5.5 CFS, and for all 6 foot special inlets
shall be 6.5 CFS.
      B.   Straight Pipe Sections.
         Wherever possible all storm drain pipes shall be designed to follow
straight courses. No angular deflections of storm sewer pipe sections in excess
of 5° shall be permitted. No vertical curves shall be permitted in the storm
drain pipe system. Storm pipes shall be either fully coated bituminous
corrugated metal pipe or reinforced cement concrete pipe.
         1.   Minimum Grade and Size - All storm drain pipes shall be designed
to maintain a minimum grade of 0.5%. All storm pipes shall have a minimum
inside diameter of 15 inches or a cross-sectional area of 176 square inches,
except that pipes under a 25 foot or greater fill shall not be less than 24
inches or a cross-sectional area of 453 square inches.
         2.   Pipe Capacity - The capacity of all pipe culverts shall, as a
minimum, provide the required carrying capacity as determined by the Manning
Equation indicated in Section V, Paragraph E.
         3.   Pipe Arches - Where headroom is restricted, equivalent pipe
arches may be used in lieu of circular pipe.
         4.   Horizontal Pipe Deflections - A manhole or inlet shall be
provided at all horizontal deflections in the storm pipe system exceeding 5°.
         5.   Minimum Cover - a minimum of 2 feet of cover shall be maintained
over all storm pipes. In extreme case, when approved by the Township Engineer,
this minimum may be reduced, but in no case shall the top of the pipe be higher
than 0.5 foot below the sub-grade elevation of the roadway.
         6.   Match Crowns - The crowns of all pipes tying into an inlet or
manhole shall be set at equal elevation.
         7.   Diversion of Runoff - Where required by the Township, all storm
drain pipes shall be designed to carry the runoff into a detention basin or
similar facility utilized to control the rate of runoff.
(as amended by Ord. 239, 2/9/1990, § 2; by Ord. 242, 4/4/1990; and by Res.
1992-29, 8/19/1992)
   VII.   RUNOFF CONTROL MEASURES
      A.   Runoff Control.
         The rate of storm water runoff from any proposed subdivision or land
development shall not exceed the rate of runoff prior to development. Where, in
the judgement of the Township Engineer, the quantity of storm water runoff will
cause detrimental downstream impact, further controls may be required. This
standard shall be maintained for all storms (i.e. both high frequency and low
frequency.)
      B.   Design of Detention Basins.
         All detention basins shall be designed as per the procedures developed
by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, as outlined
in their Technical Release No. 55, Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds for
Drainage Areas in Excess of 25 Acres. Drainage basins of less than 25 acres
shall be designed using the Universal Rational Method.
      C.   Basin Design Criteria.
         The following design criteria shall be used in the design of all
detention basins in the 'Township. The basins shall be designed to detain the
quantity of water resulting from a 25 year storm frequency return period under
full development conditions released at a maximum outflow rate equal to that
resulting from a 10 year storm frequency return period under present
conditions. Calculations shall also be provided to show that the pond outflow
for a 2 year storm has been attenuated to the pre-developed rate. All flows in
excess of the above mentioned standard shall flow over an emergency spillway.
         1.   Outlet Structure - A perforated riser or other type outlet
structure specially designed for the outlet condition shall be provided at the
outlet of all detention basins. The riser shall be constructed of metal or
concrete. The riser shall extend to an elevation 2 feet below the crest
elevation of the emergency spillway. The riser shall be designed so that the
rate of outflow is controlled by the pipe barrel through the basin berm when
the depth of the water within the basin exceeds the height of the riser. The
perforations shall be cleanly cut and shall not be susceptible to enlargement.
All metal risers shall be suitably coated to prevent corrosion. A trash rack or
similar appurtenance shall be provided to prevent debris from entering the
riser. All risers shall have a concrete base attached with a watertight
connection. The base shall be sufficient weight to prevent floatation of the
riser. An anti-vortex device, consisting of a thin vertical plate normal to the
basin berm, shall be provided on the top of the riser. A suitable perforated
riser design is outlined in the following source:
            Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook
            Lehigh County Soil and Water Conservation District
            Soil Conservation Service
            United States Department of Agriculture
         2.   Maximum Depth of Detention Basins - In general, the maximum depth
of water in a detention basin shall not exceed 5 feet.
         3.   Emergency Spillway - Whenever possible, the emergency spillway
for detention basins shall be constructed on undisturbed ground. Emergency
spillways shall be constructed of reinforced concrete, vegetated earth, or
concrete rubble. All emergency spillways shall be constructed so that the
detention basin berm is protected against erosion. The minimum capacity of all
emergency spillways shall be such that the combined capacity of the emergency
spillway and the principal pipe barrel equal the peak flow rate from the 100
year design storm. The dimensions of the emergency spillways can be determined
from the Lehigh County Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook. Emergency
spillways shall extend along the upstream and downstream berm embankment
slopes. The upstream edge of the emergency spillway shall be a minimum of 3
feet below the spillway crest elevation. The downstream slope of the spillway
shall, as a minimum, extend to the toe of the berm embankment. The emergency
spillway shall not discharge over earthen fill and/or easily erodible material.
         4.   Antiseep Collars - Antiseep collars shall be installed around the
principal pipe barrel within the normal saturation zone of the detention basin
berms. The anitseep collars and their connections to the pipe barrel shall be
watertight. The antiseep collars shall extend a minimum of 2 feet beyond the
outside of the principal pipe barrel. The maximum spacing between collars shall
be 14 times the minimum projection of the collar measured perpendicular to the
pipe.
         5.   Freeboard - Freeboard is the difference between the design flow
elevations in the emergency spillway and the top of the settled detention basin
embankment. The minimum freeboard shall be 2 feet.
         6.   Slope of Detention Basin Embankment - The maximum slope of
earthen detention basin embankments shall be 3 to 1. The top or toe of any
slope shall be located a minimum of 5 feet from any property line. Whenever
possible, the side slopes and basin shape shall be amenable to the natural
topography. Straight side slopes and rectangular basins shall be avoided
whenever possible.
         7.   Width of Berm - The minimum top width of detention basin berms
shall be 10 feet.
         8.   Slope of Basin Bottom - In order to insure proper drainage of the
detention basin, a minimum grade of 2% shall be maintained for all sheet flow.
A minimum grade of 0.5% percent shall be maintained for all channel flow.
         9.   Energy Dissipators - Energy dissipating devices (riprap, end
sills, etc.) shall be placed at all basin outlets.
         10.   Design Information - As part of the Storm Water Management Plan
and Report, all design information shall be submitted including, but not
limited to, the following:
            a.   General description of proposed facilities and the operation
of the runoff control measures.

in Section
VIII of this Appendix.
         12.   The distance from the highest free water surface of any
detention basin or drainage facility to a dwelling unit shall be a minimum of
100 feet.
         13.   The detention basin shall, unless otherwise specified by the
Township, be fenced by a chain link fence with a minimum height of 4 feet.
         14.   The detention basin shall be designed with an impervious liner.
The liner may be of the impervious membrane type, placed in accordance with the
manufacturer's recommendations, or may be constructed by mixing Bentonite with
existing soil available at the site as approved by the Township Engineer.
         15.   When rock is encountered during the excavation of a pond, it
shall be removed to an elevation of at least 12 inches below the proposed basin
floor.
(as amended by Ord. 239, 2/9/1990, § 2; and by Res. 1992-29, 8/19/1992)
   VIII.   GRADING AND LANDSCAPING
      A.   Cuts.
         No excavation shall be made with a cut face steeper than three
horizontal to one vertical, except under the conditions that the material in
which the excavation is made is sufficiently stable to sustain a slope of
steeper than three horizontal to one vertical. A written statement to that
effect is required from a civil engineer, licensed by the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, having experience in soils engineering, and must be submitted to
the Township Engineer and approved by him. The statement shall affirm that the
site has been inspected and that the deviation from the slope should not result
in injury to persons or damage to property. Retaining walls will be required if
a stable slope cannot be maintained. Any retaining wall design must be approved
by the Township Engineer. The toe of the slope of headwall of any cut must be
located a minimum of 5 feet from property lines.
      B.   Fills.
         No fill shall be made with creates any exposed surface steeper in
slope than three horizontal to one vertical, except where the fill is located
so that settlement, sliding, or erosion will not result in property damage or
be a hazard to adjoining property, streets, or buildings. A written statement
is required from a civil engineer licensed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
having experience in soils engineering, certifying that he has inspected the
site and that any proposed deviation from the slope specified above should not
endanger any property or result in property damage, and must be submitted to
and approved by the Township Engineer.
         A concrete or stone masonry wall designed and constructed in
accordance with these specifications and standards may be required to support
the face of the fill where the above-specified slopes are exceeded.

APPENDIX C
Catasauqua Creek and Lehigh River Sub-basin 4 Stormwater Management Standards
Article I.   General Provisions.
§ 101. Short Title.
This Appendix shall be known and may be cited as the “Catasauqua Creek and
Lehigh River Sub-Basin 4 Stormwater Management Ordinance” and is referred to
herein as “this Appendix.”
(Ord. 640, 9/22/2022)
§ 102. Statement of Findings.
Hanover Township Council finds that:
   A.   Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases runoff volumes, flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying
capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public
facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines flood plain management
and flood control efforts in downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, threatens public health and safety, and increases nonpoint source
pollution of water resources.
   B.   A comprehensive program of stormwater management (SWM), including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff,
is fundamental to the public health, safety, and welfare and the protection of
people of the Commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
   C.   Stormwater is an important water resource that provides groundwater
recharge for water supplies and supports the base flow of streams.
   D.   The use of green infrastructure and low impact development (LID) are
intended to address the root cause of water quality impairment by using systems
and practices which use or mimic natural processes to: 1) infiltrate and
recharge, 2) evapotranspire, and/or 3) harvest and use precipitation near where
it falls to earth, Green infrastructure practices and LID contribute to the
restoration or maintenance of pre-development hydrology.
   E.   Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are required
to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer
systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
program.
   F.   Nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems can
contribute to pollution of waters of the Commonwealth by the municipality.
(Ord. 640, 9/22/2022)
§ 103. Purpose.
The purpose of this Appendix is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
Hanover Township and the Catasauqua Creek and Lehigh Creek Sub-Basin 4
Watersheds by minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits described in §
101-2 of this Appendix through provisions designed to:
   A.   Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim, and restore the
existing and designated uses of the waters of this Commonwealth.
   B.   Preserve natural drainage systems.
   C.   Manage stormwater runoff close to the source, reduce runoff volumes and
mimic predevelopment hydrology.
   D.   Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater planning
and management.
   E.   Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and
groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources.
   F.   Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
   G.   Provide proper operation and maintenance of all stormwater best
management practices (BMPs) that are implemented within the municipality.
   H.   Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.
   I.   Satisfies the regulatory requirements of the NPDES MS4 program as well
as Act 167 requirements for the Monocacy Creek.
(Ord. 640, 9/22/2022)
§ 104. Statutory Authority.
The municipality is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect
runoff by the authority of the Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, The
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, the Act of October 4,
1978, P.L. 864 (Act 167), 32 P.S. Section 680.1, et seq., as amended, the
Stormwater Management Act and the Home Rule Charter and Optional Plans Law 53
Pa.C.S. §2901, et seq.
(Ord. 640, 9/22/2022)
§ 105. Applicability.
All regulated activities and all activities that may affect stormwater runoff,
including land development and earth disturbance activity, are subject to
regulation by this Appendix including those areas of the municipality which are
located within the Monocacy Creek as delineated on an official map available
for inspection at the municipal office. Where necessary, NPDES Phase II
regulations ensure that all of the ordinance provisions required to meet the
MS4 NPDES requirements apply across the entire municipality. The following
activities are defined as regulated activities and shall be governed by this
Appendix:
   A.   Land development.
   B.   Subdivision.
   C.   Construction of new or additional impervious surfaces (driveways,
parking lots, etc.).
   D.   Construction of new buildings or additions to existing buildings.
   E.   Diversion or piping of any natural or man-made stream channel.
   F.   Installation of stormwater systems or appurtenances thereto.
   G.   Regulated earth disturbance activities.
(Ord. 640, 9/22/2022)
§ 106. Exemptions.
   A.   Impervious cover. Any proposed regulated activity, except those defined
in §
105E and §
105F, which would create 10,000 square feet or less of additional impervious
cover is exempt from the drainage plan preparation provisions of this Appendix.
All of the impervious cover added incrementally to a site above the initial
10,000 square feet shall be subject to the drainage plan preparation provisions
of this Appendix. If a site has previously received an exemption and is
proposing additional development such that the total impervious cover on the
site exceeds 10,000 square feet, the total impervious cover on the site
proposed since the original ordinance date must meet the provisions of this
Appendix.
      (1)   The date of the municipal ordinance adoption of the original
Monocacy Creek Act 167 Stormwater Management Ordinance, March 1989, shall be
the starting point from which to consider tracts as “parent tracts” in which
future subdivisions and respective impervious area computations shall be
cumulatively considered.
      (2)   For development taking place in stages, the entire development plan
must be used in determining conformance with these criteria.
      (3)   Additional impervious cover shall include, but not be limited to,
additional indoor living spaces, decks, patios, garages, driveways, storage
sheds and similar structures, any roof, parking or driveway areas and any new
streets and sidewalks constructed as part of or for the proposed regulated
activity.
      (4)   Any additional areas proposed to initially be gravel, crushed
stone, porous pavement, etc., shall be assumed to be impervious for the
purposes of comparison to the exemption criteria. Any existing gravel, crushed
stone or hard packed soil areas on a site shall be considered as pervious cover
for the purpose of exemption evaluation.
   B.   Prior drainage plan approval. Any regulated activity for which a
drainage plan was previously prepared as part of a subdivision or land
development proposal that received preliminary plan approval from the
municipality prior to the effective date of this Appendix is exempt from the
drainage plan preparation provisions of this Appendix, except as cited in §
106C, provided that the approved drainage plan included design of stormwater
facilities to control runoff from the site currently proposed for regulated
activities consistent with ordinance provisions in effect at the time of
approval and the approval has not lapsed under the Municipalities Planning
Code. If significant revisions are made to the drainage plan after both the
preliminary plan approval and the effective date of this Appendix preparation
of a new drainage plan, subject to the provisions of this Appendix shall be
required. Significant revisions would include a change in control methods or
techniques, relocation or redesign of control measures or changes necessary
because soil or other conditions are not as stated on the original drainage
plan.
   C.   These exemptions shall not relieve the applicant from implementing such
measures as are necessary to protect health, safety, property, and state water
quality requirements. These measures include adequate and safe conveyance of
stormwater on the site and as it leaves the site. These exemptions do not
relieve the applicant from the responsibility to secure required permits or
approvals for activities regulated by any other applicable code, rule, act or
ordinance.
   D.   No exemptions shall be provided for regulated activities as defined in
§
105E and
105F.
(Ord. 640, 9/22/2022)
§ 107. Repealer.
Any other ordinance provision(s) or regulation of the municipality inconsistent
with any of the provisions of this Appendix is hereby repealed to the extent of
the inconsistency only.
(Ord. 640, 9/22/2022)
§ 108. Severability.
In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction declares any section or
provision of this Appendix invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity
of any of the remaining provisions of this Appendix.
(Ord. 640, 9/22/2022)
§ 109.   Compatibility with Other Ordinance Requirements.
Approvals issued and actions taken under this Appendix do not relieve the
applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for
activities regulated by any other code, law, regulation or ordinance.
(Ord. 640, 9/22/2022)
§ 110.   Duty of Persons Engaged in Development of Land.
Notwithstanding any provisions of this Appendix, including exemption and waiver
provisions, any landowner and any person engaged in the alteration or
development of land which may affect stormwater runoff characteristics shall
implement such measures as are reasonably necessary to prevent injury to
health, safety or other property. Such measures shall include such actions as
are required to manage the rate, volume, direction and quality of resulting
stormwater runoff in a manner which otherwise adequately protects health and
property from possible injury.
(Ord. 640, 9/22/2022)
§ 111.   Erroneous Permit.
Any permit or authorization issued or approved based on false, misleading or
erroneous information provided by an applicant is void without the necessity of
any proceedings for revocation. Any work undertaken or use established pursuant
to such permit or other authorization is unlawful. No action may be taken by a
board, agency or employee of the municipality purporting to validate such a
violation.
(Ord. 640, 9/22/2022)
§ 112.   Waivers.
   A.   If the municipality determines that any requirement under this Appendix
cannot be achieved for a particular regulated activity, the municipality may,
after an evaluation of alternatives, approve measures other than those in this
Appendix.
   B.   Waivers or modifications of the requirements of this Appendix may be
approved by the Municipality if enforcement will exact undue hardship because
of peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question, provided that the
modifications will not be contrary to the public interest and that the purpose
of the chapter is preserved. Cost or financial burden shall not be considered a
hardship. Modification may be considered if an alternative standard or approach
will provide equal or better achievement of the purpose of this Appendix. A
request for modifications shall be in writing and accompany the stormwater
management site plan submission. The request shall provide the facts on which
the request is based, the provision(s) of the ordinance involved and the
proposed modification.
   C.   No waiver or modification of any regulated stormwater activity
involving earth disturbance greater than or equal to one acre may be granted by
the Municipality unless that action is approved in advance by the Department of
Environmental Protection (DEP) or the delegated county conservation district.
(Ord. 640, 9/22/2022)

   C.   The words “shall” and “must” are mandatory; the words “may” and
“should” are permissive.
These definitions do not necessarily reflect the definitions contained in
pertinent regulations or statutes, and are intended for this Appendix only.
   ACCELERATED EROSION - The removal of the surface of the land through the
combined action of human activities and natural processes, at a rate greater
than would occur because of the natural processes alone.
   AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY - Activities associated with agriculture such as
agricultural cultivation, agricultural operation, and animal heavy use areas.
This includes the work of producing crops including tillage, land clearing,
plowing, disking, harrowing, planting, harvesting crops or pasturing and
raising of livestock and installation of conservation measures. Construction of
new buildings or impervious area is not considered an agricultural activity.
   APPLICANT - A landowner, developer, or other person who has filed an
application to the municipality for approval to engage in any regulated
activity at a project site in the municipality.
   BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE (BMP) - Activities, facilities, designs, measures,
or procedures used to manage stormwater impacts from regulated activities
listed in § 105, to meet state water quality requirements, to promote
groundwater recharge, and to otherwise meet the purposes of this Appendix.
Stormwater BMPs are commonly grouped into one of two broad categories or
measures: “structural'' or “non-structural.” In this Appendix, non-structural
BMPs or measures refer to operational and/or behavior-related practices that
attempt to minimize the contact of pollutants with stormwater runoff, whereas
structural BMPs or measures are those that consist of a physical device or
practice that is installed to capture and treat stormwater runoff.
   Structural BMPs include, but are not limited to, a wide variety of practices
and devices, from large-scale retention ponds and constructed wetlands, to
small-scale underground treatment systems, infiltration facilities, filter
strips, low impact design, bioretention, wet ponds, permeable paving, grassed
swales, riparian or forested buffers, sand filters, detention basins, and
manufactured devices. Structural stormwater BMPs are permanent appurtenances to
the project site.
   BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE PLAN - Documentation,
included as part of a drainage plan, detailing the proposed BMPs, how they will
be operated and maintained and who will be responsible.
   BIORETENTION - Densely vegetated, depressed features that store stormwater
and filter it through vegetation, mulch, planting soil, etc. Ultimately
stormwater is evapotranspirated, infiltrated, or discharged. Optimal
bioretention areas mimic natural forest ecosystems in terms of species
diversity, density, distribution, use of native plants, etc.
   BUFFER -
      STREAMSIDE BUFFER - A zone of variable width located along a stream that
is vegetated and is designed to filter pollutants from runoff.
      SPECIAL GEOLOGIC FEATURE BUFFER - A required isolation distance from a
special geologic feature to a proposed BMP needed to reduce the risk of
sinkhole formation due to stormwater management activities.
   CAPTURE/REUSE - Stormwater management techniques such as cisterns and rain
barrels which direct runoff into storage devices, surface or subsurface, for
later reuse, such as for irrigation of gardens and other planted areas. Because
this stormwater is utilized and no pollutant discharge results, water quality
performance is superior to other noninfiltration BMPs.
   CARBONATE BEDROCK - Rock consisting chiefly of carbonate minerals, such as
limestone and dolomite; specifically a sedimentary rock composed of more than
50% by weight of carbonate minerals that underlies soil or other
unconsolidated, superficial material.
   CISTERN - An underground reservoir or tank for storing rainwater.
   CLOSED DEPRESSION - A distinctive bowl-shaped depression in the land
surface. It is characterized by internal drainage, varying magnitude, and an
unbroken ground surface.
   CONSERVATION DISTRICT - The Lehigh County Conservation District.
   CONCENTRATED DRAINAGE DISCHARGE - Stormwater runoff leaving a property via a
point source.
   CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS - Constructed wetlands are similar to wet ponds (see
below) and consist of a basin which provides for necessary stormwater storage
as well as a permanent pool or water level, planted with wetland vegetation. To
be successful, constructed wetlands must have adequate natural hydrology (both
runoff inputs as well as soils and water table which allow for maintenance of a
permanent pool of water). In these cases, the permanent pool must be designed
carefully, usually with shallow edge benches, so that water levels are
appropriate to support carefully selected wetland vegetation.
   CULVERT - A pipe, conduit or similar structure including appurtenant works
which carries surface water.
   DAM - An artificial barrier, together with its appurtenant works,
constructed for the purpose of impounding or storing water or another fluid or
semifluid or a refuse bank, fill or structure for highway, railroad or other
purposes which does or may impound water or another fluid or semifluid.
   DEP - The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.
   DESIGN STORM - The magnitude and temporal distribution of precipitation from
a storm event measured in probability of occurrence (e.g., a five-year storm)
and duration (e.g., 24 hours) used in the design and evaluation of stormwater
management systems. Also see Return Period.
   DETENTION BASIN - A basin designed to retard stormwater runoff by
temporarily storing the runoff and releasing it at the appropriate release
rate.
   DETENTION VOLUME - The volume of runoff that is captured and released into
the waters of the Commonwealth at a controlled rate.
   DEVELOPER - A person, partnership, association, corporation or other entity,
or any responsible person therein or agent thereof, that undertakes any
activity regulated by this Appendix.
   DEVELOPMENT SITE (SITE) - The specific tract of land for which a regulated
activity is proposed. See PROJECT SITE.
   DIFFUSED DRAINAGE - See SHEET FLOW.
   DIRECT RECHARGE/SUBSURFACE BMP - A BMP designed to direct runoff to
groundwater recharge without providing for vegetative uptake. Examples include
infiltration trenches, seepage beds, drywells and stormwater drainage wells
such that nearly all runoff becomes recharge to groundwater.
   DISTURBED AREA - An unstabilized land area where an earth disturbance
activity is occurring or has occurred.
   DRAINAGE EASEMENT - A right granted by a landowner to a grantee, allowing

dam subject to permit by DEP under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105.
(Ord. 640, 9/22/2022)
§ 303. Erosion and Sediment Control During Regulated Earth Disturbance
Activities.
   A.   No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall
commence until approval by the municipality of an erosion and sediment control
plan for construction activities. Written approval by DEP or a delegated County
Conservation District shall satisfy this requirement.
   B.   An erosion and sediment control plan is required by DEP regulations for
any earth disturbance activity of 5,000 square feet or more under 25 Pa. Code §
102.4(b).
   C.   A DEP NPDES stormwater discharges associated with construction
activities permit is required for regulated earth disturbance activities under
25 Pa. Code Chapter 92a.
   D.   S) for regulated earth disturbance activities from the appropriate DEP
regional office or County Conservation District must be provided to the
municipality before the commencement of an earth disturbance activity.
   E.   A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan and any permit, as
required by DEP regulations, shall be available at the project site at all
times.
(Ord. 640, 9/22/2022)
§ 304. Post Construction Water Quality Criteria.
   A.   No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall
commence until approval by the municipality of a drainage plan which
demonstrates compliance with this Appendix.
   B.   The water quality volume (WQv) shall be captured and treated with
vegetated/surface and/or direct recharge/subsurface BMPs. The WQv shall be
calculated as the difference in runoff volume from pre-development to
postdevelopment for the 24-hour, two-year return period storm. This may be
calculated using either the soil-cover-complex method or rational method using
the two-year rainfall depth as noted in Section
308.1. The effect of closed depressions on the site shall be considered in this
calculation. The WQv shall be captured and treated in a manner consistent with
the standards outlined in Section
305 of this Appendix.
   C.   The WQv shall be calculated for each post-development drainage
direction on a site for sizing BMPs. Site areas having no impervious cover and
no proposed disturbance during development may be excluded from the WQv
calculations and do not require treatment.
   D.   The applicant shall document the bedrock type(s) present on the site
from published sources. Any apparent boundaries between carbonate and
noncarbonate bedrock shall be verified through more detailed site evaluations
by a qualified geotechnical professional.
   E.   For each proposed regulated activity in the watershed where an
applicant intends to use infiltration BMPs, the applicant shall conduct a
preliminary site investigation, including gathering data from published
sources, a field inspection of the site, a minimum of one test pit and a
minimum of two percolation tests, as outlined in
Appendix G. This investigation will determine depth to bedrock, depth to the
seasonal high water table, soil permeability and location of special geologic
features, if applicable. This investigation may be done by a certified Sewage
Enforcement Officer (SEP) except that the location(s) of special geologic
features shall be verified by a qualified geotechnical professional.
   F.   Sites where applicants intend to use infiltration BMPs must meet the
following criteria:
      (1)   Depth to bedrock below the invert of the BMP greater than or equal
to two feet.
      (2)   Depth to seasonal high water table below the invert of the BMP
greater than or equal to two feet: except for infiltration of residential roof
runoff where the seasonal high water table must be below the invert of the BMP.
      (3)   Soil permeability (as measured using the standards listed in
Appendix C of the Pennsylvania Stormwater Best Practices Manual) greater than
or equal to 0.1 inches/hour and less than or equal to 10 inches per hour,
      (4)   Setback distances or buffers as follows:
         a.   One hundred feet from water supply wells, or 50 feet in
residential development.
         b.   Ten feet downgradient or 100 feet upgradient from building
foundations.
      (5)   Fifty feet from septic system drainfields.
      (6)   Fifty feet from a geologic contact with carbonate bedrock unless a
preliminary site investigation is done in the carbonate bedrock to show the
absence of special geologic features within 50 feet of the proposed
infiltration area.
   G.   In entirely carbonate areas, where the applicant intends to use
infiltration BMPs, the preliminary site investigation described in
Appendix G shall be conducted. For infiltration areas that appear feasible
based on the preliminary site investigation, the applicant shall conduct the
additional site investigation and testing as outlined in
Appendix G. The soil depth, percolation rate and proposed loading rate, each
weighted as described in Section
308, along with the buffer from special geologic features shall be compared to
the Recommendation Chart for Infiltration Stormwater Management BMPs in
Carbonate Bedrock in
Appendix D to determine if the site is recommended for infiltration. In
addition to the recommendation from
Appendix D, the conditions listed in Section
304.F are required for infiltration in carbonate areas.
   H.   Site areas proposed for infiltration shall be protected from
disturbance and compaction except as necessary for construction of infiltration
BMPs.
   I.   If infiltration of the entire WQv is not proposed, the remainder of the
WQv shall be treated by acceptable BMPs for each discharge location. Acceptable
BMPs are listed in
Appendix H.
   J.   Stormwater runoff from hot spot land uses shall be pre-treated.
Suggested methods of pre-treatment are listed in
Appendix H.
   K.   The use of infiltration BMPs is prohibited on hot spot land use areas
unless the applicant can demonstrate that existing and proposed site
conditions, including any proposed runoff pre-treatment, create conditions
suitable for runoff infiltration under this Appendix.
   L.   Stormwater infiltration BMPs shall not be placed in or on a special
geologic feature(s). Additionally, stormwater runoff shall not be discharged
into existing onsite sinkholes.
   M.   Stormwater drainage wells may only be used for runoff from roof areas.
   N.   Applicants shall request, in writing, public water suppliers to provide
the Zone I wellhead protection radius, as calculated by the method outlined in
the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Wellhead Protection
regulations, for any public water supply well within 400 feet of the site. In
addition to the setback distances specified in Section
304.F, infiltration is prohibited in the Zone I radius as defined and
substantiated by the public water supplier in writing. If the applicant does
not receive a response from the public water supplier, the Zone I radius is
assumed to be 100 feet.
   O.   The municipality may, after consultation with DEP, approve alternative
methods for meeting the state water quality requirements other than those in
this Appendix, provided that they meet the minimum requirements of, and do not
conflict with, state law including but not limited to the Clean Streams Law.
(Ord. 640, 9/22/2022)
§ 305. Green Infrastructure and Existing Water Balance Preservation Standards.
   A.   The entire WQv as calculated in Section
304.B of this Appendix shall be captured and treated by either direct recharge/
subsurface and/or vegetated/surface BMPs.
   B.   As much proposed impervious area as practical shall be directed to
water quality BMPs.
   C.   Existing impervious area that is not proposed to be treated by direct
recharge/subsurface BMPs should be excluded from all water balance
calculations.
   D.   Vegetated/surface BMPs shall be employed “first” for the site to
capture the equivalent of a minimum of 0.38 inches of runoff for each square
foot of impervious area, unless proven not feasible by the applicant. For
proposed impervious cover directed to multiple BMPs, the vegetated/surface BMP
capture volume chart in Appendix C shall be used to determine overall site
compliance. Direct recharge/subsurface BMPs may be used “first” for portions of
the impervious cover- provided the overall vegetated/surface BMP “first”
standard is met.
   E.   A maximum of 30% of the total annual rainfall for a site may be
directly recharged to groundwater using direct recharge/subsurface BMPs, for
runoff from impervious areas.
      (1)   For development sites with greater than 33% proposed impervious
cover:
         a.   If all impervious cover is directed to vegetated/surface BMPs to
capture the entire two-year, 24-hour event, the direct recharge standard is
met.
         b.   Up to 33% of the site as impervious cover may be directed to
direct recharge/subsurface BMPs designed to capture the entire two-year, 24-
hour event provided the overall vegetated/surface BMP “first” standard is met.
All remaining impervious cover shall be directed to vegetated/surface BMPs
designed to capture the remainder of the WQv.
         c.   For vegetated/surface and/or direct recharge/subsurface BMPs
designed for runoff from impervious areas designed to capture less than the
entire two-year, 24-hour event, Appendix C shall be used to assure that the
maximum direct recharge standard is met.
      (2)   The maximum 30% direct recharge standard applies on an overall site
basis, rather than in each drainage direction.
(Ord. 640, 9/22/2022)
§ 306. Stormwater Management Districts.
   A.   Mapping of Stormwater Management Districts - To implement the
provisions of the Monocacy Creek Watershed Stormwater Management Plan Update,
the municipality is hereby divided into stormwater management districts
consistent with the Monocacy Creek Release Rate Map presented in the plan
update. The boundaries of the stormwater management districts are shown on an
official map which is available for inspection at the municipal office. A copy
of the official map at a reduced scale is included in
Appendix A for general reference.
   B.   Release Rate Districts - There are six single release rate districts
that differ in the extent to which the post-development runoff must be
controlled. The release rate districts are 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% and 100%.
Within a given district, the post-development peak rate of storm runoff must be
controlled to the stated percentage of the pre-development peak rate of runoff
for each of the 10-, 25-, 50- and 100-year return period storms to protect
downstream watershed areas. There is one dual release rate district. Within
this district, the 10-year return period event needs to meet a 30% release
rate, and the 25-year and higher return period events need to meet a 100%
release rate.
   C.   Conditional No Detention Districts - These watershed areas peak very
early with respect to the total watershed peak flow and contribute very minimal
flow to the watershed peak flow. For that reason, these watershed areas may
discharge post-development peak runoff without detention for the 10- through
100-year return periods without adversely affecting the total watershed peak
flow, These areas are designated as "conditional" no detention areas because in
certain instances the "local" runoff conveyance facilities, which transport
runoff from the site to the main channel, may not have adequate capacity to
safely transport the peak flows associated with no detention for a proposed
development. In those instances, a 100% release rate control would have to be
provided or, alternately, the capacity deficiency(ies) would have to be
corrected.
(Ord. 640, 9/22/2022)
§ 307. Stormwater Management District Implementation Provisions.
   A.   Applicants shall provide a comparative pre- and post construction
stormwater management hydrograph analysis for each direction of discharge and
for the site overall to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this
Appendix.
   B.   Any stormwater management controls required by this Appendix and
subject to release rate criteria shall meet the applicable release rate
criteria for each of the 2-, 10-, 25-, 50- and 100-year return period runoff
events consistent with the calculation methodology specified in §
308.
   C.   The exact location of the stormwater management district boundaries as
they apply to a given development site shall be determined by mapping the
boundaries using the two-foot topographic contours provided as part of the
drainage plan. The district boundaries as originally drawn coincide with
topographic divides or, in certain instances, are drawn from the intersection
of the watercourse and a physical feature such as the confluence with another
watercourse or a potential flow obstruction (e.g., road, culvert, bridge,
etc.). The physical feature is the downstream limit of the subarea, and the
subarea boundary is drawn from that point up slope to each topographic divide
along the path perpendicular to the contour lines.
   D.   Any downstream capacity analysis conducted in accordance with this
Appendix shall use the following criteria for determining adequacy for
accepting increased peak flow rates:
      (1)   Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey the
increased runoff associated with a two-year return period event within their
banks at velocities consistent with protection of the channels from erosion.
      (2)   Natural or man-made channels, swales, culverts, bridges, storm
sewers or any other facilities which must convey flows from the tributary area
must be able to convey the increased 25-year return period runoff.
   E.   For a proposed development site located within one release rate
category subarea, the total runoff from the site shall meet the applicable
release rate criteria. For development sites with multiple directions of runoff
discharge, individual drainage directions may be designed for up to a 100%
release rate so long as the total runoff from the site is controlled to the
applicable release rate.
   F.   For a proposed development site located within two or more release rate
category subareas, the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall be the pre-
development peak discharge for that subarea multiplied by the applicable
release rate. The calculated peak discharges shall apply regardless of whether
the grading plan changes the drainage area by subarea An exception to the above
may be granted if discharges from multiple subareas re-combine in proximity to
the site. In this case, peak discharge in any direction may be a 100% release
rate provided that the overall site discharge meets the weighted average
release rate.
   G.   For sites straddling major watershed divides (e.g., Monocacy Creek and
Bushkill Creek), runoff volumes shall be managed to prevent diversion of runoff
between watersheds, as practicable.
   H.   Within a release rate category area, for a proposed development site
which has areas which drain to a closed depression(s), the design release from
the site will be the lesser of (a) the applicable release rate flow assuming no
closed depression(s) or (b) the existing peak flow actually leaving the site.
In cases where (b) would result in an unreasonably small design release, the
design discharge of less than or equal to the release rate will be determined
by the available downstream conveyance capacity to the main channel calculated
using Section
307.D and the minimum orifice criteria.
   I.   Off-site areas which drain through a proposed development site are not
subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable peak runoff rates.
However, onsite drainage facilities shall be designed to safely convey off-site
flows through the development site using the capacity criteria in §
307.D and the detention criteria in Section
308, In addition to the criteria in §
307.D, on-site conveyance systems designed to carry runoff to a detention basin
must be able to transport the basin's 100-year tributary flow either in-system,
in-gutter or overland.
   J.   For development sites proposed to take place in phases, all detention
ponds shall be designed to meet the applicable release rate(s) applied to all
site areas tributary to the proposed pond discharge direction. All site
tributary areas will be assumed as developed, regardless of whether all site
tributary areas are proposed for development at that time. An exception shall
be sites with multiple detention ponds in series where only the downstream pond
must be designed to the stated release rate.
   K.   Where the site area to be impacted by a proposed development activity
differs significantly from the total site area, only the proposed impact area
shall be subject to the release rate criteria. The impact area includes any
proposed cover or grading changes.
   L.   Development proposals which, through groundwater recharge or other
means, do not increase either the rate or volume of runoff discharged from the
site compared to pre-development are not subject to the release rate provisions
of this Appendix.
   M.   “No Harm” Water Quantity Option - For any proposed development site,
the developer has the option of using a less restrictive runoff control if the
developer can prove that special circumstances exist for the proposed
development site and that “no harm” would be caused by discharging at a higher
runoff rate than that specified by this Appendix. Special circumstances are
defined as any hydroloqic or hydraulic aspects of the development itself not
accommodated by the runoff control standards of this Appendix. Proof of “no
harm” would have to be shown from the development site through the remainder of
the downstream drainage network to the confluence of the Monocacy Creek with
the Lehigh River. Proof of “no harm” must be shown using the capacity criteria
specified in §
307D. if downstream capacity analysis is a part of the “no harm” justification.
      Attempts to prove "no harm" based upon downstream peak flow versus
capacity analysis shall be governed by the following provisions:
      (1)   Any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system as
documented by a developer may be used by the developer only in proportion to
his development site acreage relative to the total upstream undeveloped acreage
from the identified capacity (i.e. if his site is 10% of the upstream
undeveloped acreage, he may use up to 10% of the documented downstream
available capacity).
      (2)   Developer-proposed runoff controls which would generate increased
peak flow rates at storm drainage problem areas would, by definition, be
precluded from successful attempts to prove “no harm.”
      (3)   Any downstream capacity improvements proposed by the developer as
part of a “no harm” justification would be designed using the capacity criteria
specified in §
307D. Peak flow contributions to the proposed improvements shall be calculated
as the larger of; (1) assuming the local watershed is in the existing
condition, or (2) assuming that the local watershed is developed per current
zoning and using the specified runoff controls.
      Any "no harm" justifications shall be submitted by the developer as part
of the drainage plan submission per Article 4. Developers submitting “no harm”
justifications must still meet all of the water quality requirements in §
304 The municipality will process all eligible “no harm” requests in accordance
with §
307O.
   N.   Capacity Improvements - In certain instances, local drainage conditions
may dictate more stringent levels of runoff control than those based upon
protection of the entire watershed. In these instances, if the developer could
prove that it would be feasible to provide capacity improvements to relieve the
capacity deficiency in the local drainage network, then the capacity
improvements could be provided by the developer in lieu of runoff controls on
the development site. Peak flow calculations shall be done assuming that the
local watershed is in the existing condition and then assuming that the local
watershed is developed per current zoning and using the specified runoff
controls. Any capacity improvements would be designed using the larger of the
above peak flows and the capacity criteria specified in §
307D. All new development in the entire subarea(s) within which the proposed
development site is located shall be assumed to implement the developer's
proposed discharge control, if any.
   O.   Release rates need to be met year round. Designs involving BMPs that
function differently in winter versus non-winter conditions (e.g.. capture/
reuse with spray irrigation shut off for the winter) must still meet release
rates during the winter.
(Ord. 640, 9/22/2022)
§ 308.   Calculation Methodology. 
   A.   Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using
either the rational method or the soil-cover-complex methodology.
   B.   Infiltration BMP loading rate percentages in the Recommendation Chart
for Infiltration Stormwater Management BMPs in Carbonate Bedrock in
Appendix D shall be calculated as follows:
       Area tributary to infiltration BMP *100%
      Base area of infiltration BMP
      The area tributary to the infiltration BMP shall be weighted as follows:
      All disturbed areas to be made impervious: weight at 100%
      All disturbed areas to be made pervious: weight at 50%
      All undisturbed pervious areas: weight at 0%
      All existing impervious areas: weight at 100%
   C.   The design of any detention basin intended to meet the requirements of
this Appendix shall be verified by routing the design storm hydrograph through
the proposed basin using the storage indication method or other methodology
demonstrated to be more appropriate. For basins designed using the rational
method technique, the design hydrograph for routing shall be either the
universal rational hydrograph or another rational hydrograph that closely
approximates the volume of the universal rational hydrograph.
   D.   BMPs designed to store or infiltrate runoff and discharge to surface
runoff or pipe flow shall be routed using the storage indication method.
   E.   BMPs designed to store or infiltrate runoff and discharge to surface
runoff or pipe flow shall provide storage volume for the full WQv below the
lowest outlet invert.
   F.   Wet detention ponds designed to have a permanent pool for the WQv shall
assume that the permanent pool volume below the primary outlet is full at the
beginning of design event routing for the purposes of evaluating peak outflows.
   G.   All above-ground stormwater detention facilities shall provide a
minimum 0.5 feet of freeboard above the maximum pool elevation associated with
the two- through 100-year runoff events, or an additional ten percent of the
100-year storage volume as freeboard volume, whichever is greater. All below-
ground stormwater detention and infiltration facilities shall have an
additional ten percent of the 100-year storage volume available within the
storage medium, as well as a minimum of 0.5 feet of freeboard. The freeboard
shall be measured from the maximum pool elevation to the invert of the
emergency spillway for above-ground facilities, and from the maximum pool
elevation to the lowest overflow elevation for belowground facilities. The 2-
through 100-year storm events shall be controlled by the primary outlet
structure. An emergency spillway for each above-ground basin shall be designed
to pass the 100-year return frequency storm peak basin inflow rate with a
minimum 0.5 foot freeboard measured to the top of basin. The freeboard criteria
shall be met considering any off-site areas tributary to the basin as
developed, as applicable. Exceptions to the freeboard requirements are as
follows:
      (1)   Bioretention BMPs with a ponded depth less than or equal to 0,5
feet are exempt from the freeboard requirements.
      (2)   Small detention basins, with a ponded depth less than or equal to
1.5 feet or having a depth to the top of the berm less than or equal to 2.5
feet, may provide 20% additional storage volume measured from the maximum
ponded depth to the invert of the emergency spillway in lieu of the above
requirements. The depth of the emergency spillway must be sufficient to pass
either two times the 100-year peak or the 100-year peak with 0.2' of freeboard
to the top of berm, whichever is greater.
      (3)   Small infiltration basins, with a ponded depth less than or equal
to 1.5 feet or having a depth to the top of the berm less than or equal to 2.5
feet, may provide twenty percent additional storage volume measured from the
maximum ponded depth to the top of the berm in lieu of the above requirements.
In this case, an emergency spillway is only necessary if runoff in excess of
the basin volume would cause harm to downstream owners. If a spillway is
necessary, it must be sufficiently sized to pass the 100-year peak inflow.
      If this detention facility is considered to be a dam as per DEP Chapter
105, the design of the facility must be consistent with the Chapter 105
regulations, and may be required to pass a storm greater than the 100-year
event.
   H.   The minimum circular orifice diameter for controlling discharge rates
from detention facilities shall be three inches. Designs where a lesser size
orifice would be required to fully meet release rates shall be acceptable with
a three-inch orifice provided that as much of the site runoff as practical is
directed to the detention facilities. The minimum three-inch diameter does not
apply to the control of the WQv.
   I.   Runoff calculations using the soil-cover-complex method shall use the
natural resources conservation service Type II 24-hour rainfall distribution.
The 24-hour rainfall depths for the various return periods to be used
consistent with this Appendix may be taken from NOAA Atlas 14, Precipitation
Frequency Atlas of the United States, current volume, or the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation Drainage Manual, 2015 Edition for Region 4. The
following values are taken from the Drainage Manual:
Return Period 24-Hour Rainfall Depth
Return Period 24-Hour Rainfall Depth
1-year        2.64 inches
2-year        3.16 inches
5-year        3.91 inches
10-year       4.57 inches
25-year       5.60 inches
50-year       6.53 inches
100-year      7.63 inches
 
      A graphical and tabular presentation of the Type II-24 hour distribution
is included in Appendix C.
   J.   Runoff calculations using the rational method shall use rainfall
intensities consistent with appropriate times of concentration and return
periods and NOAA Atlas 14, Precipitation Frequency Atlas of the United States
Precipitation and Intensity Charts, current volume, as presented in Appendix C.
   K.   Runoff curve numbers (CN's) to be used in the soil-cover-complex method
shall be based upon the table presented in
Appendix C.
   L.   Runoff coefficients for use in the rational method shall be based upon
the table presented in
Appendix C.
   M.   All time of concentration calculations shall use a segmental approach
which may include one or all of the flow types below:
      (1)   Sheet flow (overland flow) calculations shall use either the NRCS
average velocity chart (Figure 3-1, Technical Release-55.1975) or the modified
kinematic wave travel time equation (equation 3-3, NRCS TR-55, June 1986). If
using the modified kinematic wave travel time equation, the sheet flow length
shall be limited to 50 feet for designs using the rational method and limited
to 150 feet for designs using the soil-cover-complex method.
      (2)   Shallow concentrated flow travel times shall be determined from the
watercourse slope, type of surface and the velocity from Figure 3-1 of TR-55,
June 1986.
      (3)   Open channel flow travel times shall be determined from velocities
calculated by the Manning Equation. Bankfull flows shall be used for
determining velocities. Manning 'n' values shall be based on the table
presented in
Appendix C.
      (4)   Pipe flow travel times shall be determined from velocities
calculated using the Manning Equation assuming full flow and the Manning 'n'
values from
Appendix C.
   N.   If using the rational method, all pre-development calculations for a
given discharge direction shall be based on a common time of concentration
considering both onsite and any off-site drainage areas. If using the rational
method, all postdevelopment calculations for a given discharge direction shall
be based on a common time of concentration considering both on-site and any
off-site drainage areas.
   O.   When conditions exist such that a proposed detention facility may
experience a tailwater effect, the basin shall be analyzed without any
tailwater effect for all storm events for comparison against the required
release rates. An additional routing of the 100-year storm with the full
tailwater effect shall be performed to check that the basin has sufficient
storage to contain the 100-year tributary flow and meet freeboard requirements.
   P.   The Manning Equation shall be used to calculate the capacity of
watercourses. Manning 'n’ values used in the calculations shall be consistent
with the table presented in
Appendix C or other appropriate standard engineering 'n' value resources. Pipe
capacities shall be determined by methods acceptable to the municipality.
   Q.   The Pennsylvania DEP, Chapter 105, Rules and Regulations, apply to the
construction, modification, operation or maintenance of both existing and
proposed dams, water obstructions and encroachments throughout the watershed.
Criteria for design and construction of stormwater management facilities
according to this Appendix may differ from the criteria that are used in the
permitting of dams under the dam safety program.

§ 309.   Volume Controls.
The green infrastructure and low impact development practices provided in the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's Pennsylvania Stormwater
Best Management Practices Manual (December 2006), as amended and updated, shall
be utilized for all regulated activities wherever possible. Water volume
controls shall be implemented using the Design Storm Method in Subsection A or
the Simplified Method in Subsection B below. For regulated activity areas equal
or less than one acre that do not require hydrologic routing to design the
stormwater facilities, this Appendix establishes no preference for either
methodology; therefore, the applicant may select either methodology on the
basis of economic considerations, the intrinsic limitations on applicability of
the analytical procedures associated with each methodology and other factors.
   A.   The Design Storm Method [CG-1 in the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection's Pennsylvania Stormwater Best Management Practices
Manual (December 2006), as amended and updated] is applicable to any size of
regulated activity. This method requires detailed modeling based on site
conditions.
      (1)   Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the two-year 24 hour duration precipitation.
      (2)   For modeling purposes:
         a.   Existing (predevelopment) non-forested pervious areas must be
considered meadow in good condition.
         b.   Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present, shall
be considered meadow in good condition in the model for existing conditions.
   B.   The Simplified Method [CG-2 in the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection's Pennsylvania Stormwater Best Management Practices
Manual (December 2006), as amended and updated] provided below is independent
of site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm Method is not
followed. This method is not applicable to regulated activities greater than
one acre or for projects that require design of stormwater storage facilities.
For new impervious surfaces:
      (1)   Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two (2)
inches of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
      (2)   At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious surfaces
shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it shall not be
released into the surface waters of this Commonwealth. Removal options include
reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration.
      (3)   Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed runoff; however, in
all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the permanently removed runoff should
be infiltrated.
      (4)   This method is exempt from the requirements of §
308.

applicant;
      (5)   That the waiver, if authorized, will represent the minimum waiver
that will afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of
the regulation in issue; and
      (6)   That financial hardship is not the criteria for granting of a
hardship waiver.
   C.   In granting any waiver, the municipality may attach such conditions and
safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this Appendix.

the regulated activity which constitutes or creates a hazard or nuisance,
pollution or which endangers the life or property of others.

costs, including reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the municipality as a
result thereof, for each violation, recoverable with costs, or imprisonment to
the extent allowed by law for the punishment of summary offense, or both. Each
day that the violation continues shall be a separate offense and penalties
shall be cumulative. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or
payable until the date of the determination of a violation by the Magisterial
District Judge. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment,
the municipality may enforce the judgment pursuant to a separate violation,
unless the Magisterial District Judge determining that there has been a
violation further determines that there was a good-faith basis for the person,
partnership, or corporation violating this Appendix to have believed that there
was no such violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have been only
one such violation until the fifth day following the date of the determination
of a violation by the Magisterial District Judge and, thereafter, each day that

the violation and judgment.
   D.   Nothing contained in this section shall be construed or interpreted to
grant to any person or entity other than the municipality the right to commence
any action for enforcement pursuant to this section.
   E.   Magisterial District Judges shall have initial jurisdiction in
proceedings brought under this section.
   F.   In addition, the municipality, through its solicitor, may institute
injunctive, mandamus or any other appropriate action or proceeding at law or in
equity for the enforcement of this Appendix. Any court of competent
jurisdiction shall have the right to issue restraining orders, temporary or
permanent injunctions, mandamus or other appropriate forms of remedy or relief.

Low Impact Development Practices
Alternative Approach for Managing Stormwater Runoff
(Ord. 473, 5/16/2007)
      Natural hydrologic conditions may be altered radically by poorly planned
development practices, such as introducing unneeded impervious surfaces,
destroying existing drainage swales, constructing unnecessary storm sewers, and
changing local topography. A traditional drainage approach of development has
been to remove runoff from a site as quickly as possible and capture it in a
detention basin. This approach may lead ultimately to the degradation of water
quality as well as expenditure of additional resources for detaining and
managing concentrated runoff at some downstream location.
      The recommended alternative approach is to promote practices that will
minimize post- development runoff rates and volumes, which will minimize needs
for artificial conveyance and storage facilities. To simulate pre-development
hydrologic conditions, forced infiltration is often necessary to offset the
loss of infiltration by creation of impervious surfaces. The ability of the
ground to infiltrate depends upon the soil types and its conditions.
      Preserving natural hydrologic conditions requires careful alternative
site design considerations. Site design practices include preserving natural
drainage features, minimizing impervious surface area, reducing the hydraulic
connectivity of impervious surfaces, and protecting natural depression storage.
A well-designed site will contain a mix of all those features. The following
describes various techniques to achieve the alternative approach:
•   Preserving Natural Drainage Features. Protecting natural drainage features,
particularly vegetated drainage swales and channels, is desirable because of
their ability to infiltrate and attenuate flows and to filter pollutants.
However, this objective is often not accomplished in land development. In fact,
commonly held drainage philosophy encourages just the opposite pattern -
- streets and adjacent storm sewers typically are located in the natural
headwater valleys and swales, thereby replacing natural drainage functions with
a completely impervious system. As a result, runoff and pollutants generated
from impervious surfaces flow directly into storm sewers with no opportunity
for attenuation, infiltration, or filtration. Developments designed to fit site
topography also minimizes the amount of grading on site.
•   Protecting Natural Depression Storage Areas. Depression storage areas have
no surface outlet, or drain very slowly following a storm event. They can be
commonly seen as ponded areas in farm fields during the wet season or after
large runoff events. Traditional development practices eliminate these
depressions by filling or draining, thereby obliterating their ability to
reduce surface runoff volumes and trap pollutants. The volume and release-rate
characteristics of depressions should be protected in the design of the
development site. The depressions can be protected by simply avoiding the
depression or by incorporating its storage as additional capacity in required
detention facilities.
•   Avoiding Introduction of Impervious Areas. Careful site planning should
consider reducing impervious coverage to the maximum extent possible. Building
footprints, sidewalks, driveways and other features producing impervious
surfaces should be evaluated to minimize impacts on runoff:
•   Reducing the Hydraulic Connectivity of Impervious Surfaces. Impervious
surfaces are significantly less of a problem if they are not directly connected
to an impervious conveyance system (such as storm sewer). Two basic ways to
reduce hydraulic connectivity are routing of roof runoff over lawns and
reducing the use of storm sewers. Site grading should promote increasing travel
time of stormwater runoff, and should help reduce concentration of runoff to a
single point in the development.
•   Routing Roof Runoff Over Lawns. Roof runoff can be easily routed over lawns
in most site designs. The practice discourages direct connections of downspouts
to storm sewers or parking lots. The practice also discourages sloping
driveways and parking lots to the street. By routing roof drains and crowning
the driveway to run off to the lawn, the lawn is essentially used as a filter
strip.
•   Reducing the Use of Storm Sewers. By reducing use of storm sewers for
draining streets, parking lots, and back yards, the potential for accelerating
runoff from the development can be greatly reduced. The practice requires
greater use of swales and may not be practical for some development sites,
especially if there are concerns for areas that do not drain in a “reasonable”
time. The practice requires educating local citizens and public works
officials, who expect runoff to disappear shortly after a rainfall event.
•   Reducing Street Widths. Street widths can be reduced by either eliminating
on- street parking or by reducing roadway widths. Municipal planners and
traffic designers should encourage narrower neighborhood streets which
ultimately could lower maintenance.
•   Limiting Sidewalks to One Side of the Street. A sidewalk on one side of the
street may suffice in low-traffic neighborhoods. The lost sidewalk could be
replaced with bicycle/recreational trails that follow back-of-lot lines. Where
appropriate, backyard trails should be constructed using pervious materials.
•   Using Permeable Paving Materials. These materials include permeable
interlocking concrete paving blocks or porous bituminous concrete. Such
materials should be considered as alternatives to conventional pavement
surfaces, especially for low use surfaces such as driveways, overflow parking
lots, and emergency access roads.
•   Reducing Building Setbacks. Reducing building setbacks reduces driveway and
entry walks and is most readily accomplished along low-traffic streets where
traffic noise is not a problem.
•   Constructing Cluster Developments. Cluster developments can also reduce the
amount of impervious area for a given number of lots. The biggest savings is in
street length, which also will reduce costs of the development. Cluster
development clusters the construction activity onto less-sensitive areas
without substantially affecting the gross density of development.

Preliminary Site Investigation and Testing Requirements
(Ord. 473, 5/16/2007)
Required Data and Site Information: The following data shall be gathered
utilizing standard testing procedures as part of a Preliminary Site
Investigation:
•   Bedrock composition–Any apparent boundaries between carbonate and non-
carbonate bedrock must be verified by a qualified geotechnical professional.
•   Bedrock structural geology–This includes the possible presence of faults
and mapping of conspicuous fracture traces or lineaments.
•   Overburden and soil mantle composition and thickness
•   Permeability of the soil
•   Depth to the seasonal high water table
•   Presence of special geologic features–This includes sinkholes, closed
depressions, fracture traces, lineaments, joints, faults, caves , pinnacles and
geologic contacts between carbonate and non-carbonate bedrock
Preliminary Site Investigation Required for Sites Intending to Use Infiltration
Review of Available Data, Maps and Reports: Some of the required information,
as listed above, can be found in existing published data. Suggested resources
include the following:
•   Geologic maps and references for the development area
•   The Little Lehigh Creek Basin Carbonate Prototype Area Closed Depression
Map–available at the LVPC
•   USGS topographic maps
•   Lehigh and Northampton County soil survey maps
•   Aerial photographs from the LVPC or other sources
•   Relevant Pennsylvania Geologic Survey Open File Reports that provide maps
of sinkholes and Karst features for Lehigh County (OF 87-01) and Northampton
County (OF 87-02)
•   Kochanov and Reese (2003). Density of Mapped Karst Feature in South-Central
and Southeastern Pennsylvania (Map 68)
•   DCNR Online Sinkhole Inventory -
(http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/topogeo/hazards/sinkhole/default.asp)
Field Inspections: In addition to gathering data from published sources, a
field inspection of the proposed site is required. A field inspection can
provide additional information relating to site features such as carbonate
bedrock features, indicators of seasonal high stream-level or water table
levels, streams, springs, etc.
Soil Test Pit and Percolation Test Requirements: A minimum of one test pit and
a minimum of 2 percolation tests are required for every site. A test pit is a
2-3 foot wide, 8 foot deep trench excavated with a backhoe for observing
subsurface conditions. The test pits will be used to describe soil depth and
quality, including soil horizons, and testing of permeability or percolation
rates and can be conducted by a certified Sewage Enforcement Officer.
      Percolation tests are to be conducted as follows (adapted from § 73.15.
“Percolation Tests,” of the Pennsylvania Code)
   1.   The percolation tests shall be made in separate holes uniformly spaced
over the possible infiltration area.
   2.   An “Initial Presoak” should not be performed.
   3.   Percolation holes located within the possible infiltration area shall
be used in the calculation of the average percolation rate.
   4.   Holes having a uniform diameter of 6 to 10 inches shall be bored or dug
as follows:
      a.   To the depth of the bottom of the possible infiltration BMP
      b.   Alternate depths if the test pits/auger holes indicate that the
soils are more suitable at a different depth (i.e., if a clay horizon is
identified and more suitable soils are located beneath the horizon, and
infiltration test should be performed in the suitable horizon).
   5.   The bottom and sides of the hole shall be scarified with a knife blade
or sharp-pointed instrument to completely remove any smeared soil surfaces and
to provide a natural soil interface into which water may percolate. Loose
material shall be removed from the hole. Two inches of coarse sand or fine
gravel shall be placed in the bottom of the hole to protect the soil from
scouring and clogging of the pores.
   6.   Immediately before the percolation test, as a final presoak, water
shall be placed in the hole to a minimum depth of 6-inches over the gravel and
readjusted every 30 minutes for 1 hour.
   7.   The drop in the water level during the last 30 minutes of the final
presoaking period shall be applied to the following standard to determine the
time interval between readings for each percolation hole:
      a.   If water remains in the hole, the interval for readings during the
percolation test shall be 30 minutes.
      b.   If no water remains in the hole, the interval for readings during
the percolation test may be reduced to 10 minutes.
   8.   After the final presoaking period, water in the hole shall again be
adjusted to approximately 6-inches over the gravel and readjusted when
necessary after each reading.
      a.   Measurement to the water level in the individual percolation holes
shall be made from a fixed reference point and shall continue at the interval
determined from step No. 7 (above) for each individual percolation hole until a
minimum of eight readings are completed or until a stabilized rate of drop is
obtained, whichever occurs first. A stabilized rate of drop means a difference
of ¼-inch or less of drop between the highest and lowest readings of four
consecutive readings.
      b.   The drop that occurs in the final period in percolation test holes,
expressed as inches per hour, shall be used to calculate the average
percolation rate.
      c.   When the rate of drop in a percolation test is too slow to obtain a
measurable rate, the rate of 0.25 inches per hour shall be assigned to that
hole for use in calculating the average percolation rate. The infiltration area
may be placed over holes with no measurable rate when the average percolation
rate for the possible infiltration area is within the acceptable range.
      When a percolation test hole yields a percolation rate of greater than 12
inches per hour, the proposed infiltration area may not be designed or
installed within 25 feet of this hole unless the municipality determines that a
testing anomaly caused the fast percolation rate and a retest of the area
yields acceptable percolation rates. This percolation rate limit is established
to protect groundwater quality and to minimize the risk of subsidence.
Additional Site Investigation and Testing Required if Infiltration is Proposed
Soil Test Pit Requirements: The required number of test pits varies with
Effective Soil Thickness. As risk factors increase, the number of test pits
increases. A minimum of two test pits, uniformly spaced within the proposed
infiltration area (e.g., the two pits should be centered on each half of the
proposed infiltration area), are required for any site proposing infiltration
unless the applicant can demonstrate that one test pit is adequately
representative of the area proposed for infiltration. For larger infiltration
areas, multiple test pits shall be developed at the densities as listed below:
 
                Test Pit Density    Percolation Tests
Effective Soil  (per acre of        (per acre of proposed Auger Grid Spacing
Thickness (ft.) proposed            infiltration area)**  (Feet On- Center)***
                infiltration area)*
8               8                   16                    25
4 to 8          12                  24                    15
2 to 4          16                  32                    10
*No. of Test Pits required = Infiltration sq. ft./43,560 sq. ft. x test pit
density from chart rounded up to the nearest whole number
** No. of Percolation Tests required = Infiltration sq. ft./43,560 sq. x
percolation tests from chart rounded up to the nearest whole number
***Auger testing is only required on Carbonate sites.
Soil Auger Testing Requirements for Carbonate Areas: Because soil depth is not
uniform in many carbonate areas, test pits will not be sufficient to accurately
determine the depth to bedrock. Augering provides this essential data as
inexpensively as possible. Track-rig rotary soil auger test drilling allows
relatively inexpensive, qualitative determination of the presence of overburden
voids and will generally penetrate to the top-of-bedrock. Augers typically
extend to depths of 20 feet. Special augers extend to as much as 50 feet.
Augers do not extend into the bedrock. Auger testing should be performed in a
grid pattern across the proposed infiltration area, spaced as indicated in the
above table.
Percolation Testing Requirements: For each proposed infiltration area, a
minimum of six percolation tests shall be conducted with a vertical component
permeability test unless the applicant can demonstrate that fewer tests
accurately represent the percolation rate of the proposed infiltration area.
Additional testing shall be required if the initial test results show
significant variability in the vertical component percolation rate. For larger
infiltration areas, percolation tests shall be conducted at the densities
listed in the table above.
Electromagnetic Geophysics Technology Testing Requirements: For each
infiltration area, this testing technology, particularly Ground Penetrating
Radar and 2D and 3D Resitivity Imaging, shall be required to determine the
adequacy of the site to support infiltration and to minimize sinkhole
occurrence. Testing requirements and methods shall be approved by the Township
Engineer.
APPENDIX D Monocacy Creek Stormwater Management Standards
Article 1.   General Provisions.
§ 101.   Short Title.
This Appendix shall be known and may be cited as the “Monocacy Creek Stormwater
Management Ordinance” and is referred to herein as “this Appendix”.
(Ord. 641, 9/21/2022)
§ 102.   Statement of Findings.
Hanover Township Council finds that:
   A.   Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases runoff volumes, flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying
capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public
facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines flood plain management
and flood control efforts in downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, threatens public health and safety, and increases nonpoint source
pollution of water resources.
   B.   A comprehensive program of stormwater management (SWM), including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff,
is fundamental to the public health, safety, and welfare and the protection of
people of the Commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
   C.   Stormwater is an important water resource that provides groundwater
recharge for water supplies and supports the base flow of streams.
   D.   The use of green infrastructure and low impact development (LID) are
intended to address the root cause of water quality impairment by using systems
and practices which use or mimic natural processes to: 1) infiltrate and
recharge, 2) evapotranspire, and/or 3) harvest and use precipitation near where
it falls to earth. Green infrastructure practices and LID contribute to the
restoration or maintenance of pre-development hydrology.
   E.   Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are required
to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer
systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
program.
   F.   Nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems can
contribute to pollution of waters of the Commonwealth by the municipality.
(Ord. 641, 9/21/2022)
§ 103.   Purpose.
The purpose of this Appendix is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
Hanover Township and the Catasauqua Creek and Lehigh Creek Sub-Basin 4

§ 106.   Exemptions.
   A.   Impervious cover. Any proposed regulated activity, except those defined
in §
105E and §
105F, which would create 10,000 square feet or less of additional impervious
cover is exempt from the drainage plan preparation provisions of this Appendix.
All of the impervious cover added incrementally to a site above the initial
10,000 square feet shall be subject to the drainage plan preparation provisions
of this Appendix. If a site has previously received an exemption and is
proposing additional development such that the total impervious cover on the
site exceeds 10,000 square feet, the total impervious cover on the site
proposed since the original ordinance date must meet the provisions of this
Appendix.
      (1)   The date of the municipal ordinance adoption of the original
Catasauqua Creek and Lehigh Creek Sub-Basin 4 Watershed Act 167 Stormwater
Management Ordinance, October 15, 1997, shall be the starting point from which
to consider tracts as “'parent tracts” in which future subdivisions and
respective impervious area computations shall be cumulatively considered.
      (2)   For development taking place in stages, the entire development plan
must be used in determining conformance with these criteria.
      (3)   Additional impervious cover shall include, but not be limited to,
additional indoor living spaces, decks, patios, garages, driveways, storage
sheds and similar structures, any roof, parking or driveway areas and any new
streets and sidewalks constructed as part of or for the proposed regulated
activity.
      (4)   Any additional areas proposed to initially be gravel, crushed
stone, porous pavement, etc., shall be assumed to be impervious for the
purposes of comparison to the exemption criteria. Any existing gravel, crushed
stone or hard packed soil areas on a site shall be considered as pervious cover
for the purpose of exemption evaluation.
   B.   Prior drainage plan approval. Any regulated activity for which a
drainage plan was previously prepared as part of a subdivision or land
development proposal that received preliminary plan approval from the
municipality prior to the effective date of this Appendix is exempt from the
drainage plan preparation provisions of this Appendix, except as cited in §
106C, provided that the approved drainage plan included design of stormwater
facilities to control runoff from the site currently proposed for regulated
activities consistent with ordinance provisions in effect at the time of
approval and the approval has not lapsed under the Municipalities Planning
Code. If significant revisions are made to the drainage plan after both the
preliminary plan approval and the effective date of this chapter, preparation
of a new drainage plan, subject to the provisions of this Appendix, shall be
required. Significant revisions would include a change in control methods or
techniques, relocation or redesign of control measures or changes necessary
because soil or other conditions are not as stated on the original drainage
plan.
   C.   These exemptions shall not relieve the applicant from implementing such
measures as are necessary to protect health, safety, property, and state water
quality requirements. These measures include adequate and safe conveyance of
stormwater on the site and as it leaves the site. These exemptions do not
relieve the applicant from the responsibility to secure required permits or
approvals for activities regulated by any other applicable code, rule, act or
ordinance.
   D.   No exemptions shall be provided for regulated activities as defined in
§
105E and
105F.
(Ord. 641, 9/21/2022)
§ 107.   Repealer.
Any other ordinance provision(s) or regulation of the municipality inconsistent
with any of the provisions of this Appendix is hereby repealed to the extent of
the inconsistency only
(Ord. 641, 9/21/2022)
§ 108.   Severability.
In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction declares any section or
provision of this Appendix invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity
of any of the remaining provisions of this Appendix.
(Ord. 641, 9/21/2022)
§ 109.   Compatibility with Other Ordinance Requirements.
Approvals issued and actions taken under this Appendix do not relieve the
applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for
activities regulated by any other code, law, regulation or ordinance.
(Ord. 641, 9/21/2022)
§ 110.   Duty of Persons Engaged in the Development of Land.
Notwithstanding any provisions of this Appendix, including exemption and waiver
provisions, any landowner and any person engaged in the alteration or
development of land which may affect stormwater runoff characteristics shall
implement such measures as are reasonably necessary to prevent injury to
health, safety or other property. Such measures shall include such actions as
are required to manage the rate, volume, direction and quality of resulting
stormwater runoff in a manner which otherwise adequately protects health and
property from possible injury.
(Ord. 641, 9/21/2022)
§ 111.   Erroneous Permit.
Any permit or authorization issued or approved based on false, misleading or
erroneous information provided by an applicant is void without the necessity of
any proceedings for revocation. Any work undertaken or use established pursuant
to such permit or other authorization is unlawful. No action may be taken by a
board, agency or employee of the municipality purporting to validate such a
violation.
(Ord. 641, 9/21/2022)
§ 112.   Waivers.
   A.   If the municipality determines that any requirement under this Appendix
cannot be achieved for a particular regulated activity, the municipality may,
after an evaluation of alternatives, approve measures other than those in this
Appendix.
   B.   Waivers or modifications of the requirements of this Appendix may be
approved by the municipality if enforcement will exact undue hardship because
of peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question, provided that the
modifications will not be contrary to the public interest and that the purpose
of the Appendix is preserved. Cost or financial burden shall not be considered
a hardship. Modification may be considered if an alternative standard or
approach will provide equal or better achievement of the purpose of this
Appendix. A request for modifications shall be in writing and accompany the
Stormwater Management Site Plan submission. The request shall provide the facts
on which the request is based, the provision(s) of the ordinance involved and
the proposed modification.
   C.   No waiver or modification of any regulated stormwater activity
involving earth disturbance greater than or equal to one acre may be granted by
the municipality unless that action is approved in advance by the Department of
Environmental Protection (DEP) or the delegated county conservation district.

   ACCELERATED EROSION - The removal of the surface of the land through the
combined action of human activities and natural processes, at a rate greater
than would occur because of the natural processes alone.
   AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY - Activities associated with agriculture such as
agricultural cultivation, agricultural operation, and animal heavy use areas.
This includes the work of producing crops including tillage, land clearing,
plowing, disking, harrowing, planting, harvesting crops or pasturing and
raising of livestock and installation of conservation measures. Construction of
new buildings or impervious area is not considered an agricultural activity.
   APPLICANT - A landowner, developer, or other person who has filed an
application to the municipality for approval to engage in any regulated
activity at a project site in the municipality.
   BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE (BMP) - Activities, facilities, designs, measures,
or procedures used to manage stormwater impacts from regulated activities
listed in § 105, to meet state water quality requirements, to promote
groundwater recharge, and to otherwise meet the purposes of this Appendix.
Stormwater BMPs are commonly grouped into one of two broad categories or
measures: “structural” or “non-structural.” In this Appendix, non-structural
BMPs or measures refer to operational and/or behavior-related practices that
attempt to minimize the contact of pollutants with stormwater runoff, whereas
structural BMPs or measures are those that consist of a physical device or
practice that is installed to capture and treat stormwater runoff.
   Structural BMPs include, but are not limited to, a wide variety of practices
and devices, from large-scale retention ponds and constructed wetlands, to
small-scale underground treatment systems, infiltration facilities, filter
strips, low impact design, bioretention, wet ponds, permeable paving, grassed
swales, riparian or forested buffers, sand filters, detention basins, and
manufactured devices. Structural stormwater BMPs are permanent appurtenances to
the project site.

promulgated under 25 Pa. Code 102.
   CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS - Constructed wetlands are similar to wet ponds (see
below) and consist of a basin which provides for necessary stormwater storage
as well as a permanent pool or water level, planted with wetland vegetation. To
be successful, constructed wetlands must have adequate natural hydrology (both
runoff inputs as well as soils and water table which allow for maintenance of a
permanent pool of water). In these cases, the permanent pool must be designed
carefully, usually with shallow edge benches, so that water levels are
appropriate to support carefully selected wetland vegetation.
   CULVERT - A pipe, conduit or similar structure including appurtenant works
which carries surface water.
   DAM - An artificial barrier, together with its appurtenant works,
constructed for the purpose of impounding or storing water or another fluid or
semifluid or a refuse bank, fill or structure for highway, railroad or other
purposes which does or may impound water or another fluid or semifluid.
   DEP - The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.
   DESIGN STORM - The magnitude and temporal distribution of precipitation from
a storm event measured in probability of occurrence (e.g., a five-year storm)
and duration (e.g., 24 hours) used in the design and evaluation of stormwater
management systems. Also see RETURN PERIOD.
   DETENTION BASIN - A basin designed to retard stormwater runoff by
temporarily storing the runoff and releasing it at the appropriate release
rate.
   DETENTION VOLUME - The volume of runoff that is captured and released into
the waters of the Commonwealth at a controlled rate.

typically found in stormwater runoff. These land uses are listed in §
304P.
   HYDROLOGIC SOIL GROUP (HSG) - Infiltration rates of soils vary widely and
are affected by subsurface permeability as well as surface intake rates. Soils
are classified into four HSGs (A, B, C, and D) according to their minimum
infiltration rate, which is obtained for bare soil after prolonged wetting. The
NRCS defines the four groups and provides a list of most of the soils in the
United States and their group classification. The soils in the area of the
development site may be identified from a soil survey report that can be
obtained from local NRCS offices or conservation district offices. Soils become
less pervious as the HSG varies from A to D (NRCS 1,2).

tract or parcel of land by any means into two or more lots, tracts, parcels or
other divisions of land including changes in existing lot lines for the
purpose, whether immediate or future, of lease, partition by the court for
distribution to heirs or devisees, transfer of ownership or building or lot
development; provided, however, that the subdivision by lease of land for
agricultural purposes into parcels of more than ten acres, not involving any
new street or easement of access or any residential dwelling, shall be
exempted.
   SWALE - A low-lying stretch of land which gathers or carries surface water
runoff. See also “vegetated swale.”
   TECHNICAL BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE MANUAL AND INFILTRATION FEASIBILITY

swales are not considered to be water quality BMPs.
      (2)   Broad, shallow, densely vegetated, earthen channels designed to
treat stormwater while slowly infiltrating, evapotranspirating, and conveying
it. Swales should be gently sloping with low flow velocities to prevent
erosion. Check dams may be added to enhance performance.

Article III.   Stormwater Management Requirements
§ 301.   General Requirements.
   A.   For all regulated activities, unless preparation of an SWM Site Plan is
specifically exempted in §
302:
      (1)   Preparation and implementation of an approved SWM Site Plan is
required.
      (2)   No regulated activities shall commence until the municipality
issues written approval of an SWM Site Plan, which demonstrates compliance with
the requirements of this Appendix.
   B.   SWM Site Plans approved by the municipality, in accordance with § 409,
shall be on site throughout the duration of the regulated activity.
   C.   The municipality may, after consultation with DEP, approve measures for
meeting the state water quality requirements other than those in this Appendix,
provided that they meet the minimum requirements of, and do not conflict with,
state law including, but not limited to, the Clean Streams Law.
   D.   For all regulated earth disturbance activities, erosion and sediment
control BMPs shall be designed, implemented, operated, and maintained during
the regulated earth disturbance activities (e.g., during construction) to meet
the purposes and requirements of this Appendix and to meet all requirements
under Title 25 of the Pennsylvania Code and the Clean Streams Law. Various BMPs
and their design standards are listed in the Erosion and Sediment Pollution
Control Program Manual (E&S Manuals), No. 363-2134-008, as amended and updated.
   E.   Impervious areas:
      (1)   The measurement of impervious areas shall include all of the
impervious areas in the total proposed development even if development is to
take place in stages.
      (2)   For development taking place in stages, the entire development plan
must be used in determining conformance with this Appendix.
      (3)   For projects that add impervious area to a parcel, the total
impervious area on the parcel is subject to the requirements of this Appendix;
except that the volume controls in § 308 and the peak rate controls of §
309 do not need to be retrofitted to existing impervious areas that are not
being altered by the proposed regulated activity.
   F.   Stormwater flows onto adjacent property shall not be created,
increased, decreased, relocated, or otherwise altered without written
notification to the adjacent property owner(s). Such stormwater flows shall be
subject to the requirements of this Appendix.
   G.   All regulated activities shall include such measures as necessary to:
      (1)   Protect health, safety, and property.
      (2)   Meet the water quality goals of this Appendix by implementing
measures to:
         a.   Minimize disturbance to floodplains, wetlands, and wooded areas.
         b.   Maintain or extend riparian buffers.
         c.   Avoid erosive flow conditions in natural flow pathways.
         d.   Minimize thermal impacts to waters of this Commonwealth.
         e.   Disconnect impervious surfaces by directing runoff to pervious
areas, wherever possible.
      (3)   Incorporate methods described in the Pennsylvania Stormwater Best
Management Practices Manual (BMP Manual4). If methods other than green
infrastructure and LID methods are proposed to achieve the volume and rate
controls required under this Appendix, the SWM Site Plan must include a
detailed justification demonstrating that the use of LID and green
infrastructure is not practicable.
   H.   The design of all facilities over karst shall include an evaluation of
measures to minimize adverse effects.
   I.   Infiltration BMPs should be spread out, made as shallow as practicable,
and located to maximize use of natural on-site infiltration features while
still meeting the other requirements of this Appendix.
   J.   Normally dry, open top, storage facilities should completely drain both
the volume control and rate control capacities over a period of time not less
than 24 and not more than 72 hours from the end of the design storm.
   K.   The design storm volumes to be used in the analysis of peak rates of
discharge should be obtained from the latest version of the Precipitation-
Frequency Atlas of the United States, National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service, Hydrometeorological Design
Studies Center, Silver Spring, Maryland. NOAA's Atlas 145 can be accessed at:
http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/.
   L.   For all regulated activities, SWM BMPs shall be designed, implemented,
operated, and maintained to meet the purposes and requirements of this Appendix
and to meet all requirements under Title 25 of the Pennsylvania Code, the Clean
Streams Law, and the Storm Water Management Act.
   M.   Various BMPs and their design standards are listed in the BMP Manual4.
   N.   Where a site is traversed by watercourses other than those for which a
100-year floodplain is defined by the municipality, there shall be provided
drainage easements conforming substantially with the line of such watercourses.
The width of any easement shall be adequate to provide for unobstructed flow of
storm runoff based on calculations made in conformance with § 306 for the 100-
year return period runoff and to provide a freeboard allowance of 0.5 foot
above the design water surface level. The terms of the easement shall prohibit
excavation, the placing of fill or structures, and any alterations which may
adversely affect the flow of stormwater within any portion of the easement.
Also, periodic maintenance of the easement to ensure proper runoff conveyance
shall be required. Watercourses for which the 100-year floodplain is formally
defined are subject to the applicable municipal floodplain regulations.
      (1)   When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural
drainage swales on the site cannot adequately provide for drainage, open
channels may be constructed conforming substantially to the line and grade of
such natural drainage swales. Capacities of open channels shall be calculated
using the Manning Equation.
   P.   Techniques described in Appendix F (Low-Impact Development) of this
chapter are encouraged because they reduce the costs of complying with the
requirements of this Appendix and the state water quality requirements.
   Q.   Infiltration for stormwater management is encouraged where soils and
geology permit, consistent with the provisions of this Appendix and, where
appropriate, the Recommendation Chart for Infiltration Stormwater Management
BMPs in Carbonate Bedrock in Appendix D. Infiltration is encouraged for
capturing and treating the water quality volume (as calculated in §
304) any part of the water quality volume or for otherwise meeting the purposes
of this Appendix.
(Ord. 641, 9/21/2022)
§ 302.   Permit Requirements by Other Government Entities.
The following permit requirements apply to certain regulated and earth
disturbance activities and must be met prior to commencement of regulated and
earth disturbance activities, as applicable:
   A.   All regulated and earth disturbance activities subject to permit
requirements by DEP under regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102.
   B.   Work within natural drainageways subject to permit by DEP under 25 Pa.
Code Chapter 102 and Chapter 105.
   C.   Any stormwater management facility that would be located in or adjacent
to surface waters of the commonwealth, including wetlands, subject to permit by
DEP under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105.
   D.   Any stormwater management facility that would be located on a state
highway right-of-way or require access from a state highway shall be subject to
approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT).
   E.   Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must pass
or convey flows from the tributary area and any facility which may constitute a
dam subject to permit by DEP under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105.
(Ord. 641, 9/21/2022)
§ 303.   Erosion and Sediment Control During Regulated Earth Disturbance
Activities.
   A.   No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall
commence until approval by the municipality of an erosion and sediment control
plan for construction activities. Written approval by DEP or a delegated County
Conservation District shall satisfy this requirement.
   B.   An erosion and sediment control plan is required by DEP regulations for
any earth disturbance activity of 5,000 square feet or more under 25 Pa. Code §
102.4(b).
   C.   A DEP NPDES stormwater discharges associated with construction
activities permit is required for regulated earth disturbance activities under
25 Pa. Code Chapter 92a.
   D.   s) for regulated earth disturbance activities from the appropriate DEP
regional office or County Conservation District must be provided to the
municipality before the commencement of an earth disturbance activity.   
   E.   A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan and any permit, as
required by DEP regulations, shall be available at the project site at all
times.
(Ord. 641, 9/21/2022)
§ 304.   Post Construction Water Quality Criteria.
   A.   No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall
commence until approval by the municipality of a drainage plan which
demonstrates compliance with this Appendix. This Appendix provides standards to
meet NPDES permit requirements associated with construction activities and MS4
permit requirements.
   B.   The water quality volume (WQv) shall be captured and treated. The WQv
shall be calculated two ways.
      (1)   First, WQv shall be calculated using the following formula:
               MQv = (c)(P)(A)/12
         Where:
         WQv       =   Water quality volume in acre-feet
         c      =   Rational Method post-development runoff coefficient for the
two-year storm
         P      =   1.25 inches
         A      =   Area in acres of proposed regulated activity
      (2)   Second, the WQv shall be calculated as the difference in runoff
volume from predevelopment to post-development for the two-year return period
storm. The effect of closed depressions on the site shall be considered in this
calculation. The larger of these two calculated volumes shall be used as the
WQv to be captured and treated, except that in no case shall the WQv be
permitted to exceed 1.25 inches of runoff over the site area. This standard
does not limit the volume of infiltration an applicant may propose for purposes
of water quantity/ peak rate control.
   C.   The WQv shall be calculated for each post-development drainage
direction on a site for sizing BMPs. Site areas having no impervious cover and
no proposed disturbance during development may be excluded from the WQv
calculations and do not require treatment.
   D.   If an applicant is proposing to use a dry extended detention basin, wet
pond, constructed wetland or other BMP that ponds water on the land surface and
may receive direct sunlight, the discharge from that BMP must be treated by
infiltration, a vegetated buffer, filter strip, bioretention, vegetated swale
or other BMP that provides a thermal benefit to protect the high quality waters
of the Catasauqua Creek and Lehigh Creek Sub-Basin 4 Watersheds, from thermal
impacts.
   E.   The WQv for a site as a result of the regulated activities must either
be treated with infiltration or two acceptable BMPs such as those listed in §
303, except for minor areas on the periphery of the site that cannot reasonably
be drained to an infiltration facility or other BMP.
   F.   Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed on fill unless the applicant
demonstrates that the fill is stable and otherwise meets the infiltration BMP
standards of this Appendix.
   G.   The applicant shall document the bedrock type(s) present on the site
from published sources. Any apparent boundaries between carbonate and
noncarbonate bedrock shall be verified through more detailed site evaluations
by a qualified geotechnical professional.
   H.   For each proposed regulated activity in the watershed where an
applicant intends to use infiltration BMPs, the applicant shall conduct a
preliminary site investigation, including gathering data from published
sources, a field inspection of the site, a minimum of one test pit and a
minimum of two percolation tests, as outlined in
Appendix G.12 This investigation will determine depth to bedrock, depth to the
seasonal high water table, soil permeability and location of special geologic
features, if applicable. This investigation may be done by a certified Sewage
Enforcement Officer (SEO) except that the location(s) of special geologic
features shall be verified by a qualified geotechnical professional.
   I.   Sites where applicants intend to use infiltration BMPs must meet the
following criteria:
      (1)   Depth to bedrock below the invert of the BMP greater than or equal
to two feet.
      (2)   Depth to seasonal high water table below the invert of the BMP
greater than or equal to three feet; except for infiltration of residential
roof runoff where the seasonal high water table must be below the invert of the
BMP. (If the depth to bedrock is between two feet and three feet and the
evidence of the seasonal high water table is not found in the soil, no further
testing to locate the depth to seasonal high water table is required.)
      (3)   Soil permeability (as measured by the adapted 25 Pa. Code § 73.15
percolation test in
Appendix G) greater than or equal to 0.5 inches/hour and less than or equal to
12 inches per hour.
      (4)   Setback distances or buffers as follows:
         a.   One hundred feet from water supply wells.
         b.   Fifteen feet downgradient or 100 feet upgradient from building
foundations; except for residential development where the required set back is
15 feet downgradient or 40 feet upgradient from building foundations.
         c.   Fifty feet from septic system drainfields; except for residential
development where the required setback is 25 feet from septic system
drainfields.
         d.   Fifty feet from a geologic contact with carbonate bedrock unless
a preliminary site investigation is done in the carbonate bedrock to show the
absence of special geologic features within 50 feet of the proposed
infiltration area.
         e.   One hundred feet from the property line unless documentation is
provided to show that all setbacks from existing or potential future wells,
foundations and drainfields on neighboring properties will be met; except for
one and two family residential dwellings where the required setback is 40 feet
unless documentation is provided to show that all setbacks from existing or
potential future wells, foundations and drainfields on neighboring properties
will be met.
   J.   For entirely noncarbonate sites, the recharge volume (REv) shall be
infiltrated unless the applicant demonstrates that it is infeasible to
infiltrate the REv for reasons of seasonal high water table, permeability rate,
soil depth or setback distances; or except as provided in § 363-16U.
      (1)   The REv shall be calculated as follows:
               REv = (0.25) * (l)/12
         Where:
            REv      =   Recharge volume in acre- feet
            I      =   Impervious area in acres
      (2)   The preliminary site investigation described in §
303H is required and shall continue on different areas of the site until a
potentially suitable infiltration location is found or the entire site is
determined to be infeasible for infiltration. For infiltration areas that
appear to be feasible based on the preliminary site investigation, the
Additional Site Investigation and Testing as outlined in
Appendix G13 shall be completed.
      (3)   If an applicant proposes infiltration, the municipality may
determine infiltration to be infeasible if there are known existing conditions
or problems that may be worsened by the use of infiltration.
      (4)   The site must meet the conditions listed in §
304I.
      (5)   If it is not feasible to infiltrate the full REv, the applicant
shall infiltrate that portion of the REv that is feasible based on the site
characteristics. If none of the REv can be infiltrated, REv shall be considered
as part of the WQv and shall be captured and treated as described in §
304O.
      (6)   If REv is infiltrated, it may be subtracted from the WQv required
to be captured and treated.
   K.   Entirely carbonate areas.
      (1)   In entirely carbonate areas, where the applicant intends to use
infiltration BMPs, the preliminary site investigation described in §
304H shall be conducted. For infiltration areas that appear feasible based on
the preliminary site investigation, the applicant shall conduct the additional
site investigation and testing as outlined in
Appendix G. The soil depth, percolation rate and proposed loading rate, each
weighted as described in §
307, along with the buffer from special geologic features shall be compared to
the Recommendation
         Chart for Infiltration Stormwater Management BMPs in Carbonate Bedrock
in Appendix D14to determine if the site is recommended for infiltration. In
addition to the recommendation from Appendix D, the conditions listed in §
304I are required for infiltration in carbonate areas.
      (2)   Applicants are encouraged to infiltrate the REv, as calculated in §
304J, but are not required to use infiltration BMPs on a carbonate site even if
the site falls in the recommended range on the chart in Appendix D. Any amount
of volume infiltrated can be subtracted from the WQv to be treated by
noninfiltration BMPs. If infiltration is not proposed, the full WQv shall be
treated by two acceptable BMPs, as specified in §
304O.
   L.   If a site has both carbonate and noncarbonate areas, the applicant
shall investigate the ability of the noncarbonate portion of the site to fully
meet this Appendix to meet the requirements for REv for the whole site through
infiltration. If that proves infeasible, infiltration in the carbonate area as
described in §
304K or two other noninfiltration BMPs as described in §
3040 must be used. No infiltration structure in the noncarbonate area shall be
located within 50 feet of a boundary with carbonate bedrock, except when a
preliminary site investigation has been done showing the absence of special
geologic features within 50 feet of the proposed infiltration area.
   M.   If infiltration BMPs are proposed in carbonate areas, the post-
development two- year runoff volume leaving the site shall be 80% or more of
the predevelopment runoff volume for the carbonate portion of the site to
prevent infiltration of volumes far in excess of the predevelopment
infiltration volume.
   N.   Site areas proposed for infiltration shall be protected from
disturbance and compaction except as necessary for construction of infiltration
BMPs.
   O.   If infiltration of the entire WQv is not proposed, the remainder of the
WQv shall be treated by two acceptable BMPs in series for each discharge
location. Sheet flow draining across a pervious area can be considered as one
BMP. Sheet flow across impervious areas and concentrated flow shall flow
through two BMPs. If sheet flow from an impervious area is to be drained across
a pervious area as one BMP, the length of the pervious area must be equal to or
greater than the length of impervious area. In no case may the same BMP be
employed consecutively to meet the requirement of this section. Acceptable BMPs
are listed below along with the recommended reference for design.

infiltration is proposed, the site and BMP will be subject to the testing and
other infiltration requirements in this Appendix.
   B   If this BMP is used to treat the entire WQv then it is the only BMP
required because of this BMPs superior water quality performance.
   C   See table below.
   D   Water quality inlets include such BMPs as oil/water separators, sediment
traps/catch basin sumps, and trash/debris collectors in catch basins.

A   These numbers refer to the Design Reference Title Chart in §
304O above.
   Q.   The use of infiltration BMPs is prohibited on hot spot land use areas.
   R.   Stormwater infiltration BMPs shall not be placed in or on a special
geologic feature(s). Additionally, stormwater runoff shall not be discharged
into existing on- site sinkholes.
   S.   Applicants shall request, in writing, public water suppliers to provide
the Zone I wellhead protection radius, as calculated by the method outlined in
the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection wellhead protection
regulations, for any public water supply well within 400 feet of the site. In
addition to the setback distances specified in §
304I, infiltration is prohibited in the Zone I radius as defined and
substantiated by the public water supplier in writing. If the applicant does
not receive a response from the public water supplier, the Zone I radius is
assumed to be 100 feet.
   T.   The volume and rate of the net increase in stormwater runoff from the
regulated activities must be managed to prevent the physical degradation of
receiving waters from such effects as scour and stream bank destabilization, to
satisfy state water quality requirements, by controlling the two-year
postdevelopment runoff to a 30% release rate.
   U.   The municipality may, after consultation with DEP, approve alternative
methods for meeting the state water quality requirements other than those in
this section, provided that they meet the minimum requirements of and do not
conflict with state law, including but not limited to the Clean Streams Law.
(Ord. 641, 9/21/2022)
§ 305.   Stormwater Management Districts.
   A.   Mapping of stormwater management districts. To implement the provisions
of the Catasauqua Creek and Lehigh Creek Sub-Basin 4 Watersheds Stormwater
Management Plan, the municipality is hereby divided into Stormwater Management
Districts consistent with the Catasauqua Creek and Lehigh Creek Sub-Basin 4
Watersheds Release Rate Map presented in the Plan Update. The boundaries of the
stormwater management districts are shown on an official map which is available
for inspection at the municipal office. A copy of the Official Map at a reduced
scale is included in
Appendix A for general reference.
   B.   Description of stormwater management districts. Two types of stormwater
management districts may be applicable to the municipality, namely conditional/
provisional no detention districts and dual release rate districts, as
described below.
      (1)   Conditional/provisional no detention districts. Within these
districts, the capacity of the local runoff conveyance facilities (as defined
in Article II) must be calculated to determine if adequate capacity exists. For
this determination, the developer must calculate peak flows assuming that the
site is developed as proposed and that the remainder of the local watershed is
in the existing condition. The developer must also calculate peak flows
assuming that the entire local watershed is developed per current zoning and
that all new development would use the runoff controls specified by this
Appendix. The larger of the two peak flows calculated will be used in
determining if adequate capacity exists. If adequate capacity exists to safely
transport runoff from the site to the main channel (as defined in Article II),
these watershed areas may discharge post-development peak runoff without
detention facilities. If the capacity calculations show that the local runoff
conveyance facilities lack adequate capacity, the developer shall either use a
100% release rate control or provide increased capacity of downstream elements
to convey increased peak flows consistent with §
305P.' Any capacity improvements must be designed to convey runoff from
development of all areas tributary to the improvement consistent with the
capacity criteria specified in By definition, a storm drainage problem area
associated with the local runoff conveyance facilities indicates that adequate
capacity does not exist. Sites in these districts are still required to meet
all of the water quality requirements in §
304.
      (2)   Dual release rate districts. Within these districts, the two-year
postdevelopment peak discharge must be controlled to 30% of the predevelopment
two-year runoff peak. Further, the ten-, twenty-five- and 100-year post-
development peak runoff must be controlled to the stated percentage of the
predevelopment peak. Release rates associated with the ten- through 100-year
events vary from 50% to 100% depending upon location in the watershed.
(Ord. 641, 9/21/2022)
§ 306.   Stormwater Management District Implementation Provisions.
   A.   Applicants shall provide a comparative pre- and post-construction
stormwater management hydrograph analysis for each direction of discharge and
for the site overall to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this
Appendix.
   B.   Any stormwater management controls required by this Appendix and
subject to a dual release rate criteria shall meet the applicable release rate
criteria for each of the two-, ten-, twenty-five- and 100-year return period
runoff events consistent with the calculation methodology specified in §
307.
   C.   The exact location of the stormwater management district boundaries as
they apply to a given development site shall be determined by mapping the
boundaries using the two-foot topographic contours provided as part of the
drainage plan. The district boundaries as originally drawn coincide with
topographic divides or, in certain instances, are drawn from the intersection
of the watercourse and a physical feature such as the confluence with another
watercourse or a potential flow obstruction (e.g., road, culvert, bridge,
etc.). The physical feature is the downstream limit of the subarea and the
subarea boundary is drawn from that point up slope to each topographic divide
along the path perpendicular to the contour lines.
   D.   Any downstream capacity analysis conducted in accordance with this
Appendix shall use the following criteria for determining adequacy for
accepting increased peak flow rates:
      (1)   Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey the
increased runoff associated with a two-year return period event within their
banks at velocities consistent with protection of the channels from erosion.
      (2)   Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey the
increased twenty-five-year return period runoff without creating any hazard to
persons or property.
      (3)   Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must
pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in accordance
with DEP Chapter 105 regulations (if applicable) and, at minimum, pass the
increased twenty-five-year return period runoff.
   E.   For a proposed development site located within one release rate
category subarea, the total runoff from the site shall meet the applicable
release rate criteria. For development sites with multiple directions of runoff
discharge, individual drainage directions may be designed for up to a 100%
release rate so long as the total runoff from the site is controlled to the
applicable release rate.
   F.   For a proposed development site located within two or more release
category subareas, the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall be the
predevelopment peak discharge for that subarea multiplied by the applicable
release rate. The calculated peak discharges shall apply regardless of whether
the grading plan changes the drainage area by subarea. An exception to the
above may be granted if discharges from multiple subareas recombine in
proximity to the site. In this case, peak discharge in any direction may be a
100% release rate provided that the overall site discharge meets the weighted
average release rate.
   G.   For a proposed development site located partially within a release rate
category subarea and partially within a conditional/provisional no detention
subarea, the size of the predevelopment drainage area on a site may not be
changed post- development to create potentially adverse conditions on
downstream properties except as part of a no harm or hardship waiver procedure.
   H.   No portion of a site may be regraded between any Hanover Township
watersheds, and any adjacent watershed except as part of a “no harm” or
hardship waiver procedure.
   I.   Within a release rate category area, for a proposed development site
which has areas which drain to a closed depression(s), the design release from
the site will be the lesser of a) the applicable release rate flow assuming no
closed depression(s) or b) the existing peak flow actually leaving the site. In
cases where b) would result in an unreasonably small design release, the design
discharge of less than or equal to the release rate will be determined by the
available downstream conveyance capacity to the main channel calculated using §
306D and the minimum orifice criteria.
   J.   Off-site areas which drain through a proposed development site are not
subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable peak runoff rates.
However, on-site drainage facilities shall be designed to safely convey offsite
flows through the development site using the capacity criteria in §
306D and the detention criteria in §
307.
   K.   For development sites proposed to take place in phases, all detention
ponds shall be designed to meet the applicable release rate(s) applied to all
site areas tributary to the proposed pond discharge direction. All site
tributary areas will be assumed as developed, regardless of whether all site
tributary acres are proposed for development at that time. An exception shall
be sites with multiple detention ponds in series where only the downstream pond
must be designed to the stated release rate.
   L.   Where the site area to be impacted by a proposed development activity
differs significantly from the total site area, only the proposed impact area
shall be subject to the release rate criteria. The impact area includes any
proposed cover or grading changes.
   M.   Development proposals which, through groundwater recharge or other
means, do not increase either the rate or volume of runoff discharged from the
site compared to predevelopment are not subject to the release rate provisions
of this Appendix.
   N.   No harm water quantity option. For any proposed development site not
located in a conditional/provisional no detention district, the developer has
the option of using a less restrictive runoff control (including no detention)
if the developer can prove that special circumstances exist for the proposed
development site and that no harm would be caused by discharging at a higher
runoff rate than that specified by the plan. Special circumstances are defined
as any hydrologic or hydraulic aspects of the development itself not
specifically considered in the development of the plan runoff control strategy.
   O.   Proof of no harm would have to be shown from the development site
through the remainder of the downstream drainage network to the confluence of
the creek with the Delaware or Lehigh River. Proof of no harm must be shown
using the capacity criteria specified in §
306 if downstream capacity analysis is a part of the no harm justification.
      (1)   Attempts to prove no harm based upon downstream peak flow versus
capacity analysis shall be governed by the following provisions:
         a.   The peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the
design return period storms (two-, ten-, twenty-five- and 100-year) shall be
the values from the calibrated PSRM Model for the Catasauqua Creek and Lehigh
River Sub-basin 4 Watersheds or as calculated by an applicant using an
alternate method acceptable to the municipality. The flow values from the PSRM
Model would be supplied to the developer by the municipality upon request.
         b.   Any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system as
documented by a developer may be used by the developer only in proportion to
his development site acreage relative to the total upstream undeveloped acreage
from the identified capacity (i.e., if his site is 10% of the upstream
undeveloped acreage, he may use up to 10% of the documented downstream
available capacity).
         c.   Developer-proposed runoff controls which would generate increased
peak flow rates at storm drainage problem areas would, by definition, be
precluded from successful attempts to prove no harm, except in conjunction with
proposed capacity improvements for the problem areas consistent with §
306P.
      (2)   Any no harm justifications shall be submitted by the developer as
part of the drainage plan submission per Article IV. Developers submitting no
harm justifications must still meet all of the water quality requirements in §
304.
   O.   Regional detention alternatives. For certain areas within the study
area, it may be more cost-effective to provide one control facility for more
than one development site than to provide an individual control facility for
each development site. The initiative and funding for any regional runoff
control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective developers. The
design of any regional control basins must incorporate reasonable development
of the entire upstream watershed. The peak outflow of a regional basin would be
determined based on the required release rate at the point of discharge.
   P.   Capacity improvements. In certain instances, primarily within the
conditional/ provisional no detention areas, local drainage conditions may
dictate more stringent levels of runoff control than those based upon
protection of the entire watershed. In these instances, if the developer could
prove that it would be feasible to provide capacity improvements to relieve the
capacity deficiency in the local drainage network, then the capacity
improvements could be provided by the developer in lieu of runoff controls on
the development site. Peak flow calculations shall be done assuming that the
local watershed is in the existing condition and then assuming that the local
watershed is developed per current zoning and using the specified runoff
controls. Any capacity improvements would be designed using the larger of the
above peak flows and the capacity criteria specified in §
306. All new development in the entire subarea(s) within which the proposed
development site is located shall be assumed to implement the developer's
proposed discharge control, if any. Capacity improvements may also be provided
as necessary to implement any regional detention alternatives or to implement a
modified no harm option which proposes specific capacity improvements to
provide that a less stringent discharge control would not create any harm
downstream.
(Ord. 641, 9/21/2022)
§ 307.   Calculation Methodology.
   A.   Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using
either the rational method or the soil-cover-complex methodology.
   B.   Infiltration BMP loading rate percentages.
      (1)   Infiltration BMP loading rate percentages in the Recommendation
Chart for Infiltration Stormwater Management BMPs in Carbonate Bedrock in
Appendix D17 shall be calculated as follows:
            (Area tributary to infiltration BMP)
                           *100%
            (Base area of infiltration BMP)
       (2)   The area tributary to the infiltration BMP shall be weighted as
follows:
         a.   All disturbed areas to be made impervious: weight at 100%,
         b.   All disturbed areas to be made pervious: weight at 50%,
         c.   All undisturbed pervious areas: weight at 0%,
         d.   All existing impervious areas: weight at 100%.
   C.   Soil thickness.
      (1)   Soil thickness is to be measured from the bottom of any proposed
infiltration system. The effective soil thickness in the Recommendation Chart
for Infiltration Stormwater Management BMPs in Carbonate Bedrock in Appendix D
is the measured soil thickness multiplied by the thickness factor based on soil
permeability (as measured by the adapted 25 Pa. Code § 73.15 percolation test
in Appendix G10), as follows:
 
Permeability Range*     Thickness Factor
6.0 to 12.0 inches/hour 0.8
2.0 to 6.0 inches/hour  1.0
1.0 to 2.0 inches/hour  1.4
0.75 to 1,0 inches/hour 1.2
0.5 to 0.75 inches/hour 1.0
 
      NOTES:
         * If the permeability rate (as measured by the adapted 25 Pa. Code §
73.15 percolation test in Appendix G) falls on a break between two thickness
factors, the smaller thickness factor shall be used.
      (2)   Sites with soil permeability greater than 12.0 in/hr or less than
0.5 in/hr, as measured by the adapted 25 PA\a. Code § 73.15 percolation test in
Appendix G, are not recommended for infiltration.
   D.   The design of any detention basin intended to meet the requirements of
this Appendix shall be verified by routing the design storm hydrograph through
the proposed basin using the storage indication method or other methodology
demonstrated to be more appropriate. For basins designed using the Rational
Method technique, the design hydrograph for routing shall be either the
Universal Rational Hydrograph or the Modified Rational Method trapezoidal
hydrograph which maximizes detention volume. Use of the Modified Rational
hydrograph shall be consistent with the procedure described in Section PI PE.
RAT of the Users' Manual for the Penn State Urban Hydrology Model (1987).
   E.   BMPs designed to store or infiltrate runoff and discharge to surface
runoff or pipe flow shall be routed using the storage indication method.
   F.   BMPs designed to store or infiltrate runoff and discharge to surface
runoff or pipe flow shall provide storage volume for the full WQv below the
lowest outlet invert.
   G.   Wet detention ponds designed to have a permanent pool for the WQv shall
assume that the permanent pool volume below the primary outlet is full at the
beginning of design event routing for the purposes of evaluating peak outflows.
   H.   All stormwater detention facilities shall provide a minimum 1.0 foot
freeboard above the maximum pool elevation associated with the two- through 25-
year runoff events. A 0.5 foot freeboard shall be provided above the maximum
pool elevation of the 100-year runoff event. The freeboard shall be measured
from the maximum pool elevation to the invert of the emergency spillway. The
two- through 100-year storm events shall be controlled by the primary outlet
structure. An emergency spillway for each basin shall be designed to pass the
100-year return frequency storm peak basin inflow rate with a minimum 0.5 foot
freeboard measured to the top of basin. The freeboard criteria shall be met
considering any off-site areas tributary to the basin as developed, as
applicable. If this detention facility is considered to be a dam as per DEP
Chapter 105, the design of the facility must be consistent with the Chapter 105
regulations and may be required to pass a storm greater than the 100-year
event.
   I.   The minimum circular orifice diameter for controlling discharge rates
from detention facilities shall be three inches. Designs where a lesser size
orifice would be required to fully meet release rates shall be acceptable with
a three-inch orifice, provided that as much of the site runoff as practical is
directed to the detention facilities. The minimum three-inch diameter does not
apply to the control of the WQv.
   J.   Runoff calculations using the Soil-Cover-Complex Method shall use the
Natural Resources Conservation Service Type II 24-hour rainfall distribution.
The 24-hour rainfall depths for the various return periods to be used
consistent with this Appendix shall be taken from the latest version of the
Precipitation-Frequency Atlas of the United States, National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service,
Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center, Silver Spring, Maryland. A graphical
and tabular presentation of the Type II- 24-hour distribution is included in
Appendix C.
   K.   Runoff calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall
intensities consistent with appropriate times of concentration and return
periods and NOAA Atlas 14, Volume 2 Version 2.1,2004 or the Intensity-Duration-
Frequency Curves as presented in Appendix C.
   L.   Runoff curve numbers (CNs) to be used in the Soil-Cover-Complex Method
shall be based upon the matrix presented in
Appendix C.
   M.   Runoff coefficients for use in the Rational Method shall be based upon
the table presented in
Appendix C.
   N.   All time of concentration calculations shall use a segmental approach
which may include one or all of the flow types below:
      (1)   Sheet flow (overland flow) calculations shall use either the NRCS
average velocity chart (Figure 3-1, Technical Release-55, 1975) or the modified
kinematic wave travel time equation (Equation 3-3, NRCS TR-55, June 1986). If
using the modified kinematic wave travel time equation, the sheet flow length
shall be limited to 50 feet for designs using the Rational Method and limited
to 150 feet for designs using the Soil-Cover-Complex Method.
      (2)   Shallow concentrated flow travel times shall be determined from the
watercourse slope, type of surface and the velocity from Figure 3-1 of TR-55,
June 1986.
      (3)   Open channel flow travel times shall be determined from velocities
calculated by the Manning Equation. Bankfull flows shall be used for
determining velocities. Manning 'n* values shall be based on the table
presented in
Appendix C.
      (4)   Pipe flow travel times shall be determined from velocities
calculated using the Manning Equation assuming full flow and the Manning 'n'
values from
Appendix C.
   O.   If using the Rational Method, all predevelopment calculations for a
given discharge direction shall be based on a common time of concentration
considering both onsite and any off-site drainage areas. If using the Rational
Method, all postdevelopment calculations for a given discharge direction shall
be based on a common time of concentration considering both on-site and any
off-site drainage areas.
   P.   The Manning Equation shall be used to calculate the capacity of
watercourses. Manning 'n' values used in the calculations shall be consistent
with the table presented in Appendix C20 or other appropriate standard
engineering 'n' value resources. Pipe capacities shall be determined by methods
acceptable to the municipality.
   Q.   The Pennsylvania DEP Chapter 105 rules and regulations apply to the
construction, modification, operation or maintenance of both existing and
proposed dams, water obstructions and encroachments throughout the watershed.
Criteria for design and construction of stormwater management facilities
according to this Appendix may differ from the criteria that are used in the
permitting of dams under the Dam Safety Program.
(Ord. 641, 9/21/2022)
§ 308.   Volume Controls.
The green infrastructure and low impact development practices provided in the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's Pennsylvania Stormwater
Best Management Practices Manual (December 2006), as amended and updated, shall
be utilized for all regulated activities wherever possible. Water volume
controls shall be implemented using the Design Storm Method in Subsection A or
the Simplified Method in Subsection B below. For regulated activity areas equal
or less than one acre that do not require hydrologic routing to design the
stormwater facilities, this Appendix establishes no preference for either
methodology; therefore, the applicant may select either methodology on the
basis of economic considerations, the intrinsic limitations on applicability of
the analytical procedures associated with each methodology and other factors.
   A.   The Design Storm Method [CG-1 in the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection's Pennsylvania Stormwater Best Management Practices
Manual (December 2006), as amended and updated] is applicable to any size of
regulated activity. This method requires detailed modeling based on site
conditions.
      (1)   Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the 2-year 24 hour duration precipitation.
      (2)   For modeling purposes:
         (a)   Existing (predevelopment) non-forested pervious areas must be
considered meadow in good condition.
         (b)   Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present, shall
be considered meadow in good condition in the model for existing conditions.
   B.   The Simplified Method [CG-2 in the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection's Pennsylvania Stormwater Best Management Practices
Manual (December 2006), as amended and updated] provided below is independent
of site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm Method is not
followed. This method is not applicable to regulated activities greater than
one acre or for projects that require design of stormwater storage facilities.
For new impervious surfaces:
      (1)   Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two (2)
inches of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
      (2)   At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious surfaces
shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it shall not be
released into the surface waters of this Commonwealth. Removal options include
reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration.
      (3)   Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed runoff; however, in
all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the permanently removed runoff should
be infiltrated.
      (4)   This method is exempt from the requirements of §
307.

See section § 306. for details on Rate Controls.
(Ord. 641, 9/21/2022)
§ 310.   Riparian Buffers.
   A.   In order to protect and improve water quality, a riparian buffer
easement shall be created and recorded as part of any subdivision or land
development that encompasses a riparian buffer.
   B.   Except as required by Chapter 102, the Riparian Buffer Easement shall
be measured to be the greater of the limit of the 100 year floodplain or a
minimum of 35 feet from the top of the streambank (on each side).
   C.   Minimum Management Requirements for Riparian Buffers.
      (1)   Existing native vegetation shall be protected and maintained within
the riparian buffer easement.
      (2)   Whenever practicable invasive vegetation shall be actively removed
and the riparian buffer easement shall be planted with native trees, shrubs and
other vegetation to create a diverse native plant community appropriate to the
intended ecological context of the site.
   D.   The riparian buffer easement shall be enforceable by the municipality
and shall be recorded in the appropriate County Recorder of Deeds Office, so
that it shall run with the land and shall limit the use of the property located
therein. The easement shall allow for the continued private ownership and shall
count toward the minimum lot area a required by zoning, unless otherwise
specified in the municipal Zoning Ordinance.
   E.   Any permitted use within the riparian buffer easement shall be
conducted in a manner that will maintain the extent of the existing 100-year
floodplain, improve or maintain the stream stability, and preserve and protect
the ecological function of the floodplain.
   F.   The following conditions shall apply when public and/or private
recreation trails are permitted within riparian buffers:
      (1)   Trails shall be for non-motorized use only.
      (2)   Trails shall be designed to have the least impact on native plant
species and other sensitive environmental features.
   G.   Septic drainfields and sewage disposal systems shall not be permitted
within the riparian buffer easement and shall comply with setback requirements
established under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 73.

For any of the regulated activities of this Appendix, prior to the final
approval of subdivision and/or land development plans or the issuance of any

Municipal Engineer, Municipal Solicitor and Lehigh Valley Planning Commission.
The request shall fully document the nature of the alleged hardship.
   B.   The municipality may grant a waiver, provided that all of the following
findings are made in a given case:
      (1)   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or
other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions, and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of this Appendix in the
stormwater management district in which the property is located;
      (2)   That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of this Appendix, including the no harm provisions, and that the
authorization of a waiver is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use
of the property;

involving earth disturbance greater than or equal to one acre may be granted by
the municipality unless that action is approved in advance by the Department of
Environment Protection (DEP) or the delegated county conservation district.
      (4)   That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant;
      (5)   That the waiver, if authorized, will represent the minimum waiver
that will afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of
the regulation in issue; and
      (6)   That financial hardship is not the criteria for granting of a
hardship waiver,
   C.   In granting any waiver, the municipality may attach such conditions and
safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this Appendix.
If a hardship waiver is granted, the applicant must still manage the quantity,
velocity, direction and quality of resulting storm runoff as is necessary to
prevent injury to health, safety or other property.

§ 204. Duty of Employers to Collect.
   1.   Each employer within the Township, as well as those employers situated
outside the Township but who engage in business within the Township, is hereby
charged with the duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged
by him or performing for him within the Township and making a return and
payment thereof to the collector. Further, each employer is hereby authorized
to deduct this tax for each employee in his or her employ, whether said
employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and whether or not all such
services are performed within the Township.
   2.   A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro
rata share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person for a
payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax levied for
the calendar year by the number of payroll periods established by the employer
for the calendar year. For purposes of determining the pro rata share, an
employer shall round down the amount of the tax collected each payroll period
to the nearest one-hundredth (1/100) of a dollar. Collection of the tax shall
be made on a payroll period basis for each payroll period in which the person
is engaging in an occupation, except as provided in subsection (4) of this
Section. For purposes of this subsection, “combined rate” shall mean the
aggregate annual rate of the tax levied by the school district and the
municipality.
   3.   No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one (1) municipality during each payroll period.
   4.   In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement from a
principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the length of the
payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a statement from the
employee that the pay statement is from the employee’s principal employer and
the employee will notify other employers of a change in principal place of
employment within two (2) weeks of its occurrence. The employee’s statement
shall be provided on the form approved by DCED.
   5.   The tax shall be no more than fifty-two dollars ($52.00) on each person
for each calendar year, irrespective of the number of municipalities within
which a person maybe employed. The Township shall provide a taxpayer a receipt
of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
   6.   No employer shall he held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for
the payment of the withheld tax money to the Township if the failure to
withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the employee as
to the employee’s place or plates of employment, the employee’s principal
office or where the employee is principally employed. Further, an employer
shall not be liable for payment of the local services tax in an amount
exceeding the amount withheld by the employer if the employer complies with the
provisions of subsection (2) of this Part and this Section and remits the
amount so withheld in accordance with this Part.
   7.   Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes thirty
(30) days after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
(Ord. 488, 10/15/2008, § 1)
§ 205. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the tax
on forms to be supplied to the employer by the collector. If an employer fails
to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her to
an employee, except as provided hereafter in this Part, the employer shall be
responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had been
originally levied against the employer.
(Ord. 488, 10/15/2008, § 1)
§ 206. Dates for Determining Tax Liability and Payment.

of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
(Ord. 488, 10/15/2008, § 1)
§ 207. Self-Employed Individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind or
engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of employment
within the Township shall be required to comply with this Part and pay the pro
rata portion of the tax due to the collector on or before the thirtieth (30th)
day following the end of each quarter.
(Ord. 488, 10/15/2008, § 1)
§ 208. Individuals Engaged in More than One (1) Occupation or Employed in More
than One (1) Township.
   1.   The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day
the person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the event
a person is engaged in more than one (1) occupation, that is, concurrent
employment, or an occupation which requires the person working in more than one
(1) municipality during a payroll period, the priority of claim to collect the
local services tax shall be in the following order:
      A.   First, the municipality in which a person maintains his or her
principal office or is principally employed.
      B.   Second, the municipality in which the person resides and works if
the tax is levied by that Township.
      C.   Third, the municipality in which a person is employed and which
imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person’s home.
In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes prima facie
certification of payment to all other municipalities.

§ 209. Nonresidents Subject to Tax.

penalties and regulations promulgated under this Part with the same force and

self-employed person, and in the event his or her tax is not paid, the Township
shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer or employee for
the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.

transactions in which any person shall pay or transfer anything of value to an
operator for the privilege of parking or storing a motor vehicle at or in any
commercial parking place for any period of time, except residential parking

for the transaction. The tax shall be paid by the person who acquires the
privilege of parking or storing a motor vehicle.
(Ord. 392, 12/30/1999, § 1)
§ 604. Payment and Collection of Tax.
   1.   In General. Except as provided in §
604(2), the tax imposed by this Part shall be paid to, and collected by, the
operator of the commercial parking place to which the transaction relates. Any
operation required to collect tax under this subsection who shall fail to
collect such tax or shall fail to collect the proper amount of such tax shall
be liable for the full amount of the tax which he should have collected.
   2.   Exempt Operators. If a transaction taxable under §
603 relates to a commercial parking place whose operator is an exempt operator,
the tax imposed by this Part shall be paid to and collected by the Treasury
Department by the taxpayer at or about the time the taxpayer pays the
established price, unless the Treasury Department permits the taxpayer to pay
the tax or at or about the time the taxpayer removes his motor vehicle from the
commercial parking place.
   3.   Collection Locations by Arrangement with Exempt Operators. The Treasury
Department is hereby authorized to enter into negotiations with exempt
operators to make suitable arrangements for the Treasury Department to collect
taxes under §
604(2). All such arrangements shall be approved by the Township Council prior
to implementation. All other things being equal, the following order of
preference is established for the form of such arrangements:
      A.   Designation of employees or agents of the exempt operator to collect
the tax at the same time and in the same manner they collect the established
price and then remit the tax to the Treasury Department at a later time.
      B.   Designation of employees or agents of the exempt operator to collect
the tax at the same time and in the same manner they collect the established
Price and then immediately remit the tax to the Treasury Department designee
who is stationed at the tax collection site.
      C.   Permission for the Treasury Department designee to share space with
employees or agents of the exempt operator at the site where the established
price is collected and to collect the tax from the taxpayers at the time the
established price is paid.
      D.   Permission for the Treasury Department to erect and occupy a
collection booth, with an associated gate, at a location which taxpayers must
pass after departing from the commercial parking place and before entering a
public street, alley or highway, and/or at a location which taxpayers must pass
before entering the commercial parking place.
   4.   Collection Locations Without an Arrangement with the Exempt Operator.
If the Treasury Department is unable to conclude a suitable arrangement with an
exempt operator under § 604(3), the Treasury Department is hereby authorized
and directed to seek a declaration or order from a court of competent
jurisdiction that:
      A.   The exempt operator must not interfere with the Treasury Department
in establishing a reasonable means of collecting the tax in close proximity to
the point of entry to the commercial parking place, the point of departure from
the commercial parking place or the place where the established price is
collected so long as such actions of the Treasury Department do not materially
impair or interfere with a public use established by the exempt operator or the
government entity from which the exempt operator's exemption rights are
derived.
      B.   The Township may condemn such interest in property tax as is
necessary to permit the Treasury Department to establish a reasonable means of
collecting the tax in close proximity to the point of entry to the commercial
parking place, or the Place where the established price is collected, so long
as the condemnation does not materially impair or interfere with a public use
established by the exempt operator or the governmental entity from which the
exempt operator's exemption rights are derived.
   5.   Calculation of Tax. If any tax is collected under §
604(2) at a location other than the place where the established price is
collected, the Treasury Department may assess the amount of tax based on a
proper receipt for payment of the established price issued by the exempt
operator. In the absence of a proper receipt, the Treasury Department may
assess the amount of tax based on a reasonable estimate of the tax due (which
may be an estimate of the established price that would be paid if the taxpayer
parked or stored his vehicle for the maximum amount of time ordinarily
permitted). The Treasury Department is also authorized to issue time tickets to
persons about to enter the commercial parking Place to aid in the assessment of
tax when no receipt is issued or produced.

§ 605. Reporting of Tax.

calendar month to the Treasury Department on form prescribed by the Treasury

affidavit or verification certifying to the correctness of the report, subject
to the penalties of perjury or of unsworn falsifications to authorities.

605, shall compute and pay to the Treasury Department the taxes collected by
the operator under this Part and due to the Township during the period for
which the report is to be made, plus the amount of taxes which were not

portion of the tax collected under this Part as an administrative fee or
otherwise unless such fee is arranged under §
604(3) of this Part and approved by the Township Council.

610 by its due date, a penalty of three hundred dollars ($300.00) shall be
assessed against the operator and collected by the Treasury Department.

hereunder. If the Treasury Department shall determine that the amount of any
taxes required to be reported on any report hereunder has been understated by
more the ten (10) percent, it shall be rebuttably presumed that the operator
intended to file a false or misleading report.
(Ord. 392 12/30/1999, § 1)
§ 608. Verification of Reports.
   1.   If the Treasury Department is not satisfied with any report and/or
payment of tax made by any operator under the provisions of this Part, the
Treasury Department is authorized and empowered to make a determination of the
tax due to have been collected by the operator and paid over by the operator to
the Treasury Department, based upon the facts contained in the operator's
report, or upon any information within the Treasury Department or that shall
come into the Treasury Department's possession and, for this purpose, the

report filed by the operator shall be erroneous or otherwise misstated by in
excess of ten (10) percent of the tax actually due, exclusive of interest and
penalties, or if the examination was conducted because the operator failed,
neglected or refused to make a report required under this Part, the cost of
such examination shall be borne by the operator and shall be remitted to the
Treasury Department upon demand.

during this period shall be the quarterly rate of $15 per Consumer Unit.
(Ord. 68, § 2, 1/10/79)
§ 26-126.   Rates for Multiple Consumer Units.

the total consumption through such service connection and meter shall be
divided by the number of Consumer Units served thereby; (ii) the schedule of
water rates, rents and charges established under subsection (1) of §
26-124 shall be applied to the resultant quotient; and (iii) the resultant pro-
rata charge for each Consumer Unit shall be multiplied by the number of
Consumer Units served through such service connection and water meter to arrive
at the total bill for all Consumer Units served through the common meter and
service connection.
   2.   Minimum Quarterly Charge. There shall be charged a minimum quarterly
charge for each Consumer Unit as follows:
      A.   Where two Consumer Units are served through one connection and one
meter, each such Consumer Unit shall be charged a minimum charge of $16.50 or
1/2 the bill based on total consumption, whichever is larger.
      B.   Where three Consumer Units are served through one connection and one
meter, each such Consumer Unit shall be charged a minimum charge of $16.50 or
1/2 of the bill based on total consumption whichever is larger.
      C.   Where four or more Consumer Units are served through one connection
and one meter, each such Consumer Unit shall be charged a minimum charge of
$16.50 or a proportionate amount based on the total bill, whichever is larger.
(Ord. 68, § 5, 1/10/79; as amended by Ord. 201, 12/10/86)

shall specify, and shall cover a quarterly billing period consisting of the
immediately succeeding three complete calendar months. [Ord. 88]
   2.   Pro-rata Charge for Fractional Periods. Whenever water service to any
Consumer Unit, or unit of construction, as applicable, shall begin after the
first day or shall terminate before the last day of any billing period, the
water rates, rents and charges for such period shall be prorated equitably for
that portion of the billing period during which service was provided by the
Township.
   3.   Recipient. Each bill for water service shall be made out in the name of
the consumer.
   4.   Rebate for Unoccupied Property. No allowance or rebate will be made for
unoccupied property unless and until: (1) the Consumer shall have notified the
Township of such vacancy in writing; and (2) such vacancy shall continue for at
least thirty days. In any such event, service shall be restored only upon the
execution of a new application therefor.
   5.   All billing and payment shall be in accordance with the red flag
policies of
Chapter 1, Part 12. [Ord. 507]
(Ord. 68, § 3 1/10/79; as amended by Ord. 88, § 2, 6/11/80; and by Ord. 507,

   1.   Thirty to Sixty Days After Bills are Due and Payable. All bills for
water service furnished to consumers shall be due and payable upon the
appropriate billing date and the appropriate amount computed in accordance with
this Part shall constitute the net bill. If bills for such water service shall
not be paid within thirty days after such bill becomes due and payable, such
bills shall be deemed delinquent and a penalty of fifteen percentum shall be
added to such delinquent bills and collected as a part thereof. [Ord. 88]
   2.   Delinquency in Excess of Sixty Days. Such action may be taken whenever
any bill for water service furnished to a consumer shall remain unpaid for a
period in excess of sixty (60) days after the date thereof and five days after
mailing a delinquency notice to the consumer at his latest recorded address of
the books of the Township, which notice shall inform the consumer of the
delinquency and the penalty and shall declare the intention of the Township to
shut off and discontinue the water service. The water service will not be
restored until the bill, including penalties, together with a turn-off and
turn-on charge has been paid.

being of such number, shape, kind and area, and of such common unity of purpose
and adaptability of use that are deemed most suitable to carry out the
objectives of this Chapter.
Every parcel of land and every building or other structure in the Township,
except as otherwise provided by law or by the Chapter, shall be subject to the
regulations, restrictions, and requirements specified for the district in which
it is located.
(Ord. 45, Z-§ 300, 5/12/76)
§ 27-301. Classes of Districts.
For the purposes of this Chapter, Hanover Township is hereby divided into eight
classes of districts which shall be designated as follows:

(Ord. 45, Z-§ 302, 5/12/76)
§ 27-303. Interpretation of District Boundaries.
Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries between districts as
indicated on the Zoning Map, the Zoning Officer shall render his decision
consistent with the following rules:
      A.   Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately coinciding
with the center lines of streets or railroad rights-of-way, such center lines
shall be construed to be such boundaries.
      B.   Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately
coincide with the lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be said
boundaries.
      C.   Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are
approximately parallel to street or railroad rights-of-way, such district
boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance
therefrom as indicated on the Zoning Map.
      D.   Where district boundaries divide a lot, the location of such
boundaries shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the Zoning Map
unless the boundaries are indicated by dimensions.
(Ord. 45, Z4303, 5/12/76)
§ 27-304. Uses Permitted in Zoning Districts.

§ 27-306. Statement of Community Development Objectives and Legislative Intent.
   1.   As an aid in interpreting the provisions of this Chapter, the purposes
for which the various zoning districts are established, the types of uses which
should be permitted to further the goals and objectives of the adopted Township
Comprehensive Plan are stated as follows:
      A.   Limited Use District (LU) - The purpose of this district is to
designate and protect areas along streams and areas containing major drainage
channels; areas which are part of highway interchange rights-of-way and
critical access points to expressways; areas for recreation and open space; and
areas which, by reason of steep slope, geologic condition or natural character
warrant preservation through limited usage.
      B.   Planned Residential District (PR) - The purpose of this district is
to provide for a type of residential development which will protect the natural
features of the largest concentrated area of the Township remaining for new
residential growth, while making development of this area feasible. This
district is intended to permit flexibility in lot layout, lot sizes, housing
types and the placement and bulk of buildings planned and developed as a single
development.
      C.   Medium Density Residential District (MR) - The purpose of this
district is to protect and enhance the characteristics of existing residential
areas of the Township while permitting remaining, relatively small undeveloped
areas to be feasibly developed for residential and related uses.
      D.   Planned Commercial District (PC) - The purpose of this district is
to provide business areas to meet the needs of highway users and to help
provide for convenient shopping, personal service and entertainment of Township
residents.
      E.   Planned Industrial-Office District (PIO) - The purpose of this
district is to encourage well planned modern industrial and office development
in the most suitable and accessible areas of the Township, while protecting
residential areas of the Township through the use of industrial development and
performance standards.
      F.   Planned Unit Development District (PUD) - The purpose of this
district is to provide for orderly use and development of those sections of the
Township which exhibit a variety of existing uses and/ or represent diversified
potential for future land use. The planned unit development concept is utilized
to encourage totally planned residential developments, and non-residential
complexes planned and developed as a single functional unit.
      G.   Airport-Industrial District (AI) - The purpose of this district is
to provide for a totally planned and diversified airport facility and
functionally related uses, while protecting other areas in the Township.
      H.   Flood Hazard District (FH) - The purpose of this district is to
minimize flood losses by restricting uses dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood and uses causing increased flood heights or
velocities. It is also the purpose to protect the quality and quantity of
surface and subsurface water supplies adjacent to and underlying flood hazard
areas.

DISTRICT USE, DIMENSION & OTHER RELATED REQUIREMENTS
§ 27-400. Designation of Allowable Uses.
The tables in §
27-402 designate the land uses allowed in each zoning district. The allowance
of the uses is identified by the type of approval required:
   P = Permitted Uses (permitted by right as approved by the zoning officer, or
as otherwise specified by the Chapter, except that such permission shall not
supersede any deed restriction, covenant, or agreement restricting the use of
land, nor any master deed, by-law, or other document applicable to a common
interest ownership community.) (Ord. 451)

area, minimum lot area per dwelling unit, minimum lot width and minimum
required yards shall be as specified in §
27-402, subject to any further applicable dimensional requirements or
exemptions specified elsewhere in the Chapter.
   2.   The minimum lot area specified in §
27-402 is based upon the availability of a centralized water supply system and
a centralized sewage disposal system. If these systems are not available to
serve a proposed use, the applicable standards of the Pennsylvania Department
of Environmental Protection shall be used in determining lot size.
   3.   Measurements of minimum land area and yards pursuant to §
27-402 shall not include any land within the right-of-way of any existing or
proposed street.
   4.   A lot in any particular zoning district may be used for more than one
use, provided that the uses are permitted uses in that district. In such case,
the greatest minimum lot or land area; lot width, yard requirements, and the
smallest maximum building coverage and maximum lot coverage applicable to any
of the uses shall apply to the entire lot. Parking requirements shall be
cumulative. Total signs allowed shall be no more than the maximum allowed for
any one of the uses on the premises; provided, however, where the size of a
sign is restricted by the area of the face of a building, the total area may be
considered notwithstanding its occupancy by more than one use. No requirement
of the zoning ordinance shall become less restrictive for any use of a lot by
reason of another use being upon the same lot.

maintained, repaired, modified, removed, and replaced in strict compliance with
all current applicable federal and state technical and safety codes including,
without limitation, the permitting and inspection requirements of the PA
Uniform Construction Code, as adopted by the Township.
      B.   Subdivision plan approval shall not be required when a WCF is
located on a leased parcel that is less than the entire lot. This provision
shall not eliminate any requirement for a land development plan.
      C.   All WCFs shall be operated in accordance with all applicable FCC
rules regarding interference with public safety communications or the reception
of broadband, television, radio or other communications services.
      D.   All WCFs shall be operated in a manner so that they do not interfere
with public safety communications or the reception of broadband, television,
radio, or other communication services enjoyed by occupants of nearby
properties. In the event that a WCF causes interference with such services
within the Township, the WCF applicant, at the applicant's sole expense, shall
thereafter ensure that any interference problems are promptly corrected.
      E.   Collocation. All tower-based WCFs shall be designed to accommodate
both the applicant's antennas and comparable antennas for future users. As a
condition of approval for all tower-based WCFs, the applicant shall agree to
allow other service providers to collocate antennas on the tower where
technically and economically feasible.
      F.   Signage. All WCFs shall include a posted sign at the location. Such
signage shall include the ownership, contact name and phone number in the event
of an emergency and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) registration number
(if applicable). Such signage shall not include commercial advertising and is
subject to approval by the Township.
      G.   Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially lighted beyond what is
required by law. If lighting is required, the WCF applicant shall provide a
detailed plan for sufficient lighting, demonstrating as unobtrusive and
inoffensive an effect as is permissible under Township, state, and federal
regulations.
      H.   Noise. All WCFs shall be operated and maintained so as not to
produce noise in excess of applicable noise standards established by the

weather surface, including gravel, to a width of at least ten feet (10')
throughout its entire length.
         7)   Vehicular access to all WCFs shall not interfere with the parking
or vehicular circulations for a principal use, if located on the lot. However,
where appropriate and available, existing parking for the principal or other
uses on the lot may be utilized.
      J.   Fencing. A security fence with a height of six feet (6') shall be
required to surround any tower-based WCF. The requirement for a security fence
may be waived by the Township when the tower is a monopole that cannot be
climbed or the fence would not be appropriate or feasible. All fencing must be
in accordance with the provisions of the Township Zoning Ordinance.
      K.   Maintenance. An applicant for a WCF shall describe anticipated
maintenance needs, including frequency of service, personnel needs, and
equipment needs, and the traffic, safety, and noise impacts of such
maintenance.
      L.   Soil report. An applicant for a tower-based WCF shall submit a soil
report complying with the standards of geotechnical investigations of the

structure and anchors for the guy wires, if used.
      M.   Aviation safety. All WCFs must meet or exceed current standards and
regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") and any other agency
of the State or Federal government with the authority to regulate aviation
safety. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the applicant of
the WCF governed hereby shall bring such WCF into compliance with such revised
standards and regulations within six (6) months of the effective date of such
standards and regulations, unless a different compliance schedule is mandated
by the controlling State or Federal agency. Failure to bring WCF into
compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds
for removal of the WCF at the applicant's expense.
      N.   Inspections for all WCFs. All WCFs shall be subject to applicable
provisions of the building code of Hanover Township, including periodic
inspections.
      O.   Equipment Storage. The storage of unused equipment or supplies is
prohibited on any WCF site.
      P.   Historic Locations. Wireless communications facilities are not
permitted to be located on buildings, structures or sites listed on the
National State Register of Historic Places or recognized as historic buildings,
structures or sites by resolution of the Hanover Township Council.
   6.   Aesthetics, Landscaping, and Screening.
      A.   Stealth Technology. All WCFs shall employ the most current stealth
technology available, where appropriate, in an effort to appropriately blend
the proposed WCF into the surrounding environment and minimize aesthetic
impact. Equipment buildings and cabinets shall be designed to blend into the
environment in which they are situated, to the extent practicable. All proposed
tower-based WCFs must provide documentation detailing the proposed stealth
technology.
      B.   Landscaping and Screening. An applicant for tower-based shall submit
a landscaping and screening design including the following:
         1)   The applicant shall ensure that the existing vegetation, trees,
and shrubs located within proximity to the WCF support structure shall be

disturbed during construction shall be restored to the extent practicable so
that the property is in as good as or better condition than it was prior to
construction.
         2)   Ground mounted equipment may be screened from public view using
an evergreen screen, artificial screen, or fencing, as directed by the
Township.
         3)   Any graffiti on the tower or on any related equipment shall be
immediately removed at the sole expense of the WCF owner or the property owner.
   7.   Replacement, Collocation, or Modification.
      A.   Notwithstanding the requirements for all tower-based WCFs and WCFs
on existing structures, as set forth in this sub-section, an application for
replacement, collocation or modification of a previously approved wireless
support structure or WCF shall be reviewed for conformance with the Township
building permit requirements, including requirements applicable to the added
structural loading of the proposed antennas and accessory equipment. These
previously approved facilities shall not be subject to the issuance of new
zoning or land use approvals, provided that there is no substantial change.
      B.   Replacement of WCFs on existing wireless support structures or
within existing equipment compounds may be performed by the applicant without
obtaining building or zoning permits from the Township.

§ 27-601.   General Regulations Applying to Required Off-Street Parking
Facilities.
   1.   Existing Parking. Structures and uses in existence at the date of
adoption of this Chapter shall not be subject to the requirements of this Part
so long as the kind or extent of use is not changed, provided that any parking
facilities now serving such structures or uses shall not in the future be
reduced below such require ments.
   2.   Change in Requirements. Whenever there is an alteration of structure of
a change or extension of a use which increase the parking requirements
according to the standards of §
27-600, the total additional parking required for the alteration, change or
extension shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of that
Section.
   3.   Conflict with Other Uses. No parking area shall be used for any use
that interferes with its availability for the parking need it is required to
serve.
   4.   Continuing Character of Obligation. All required parking facilities
shall be provided and maintained so long as the use exists which the facilities
were designed to serve. Off-street parking facilities shall not be reduced in
total extent after their provision, except when such reduction is in conformity
with the requirements of this Part. Reasonable precautions shall be taken by
the owner or sponsor of particular uses to assure the availability of required
facilities to the employees of other persons whom the facilities are designed
to serve. Such facilities shall be designed and used in such a manner as to at
no time constitute a nuisance, or a hazard, or unreasonable impediment to
traffic.
   5.   Joint Use. Two or more uses may provide for required parking in a
common parking lot if the total space provided is not less than the sum of the
spaces required for each use individually. However, the number of spaces
required in a common parking facility may be reduced below this total by
special exception under Part 14 if it can be demonstrated to the Zoning Hearing
Board that the hours or days of peak parking need for the uses are so different
that a lower total will provide adequately for all uses served by the facility.
   6.   Fractional Spaces. Where the computation of required parking space
results in a fractional number, only the fraction of one-half more shall be
counted as one
   7.   Location of Parking Space. Required off-street parking areas shall be
on the same lot or premises with the principal use served, or, where this
requirement cannot be met, within 300 feet of the principal use served within
the same district.
   8.   Maintenance of Parking Areas. For parking areas of 3 or more vehicles,
the area not landscaped and so maintained, including driveways, shall be
graded, surfaced with asphalt or other suitable hard surface material and
drained to the satisfaction of the Township Engineer to the extent to prevent
dust, erosion, or excessive water flow across streets or adjoining property.
All off-street parking spaces shall be marked as to indicate their location.
   9.   Parking of Commercial Vehicles. Commercial motor vehicles as defined in
Part 2 are not permitted to park in the LU, MR or PR District other than for
normal commercial deliveries and services to the residents.

PART 7
SIGNS
§ 27-700.   Purpose.
This Part recognizes that signs perform an important function by identifying
residences and businesses and that minimum control of signs is necessary to
promote the health, safety and general welfare by lessening hazards to
pedestrian and vehicular traffic: by preserving property values, by preventing
unsightly and detrimental development which has a blighting influence upon
residential, business and industrial uses, by preventing signs from reaching
such excessive size that they obscure one another to the detriment of all
concerned and by securing certain fundamentals of design for the Township.
(Ord. 45, Z-§ 700, 5/12/76)
§ 27-701.   Permit Requirements For Signs.
   1.   All permanent on-premises and off-premises signs, regardless of size
shall require the issuance of a Zoning Permit from the Zoning Officer before
erection or replacement. All signs must comply with all of the regulations
contained herein, regardless of whether a permit is required. However, no
permit shall be required to repaint any sign provided there are no changes or
alterations whatsoever.
   2.   Permits are not required for temporary signs to be used within a period
of less than thirty (30) days.
   3.   Permits issued for signs, including the conversion of a nonconforming
billboard to an EMS, shall be subject to the provisions of §
27-1303 and construction shall be commenced and completed within six (6) months
of issuance or shall automatically expire. [Ord. 475]
(Ord. 45, Z-§ 701, 5/12/76; as amended by Ord. 475, 7/18/2007, § 2)
§ 27-702.   Signs Prohibited in All Districts.
   1.   Signs which any way simulate official, functional, directional or
warning signs erected or maintained by the United States government, the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, County or Municipality thereof, or by any
railroad, or public utility or similar agency concerned with the protection of
public health or safety.
   2.   Banners, spinners, flags, pennants or any moving object used for
commercial advertising purposes whether containing a message or not, except
where specifically permitted.
   3.   Flashing, blinking, twinkling, animated, twirling or moving signs of

   5.   On-premises signs advertising a use no longer in existence or a project
no longer available shall be removed or changed to advertise the new use or
product immediately after cessation of the original use. Signs once removed,
shall be replaced only by signs in conformance with this Chapter.
   6.   No signs except those of a duly constituted governmental body,
including traffic signs and similar regulatory notices shall be allowed within
street lines unless specifically authorized by other Chapters and regulations
of the Township and in compliance with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
regulations.

(Ord. 45, Z-§ 702, 5/12/76; as amended by Ord. 367, 2/18/1998, § 3)
§ 27-703.   Non-Conforming Signs.
   1.   Only lawful signs existing at the time of passage of this Chapter and
which do not conform to the requirements of the Chapter shall be considered
nonconforming signs and once removed shall be replaced only with conforming
signs; however, lawful, nonconforming signs may be repainted or repaired
provided such repainted or repaired sign does not exceed the dimensions of the
existing sign. Any sign or billboard destroyed, damaged, or dismantled for any
reason whatsoever may only be rebuilt on its previous location in strict
conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a nonconforming sign or billboard may be
converted by the owner of such nonconforming sign or billboard to an EMS,
including the structural reinforcement thereof for purposes of supporting said
EMS, provided that the converted EMS shall not exceed the dimensions of the
existing sign or billboard, shall not be relocated, and shall otherwise meet
all of the requirements for an EMS including, but not limited to, the distance
requirements set forth in §
27-711.4. [Ord. 475]
   2.   Every lawful sign, billboard and other outdoor advertising media
erected in the Township prior to the adoption of this Chapter, may continue to
be maintained in spite of their lack of conformity with all of the provisions
of this Chapter, for a period of 7 years after the adoption hereof, after which
the owner of every such sign, at his own expense, shall cause the same to be
brought into strict conformity with all the requirements of this Chapter, or
shall remove the same. The work of bringing such sign into conformity with such
requirements shall constitute either repair, alteration or relocation and
therefore, shall require the owner of such sign, to obtain a permit. Provided,
the Zoning Hearing Board may permit the owner of the sign to continue to
maintain such sign without conforming to the require ments of this Chapter
where to require cessation of use would in the opinion of the Zoning Hearing
Board, impair the property rights of any person to such an extent as to be an
unconstitutional taking of property.
   3.   Every unlawful sign must conform to the provisions of Part 12. All
signs erected prior to the adoption of this Chapter which do not have a Zoning
Permit but do conform to the provisions of this Part, shall be required to
apply for a Zoning Permit within 60 days of the official adoption of this
Chapter.

§ 27-704.   Area of Signs.
   1.   The size of any sign shall be computed by multiplying its greatest
height by its greatest length, exclusive of supporting structures, unless such
supporting structure is illuminated or is in the form of a symbol or contains
advertising copy. In the case of signs that have no definable edges, such as
raised letters attached to a building facade, the sign size shall be that area
within a single continuous perimeter enclosing the extreme limits of the actual
message or copy area.
   2.   The area of a sign shall be construed to include all lettering, wording
and accompanying designs and symbols, together with the background, whether
open or enclosed, on which they are displayed but not including any supporting
framework and bracing which are incidental to the display itself.
   3.   Where the sign consists of individual letters or symbols attached to or
painted on a surface, building, wall or window, the area shall be considered to
be that of the smallest rectangle or other shape which encompasses all of the
letters and symbols.
   4.   In computing square foot area of a double-face sign, only one side
shall be considered provided both faces are identical. If the interior angle
formed by the two faces of the double-faced sign is greater than 45 degrees,
then both sides of such sign shall be considered in calculating the sign area
and it shall be considered as a parallel sign.
   5.   If an establishment has walls fronting on two or more streets, the sign
area for each fronting street may be computed and used. Each sign shall be
placed on the frontage used in the computation. When a freestanding sign is
used only one wall sign shall be allowed.
(Ord. 45, Z-004, 5/12/76)
§ 27-705.   General Sign Regulations.
The following requirements shall apply to all specifically designated signs:

other means. In no case shall any sign, other than an official governmental
sign, be erected within the official right-of-way of any street unless
specifically authorized by other ordinances or regulations of the Township and
in conformance Commonwealth of Pennsylvania regulations, where appropriate. No
sign shall violate the visibility restrictions outlined in this Chapter.

restrictions of this Chapter.
   5.   No sign which directs attention to a business, commodity, service, or
entertain ment conducted, sold, or offered only elsewhere than upon the
premises where it is displayed shall be established nearer than 100 feet to a
Residential District, unless the advertisement surface of such sign is not
visible therefrom and does not create a nuisance to adjacent property owners,
in which instance they shall be no closer than 50 feet to a Residential
District.
   6.   No sign in a Non-Residential District shall be located so as to face
any Residential District. This provision shall not apply to signs at right
angles to the street line of such street.
   7.   All free standing signs shall be set back at least 10 feet from the
front lot line. No free standing sign in other than a Residential District
shall extend within 50 feet of any Residential District boundary line.
   8.   Special promotional devices, signs, or displays such as flood lights,

      D.   Each permit shall be for a minimum of thirty (30) days and a maximum
of sixty (60) days, but for a total of not more than 120 days for all permits
for any business in any calendar year.
      E.   At a shopping center with more than one business under separate
ownership on the lot, the provisions of this Section
705(8) shall apply to each such separately owned business, individually,

      J.   A permit shall be required for the placement of all devices and at
no other time shall such devices be permitted. [Ord. 517]
      K.   The Hanover Township Council shall establish fees for such permits

§ 27-710.   Signs Adjacent to Expressways.
The use of off-premises signs, notices and other signs are herewith restricted
as follows in order to facilitate the movement of traffic to minimize the
hazard on expressways, as designated in the Township Comprehensive Plan and to
restrict the use of signs in the various zoning districts of Hanover Township.
Signs permitted by this §
27-710 shall not be permitted on any lot upon which a billboard is located.
   1.   Within 50 feet of any part of the right-of-way of any expressway within
the limits of the Township, only the following signs shall be permitted.
      A.   Official signs including traffic markers, directional signs, or
street name plates.
      B.   Name plates not exceeding 2 square feet, identifying the owner or
occupant of the property.
      C.   In those areas where there is no open area adjacent to a building
abutting the said highway approach a sign not exceeding 4 square feet in area
pertaining to the sale or lease of the property and set back at least 25 feet
and placed so as not to obstruct a driver’s view of official signs.
   2.   Over 50 feet and within 100 feet of the edge of said rights-of-way
referred to in the preceding subparagraph only the following signs shall be
permitted:
      A.   All signs permitted in subparagraph §
27-710.
      B.   An unilluminated sign attached to the main wall of a building and
projection horizontally not more than 12 inches therefrom, 10 feet, nor more
than 20 feet above the ground. The said sign shall not exceed 30 inches in
height or bear an advertisement other than the name of the person, firm or
corporation operating the place of business, or owning the property and a
description of the general character of the business.
      C.   One illuminated projecting sign, excluding a flashing or animated
illuminated sign, or animated unilluminated sign for each building or use not
projecting over a street or other public space more than 10 feet from the face
of the building or structure, nor in any case beyond a vertical plane two feet
inside the right-of-way line; nor shall it be so erected that its innermost
edge shall be placed more than 12 inches from the building line; nor shall it
bear an advertisement other than the name of the person, firm or corporation
operating the place of business, or owning the property and a description of
the general character of-the business or be above the roof line.
(Ord. 45, Z-§ 710, 5/12/76)
§ 27-711.   Electronic Message Signs.
Electronic message signs (EMS) wherever permitted in the Township shall be
subject to the following rules:
   1.   No EMS image or part thereof (including words, letters, symbols or
other graphics) may change more than once every 10 seconds.
   2.   Any change in an image shall occur within 1 second or less.
   3.   Change of an image includes, but is not limited to, any perceived
movement of the image such as scrolling, dissolving, fading or similar
adjustment.
   4.   No side or face of an EMS which is a billboard shall contain double or
multiple signs or split screen images. [Ord. 486]
   5.   Only one sign on a side or face of an existing, nonconforming double or
multiple sign billboard may be converted to an EMS. [Ord. 486]
   6.   No EMS which is a billboard shall be located within 1,500 feet of any
other EMS which is a billboard regardless of which side of the highway the said
other EMS which is a billboard is located.
   7.   Each EMS must be equipped with automatic day/night dimming software, to
maintain a constant illumination intensity or contrast of light level.
   8.   Community Service. Each EMS owner shall give priority over all messages
to emergency alerts as directed by Federal, State, and local authorities . Each
owner must notify AMBER ALERT and register its location for use if needed. When
possible due to unsold message time, an EMS owner shall give consideration to
devoting such unsold time to community service messages (i.e., time and
temperature, school closing, weather, non-profit announcements, etc.), as
determined by the EMS owner.
(Ord. 45, Z-§ 711, 5/12/76; as added by Ord. 475, 7/18/2007, § 9; and as

PART 8
PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT (PRD)
§ 27-800. Purposes.
The purposes of these Planned Residential Development Provisions are:
   1.   To insure that the provisions of the Zoning Chapter which are concerned
with the uniform treatment of dwelling type, bulk, density and open space
within each zoning district, shall not be applied to the improvement of land by
other than lot by lot development in a manner which would distort the
objectives of the Zoning Chapter.
   2.   lb encourage innovations in residential development and renewal so that
the growing demand for housing may be met by greater variety and maximum choice
in the type, design and layout of dwellings and by the conservation and more
efficient use of open space ancillary to said dwellings.
   3.   lb provide, through the above innovations greater opportunities for
better housing and recreation for existing and potential residents of the

(Ord. 45, Z-§ 802, 5/12/1976; as amended by Ord. 210, 4/13/1988, § 3; and by
Ord. 285, 7/1/1992, §§ 3-7)
§ 27-803. Site, Market and Impact Analysis.
   1.   Site Analysis. In order to determine which specific areas of the total
planned residential development are best suited for high density development,
which areas are best suited for lower density development and which areas
should be preserved in their natural state as open space areas, a thorough
analysis of the natural features of the site will be required. The following
subject categories must be included in this analysis.
      A.   HYDROLOGY - Analysis of natural drainage patterns and water
resources including an analysis of streams, natural drainage swales, ponds or
lakes, wetlands, flood plain areas, permanent high water table areas and
seasonal high water table areas throughout the site.
      B.   GEOLOGY - Analysis of characteristics of rock formations underlying
the site including defining aquifers (particularly those locally subject to
pollution), shallow bedrock areas and areas in which rock formations are
unstable.
      C.   SOILS - Analysis of types of soils present in the site area
including delineation of prime agricultural soil areas, aquifier recharge soil
areas, unstable solid, soils most susceptible to erosion and soils suitable for
urban development. The analysis of soils will be based on the County Soils
Survey of the U.S. Soil Conservation Service.
      D.   TOPOGRAPHY - Analysis of terrain of site including mapping of
elevation and delineation of slope areas over 25%, between 15% and 25% and
under 15%. (Ord. 285)
      E.   VEGETATION - Analysis of tree and plant cover of the site,
emphasizing the location of woodland and meadowland areas. Dominant tree and
plant species should be identified and the characteristics of each understood.
   2.   Generalized Market Synopsis.
      A.   The general housing market shall be analyzed to determine reasonable
forecasts of market demand for various type(s) of housing on the proposed site.
This information will be used to confirm or modify the housing type(s)
proposed, sale price or rental and amenities proposed by the developer. The
findings will be presented in a summary or synopsis form in the final report.
   3.   Impact Analysis.
      A.   In order to determine the community impact of the proposed
development on the Township, certain information shall be provided by the
developer at the tentative plan stage as follows:
         (1)   Water and Sewer. Developer shall provide estimates of its water
and sewer capacity needs at build-out; of the availability of such capacities
(as estimated by the relevant public utilities or municipal systems); and of
the cost to the Township (if any) of assuring the availability of service to
the development.
         (2)   Traffic.
            (a)   Developer shall provide estimates of trips generated from the
development for 2 "peak" and 2 "off-peak" weekday hours, using trip generation
assumptions consistent with current Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) data
and estimates for comparable circumstances and comparable uses.
            (b)   In addition, between tentative plan approval and final plan
review, developer shall provide intersection evaluation for those intersections
which are likely to be impacted by more than ten 10% by traffic from the
development during any peak hour used in the initial trip generation study.
This secondary intersection evaluation shall review turning movements and
levels of service and shall suggest appropriate remedial actions to be taken to
alleviate delays and other deficiencies at such intersections.
         (3)   Schools. Developer shall identify the anticipated number of
school children which are likely to be generated by the development and shall
identify the schools which are likely to serve them, noting current enrollment
capacities in each (if such data is readily available to developer from the
school district office).
         (4)   Recreation. Developer shall identify all recreation facilities,
both passive and active, to be provided as part of the development plan.
         (5)   Public Safety. Developer shall identify any unique police or
fire fighting demands likely to be caused by the development, if any.
         (6)   Roadway Additions. Developer shall determine the number of
lineal feet of roadway proposed for the development. Additionally, if
sufficient data is readily available from the Township to determine the number
of lineal miles of existing roadway in the Township, a fraction should be
created which establishes the anticipated percentage increase in roadways
likely to be caused by the development at build-out.

(Ord. 45, Z4803, 5/12/76; as amended by Ord. 285, 7/1/1992, § 8,9)
§ 27-804. Site Design Requirements.
   1.   Residential Uses.
      A.   The natural features of the PRD site shall be a major factor in
determining the siting of dwelling unit structures. The results of the Natural
Features Analysis shall be considered in the siting of all dwelling unit
structures.
      B.   Conventional siting practices such as building setbacks from streets
and minimum distances between buildings may be varied in order to produce an
attractive and interesting arrangement of buildings. The requirements of §
27-802, "Land Use Control and Land Use Density Requirements," 6. "Lot Sizes and
Minimum Design Standards," as amended, shall be met, unless waived, modified,
or approved otherwise by the Township Council. (Ord. 285)
      C.   Dwelling unit structures shall be located and cited so as to promote
pedestrian and visual access to common open space wherever possible.
      D.   Dwelling unit structures shall be located and arranged so as to
promote privacy for residents within the PRD and maintain privacy for residents
adjacent to PRD. Mid-rise structures shall be located within the development so
that there will be no adverse impact such as excluding natural light or
invading the privacy of adjacent low rise structures.
      E.   Dwelling unit and other structures located within 200 feet of the
perimeter of a Planned Residential Development must be set back by a distance
sufficient to avoid any incongruity with adjacent existing uses. In no event
shall a building be located less than 30 feet from the perimeter boundary line
of the PRD, except along a Township boundary line where the contiguous land in
the adjacent Township is developed as part of the same PRD. [Ord. 285]
      F.   The following specific accessory uses and/or structures shall be
governed by the corresponding Section of this Zoning Ordinance listed below:
         (1)   §
27-407, “Accessory Buildings” shall apply to PRDs in the PR District, as well
as the PUD zone. [Ord. 501]
         (2)   §
27-501, “Fences, Walls and Hedges.”
         (3)   §
27-503, “Private Swimming Pools.” [Ord. 285]
      G.   For the purposes of this subsection, the word “structure” shall mean
only usual and customary residential principal and accessory uses and
buildings. [Ord. 285]
   2.   Commercial Uses.
      A.   All commercial uses shall be located in not more than two areas of
the Planned Residential Development, one area of which shall consist of at
least two contiguous acres.
      B.   All commercial uses shall be located with direct access to either a
collector or arterial street. If the total parking requirements for such uses
is 100 parking spaces or more, the uses must be located on either a collector
street or arterial street. [Ord. 285]
      C.   Signs for commercial uses are permitted subject to the following
restric tions:
         (1)   A single sign for a commercial center is permitted. such signs
shall be limited to a height of 6 feet with a total area of 30 square feet.
         (2)   Signs for individual uses shall be permitted on the structure.
Roof signs or free-standing signs for individual uses are prohibited. Such
signs shall be limited to the store name and shall be no more than 30 square
feet in extent and shall be parallel to the structure.
         (3)   Signs may be illuminated by shielded flood lights providing such
lighting is designed and located so as to direct light away from adjacent
residences. Lights shall be illuminated only during times when nonresidential
uses are open to the public.
         (4)   No sign shall have a flashing, moving, rotating, oscillating,
shuttered or similar device or shall be made of material designed to provide
reflections.
   3.   Common Open Space.
      A.   The location, shape, size and character of the common open space
shall be provided in a manner consistent with the objectives set forth for PRD
in this Chapter, concerning the conservation of natural resources and the
creative use of land to obtain a living environment of stable character, with
natural feature constraints determined through Natural Features Analysis.
      B.   The uses authorized for the common open space must be appropriate to
the scale and character of the planned development, considering its natural
features, size, land use intensity, potential population and the number and
types of dwelling units to be developed.
      C.   Whenever possible, common open space shall be designed as a
contiguous area interspersed with residential areas with pedestrian and visual
access available to all residents of the PRD.
      D.   Significant natural features such as woodland areas, large trees,
natural water courses and bodies of water, rock outcroppings and scenic views
shall be incorporated into common open space areas whenever possible. However,
no less than 20% of the total common open space area shall be suitable for
intensive use as an active recreation area, which shall include, but not be
limited to, golf courses, tennis courts, swimming pools, play grounds, ball
fields, soccer fields, bike paths, hiking trails, etc. [Ord. 285]
      E.   Development of the PRD must be planned so as to coordinate the
establish ment of common open space areas and the construction of dwelling
units.
   4.   Streets.
      A.   The street system of the Planned Residential Development shall be
designed so as to relate harmoniously with land uses within and adjacent to the
PRD through the establishment of a hierarchy of roadway functions which
includes collection and local streets, to create a separation of automobile and
pedestrian traffic through the coordinated design of streets, dwelling units,
common open space areas and pedestrian walkways, to create efficient and safe
connections with the existing road system of the municipality in order to
insure proper ingress and egress to and from the PRD and to minimize through
traffic in residential areas.
      B.   Collector streets and local streets in the Planned Residential
Development shall be so designated and shall have a minimum right-of-way of 60
feet and 50 feet, respectively. Where the results of the Community Impact
Analysis indicate a need for greater or lesser right-of-way and cartway widths,
the modifications may be authorized by the Township Council. [Ord. 285]
      C.   Cul-De-Sac and Stub Streets.

responsible for the maintenance of the common open space shall call a public
hearing upon notice to such organization, or to the residents and owners of the
Planned Residential Development, to be held by the Township, at which hearing
such organization or the residents and owners of the Planned Residential
Development shall show cause why such maintenance by the Township shall not, at
the option of the Township, continue for a succeeding year. If the Township
shall determine that such organization is ready and able to maintain said
common open space in a reasonable condition, the Township, may, in its
discretion, continue to maintain said common open space during the next
succeeding year and subject to a similar hearing and determination in each year
thereafter. The decision of the Township in any such case shall constitute a
final administrative decision subject to judicial review.
      F.   The cost of such maintenance by the Township shall be assessed
ratably against the properties within the Planned Residential Development that
have a right of enjoyment of the common open space and shall become a lien on
said properties. The Township, at the time of entering said common open space
for the purpose of maintenance, shall file a notice of lien in the office of
the prothonotary of the county, upon the properties affected by the lien within
the Planned Residential Development.
   2.   Public Dedication of Common Open Space. An offer of dedication of
common open space made by the developer in the development plan, before the
establishment of any organization responsible for open space areas and accepted
by the Township shall constitute a fulfillment of responsibility for providing
and maintaining common open space areas. Under any other circumstances,
provision for dedication must be made subject to § 27-806(1).

public hearing on his application for final approval. If the landowner wishes
to take either such alternate action he may do so at any time within which he
shall be entitled to apply for final approval, or within 30 additional days if
the time for applying for final approval shall have already passed at the time

compliance. In the event the landowner shall fail to take either of these
alternate actions within said time, he shall be deemed to have abandoned the
development plan. Any such public hearing shall be held pursuant to public
notice within 30 days after request for the hearing is made by the landowner

public hearings on applications for tentative approval. Within 30 days after
the conclusion of the hearing, the Township Council shall, by official written
communication, either grant final approval to the development plan or deny

in accordance therewith. Upon the filing of record of the development plan, the
zoning and subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the land included in
such plan shall cease to apply thereto. Pending completion within the time
periods provided by MPC, § 508(4), or such longer time periods allowed by the
final approval of said Planned Residential Development or of that part thereof,
as the case may be, that has been finally approved, no modification of the
provisions of said development plan, or part thereof, as finally approved,
shall be made except with the consent of the landowner. (Ord. 285)
      D.   In the event that a development plan, or a section thereof, is given
final approval and thereafter the landowner shall abandon such plan or the
section thereof that has been finally approved and shall so notify the Township
Council in writing; or, in the event the landowner shall fail to commence or
carry out the Planned Residential Development or of that part thereof, within
the time periods provided by MPC, § 508(4), or such longer time periods that
may be allowed by the final approval, after final approval has been granted, no
development or further development shall take place on the property included in
the development plan until after the said property is re-subdivided and is
reclassified by enactment of an amendment to the Township Zoning Chapter in the

whether recorded by plat, covenant, easement or otherwise, may be enforced by
law or by said residents acting individually, jointly, an organization
designated in the develop-plan to act on their behalf; provided, however, no
provision of the development plan shall be implied to exist in favor of

plan by the Township shall be permitted except upon a finding by the governing
body or its designated agency, following a public hearing thereon pursuant to
public notice called and held in accordance with the provisions of this

preservation of the entire PRD, does not adversely affect either the enjoyment
of land abutting upon or across the street from the Planned Residential
Development or the public interest and is not granted solely to confer a
special benefit upon any person.
      D.   Residents of the PRD may, to the extent and in the manner expressly

interpretation of any provision of this Chapter, including determination of the
exact location of any district boundary line if uncertainty exists with respect
thereto; where it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirement,
decision or determination made by the Zoning Officer in the enforcement of this
Chapter.
   2.   Special Exception. The Board shall have the power to approve special
exceptions for any of the uses for which this Chapter requires the obtaining of
such exceptions and for no other use or purpose. In granting a Special
Exception, the Board shall make findings of fact, consistent with the
provisions of this Chapter. The Board shall grant a Special Exception only if
it finds adequate standards listed for the proposed use. The Board shall, among
other things, require that any proposed use and location be:
      A.   In accordance with the Township Comprehensive Plan and consistent
with the spirit, purposes and intent of this Chapter;
      B.   In the best interests of the Township, the convenience of the
community, the public welfare and be an improvement to property in the
immediate vicinity;
      C.   Suitable for the property in question and designed, constructed,
operated and maintained so as to be in harmony with and appropriate in
appearance with the existing or intended character of the general vicinity;
      D.   In conformance with all applicable requirements of this Chapter;
      E.   Suitable in terms of permitting the logical, efficient and
economical extension of public services and facilities such as public water,
sewers, police and fire protection and public schools.

adequate sidewalks and vehicular access arrangements to protect major streets
from undue congestion and hazard. The Zoning Hearing Board may impose whatever
conditions regarding layout, circulation and performance it deems necessary to
insure that any proposed development will substantially secure the objectives
of this Chapter.
   3.   Variances. Upon appeal from a decision by the Zoning Officer, the Board
shall have the power to vary or adapt the strict application of any of the
requirements of this Chapter in the case of exceptionally irregular, narrow,
shallow, or steep lots, or other exceptional physical conditions where such
strict application would result in practical difficulty and iinnecessary
hardship depriving the owner of the reasonable use of land or building involved
but in no other case. In general, the power to authorize a variance from the
terms of this Chapter shall be sparingly exercised and only under peculiar and
exceptional circumstances. No variance in the strict application of the
provisions of this Chapter shall be granted by the Board unless the Board finds
that all the below requirements and standards are satisfied where relevant in a
given case:
      A.   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or
exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions
and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of
the zoning ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located.
      B.   That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of the zoning ordinance and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
      C.   That the unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant.
      D.   That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
      E.   That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulation in issue. In granting any variance, the Board may
attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to
implement the purposes of the Municipalities Planning Code and the Zoning
Ordinance.
      F.   That the granting of the variance shall be in harmony with the
general purpose and intent of this Chapter and shall not be injurious to the
neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
(Ord. 269)
   4.   Challenges to the Validity of This Chapter. The Board shall hear
challenges to the validity of this Chapter from persons aggrieved by a use or
development permitted on the land of another person by this Chapter or by any
provision of this Chapter. In all such challenges, the Board shall take
evidence and make a record thereon as provided for in §
27-1402. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall decide all contested
questions and shall make findings on all relevant issues of fact which shall
become part of the record on appeal to the court.
   5.   Unified Appeals. When the Board has jurisdiction over zoning matters
pursuant to §§
27-1403(1), of this Chapter, the Board shall also hear all appeals which an
applicant may elect to bring before it with respect to any Chapter or
requirement pertaining to the same development plan or development. In any such
case, the Board shall have no power to pass upon the nonzoning issues, but
shall take evidence and make a record thereon as provided in §
27-1402. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall make findings on all
relevant issues of fact which shall become part of the record on appeal to the
court.

§ 27-1405. Rules and Procedures for Application to the Zoning Hearing Board.
Board appeals and applications made to the Board shall be in writing, on forms
prescribed by the Board. Every appeal or application shall refer to the
specific provision of this Chapter involved and shall exactly set forth the
interpretation that is claimed, the grounds for any challenges to the validity
of this Chapter, the use for which a Special Exception is sought, or the
details of the variance that is applied for and the grounds on which it is
claimed that the variance should be granted, as the case may be.
Applications and appeals together with the required filing fee, as established
by the Council, shall be submitted to the Secretary of the Zoning Hearing
Board.
   1.   Parties Appellant Before the Zoning Board. Appeals under §
27-1404(1) and proceedings to challenge the Chapter under §
27-1404(4) may be filed with the Board in writing by the landowner affected,
any officer or agency of the Township or any person aggrieved. Requests for a
variance or special exception may be filed with the Board by any landowner or
any tenant with the permission of such landowner. (Ord. 269)
   2.   Time Limitations.
      A.   No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Board
later than 30 days after any application for development, preliminary or final,
has been approved by the appropriate Township officer, agency or body if such
proceeding is designed to secure reversal or to limit the approval in any
manner unless such person alleges and proves that he had no notice, knowledge
or reason to believe such approval had been given. If such person has succeeded
to his interest after such approval, he shall be bound by the knowledge of his
predecessor in interest. The failure of anyone other than the landowner to
appeal from an adverse decision on a tentative plan pursuant to Part 8 or from
an adverse decision by a zoning officer or a challenge to the validity of a
zoning ordinance or zoning map pursuant to § 27-916(2) shall preclude an appeal
from a final approval except in. the case where the final submission

filed by the landowner within 30 days after notice of determination is issued.

27-1404(1) and during its pendency before the Board, all land development
pursuant to any challenged ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning Officer
or of any agency or body and all official action thereunder shall be stayed
unless the Zoning Officer or any other appropriate agency or body certifies to
the Board facts indicating that such stay would cause imminent peril to lives
or property, in which case the development or official action shall not be
stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board
or by the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals on petition after notice
to the Zoning Officer or other appropriate agency or body.
      B.   When an application for development, preliminary or final, has been
duly approved and proceedings designed to reverse or limit the approval are
filed with the Board by persons other than the applicant, the applicant may
petition the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals to order such persons
to post bond as a condition to continuing the proceedings before the Board. The
question whether or not such petition should be granted and the amount of the
bond shall be within the sound discretion of the court.
   4.   Court Appeals.
      A.   Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Council with respect to
a conditional use approval may appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh
County within 30 days after entry of the decision or, in the case of a deemed
decision, within 30 days after the date upon which the notice of said deemed
decision is given.

Chapter.
   2.   Procedures. The procedures for public hearings as outlined in §

§ 27-1407. Validity of Ordinance; Substantive Questions; Landowner Curative
Amendments.
    1.   A landowner who, on substantive grounds, desires to challenge the
validity of an ordinance or map or any provision thereof which prohibits or
restricts the use or development of land in which he has an interest shall
submit the challenge either:
      A.   To the Zoning Hearing Board under §
27-1403(1), or
      B.   To the Township Council under §
27-1403(2)(c), together with a request for a curative amendment under 609.1 of
the Municipalities Planning Code.
   2.   Persons aggrieved by a use or development permitted on the land of
another by an ordinance or map, or any provision thereof, who desires to
challenge its validity on substantive grounds shall first submit their
challenge to the Zoning Hearing Board for a decision thereon under §
27-1403(1)(A).
      A.   A landowner who, on substantive grounds, desires to challenge the
validity of an ordinance or map or any provision thereof which prohibits or
restricts the use or development of land in which he has an interest shall
submit the challenge either:
         (1)   To the Zoning Hearing Board under §
27-1403(1), or
         (2)   To the Township Council under §
27-1403(2)(c), together with a request for a curative amendment under § 609.1
of the Municipalities Planning Code.
      B.   The submissions referred to in Subsections (1) and (2) shall be
governed by the following:
         (1)   In challenges before the Zoning Hearing Board, the challenging
party shall make a written request to the Board that it hold a hearing on this
challenge. The request shall contain the reasons for the challenge. Where the
landowner desires to challenge the validity of such ordinance and elects to
proceed by curative amendment, under § 609.1 of the Municipalities Planning
Code, his application to the Township Council shall contain, in addition to the
requirements of the written request hereof, the plans and explanatory materials
describing the use or development proposed by the landowner in lieu of the use
or development permitted by the challenged ordinance or map. Such plans or
other materials shall not be required to meet the standards prescribed for
preliminary, tentative or final approval or for the issuance of a permit, so
long as they provide reasonable notice-of the proposed use or development and a
sufficient basis for evaluating the challenged ordinance or map in light
thereof. Nothing herein contained shall preclude the landowner from first
seeking a final approval before submitting his challenge.
         (2)   If the submission is made by the landowner to the Township
Council under Subsection (1)(B), the request also shall be accompanied by an
amendment or amendments to the ordinance proposed by the landowner to cure the
alleged defects therein.
         (3)   If the submission is made to the Township Council, the Township
Attorney shall represent and advise it at the hearing or hearings.
         (4)   The Township Council may retain in independent attorney to
present the defense of the challenged ordinance or map on its behalf and to
present their witnesses on its behalf.
         (5)   Based upon the testimony presented at the hearing or hearings,
the Township Council or the Zoning Board, as the case may be, shall determine
whether the challenged ordinance or map is defective, as alleged by the
landowner. If a challenge heard by Township Council is found to have merit, the
Township Council shall proceed as provided in § 609.1 of the Municipalities
Planning Code. If a challenge heard by a Zoning Hearing Board is found to have
merit, the decision of the Zoning Hearing Board shall include recommended
amendments to the challenged ordinance which will cure the defects found. In
reaching its decision, the Zoning Hearing Board shall consider the amendments,
plans and explanatory material submitted by the landowner and shall also
consider:
            (a)   The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities,
water supplies, schools and other public service facilities;
            (b)   If the proposal is not for a residential use, the impact of
the proposal upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of the proposal
in providing housing units of a type actually available to and afordable by
classes of persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by the challenged provisions
of the ordinance or map;
            (c)   The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed
by the site's soils, slopes, woodland, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers, natural
resources and other natural features;
            (d)   The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes,
woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, natural resources and natural features, the
degree to which these are protected or destroyed, the tolerance of the
resources to development and any adverse environmental impacts; and,
            (e)   The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture
and other land uses which are essential to public health and welfare.
         (6)   The Township Council or the Zoning Hearing Board, as the case
may be, shall render its decision within 45 days after the conclusion of the
last hearing.
         (7)   If the Township Council or the Zoning Board, as the case may be,
fails to act on the landowner's request within the time limits referred to in
Subsection (F), a denial of the request is deemed to have occurrred on the 46
day after the close of the last hearing.
      C.   The Zoning Hearing Board or Township Council, as the case may be,
shall commence its hearing within 60 days after the request is filed unless the
landowner requests or consents to an extension of time.
      D.   Public notice of the hearing shall include notice that the validity
of the ordinance or map is in question and shall give the place where and the
times when a copy of the request, including any plans, explanatory material or
proposed amendments may be examined by the public.
      E.   The challenge shall be deemed denied when:
         (1)   the Zoning Hearing Board or governing body, as the case may be,
fails to commence the hearing within the time limits set forth in Subsection
(C);
         (2)   The Township Council notifies the landowner that it will not
adopt the curative amendment;
         (3)   The Township Council adopts another curative amendment which is
unacceptable to the landowner; or,
         (4)   The Zoning Hearing Board or Township Council, as the case may
be, fails to act on the request 45 days after the close of the last hearing on
the request, unless the time is extended by mutual consent by the landowner and
Township.
      F.   Where, after the effective date of this act, a curative amendment
proposal is approved by the grant of a curative amendment application by the
governing body pursuant to § 909.1(b)(4) of the Municipalities Planning Code or
a validity challenge is sustained by the Zoning Hearing Board pursuant to §
909.1(a)(1) of the Municipalities Planning Code or the court acts finally on
appeal from denial of a curative amendment proposal or a validity challenge,
and the proposal or challenge so approved requires a further application for
subdivision or land development, the developer shall have two years from the
date of such approval to file an application for preliminary or tentative
approval pursuant to Article V or WI of the Municipalities Planning Code.
Within the two-year period, no subsequent change or amendment in the zoning,
subdivision or other governing ordinance or plan shall be applied in any manner
which adversely affects the rights of the applicant as granted in the curative
amendment or the sustained validity challenge. Upon the filing of the
preliminary or tentative plan, the provisions of § 508(4) of the Municipalities
Planning Code shall apply. Where the proposed appended to the curative
amendment application or the validity challenge is approved but does not
require further application under any subdivision or land development
ordinance, the developer shall have one year within which to file for a
building permit. Within the one-year period, no subsequent change or amendment
in the zoning, subdivision or other governing ordinance or plan shall be
applied in any manner which adversely affects the rights of the applicant as
granted in the curative amendment or the sustained validity challenge. During
these protected periods, the court shall retain or assume jurisdiction for the
purpose of awarding such supplemental relief as may be necessary.
      G.   A landowner who has challenged on substantive grounds the validity
of a zoning ordinance or map either by submission of a curative amendment to
the governing body under § 909.1(a)(1) of the Municipalities Planning Code
shall not submit any additional substantive challenges involving the same
parcel, group of parcels or part thereof until such time as the status of the
landowner's original challenge has been finally determined or withdrawn:
Provided, however, that if after the date of the landowner's original challenge
the municipality adopts a substantially new or different zoning ordinance or
zoning map, the landowner may file a second substantive challenge to the new or
different zoning ordinance or zoning map under Subsection (a) thereof.

The landowner may advance the date from which time for any challenge to the
ordinance or map will run under §
27-1405(2) by the following procedure:
   1.   The landowner may submit plans and other materials describing his
proposed use or development to the zoning officer for a preliminary opinion as
to their compliance with the applicable ordinances and maps. Such plans and
other materials shall not be required to meet the standards prescribed for
preliminary, tentative or final approval or for the issuance of a building
permit so long as they provide reasonable notice of the proposed use or
development and a sufficient basis for a preliminary opinion as to its
compliance.
   2.   If the zoning officer's preliminary opinion is that the use or
development complies with the ordinance or map, notice thereof shall be
published once each week for 2 successive weeks in a newspaper of general
description of the proposed use or development and its location, by some
readily identifiable directive and the place and times where the plans and
other materials may be examined by the public. The favorable preliminary
approval under §
27-1405(2) and the time therein specified for commercing a proceeding with the
board shall run from the time when the second notice thereof has been
published.
