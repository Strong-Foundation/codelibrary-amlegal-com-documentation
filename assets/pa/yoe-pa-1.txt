FOREWORD
History
   This comprises the codification of the ordinances of the Borough of Yoe. The
Borough of Yoe was originally settled in 1815 and was incorporated as a Borough
on October 23, 1893, from parts of York Township.
   The Code of Ordinances of the Borough of Yoe was prepared by Keystate
Publishers, Inc., and adopted by the Borough of Yoe Borough Council on February
1, 2011, by Ord. 2011-01.
Organization
   The Code contains four parts which are (1) the valid current ordinances of
the Borough of Yoe contained in Chapters 1 through 27, (2) the Appendix, which
lists by abstracted title all ordinances of a temporary or “one time” nature,
(3) the Table of disposition of each ordinance ever enacted by the Borough of
Yoe, and (4) the Index, which is an alphabetical arrangement of subjects.
   In the Code each Chapter is separated by a divider tab, and specific
ordinances can be located by subject on the contents page at the beginning of
each Chapter. The Index may also be used to search for a subject when one is
looking for general information on a particular subject, or if it is not known
in which Chapter the subject might be found. The Appendix consists of several
general categories containing a chronological listing of short subject
descriptions along with a reference to the original ordinance and its date of
enactment, if known.
   The Table of disposition indicates what action has been taken by the Borough
of Yoe Borough Council with regard to every ordinance ever enacted. An
ordinance has either been (1) specifically repealed, (2) superseded by another
ordinance, (3) is located in a Chapter of the Code book, or (4) is located in
the Appendix. Annual tax rate and budget ordinances are located only in the
Table of Disposition. The Table of Disposition is a cross reference to the
original ordinance books of the Borough of Yoe, and to the location within the
Code of each ordinance by number.

Commonwealth Code Inspection Service, Inc. Consolidated
Commercial Inspection Fees
The fee schedule for inspections is based upon the latest building valuation data report of
square foot construction costs published by the ICC valuation service, with a regional modifier
applied. Actual cost submitted to, and accepted by, the Municipality may also be used. There is
a $50.00 Application/Processing charge applied to all projects submitted on this fee schedule.
Large projects that require long term multiple inspections (progressive inspections) are
calculated as follows:
Projects with a total construction cost of $0.00 to $499,999.99
      Total construction cost x .002 = insurance cost
   +   Estimated length of project in weeks x $50.00 = labor and travel cost
   =   Total
   Or no less than $50.00 per trip based on scope and complexity of the project.
Projects with a total construction cost of $500,000.00 to $2,000,000.00
      Total construction cost x .002 = insurance cost
   +   Estimated length of project in weeks x $50.00 = labor and travel cost
   =   Total
   Or no less than $50.00 per trip based on scope and complexity of the project.
Projects with a total construction cost of > $2,000,000.00 to $6,000,000.00
      $4,000.00 + [(Total construction cost - $2,000,000.00) x .0009] = insurance cost
   +   Estimated length of project in weeks x $45.00 = labor and travel cost
   =   Total
Projects with a total construction cost of > $6,000,000.00 to $10,000,000.00
      $7,600.00 + [(Total construction cost - $6,000,000.00) x .0008] = insurance cost
   +   Estimated length of project in weeks x $40.00 = labor and travel cost
   =   Total
Projects with a total construction cost of > $10,000,000.00 to $30,000,000.00
      $10,800.00 + [(Total construction cost - $10,000,000.00) x .00075] = insurance cost
   +   Estimated length of project in weeks x $40.00 = labor and travel cost
   =   Total
Projects with a total construction cost of > $30,000,000.00 to $50,000,000.00
      $25,800.00 + [(Total construction cost - $30,000,000.00) x .0007] = insurance cost
   +   Estimated length of project in weeks x $40.00 = labor and travel cost
   =   Total
* Pricing schedules assume that the project will not cause an increase in any insurance costs.
The inspection fees for mechanical, plumbing, electrical, energy, accessibility and fire
protection are computed at 25% of the building inspection fee for each discipline. Multiple
prime contracts will be computed the same as a building inspection fee and combined prime
contract fees shall be no less than a single contract fee, distributed on a percentage of total
basis.
Commercial Plan Reviews
Commonwealth Code Inspection Service, Inc. will perform commercial plan reviews. Our Commercial
Plan Review fees ($150.00 minimum) are calculated according to the ICC Valuation Service or
actual cost of construction as follows:
   Estimated Construction Value $0.00 to $1,250,000.00 = Construction value x .0015 ($150.00
minimum)
   Estimated Construction Value $1,250,000.00 to $5,000,000.00 = $1,875.00 + (.0005 x
construction value over $1,250,000.00)
   Estimated Construction Value over $5,000,000.00 = $3,750.00 + (.0004 x construction value
over $5,000,000.00)
   Plan review for mechanical, plumbing, electrical, energy, accessibility and fire prevention
are computed at 25% of the building plan review fee for each discipline.
   Special pricing may be given to buildings such as warehouses, due to their relative
simplicity or structures with repetitive features such as high rise buildings.
     This formula does not reflect changes that ICC may have made to their fee schedule. We will
use other plan review services that meet our criteria for consistent quality and charge the same
or less than ICC reviews.
Plan reviews covering the requirements of mechanical and plumbing codes are available, each for
a fee of 25% of the applicable building code review fee. Plan reviews for the requirements of
the electrical code shall be provided at a fee of 35% of the applicable building code review
fee, excluding reviews for any use included in the “I” (Institutional) use group classification.
Reviews done for the excluded use classification shall be based upon the degree of complexity.
A preliminary plan review is available for a fee of 50% of the full plan review fee cost.
Preliminary plan review addresses such code requirements as: Use and Occupancy Classification,
type of construction, height and area calculations, means of egress, and fire restrictive
construction requirements.
The preliminary plan review fee shall be credited towards the cost of a complete building code
plan review conducted by Commonwealth Code Inspection Service, Inc.
Expedited or “fast-track” plan reviews may be available as time and work-load allow. Expedited
plan reviews shall be charged at 150% of the regular rate.
CHECKS FOR PLAN REVIEW FEES SHALL BE MADE PAYABLE TO:

   Chapter, Subchapter, Part, Subpart, Section, Subsection, Paragraph, Subpara
graph, Clause, and Subclause headings contained in the Code may not be deemed
to govern, limit, modify or affect the scope, meaning or intent of the Code.
The headings of Sections, Subsections or other divisions of this Code are
intended as mere captions to indicate the contents of the Section, Subsection
or other division and shall not be deemed to be taken as titles of such
Section, Subsection or other division, nor as any part of said Section,

§ 1-106.   Construction.
   1.   Except as may be otherwise specifically provided by any provision of

shall be applied in construing this Code.
   2.   Effect of Repeal or Expiration of Code Section.
      A.   The repeal of a Code Section or ordinance, or its expiration by
virtue of any provision contained therein, shall not affect any right accrued
or any offense committed, any penalty or punishment incurred, or any proceeding
commenced before the repeal took effect or the ordinance expired.
      B.   When any ordinance repealing a former Code Section, ordinance,
clause or provision shall itself be repealed, such repeal shall not be
construed to revive such former Code Section, ordinance, clause or provision,
unless it shall be expressly so provided.
   3.   Saving Clause. The provisions of this Code, so far as they are the same
as those ordinances and regulations in force immediately prior to the adoption
of this Code, are intended as a continuation of such ordinances, resolutions
and regulations and not as a new enactment. The provisions of this Code shall
not affect any suit or prosecution pending or to be instituted to enforce any
of the prior ordinances or regulations. Except as specifically stated in this
Code or in the ordinance adopting this consolidation, codification and revision
of the ordinances and regulations, it is the intention of the Borough Council
that no ordinance or regulation of the Borough be amended, revised or repealed
by implication.
   4.   Resolutions. The provisions of this Code of Ordinances may contain

designated "resolution”) which did not require prior public notice in
accordance with the provisions of the Borough Code, 53 P.S. §45101 et seq., at
the time of their passage by the Borough Council. Such "resolutions” are
included herein for ease of reference and the Borough Council does not intend
by their inclusion herein to require prior public notice before amending,
revising or repealing such resolution or resolutions as may have been included
herein in the future. It is the intention of the Borough Council that such
actions of the Borough Council that may be included in this Code and
specifically cited and designated as a resolution shall not become an ordinance
(requiring prior public notice before amendment, revision or repeal) by the
simple fact of inclusion in this Code.
(Ord. 2011-01, 2/1/2011)
§ 1-107.   Normal Numbering.
   1.   Chapters. Chapters are numbered sequentially in Arabic throughout this
Code.
   2.   Parts. Parts are numbered sequentially in Arabic throughout this Code.
   3.   Whenever other divisions are necessary, Chapters shall be divided into
Subchapters, Parts into Subparts and designated with the Chapter or Part number
followed by a capital letter. For instance, Chapter 1 may be divided into
Subchapters 1A and 1B.
   4.   Sections. Sections are numbered sequentially throughout a Chapter and a
Part such that the first number or numbers is the Chapter number, followed by a
hyphen, followed by the Part number, followed by the Section number within the
Part. For example, "§1-101” designates Chapter 1, Part 1, Section 1. Similarly,
“§27-305” designates Chapter 27, Part 3, Section 5.
   5.   Internal Divisions of Sections. Whenever internal divisions are
necessary, Sections shall be divided into Subsections, Subsections into
Paragraphs, Paragraphs into Subparagraphs, Subparagraphs into Clauses, and

(Ord. 2011-01, 2/1/2011)
§ 1-108.   Special Numbering Problems.
   1.   Addition of New Units Between Existing Units. If it becomes necessary
to introduce a new Chapter, Part or Section between existing Chapters, Parts or
Sections, the new Chapter, Part or Section shall be designated by the addition
of a capital letter suffix to the preceding Chapter, Part or Section number.
Thus, a Chapter introduced between Chapters 5 and 6 would be Chapter 5A and
Sections in that Chapter would be numbered, for instance, “§5A-101.” If it

   1.   After initial licensing and inspection, all licensed units shall be
inspected by the rental code official on a regular basis or by complaint, at

the Code in existence. The owner or agent will provide access to the property
for inspection. The inspection will take place at a mutually agreed upon time
and date, between the rental code official and the owner or agent. Whenever
possible, owners or agents will notify the Borough so inspections will take
place when the rental units are vacant. If, after arranging for an inspection,
access to a property is denied and the inspection cannot be conducted, the
owner or agent will be charged an additional inspection fee to cover the
Borough's cost and inconvenience. [Ord. 2012-05]
   2.   Whenever the rental code official determines that there exists any
violation of this Code, the rental code official will notify the owner or agent
in writing that unless the notice of correction is complied with, the license
may be revoked. The written notice will advise the owner or agent of the
changes necessary to constitute compliance with the Code and include a time
limit to complete the required changes. After the expiration of time for
compliance as stated on the notice of correction, a re-inspection shall be made
to determine compliance. [Ord. 2012-05]
   3.   If the violation has not been corrected and no appeal is pending, the
rental code official may revoke the license and shall serve written notice upon
the owner or agent of such action. [Ord. 2012-05]

revoked or whose application for a license has been denied, may appeal to the
Borough Council as provided in this Part. [Ord. 2011-01]
(Ord. 2003-11, 11/11/2003, §6; as amended by Ord. 2011-01, 2/1/2011; and by
Ord. 2012-05, 12/4/2012, §4)
§ 5-206.   Appeals.
   1.   Any agent or owner aggrieved by a determination of violation issued by
the rental code official, the Borough Secretary or the Borough Solicitor may
appeal the determination to the Borough Council on an appeal form, which may be
obtained from the rental code official or the Borough Secretary. [Ord. 2012-05]
   2.   The appeal must be filed with the Borough Secretary not later than 15
days after the date of the determination of violation.
   3.   The appellant shall pay an appeal fee at the time the appeal is filed.
The Borough Council shall set the amount of the appeal fee by resolution.

than 10 days prior to the date and time of the hearing.
   5.   The burden of proof shall be on the rental code official to establish a
violation of this Part. The determination of the rental code official shall be
affirmed if supported by substantial evidence. Formal rules of evidence shall
not apply so long as the decision of the Borough Council is based on reliable
information, but the decision of the Borough Council may not be based solely on
hearsay evidence. [Ord. 2012-05]

§ 5-207.   Penalties and Fees.
   1.   Licensing and inspection fees will be established by Borough Council
from time to time in accordance with resolution duly adopting same. Failure to
provide appropriate fees will constitute a violation of this Part.
   2.   It shall be a violation of this Part for any person to threaten to
evict or to evict, coerce or otherwise retaliate in any manner against a tenant
for filing, lodging or making a complaint concerning any matter regulated by or
under this Part. [Ord. 2011- 01]
   3.   Any owner or agent who shall violate any provision of this Part shall,
upon conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to a fine of not less than $100 for
the first offense, $250 for the second offense, and $500 for the third offense
nor more than $1,000 plus costs for any offense and, in default of payment of

that a violation of this Part continues or each Section of this Part which
shall be found to have been violated shall constitute a separate offense. [Ord.

enacted legislation (including, but not limited to, the Insurance Company Act
of 1921 and Act 98 of 1992) that the Fire Insurance Escrow Act is promulgated
thereon (hereinafter collectively referred to hereinafter as the “FIEA”) as
they relate to the ability of the Borough of Yoe (both entity and geographic
location hereinafter referred to as the “Borough”) to avail itself of the
provisions of that Act where fire damage to any building(s), structure(s) and
any appurtenance(s) thereto located within the Borough has occurred, which, at
the time of such damage, such building(s), structure(s) and appurtenance(s)
were insured by an insurance company, association or exchange doing business in
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (hereinafter referred to as the
“Commonwealth”).
(Ord. 2017-1, 3/7/2017)
§ 7-402.   Payment of Fire Loss Claims.
   No insurance company, association or exchange (hereinafter “Insuring Agent”)
doing business in the Commonwealth shall pay a claim of a named insured for
fire damage to any property, as provided for in §7-401 of this Part, which
property is located within the Borough and where the amount recoverable for the
fire loss to that property, under any and all related insurance policies,
exceeds $7,500, unless the Insuring Agent is furnished by the Borough Treasurer
with a certificate (and bill, if applicable) pursuant to §638(b) of the FIEA,
and subject to the provisions of §638 et seq. of the FIEA, the previous laws
amended by the FIEA, and the provisions of this Part.

   1.   Certificate Required.
      A.   In the event the Borough Treasurer receives a written request from a
named insured, or their agent, pursuant to §638(b)(1) of the FIEA, the Borough
Treasurer shall obtain a copy of all fire insurance policies covering the
property (or properties) reasonably believed to have sustained fire loss damage
in excess of $7,500.
      B.   Upon receipt of the request stated in paragraph (1) of this
subsection, the Borough Treasurer shall, within 14 working days, provide a
written certificate (i.e., statement or invoice, respectively) detailing the
existence of any delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties, and any charges
against the property of the insured (as provided for in §638(b) of the FIEA)
from any municipality.
   2.   Receipt of Insurance Proceeds.
      A.   Upon receipt of any proceeds from any insurance policy for fire
damage to any property described in §7-401 of this part, the Borough Treasurer
shall:
         (1)   Receive those funds, under the auspices of the FIEA, and those
funds shall be placed in an escrow account held for, or established by, the
Borough to settle any outstanding balance for any debt on the property owed to
the Borough and described hereinafter and also to act as security against the
total cost of removing, repairing or securing the affected property incurred by
the Borough.
         (2)   Notify the named insured and certify that the proceeds have been
received by the Borough and inform the named insured of the procedures that
will be followed under the FIEA.
         (3)   The Borough Treasurer shall credit any amount received against
any outstanding balance on any property described herein, pursuant to §638(b)
(2)(ii) of the FIEA, and transfer that same amount to the Borough to satisfy
any such outstanding balance.
         (4)   Where, pursuant to §638(b)(2)(i) of the FIEA, the Borough
Treasurer issues a certificate indicating that there are not delinquent taxes,
assessments, penalties, or user charges against real property, the Insuring
Agent shall pay the claim of the named insured, provided however, that if the
loss agreed upon by the named insured and the Insuring Agent equals or exceeds
60% of the aggregate limits of liability on all fire policies covering any
building, structure, or any appurtenance thereto, the following procedures must
be followed:
            (a)   The Insuring Agent shall transfer from the insurance proceeds
to the Borough Treasurer the aggregate of $2,000 for each $15,000 for each
claim, and for each fraction of that amount of a claim, to be applied such that
if the claim is $15,000 or less, the amount transferred to the Borough shall be
$2,000; or
            (b)   If the named insured has submitted a contractor’s signed
estimate of the cost of removing, repairing or securing the building(s),
structure(s) or appurtenances thereto in compliance with all other Borough
Ordinances, Uniform Construction Code and the International Property
Maintenance Code, and that cost estimate is less than the formula set forth in
subsection (3)(i) of this section, then the Insuring Agent shall transfer to
the Borough from the insurance proceeds the amount specified in that estimate.
Any amount previously transferred to the Borough in excess of that estimate
shall be returned to the named insured.
            (c)   The transfer of proceeds shall be on pro rata basis by all
companies, associations or exchanges insuring the building(s), structure(s) or
appurtenances thereto.
            (d)   After the transfer, the named insured shall submit a
contractor’s signed estimate within 60 days of the date the certificate
required under subsection A of costs of removing, repairing or securing the
building of other structure, and the Borough Treasurer shall return the amount
of the funds transferred to the Borough in excess of the estimate to the
insured, if the Borough has not commenced to remove, repair or secure the
building or other structure.
         (5)   Upon receipt of proceeds under this section, the Municipality
shall do the following:
            (a)   The designated officer shall place the proceeds in a separate
fund to be used solely as security against the total costs of removing,
repairing, or securing the building or structure which are incurred by the
Municipality. Such costs shall include, all reasonable and customary
engineering, legal or administrative costs incurred by the Municipality in
connection with such removal, repair or securing of the building or any
proceedings related thereto; and
            (b)   It is the obligation of the Insuring Agent when transferring
the proceeds to provide the Municipality with the name and address of the named
insured. Upon receipt of the transferred funds and the name and address of the
named insured, certify that the proceeds have been received by the Municipality
and notify the named insured that the procedures under this subsection shall be
followed; and
            (c)   When repairs, removal or securing of the building or other
structure have been completed in accordance with all applicable regulations and
orders of the Municipality and the required proof of such completion received
by the designated officer, and if the Municipality has not incurred any costs
for repairs, removal or securing of the building or other structure, the costs
shall be paid from the fund and if excess funds remain, the Municipality shall
transfer the remaining funds to the named insured; and
            (d)   To the extent that interest is earned on proceeds held by the
Borough pursuant to this Section, and not returned to the named insured, such
interest shall belong to the Borough. To the extent that proceeds are returned
to the named insured, interest earned on such proceeds shall be distributed to
the named insured at the time that the proceeds are returned.
         (6)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ability
of the Borough to recover any deficiency. Furthermore, nothing in this
subsection shall be construed to prohibit the Borough and the named insured
from entering into an agreement that permits the transfer of funds to the named
insured if some other reasonable disposition of the damaged property has been
negotiated.

§ 8-101.   Statutory Authorization.
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage of
the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978, delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Council of Yoe Borough does hereby order as follows.
(Ord. 2015-04, 11/10/2015, Art. I)
Part 2
General Provisions
§ 8-201.   Intent.
   The intent of this Chapter is to:
      A.   Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
      B.   Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in
order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
      C.   Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.
      D.   Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units, and its residents, by preventing excessive development in areas subject
to flooding.
      E.   Comply with Federal and State floodplain management requirements.
(Ord. 2015-04, 11/10/2015, Art. II, §2.01)
§ 8-202.   Applicability.

or structures.
(Ord. 2015-04, 11/10/2015, Art. II, §2.02)
§ 8-203.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.
   This Chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in
effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance provisions
shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those provisions are
more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of
this Chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
(Ord. 2015-04, 11/10/2015, Art. II, §2.03)
§ 8-204.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
   1.   The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this Chapter
is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on accepted
engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be
increased by man- made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings
restricted by debris. This Chapter does not imply that areas outside any
identified floodplain areas, or that land uses permitted within such areas will
be free from flooding or flood damages.
   2.   This Chapter shall not create liability on the part of Yoe Borough or
any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance
on this Chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

community of its responsibilities pursuant to the participation requirements of
the National Flood Insurance Program as set forth in the Code of Federal
Regulations at 44 C.F.R. §59.22.
   2.   In the absence of a designated Floodplain Administrator, the Floodplain

been determined that the proposed work to be undertaken will be in conformance
with the requirements of this and all other applicable codes and ordinances.
   2.   Prior to the issuance of any permit, the Floodplain Administrator shall

amended); the Pennsylvania Dam Safety and Encroachments Act (Act 1978-325, as
amended); the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Act (Act 1937-394, as amended); and

until this determination has been made.
   3.   In the case of existing structures, prior to the issuance of any
development/permit, the Floodplain Administrator shall review the history of
repairs to the subject building, so that any repetitive loss concerns can be
addressed before the permit is issued.
   4.   During the construction period, the Floodplain Administrator or other
authorized official shall inspect the premises to determine that the work is
progressing in compliance with the information provided on the permit
application and with all applicable municipal laws and ordinances. He/she shall
make as many inspections during and upon completion of the work as are
necessary.

have the authority to enter any building, structure, premises or development in
the identified floodplain area, upon presentation of proper credentials, at any
reasonable hour to enforce the provisions of this Chapter.
   6.   In the event the Floodplain Administrator discovers that the work does
not comply with the permit application or any applicable laws and ordinances,

      A.   Any areas of Yoe Borough, classified as special flood hazard areas
(SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance
Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated December 16, 2015, and issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof, including all
digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study.
      B.   Any community identified flood hazard areas.
   2.   The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and
amendments are hereby adopted by Yoe Borough and declared to be a part of this
Chapter.
(Ord. 2015-04, 11/10/2015, Art. IV, §4.01)
§ 8-402.   Description and Special Requirements of Identified Floodplain Areas.
   The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific
areas:
      A.   The floodway area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse and the
adjacent laud areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without increasing the water surface elevation by more than 1 foot at any
point. This term shall also include floodway areas which have been identified
in other available studies or sources of information for those special flood
hazard areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
         (1)   Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted
unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed
encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
         (2)   Within any floodway area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the Department
of Environmental Protection Regional Office.
      B.   The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone
on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided.
         (1)   The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for
which base flood elevations have been provided and a floodway has been
delineated.
      C.   The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base flood
elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and floodway
information from other Federal, State, or other acceptable sources shall be
used when available. Where other acceptable information is not available, the
base flood elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on
the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site.
   In lieu of the above, the Borough may require the applicant to determine the
elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others
of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods
used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies,
analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow
a thorough technical review by the Borough.
      D.   The AO and AH Area/District shall be those areas identified as Zones
AO and AH on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject to inundation by
1- percent-annual-chance shallow flooding where average depths are between 1
and 3 feet. In Zones AO and AH, drainage paths shall be established to guide
floodwaters around and away from structures on slopes.
      E.   Community identified flood hazard areas shall be those areas where
Yoe Borough has identified local flood hazard or ponding areas, as delineated
and adopted on a “Local Flood Hazard Map” using best available topographic data
and locally derived information such as flood of record, historic high water
marks, soils or approximate study methodologies.
(Ord. 2015-04, 11/10/2015, Art. IV, §4.02)
§ 8-403.   Changes in Identification of Area.
   The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Council
where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person documents
the need for such revision. However, prior to any such change to the special
flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from FEMA. Additionally, as soon
as practicable, but not later than 6 months after the date such information
becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA of the changes to the special
flood hazard area by submitting technical or scientific data. See §
8-501.2 for situations where FEMA notification is required.
(Ord. 2015-04, 11/10/2015, Art. IV, §4.03)
§ 8-404.   Boundary Disputes.
   Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator and any
party aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the Council.
The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
(Ord. 2015-04, 11/10/2015, Art. IV, §4.04)
§ 8-405.   Jurisdictional Boundary Changes.
   Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other corporate
boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community shall review
flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary changes. The
community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in areas subject to
annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or exceed those in CFR 44
60.3.

   Lowest floor–the lowest floor of the lowest fully enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished, flood resistant partially enclosed area, used solely
for parking of vehicles, building access, and incidental storage, in an area
other than a basement area is not considered the lowest floor of a building,
provided that such space is not designed and built so that the structure is in
violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this Chapter.

the exitway requirements; nor shall minor repairs include addition to,
alteration of replacement or relocation of any standpipe, water supply, sewer,
drainage, drain leader, gas, oil, waste, vent, or similar piping, electric
wiring, mechanical or other work affecting public health or general safety.
   New construction–structures for which the start of construction commenced on
or after the effective start date of this Chapter and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures. Any construction started after December 1,
1982, and before the effective start date of this Chapter is subject to the
ordinance in effect at the time the permit was issued, provided the start of
construction was within 180 days of permit issuance.
   New manufactured home park or subdivision–a manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
   Person–an individual, partnership, public or private association or
corporation, firm, trust, estate, municipality, governmental unit, public
utility or any other legal entity whatsoever, which is recognized by law as the
subject of rights and duties.
   Post-FIRM structure–is a structure for which construction or substantial
improvement occurred after December 31, 1974, or on or after the community’s
initial Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) dated December 1, 1982, whichever is
later, and, as such, would be required to be compliant with the regulations of
the National Flood Insurance Program.
   Pre-FIRM structure–is a structure for which construction or substantial
improvement occurred on or before December 31, 1974, or before the community’s
initial Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) dated December 1, 1982, whichever is
later, and, as such, would not be required to be compliant with the regulations
of the National Flood Insurance Program.
   Recreational vehicle–a vehicle which is:
      A.   Built on a single chassis.
      B.   Not more than 400 square feet, measured at the largest horizontal
projections.
      C.   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty
truck.
      D.   Not designed for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living
quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   Regulatory flood elevation–the base flood elevation (BFE) or estimated flood
height as determined using simplified methods plus a freeboard safety factor of
1½ feet.
   Repetitive loss–flood related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a 10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the
time of each such flood event, on average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the
market value of the structure before the damages occurred.
   Special permit–a special approval which is required for hospitals, nursing
homes, jails, and new manufactured home parks/ subdivisions and substantial
improvements to such existing parks, when such development is located in all,
or a designated portion of a floodplain.
   Special flood hazard area (SFHA)–an area in the floodplain subject to a 1
percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on the
FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1-30, AE, A99, or, AH.
   Start of construction–includes substantial improvement and other proposed
new development and means the date the permit was issued, provided the actual
start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days after the date of the
permit and shall be completed within 12 months after the date of issuance of
the permit unless a time extension is granted, in writing, by the Floodplain
Administrator. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufacture home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   Structure–a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage
tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
   Subdivision–the division or re-division of a lot, tract, or parcel of land
by any means into two or more lots, tracts, parcels or other divisions of land
including changes in existing lot lines for the purpose, whether immediate or
future, of lease, partition by the court for distribution to heirs, or
devisees, transfer of ownership or building or lot development, provided,
however, that the subdivision by lease of land for agricultural purposes into
parcels of more than ten acres, not involving any new street or easement of
access or any residential dwelling, shall be exempted.
   Substantial damage–damage from any cause sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50 percent or more of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
   Substantial improvement–any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, of which the cost equals or exceeds 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction”
of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred
“substantial damage” or “repetitive loss” regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a
structure to correct existing violations of State or local health, sanitary, or
safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living
conditions.
   Uniform Construction Code (UCC)–the statewide building code adopted by the
Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1999, applicable to new construction in all
municipalities whether administered by the Borough, a third party or the
Department of Labor and Industry. Applicable to residential and commercial
buildings, the Code adopted the International Residential Code (IRC) and the
International Building Code (IBC), by reference, as the construction standard
applicable with the State floodplain construction. For coordination purposes,
references to the above are made specifically to various Sections of the IRC
and the IBC.
   Variance–a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain
management regulation.
   Violation–the failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR §60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)
(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until
such time as that documentation is provided.

General Provisions
§ 9-101.   Short Title.
   This Chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Yoe Borough Stormwater
Management Ordinance.”
(Ord. 2012-01, 1/3/2012, §101; as amended by Ord. 2022-01, 4/5/2022, §101)
§ 9-102.   Statement of Findings.
   The Borough Council of Yoe Borough finds that:
      A.   Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases runoff volumes, flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying
capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public
facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines floodplain management
and flood control efforts in downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, threatens public health and safety, and increases nonpoint source
pollution of water resources.
      B.   A comprehensive program of stormwater management (SWM), including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff,
is fundamental to the public health, safety, and welfare and the protection of
people of the Commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
      C.   Stormwater is an important water resource that provides groundwater
recharge for water supplies and supports the base flow of streams.
      D.   The use of green infrastructure and low impact development (LID) are
intended to address the root cause of water quality impairment by using systems
and practices which use or mimic natural processes to: 1) infiltrate and
recharge, 2) evapotranspire, and/or 3) harvest and use precipitation near where
it falls to earth. Green infrastructure practices and LID contribute to the
restoration or maintenance of pre-development hydrology.
      E.   Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls, called a Municipal Separate Storm
Sewer System (MS4) Program. These municipalities are required to obtain a
permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under
the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program.
(Ord. 2012-01, 1/3/2012, §102; as amended by Ord. 2022-01, 4/5/2022, §102)
§ 9-103.   Purpose.
   The purpose of this Chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
the municipality and its watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing the
benefits described in §9-102 of this Chapter, through provisions designed to:
      A.   Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa.Code 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim, and restore the
existing and designated uses of the waters of this Commonwealth.
      B.   Preserve natural drainage systems.
      C.   Manage stormwater runoff close to the source, reduce runoff volumes
and mimic pre-development hydrology.
      D.   Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater planning
and management.
      E.   Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and
groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources.
      F.   Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
      G.   Provide proper operation and maintenance of all stormwater best
management practices (BMPs) that are implemented within the municipality.
      H.   Provide standards to meet and enforce NPDES permit requirements.
      I.   Create a platform with which to advocate and grow the use of low-
impact development procedures and green infrastructure.
      J.   Protect people and property from the known and unknown changes to
our climate and weather patterns.
(Ord. 2012-01, 1/3/2012, §103; as amended by Ord. 2022-01, 4/5/2022, §103)
§ 9-104.   Statutory Authority.
   The Borough is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect runoff
by the authority of the Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, The
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, and/or the Act of
October 4, 1978, P.L. 864 (Act 167), 32 P.S. Section 680.1, et seq., as
amended, The Stormwater Management Act.
(Ord. 2012-01, 1/3/2012, §104; as amended by Ord. 2022-01, 4/5/2022, §104)
§ 9-105.   Applicability.
   All regulated activities and all activities that may affect stormwater
runoff, including land development and earth disturbance activity, are subject
to regulation by this Chapter.
(Ord. 2012-01, 1/3/2012, §105; as amended by Ord. 2022-01, 4/5/2022, §105)
§ 9-106.   Compatibility with Other Requirements.
   Approvals issued and actions taken under this Chapter do not relieve the
applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for
activities regulated by any other code, law, regulation or ordinance.
(Ord. 2012-01, 1/3/2012, §108; as amended by Ord. 2022-01, 4/5/2022, §108)
§ 9-107.   Erroneous Permit.
   Any permit or authorization issued or approved based on false, misleading or
erroneous information provided by an applicant is void without the necessity of
any proceedings for revocation. Any work undertaken or use established pursuant
to such permit or other authorization is unlawful. No action may be taken by
the Council, agency or employee of the Borough purporting to validate such a
violation.
(Ord. 2012-01, 1/3/2012, §110; as amended by Ord. 2022-01, 4/5/2022, §109)
§ 9-108.   Waivers.
   A.   If the Borough determines that any requirement under this Chapter
cannot be achieved for a particular regulated activity, the Borough may, after
an evaluation of alternatives, approve measures other than those in this
Chapter, subject to paragraphs B and C of this section.
   B.   Waivers or modifications of the requirements of this Chapter may be
approved by the Borough if enforcement will exact undue hardship because of
peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question, provided that the
modifications will not be contrary to the public interest and that the purpose
of the Chapter is preserved. Cost or financial burden shall not be considered a
hardship. Modification may be considered if an alternative standard or approach
will provide equal or better achievement of the purpose of the Chapter. A
request for modifications shall be in writing and accompany the Stormwater
Management Site Plan submission. The request shall provide the facts on which
the request is based, the provision(s) of the Chapter involved and the proposed
modification.
   C.   No waiver or modification of any regulated stormwater activity
involving earth disturbance greater than or equal to one acre may be granted by
the Borough unless that action is approved in advance by the Department of
Environmental Protection (DEP) or the delegated county conservation district.
(Ord. 2022-01, 4/5/2022, §110)

operational and/or behavior-related practices that attempt to minimize the
contact of pollutants with stormwater runoff whereas structural BMPs or
measures are those that consist of a physical device or practice that is
installed to capture and treat stormwater runoff. Structural BMPs include, but
are not limited to, a wide variety of practices and devices, from large-scale
retention ponds and constructed wetlands, to small-scale underground treatment
systems, infiltration facilities, filter strips, low impact design,
bioretention, wet ponds, permeable paving, grassed swales, riparian or forested
buffers, sand filters, detention basins, and manufactured devices. Structural
stormwater BMPs are permanent appurtenances to the project site.

that investigates set design storms characterized by a specific duration,
temporal distribution, rainfall intensity, return frequency, and total depth of
rainfall.
   CG-2–A simplified method for design storm estimation that does not take into
account site conditions and is focused on capturing and removing the first-
flush of stormwater runoff. This method is applicable to designing projects
with a land disturbance of 0.5 acres or less.
   Clean Water Act (CWA)–the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C.
§§1251- 1387.
   Cleaning agent–any product, substance or chemical other than water that is
used to clean the exterior surface of vehicles.
   Conservation District–the York County Conservation District, which district
is as defined in §3(c) of the Conservation District Law (3 P.S. §851(c)) that

Chapter 102.
   DEP–the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.
   Design storm–the magnitude and temporal distribution of precipitation from a
storm event measured in probability of occurrence, e.g., a 5-year storm, and
duration, e.g., 24 hours, used in the design and evaluation of stormwater
management systems. Also see “return period.”
   Designated uses–uses specified in 25 Pa.Code §§93.4(a) and 93.9a - 93.9z for
each water body or segment whether or not they are being attained. (25 Pa.Code

drainage or other events producing a stormwater discharge for more than 48
consecutive hours.
   Earth disturbance activity–a construction or other human activity which
disturbs the surface of the land, including, but not limited to: clearing and
grubbing; grading; excavations; embankments; road maintenance; building
construction; and the moving, depositing, stockpiling, or storing of soil,
rock, or earth materials.
   Erosion–the natural process by which the surface of the land is worn away by
water, wind, or chemical action.
   Existing condition–the dominant land cover during the 5-year period
immediately preceding a proposed regulated activity.
   Existing permittee–any entity that has been designated as a regulated small
MS4 and has previously obtained permit coverage under the PAG-13 General Permit
or obtained an Individual NPDES MS4 Permit.
   Existing uses–those uses actually attained in the water body on or after
November 28, 1975, whether or not they are included in the water quality
standards. (25 Pa.Code §93.1)
   FEMA–Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   Floodplain–any land area susceptible to inundation by water from any natural
source as delineated by applicable FEMA maps and studies as being a special
flood hazard area. Also includes areas that comprise Group 13 Soils, as listed
in Appendix A of the Pennsylvania DEP Technical Manual for Sewage Enforcement
Officers (as amended or replaced from time to time by DEP).
   Floodway–the channel of the watercourse and those portions of the adjoining
floodplains that are reasonably required to carry and discharge the 100-year
flood. Unless otherwise specified, the boundary of the floodway is as indicated
on maps and flood insurance studies provided by FEMA. In an area where no FEMA
maps or studies have defined the boundary of the 100-year floodway, it is
assumed, absent evidence to the contrary, that the floodway extends from the
stream to 50 feet from the top of the bank of the stream.
   Forest management/timber operations–planning and activities necessary for
the management of forest land. These include conducting a timber inventory,

processes to infiltrate, evapotranspire, or reuse stormwater on the site where
it is generated.
   HEC-RAS (Hydrological Engineering Centre - River Analysis System)–is a one-
dimensional hydraulic modelling program based on 4 types of analysis in rivers:
Steady Flow, Unsteady Flow, Sediment Transport, and Water Quality Analysis.
Models simulate the flow in natural riverbeds or artificial channels to
determine water levels using various data inputs. HEC-RAS Analyses are
primarily developed for flood studies and determining potential drainage
impacts to waterways.
   High quality or exceptional value waters–a Pennsylvania surface water that
meets one or more of the following conditions with regards to chemistry
(supports propagation of aquatic life) and biology (supports a diverse
community of aquatic life).
      Exceptional value water–a surface water that meets one or more of the
following conditions is an exceptional value water: located in a National or
State wildlife refuge, game, or protection area; the water is considered an
outstanding National, State, or local resource water; surface water is of
exceptional recreation significance, the waterway is designated as a
"wilderness trout stream" by the Fish and Boat Commission; and/or, the water is
a surface water of exceptional ecological significance.
   Hydrologic soil group (HSG)–infiltration rates of soils vary widely and are
affected by subsurface permeability as well as surface intake rates. Soils are
classified into four HSGs (A, B, C, and D) according to their minimum
infiltration rate, which is obtained for bare soil after prolonged wetting. The
NRCS defines the four groups and provides a list of most of the soils in the
United States and their group classification. The soils in the area of the
development site may be identified from a soil survey report that can be
obtained from local NRCS offices or conservation district offices. Soils become
less pervious as the HSG varies from A to D (NRCS 1, 2).
   Illicit connection–any physical connection to a municipal separate storm
sewer system that can convey illicit discharges into the system and/or is not
authorized or permitted by the permittee.
   Illicit discharge–any discharge to a municipal separate storm sewer that is
not composed entirely of stormwater, except non-stormwater discharges as
described in the "Discharges Authorized by this General Permit" section of this
General Permit. Examples of illicit discharges include dumping of motor vehicle
fluids, household hazardous wastes, grass clippings, leaf litter, animal
wastes, or unauthorized discharges of sewage, industrial waste, restaurant
wastes, or any other non-stormwater waste into a municipal separate storm sewer
system. Illicit discharges can be accidental or intentional.
   Impaired waters–surface waters that fail to attain one or more of its
designated uses under 25 Pa.Code Chapter 93 and as listed in Categories 4 and 5
of Pennsylvania's Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report.
   Impervious surface (impervious area)–A surface that prevents the
infiltration of water into the ground. Impervious surfaces (or areas) shall
include, but not be limited to: roofs; additional indoor living spaces, patios,
garages, storage sheds and similar structures; and any new streets, driveway,
access drives, parking areas, and sidewalks. Any areas designed to be covered
by loose surfacing materials such as gravel, stone, and/or crushed stone, and
intended for storage of and/or travel by motorized or non- motorized vehicles,
or travel by pedestrians shall be considered impervious. Surfaces or areas
designed, constructed, and maintained to permit infiltration as specified
herein may be considered pervious. For the purposes of this Chapter, a surface
or area shall not be considered impervious if such surface or area does not
diminish the capacity for infiltration of stormwater for storms up to, and
including, a 2-year, 24-hour storm event.
   Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report– the report
published every other year by DEP to report on the conditions of Pennsylvania's
surface waters to satisfy sections 305(b) and 303(d) of the CWA Intermittent
Stream means a body of water flowing in a channel or bed composed primarily of
substrates associated with flowing water, which, during periods of the year, is
below the local water table and obtains its flow from both surface runoff and
groundwater discharges. (25 Pa.Code §92a.2)
   Karst–a type of topography or landscape characterized by surface
depressions, sinkholes, rock pinnacles/uneven bedrock surface, underground
drainage, and caves. Karst is formed on carbonate rocks, such as limestone or
dolomite.
   Land development–shall include any or all of the following activities:
      A.   The improvement of one lot or two or more contiguous lots, tracts,
or parcels of land for any purpose involving:
         (1)   A group of two or more buildings, or
         (2)   The division or allocation of land or space between or among two
or more existing or prospective occupants by means of, or for the purpose of
streets, common areas, leaseholds, condominiums, building groups, or other
features.
      B.   A subdivision of land.
      C.   Development in accordance with §503(1.1) of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §10503(1.1).
   Load allocation–the portion of a surface water's loading capacity that is
assigned or allocated to existing and future nonpoint sources and natural
quality. (25 Pa.Code §96.1)
   Low Impact Development (LID)–site design approaches and small-scale
stormwater management practices that promote the use of natural systems for
infiltration, evapotranspiration, and reuse of rainwater. LID can be applied to
new development, urban retrofits, and revitalization projects. LID utilizes
design techniques that infiltrate, filter, evaporate, and store runoff close to
its source. Rather than rely on costly large-scale conveyance and treatment
systems, LID addresses stormwater through a variety of small, cost-effective
landscape features located on-site.
   MS4 requirements table–is a compilation of information regarding
Pennsylvania MS4s, surface waters that receive stormwater discharges from MS4s,
surface water impairments, and TMDLs that is posted to DEP's website
www.dep.pa.gov/MS4. The MS4 Requirements Table has been assembled by DEP to
assist MS4 permittees in determining applicable requirements for the
development of plans and implementation of BMPs, as well as eligibility for the
PAG-13 General Permit. In general, the MS4 Requirements Table will be updated
prior to each renewal of this General Permit based on DEP's latest published
Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report.
   Municipal separate storm sewer–a conveyance or system of conveyances
(including roads with drainage systems, municipal streets, catch basins, curbs,
gutters, ditches, man-made channels, or storm drains): (i) owned or operated by
a State, city, town, borough, county, parish, district, association, or other
public body (created by or pursuant to State law) having jurisdiction over
disposal of sewage, industrial wastes, stormwater, or other wastes, including
special districts under State law such as a sewer district, flood control
district or drainage district, or similar entity, or an Indian tribe or an
authorized Indian tribal organization, or a designated and approved management
agency under section 208 of the CWA that discharges to surface waters; (ii)
designed or used for collecting or conveying stormwater; (iii) which is not a
combined sewer; and (iv) which is not part of a Publicly Owned Treatment Works
(POTW) as defined at 40 CFR 122.2. (25 Pa.Code §92a.32(a) and 40 CFR §122.26(b)
(8))
   Municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4)–all separate storm sewers that
are defined as "large" or "medium" or "small" municipal separate storm sewer
systems pursuant to 40 CFR §§122.26(b)(4), (b)(7), and (b)(16), respectively,
or designated under 40 CFR §122.26(a)(1)(v). (25 Pa.Code §92a.32(a) and 40 CFR
§122.26(b)(18))
   Municipality–a city, town, borough, county, township, school district,
institution, authority, or other public body created by or pursuant to State
law and having jurisdiction over disposal of sewage, industrial wastes, or
other wastes. (25 Pa.Code §92a.2)
   Modified rational method–The modified rational method provides a way to
calculate the hydrograph from a catchment based on rational method C values and
the peak intensity. There is no "loss method" associated with the modified
rational method. The underlying assumption is that the peak intensity is
maintained for a long enough duration to reach peak flow at the outlet of the
catchment. This results in a trapezoidal hydrograph, as shown below.
[image]
   Qpeak is determined from the rational method (see definition for "Rational
Method")
   Q=C iA
      When using English units, i is intensity in in/hr, A = area, acres, Q =
flow, cfs, and C is runoff coefficient, dimensionless. The time to reach the
peak is based on the time of concentration in the catchment, which the user can
manually enter or calculate using a variety of methods ("Rational Method"). The
length of the recession leg is based on the time of concentration times a
recession multiplier which is set in the calculations options. The intensity
and duration are taken from the IDF curves (tables) based on the duration and
frequency (return period) of the storm.
   Non-structural BMPs–actions that involve management and source controls such
as: (1) policies and ordinances that provide requirements and standards to
direct growth to identified areas, promote redevelopment, protect areas such as
wetlands and riparian areas, maintain and/or increase open space, provide
buffers along water bodies, minimize impervious surfaces, and minimize
disturbance of soils and vegetation; (2) education programs for developers and
the public about minimizing water quality impacts; (3) measures such as
minimizing the percentage of impervious area after development, use of measures
to minimize directly connected impervious areas, street sweeping, and source
control measures such as good housekeeping, maintenance, and spill prevention;
and other BMPs as referenced in Chapter 5 of the Pennsylvania Stormwater BMP
Manual (363-0300-002).

State or otherwise qualified by law to perform the work required by this
Chapter.
   Rational method–The rational method solves for peak discharge based on
watershed area, Rational coefficient, and rainfall intensity for the watershed.

rainfall event in a particular area. Although the method is designed for a
single storm event, it can be scaled to find average annual runoff values. The
curve number is based on the area's hydrologic soil group, land use, treatment,
and hydrologic condition.

2022 S-6   9-19
§9-303   Borough of Yoe   §9-304
   A.   The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual4) is applicable to any
size of regulated activity. This method requires detailed modeling based on
site conditions.
      1.   Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the 2-year, 24-hour duration precipitation.
   B.   For modeling purposes:
      1.   Existing (predevelopment) non-forested pervious areas must be
considered meadow in good condition.
      2.   20% of existing impervious areas to be disturbed by the project,
when present, shall be considered meadow in good condition in the model for
existing conditions. Regulated activities not requiring an NDPES Permit are
exempt from this requirement.
   C.   The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual4) provided below is
independent of site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm Method is
not followed. This method is not applicable for regulated activities that add
greater than one-half (½) acre of new impervious area or for projects that
require routing of stormwater storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
      1.   Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two (2)
inches of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
      2.   At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious surfaces
shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it shall not be
released into the surface waters of this Commonwealth. Removal options include
reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration.
      3.   Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed runoff; however, in
all cases, at least the first 0.5 inch of the permanently removed runoff should
be infiltrated.
      4.   This method is exempt from the requirements of §9-304, Rate
Controls.
(Ord. 2012-01, 1/3/2012, §304; as amended by Ord. 2022-01, 4/5/2022, §303)
§ 9-304.   Rate Controls.
   A.   For computation of pre-development peak discharge rates, 20% of
existing impervious areas to be disturbed by the project, when present, shall
be considered meadow. Regulated activities not requiring an NDPES Permit are
exempt from this requirement.
   B.   For areas not covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
Stormwater Management Plan: Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed
the pre-development discharge rates for the 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-
year, 24-hour storm events. If it is shown that the peak rates of discharge
indicated by the post-development analysis are less than or equal to the peak
rates of discharge indicated by the pre-development analysis for 1-, 2-, 5-,
10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year, 24-hour storms, then the requirements of this
section have been met. Otherwise, the applicant shall provide additional
controls as necessary to satisfy the peak rate of discharge requirement.
   C.   For areas covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
Stormwater Management Plan: For the 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year,
24-hour storm events, the post-development peak discharge rates will follow the
applicable approved release rate maps. For any areas not shown on the release
rate maps, the post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the pre-
development discharge rates.

be measured to be the greater of the limit of the 100 year floodplain or a
minimum of 35 feet from the top of the streambank (on each side).
   C.   Minimum Management Requirements for Riparian Buffers.
      1.   Existing native vegetation shall be protected and maintained within
the riparian buffer easement.
      2.   Whenever practicable invasive vegetation shall be actively removed,
and the riparian buffer easement shall be planted with native trees, shrubs and
other vegetation to create a diverse native plant community appropriate to the
intended ecological context of the site.
   D.   The riparian buffer easement shall be enforceable by the Borough and
shall be recorded in the appropriate County Recorder of Deeds Office so that it
shall run with the land and shall limit the use of the property located
therein. The easement shall allow for the continued private ownership and shall
count toward the minimum lot area required by zoning unless otherwise specified
in the Municipal Zoning Ordinance.
   E.   Any permitted use within the riparian buffer easement shall be
conducted in a manner that will maintain the extent of the existing 100-year
floodplain, improve or maintain the stream stability, and preserve and protect
the ecological function of the floodplain.

§ 9-306.   Design Criteria.
   A.   Off-Site Areas. Off-site areas which drain through a proposed
development site are not subject to release rate criteria when determining
allowable peak runoff rates. However, on-site drainage facilities shall be
designed to safely convey off-site flows through the development site.
   B.   On-Site Areas. On-site areas proposed to remain undisturbed as part of
the regulated activity, including previously developed areas, shall be
considered as existing conditions.
   C.   Downstream Hydraulic Capacity Analysis. Any existing downstream
capacity hydraulic analysis shall be conducted in accordance with this Chapter.
      1.   All downstream facilities impacted by the total site area of the
regulated facility shall be studied to determine if the facility has adequate
capacity to handle existing and proposed flows. An impacted downstream facility
is one to which the runoff from the total site area of the regulated activity
comprises more than 50% of the total flow to such a facility. The study shall
end at a perennial stream unless directed otherwise by the Borough Engineer.
Downstream facilities include, but are not limited to, man-made or natural
swales and open channels, pipes, inlets, culverts, bridges, and roadways.
      2.   If any private facility is found to be undersized, the applicant
shall be responsible for updating the facility in coordination with the
regulated activity.
      3.   If any public facility is found to be undersized or inadequate, the
applicant shall work with the Borough or State Agency on upgrading the facility
in coordination with the regulated activity.
   D.   Regional Detention Alternatives. For certain areas within the study
area, it may be more cost-effective to provide one control facility for more
than one development site than to provide an individual control facility for
each development site. The initiative and funding for any regional runoff
control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective developers. The
design of any regional control basins must incorporate reasonable development
of the entire upstream watershed. The peak outflow of a regional basin would be
determined on a case-by-case basis using the hydrologic model of the watershed
consistent with protection of the downstream watershed areas. "Hydrologic
model" refers to the calibrated model as developed for the stormwater
management plan.
   E.   Capacity Improvements of Local Drainage Networks. In certain instances,
local drainage conditions may dictate more stringent levels of runoff control
than those based upon protection of the entire watershed. In these instances,
if the developer could prove that it would be feasible to provide capacity
improvements to relieve the capacity deficiency in the local drainage network,
then the capacity improvements could be provided by the developer in lieu of
runoff controls on the development site. Any capacity improvements would be
designed based upon development of all areas tributary to the proposed
improvement and the capacity criteria specified in §9-308. In addition, all new
development upstream of a proposed capacity improvement shall be assumed to
implement the applicable runoff controls consistent with this Chapter except
that all new development within the entire subarea(s) within which the proposed
development site is located shall be assumed to implement the developer's
proposed discharge control if any.
   F.   Capacity improvements may also be provided as necessary to implement
any regional or sub-regional detention alternatives.
   G.   Where the potential for groundwater and/or surface water contamination
exists, based on the proposed use of the regulated activity, safeguards shall
be incorporated into the site.
   H.   Roof drains and sump pumps shall discharge to infiltration or
vegetative BMPs and to the maximum extent practicable satisfy the criteria for
DIAs.
   I.   Stormwater runoff shall not be transferred from one watershed to
another unless the watersheds are sub-watersheds of a common watershed which
join together within the perimeter of the property. The transfer of watersheds
may be permitted in the event the transfer does not alter the peak discharge
onto downstream lands or drainage easements are acquired from the affected
landowners.
   J.   All storm sewer pipes, culverts, bridges, gutters, and swales
(excluding outfall structures from stormwater management facilities) conveying
water originating only from within the boundaries of the project site shall be
designed for a 25-year storm event. All other storm sewer pipes, culverts and
bridges, gutters and swales (excluding detention and retention basin outfall
structures and excluding sole access structures) conveying water originating
from off-site shall be designed for a 50-year storm event. Sole access
structures shall be designed to convey the 100-year storm event without roadway
overtopping. Drainage and access easements shall be provided to encompass the
water surface limits of the 100-year storm event throughout the project site
and to provide access from a public street to the stormwater facility.
Easements shall begin at the furthest upstream property line of the proposed
development in the watershed.
   K.   The maximum water depth for aboveground storage facilities shall not
exceed 6 feet measured at the emergency spillway.
   L.   Flow velocities from any storm sewer may not result in erosion of the
receiving channel. Adequate erosion protection shall be provided along all open
channels and at all points of discharge.
   M.   For all swales, capacities and velocities shall be computed using the
Manning Equation. The following design considerations shall be met:
      1.   Two analyses of channel velocity and stability shall be provided
with each swale design. One analysis shall be based upon the swale in an
unvegetated state with control matting and the second shall consider the
channel in permanent, designed conditions.
      2.   All swales shall have a minimum slope of 1% unless otherwise
approved by the Borough Engineer.
   N.   Design Standards.  Facilities within the public street right-of-way:
      1.   Storm sewer pipes, other than those used for street subbase
underdrains, shall have a minimum diameter of 15 inches. Structural
calculations that address the actual design requirements will be required where
installation conditions merit.
      2.   Storm sewer pipes and culverts shall be installed with a minimum
slope of 0.5%.
      3.   Allowable pipes, culvert, and bridge materials shall be as outlined
in the Borough's construction and material specifications.
      4.   All storm sewer crossings of streets shall not deviate by more than
15 degrees from perpendicular to the street centerline.
      5.   All storm sewer pipes and culverts shall be laid to a minimum depth
of 12 inches from finished subgrade to the crown of the pipe in paved and
grassed areas, or more if specified by the manufacturer.
      6.   Curves or angle points in pipes or box culverts without the use of
an inlet or manhole are prohibited unless pre-approved by the Borough. Tee
joints, elbows, and wyes shall be limited for use in constructing underground
detention facilities, underground retention facilities, underdrain systems, and
roof leader collection systems.
      7.   Manholes, inlets, headwalls, endwalls, and end sections shall
conform to the requirements of the PennDOT, Publication 408.
      8.   Inlets shall be placed on both sides of the street at low spots, at
a maximum of 600 feet apart along a storm sewer pipe or culvert, and at points
of abrupt changes in the horizontal or vertical directions of storm sewers.
Inlets shall normally be along the curb line at or beyond the curb radius
points. Within the street right-of-way, the gutter spread based on the 25-year
storm event shall be no greater than one-half of the travel lane width and have
a maximum depth of 3 inches at the curb line. A parking lane shall not be
considered as part of the travel lane. In the absence of pavement markings
separating a travel lane from the parking lane, the parking lane shall be
assumed to be 8 feet wide if parking is permitted on the street. At
intersections and access driveways, the depth of flow across the through-
streets and across the access driveways (proposed and existing) shall not
exceed one and one-half inches for the 25-year storm event. Manholes may be
substituted for inlets at locations where inlets are not required to handle
surface runoff.
      9.   Placement or use of BMPs within the public street right-of-way shall
only be allowed after Borough approval.
   O.   Design Standards.  Facilities outside of the public street right-of-
way:
      1.   The design of all BMP facilities shall incorporate best engineering
practices. The design engineer shall utilize all available design criteria in
the BMP Manual to meet the requirements of this Chapter and shall provide all
the necessary backup documentation with their submittal.
      2.   The BMPs must be designed to protect and maintain existing uses and
maintain the level of water quality necessary to protect those uses in all
streams, and to protect and maintain water quality in "special protection"
streams, as required by statewide regulations at 25 Pa.Code Chapter 93.
      3.   No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Borough shall
commence until approval by the Borough of a plan that ensures post-construction
stormwater discharges do not degrade the physical, chemical, or biological
characteristics of the receiving waters.
   P.   Design Standards - Subsurface Infiltration Facilities:
      1.   Positive overflow must be provided in the subsurface infiltration
facility. Overflow structures or pipes must be designed to convey the inflow
capacity of the facility. Note: Volume control credits may not be used above
the lowest invert of the positive overflow structure or pipe.
      2.   The minimum allowable distance between a subsurface infiltration
facility and structure/building/retaining wall is 10 feet.
      3.   The subsurface infiltration facility must be located at least 2 feet
above any limiting zone, i.e., seasonal high groundwater table, bedrock, or
poorly infiltrating soils.
      4.   Soils with rates exceeding 10 inches per hour require soil
amendments. During construction, upon reaching the subgrade of the infiltration
facility, a 2-foot thick layer of soil amendments must be spread across the
entire facility bottom area, below the designed bottom of the facility. Soil
media infiltration rate must be provided upon design.
      5.   The infiltration facility must include an acceptable form of
pretreatment before stormwater enters the facility. An acceptable form of
pretreatment includes an inlet with an 18 inch sump and 1 inch diameter weep
holes. Other forms of pretreatment must be approved by the Borough Engineer.
      6.   Subsurface infiltration facilities may not use a geotextile liner to
separate the storage area from the subgrade. Geotextile liners may only be used
on the sides and top. MSHTO Class 1 or Class 2 geotextile is recommended.
      7.   Subsurface infiltration facilities must contain a cleanout or
observation well near the center of the facility and at the end of any portion
of underdrain. The observation well or cleanout must be placed at the invert of
the stone bed and extend up to grade. Adequate inspection and maintenance
access to the observation well or cleanout must be provided.
      8.   In subsurface infiltration facilities that include chamber, pipe, or
other storage system, a sufficient number of access features must be provided
to efficiently inspect and maintain the infiltration area.
      9.   Perforated distribution pipes must contain a bedding of at least 4
inches separating the pipe and subgrade.
      10.   Infiltration testing standards set forth in the appendix shall be
followed when designing a subsurface infiltration facility.
   Q.   Design Standards; Water Carrying Facilities.
      1.   When a pipe or culvert is intended to convey the discharge from a
stormwater management facility, its required capacity shall be computed by the
rational method and compared to the peak outflow from the stormwater facility
for the 100-year storm. The greater flow shall govern the design of the pipe or
culvert.
      2.   When a pipe is part of a storm sewer system and crosses the roadway,
it shall be designed as a storm sewer with the same design storm as the
remainder of the drainage system.
      3.   Greater design frequencies may be justified on individual projects.
      4.   A 100-year storm frequency may be required for design of the
stormwater collection system to ensure that the runoff from the post-
development storm is directed into the intended management facility.
      5.   In general, inlets shall be spaced such that, based upon the
rational method, tc = 5 min. and 10-year rainfall intensity, the area
contributing to the inlet shall not produce a peak runoff of greater than 4
cfs. Also, inlets shall be spaced so that their efficiency, based upon
efficiency curves published by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation,
is not less than 65%.
      6.   Proposed channels or swales must be able to convey the increased
runoff associated with a proposed 100-year return period event within their
banks at velocities consistent with protection of the channels from erosion.
Acceptable velocities shall be based upon criteria included in the PADEP
Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control Program Manual.
      7.   All other storm sewer manholes and inlets shall have smooth flow
lines grouted.
      8.   Inlets shall be placed on both sides of the street at low spots and
at the upper side of street intersections to prevent stormwater from crossing
an intersection. Other devices such as high efficiency grates or perforated
pipe may be required if conditions warrant. All inlets at low points along the
roadway shall have an 8-inch curb reveal and shall be equipped with pavement
base drain extending 50 feet in either direction, parallel to the centerline of
the roadway.
      9.   Headwalls and endwalls shall be used where stormwater runoff enters
or leaves the storm sewer horizontally from a natural or man-made channel. In
all cases where drainage is picked up by means of a headwall, the pipe shall be
designed as a culvert. Inlet and outlet conditions shall be analyzed. PennDOT
type "dw" headwalls and endwalls shall be utilized for pipes 15 inches and
larger in diameter. End sections shall be utilized for pipes smaller than 15
inches in diameter.
      10.   Guards shall be provided on all intake and outfall structures as
well as outlet structures. The guard bars shall be ½-inch diameter galvanized
bars on 6- inch centers attached to the structure with 3/8-inch diameter
stainless steel anchors. Guards shall also be provided for any pipe opening, 18
inch in diameter or larger.
      11.   Manholes, inlets, headwalls, and endwalls shall conform to the
requirements of the PennDOT Publication 408, as modified by the Borough
construction and materials standards.
      12.   Stormwater runoff on roadways (i.e., gutter spread, lane
encroachment, etc.) shall be controlled in accordance with PennDOT Publications
13M, "Design Manual," Part 2, Chapter 10, and 584, "Drainage Manual."
   R.   Design Standards; Detention and Retention Basins.
      1.   Permanent detention and retention basins shall be designed to meet
the following standards:
         a.   The maximum permitted depth for detention or retention basins
shall be 6 feet, measured from the bottom of the emergency spillway to the
lowest point in the basin.
         b.   The minimum top width of all basin embankments shall be 8 feet.
         c.   The maximum permitted inside side-slopes for detention or
retention basins shall be 4 to 1 vertical. 3 to 1 vertical inside side-slopes
may be approved upon furnishing an appropriate planting schedule. The maximum
permitted outside side-slopes shall be 3 to 1 vertical and utilize a seed mix
designed for embankments. Areas for vehicle access shall be provided and
encompassed by a 20' wide easement and shall have slopes no greater than 5 to 1
vertical. The proposed vegetation shall be low maintenance varieties.
         d.   Any stormwater management facility (i.e., detention basin)
designed to store runoff and requiring a berm or earthen embankment required or
regulated by this Chapter shall be designed to provide an emergency spillway to
handle flow up to and including the 100-year, 24-hour design storm at post-
development conditions, assuming the principal outlet structure to be clogged.
The height of the embankment must be set as to provide a minimum of 1 foot of
freeboard above the maximum elevation computed. Should any stormwater
management facility require a dam safety permit under PADEP 25 Pa.Code, Chapter
105, the facility shall be designed in accordance with PADEP 25 Pa.Code,
Chapter 105, and meet the regulations of PADEP 25 Pa.Code, Chapter 105,
concerning dam safety which may be required to pass storms larger than the 100-
year event.
         e.   A cutoff trench composed of 4 feet wide of impervious material
shall be provided within all basin embankments.
         f.   Where a basin embankment is constructed using fill on an existing
15% or greater slope, the basin must be keyed into the existing grade.
         g.   Fencing. Any above-ground stormwater management detention/
retention facility that is designed to store at least a 2 foot depth of runoff
shall be subject to the following fencing requirements:
            1)   The stormwater facility must be completely surrounded by a
chain-link fence of not less than 4 feet in height. Alternative fences and
barriers may be permitted upon request to and approval by the Borough.
            2)   All gates or doors opening through such enclosure shall be
equipped with a self-closing and self-latching device for keeping the gate or
door securely closed at all times, when not in actual use.
         h.   All outlet structures and emergency spillways shall include a
non- erosive means of energy dissipation at its outlet to assure conveyance and
flow without endangering the safety and integrity of the basin and the
downstream drainage area.
         i.   Plans for infiltration must show the locations of existing and
proposed septic tank infiltration areas and wells. A minimum 25-foot separation
from on-lot disposal systems (OLDS) infiltration areas, including replacement
areas, is desired and will be evaluated by the Borough on a case-by-case basis.
However, the separation shall not be less than the PADEP required 10 feet.
Infiltration rates shall be based upon perk and probe tests conducted at the
site of the proposed facility.
         j.   Above-ground infiltration facilities shall provide a means of
emergency dewatering of the facilities to the bottom elevation. If amended
soils are used in the facility bottom, an underdrain shall be placed below or
at the bottom of the amended soils to dewater the amended soils in emergency
situations. Dewatering to the top may be allowed on a case-by- case basis if
the circumstance does not allow for the amended soils to drain properly. Usage
of this method shall require approval of the Borough.
   S.   Design Standards; Rain Gardens/ Bioretention Facilities.
      1.   A rain garden/bioretention facility is an excavated shallow surface
depression or storage area created by an earthen embankment that is planted
with specific native vegetation to treat and capture runoff and amended soils.
Rain gardens shall meet the following design standards (note: any SWM facility
exceeding these design standards shall be considered a retention/detention
basin and subject to their design standards):
         a.   The maximum ponding depth shall be 12 inches.
         b.   Infiltration testing standards set forth in Appendix C shall be
followed when designing a rain garden facility.
         c.   The bottom of the rain garden storage area must be located at
least 2 feet above any limiting zone, i.e., seasonal high groundwater table,
bedrock, or poorly infiltrating soils.
         d.   Pretreatment shall be used in the design of the facility.
Pretreatment can include structures such as sumped and trapped inlets,
sediment/grit chambers or separators, media filters, inlet inserts, or other
appropriate prefabricated or proprietary designs to remove sediment,
floatables, and/or hydrocarbons from stormwater runoff prior to being conveyed
to a rain garden/bioretention basin. A facility may be exempt from pretreatment
at the discretion of the Borough engineer.
         e.   Maximum side slopes for surface storage areas shall be 4(H):1(V).
         f.   Any stone storage systems incorporated into the rain garden
design must be separated from the soil media by a geotextile liner. A
geotextile liner shall not be used to separate the stone storage system from
the subgrade. Stone storage systems shall have a level bottom or use a terraced
system if installed along slope.
         g.   In the event a sand layer is to be used as part of the
underground filtration/storage system. The sand must be placed between the soil
medium and stone storage. All sides of the sand must be separated by a
geotextile liner.
         h.   The planting soil medium must have a minimum depth of 18 inches.
Planting soil shall be a loam soil capable of supporting a healthy vegetative
cover. Soils shall be amended with a composted organic material. At minimum the
organic amended soil shall be combined with 20-30% organic material (compost),
and 70-80% soil base (topsoil). Amended soils shall be spread throughout the
bottom floor of the facility.
         i.   Underdrains must be provided for all rain gardens and extend
throughout the entire rain garden bottom. Underdrains must be surrounded by a
stone layer with a minimum of 4 inches above and below the pipe.
         j.   Rain gardens that are used for volume control credits shall have
an underdrain with a valve that is to remain closed at all times unless
dewatering the facility to perform maintenance.
         k.   A sufficient number of cleanouts must be provided to access
underdrains to allow for maintenance and inspection of the underdrain pipe.
         l.   Native plants capable of supporting the proposed ponding depth
shall be utilized. The designer shall refer to the PA DEP BMP manual for a list
of potential native plant species.
(Ord. 2012-01, 1/3/2012, §307; as amended by Ord. 2022-01, 4/5/2022, §306)
§ 9-307.   Regulations Governing Stormwater Management Facilities.
   A.   Any stormwater facility located on State highway rights-of-way shall be
subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT).
   B.   Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this Chapter that
would be located in or adjacent to waters of the Commonwealth or wetlands shall
be subject to approval by PADEP through the joint permit application process
or, where deemed appropriate by PADEP, the general permit process. When there
is a question of whether wetlands may be involved, it is the responsibility of
the developer or his agent to show that the land in question cannot be
classified as wetlands; otherwise, approval to work in the area must be
obtained from PADEP.
   C.   Any stormwater management facility located within the vicinity of a
floodplain shall be subject to approval in accordance with PADEP 25 Pa.Code,
Chapter 105, "Floodplain Management," of PADEP's rules and regulations.
   D.   The design of all stormwater management facilities shall incorporate
good engineering principles and practices. The Borough shall reserve the right
to disapprove any design that would result in the occupancy or continuation of
adverse hydrologic or hydraulic conditions within the watershed.
   E.   The existing points of concentrated drainage that discharge onto
adjacent property shall not be altered without permission of the adjacent
property owner(s) and shall be subject to any applicable discharge criteria
specified in this Chapter. New proposed discharge points shall be no closer
than 10 feet to the property line in which they are located.
   F.   Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge shall be subject to any
applicable discharge criteria in the general direction of existing discharge,
whether proposed to be concentrated or maintained as diffused drainage areas,
except as otherwise provided by this Chapter. If diffused flow is proposed to
be concentrated and discharged onto adjacent property, the developer must
document that adequate downstream conveyance facilities exist to safely
transport the concentrated discharge or otherwise prove that no erosion,
sedimentation, flooding, or other harm will result from the concentrated
discharge.
   G.   Where a development site is traversed by watercourses, 20 foot wide
minimum drainage easements (10 feet from top of bank out) shall be provided
conforming to the line of such watercourses. The terms of the easement shall
prohibit excavation, the placing of fill or structures, and any alterations
that may adversely affect the flow of stormwater within any portion of the
easement. Also, maintaining of vegetation in a natural state within the
easement shall be required, except as approved by the appropriate governing
authority.
   H.   When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural
drainage ways on the site cannot adequately provide for drainage, open channels
may be constructed conforming substantially to the line and grade of such
natural drainage ways. Work within natural drainage ways shall be subject to
approval by PADEP through the joint permit application process or, where deemed
appropriate by PADEP, through the general permit process.
   I.   Roof drains and sump pumps must not be connected to streets, sanitary
or storm sewers, or roadside ditches to promote overland flow and infiltration/
percolation of stormwater where advantageous to do so. When it is more
advantageous to connect directly to streets or storm sewers, then it shall be
permitted on a case by case basis by the Borough.
   J.   Special Requirements for Areas Falling Within Defined Exceptional Value
and High-Quality Subwatersheds. The temperature and quality of water and
streams that have been declared as exceptional value and high quality is to be
maintained as defined in 25 Pa.Code, Chapter 93, "Water Quality Standards,"
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection rules and regulations.
Temperature-sensitive BMP's and stormwater conveyance systems are to be used
and designed with storage pool areas and supply outflow channels and should be
shaded with trees. This will require modification of berms for permanent ponds
and the relaxation of restrictions on planting vegetation within the
facilities, provided that capacity for volumes and rate control is maintained.
At a minimum, the southern half on pond shorelines shall be planted with shade
or canopy trees within 10 feet of the pond shoreline. In conjunction with this
requirement, the maximum slope allowed on the berm area to be planted is 10 to
1. This will lessen the destabilization of berm soils due to root growth. A
long-term maintenance schedule and management plan for the thermal control BMPs
is to be established and recorded for all development sites within defined
exceptional value and/or high-quality subwatersheds.
(Ord. 2012-01, 1/3/2012, §308; as amended by Ord. 2022-01, 4/5/2022, §307)
§ 9-308.   Calculation Methodology.
   A.   Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using
the rational method, modified rational method, or a soil cover complex
methodology.
      1.   Any stormwater runoff calculations involving drainage areas greater
than 200 acres, including on- and off-site areas, shall use generally accepted
calculation technique that is based on the NRCS soil cover complex method. It
is assumed that all methods will be selected by the design professional based
on the individual limitations and suitability of each method for a particular
site.
      2.   The Borough may allow the use of the rational method or modified
rational method to estimate peak discharges from drainage areas that contain
less than 200 acres. When using the rational method, an ascending and
descending limb factor of 3 and 7 shall be used, respectively.
      3.   All calculations consistent with this Chapter using the soil cover
complex method shall use the appropriate design rainfall depths. If a
hydrologic computer model such as PSRM or HEC-RAS is used for stormwater runoff
calculations, then the duration of rainfall shall be 24-hours. The SCS Rainfall
Type II curve shall be used for the rainfall distribution. Those projects
proposing infiltration structures shall utilize this method.
      4.   When routing a detention basin, the rational method or SCS method
may be used to determine peak rates through the primary outlet structure. Only
the SCS Method may be used to determine the peak water surface elevation during
the 100-year, 24-hour design storm, dictating the height of the embankment.
      5.   Underground storage facilities that solely receive stormwater and
are designed to capture and infiltrate the entire 100-year, 24-hour SCS runoff
volume may have their drainage areas removed from the overall post-development
drainage area(s).
      6.   For the purposes of pre-development flow rate determination,
undeveloped land, including disturbed areas, shall be considered as "meadow" in
good condition, unless the natural ground cover generates a lower curve number
or rational "C" value (i.e., forest), as listed in Tables 1 and 2,
respectively.
      7.   All calculations using the rational method shall use rainfall
intensities consistent with appropriate times of concentration for overland
flow and return periods. Times of concentration for overland flow shall be
calculated using the methodology presented in Chapter 3 of Urban Hydrology for
Small Watersheds, NRCS, TR-55 (as amended or replaced from time to time by
NRCS). Time of concentration for channel and pipe flow shall be computed using
Manning's equation.
      8.   Runoff curve numbers (CN) for both existing and proposed conditions
to be used in the soil cover complex method shall be obtained from Table 1.
      9.   Runoff coefficients (c) for both existing and proposed conditions
for use in the rational method shall be obtained from Table 2.
      10.   Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning equation shall be
used for hydraulic computations such as the capacity of open channels, pipes,
and storm sewers. Values for Manning's roughness coefficient (n) shall be
consistent with Table 3.
      11.   The design of any stormwater detention facilities intended to meet
the performance standards of this Chapter shall be verified by routing the
design storm hydrograph through these facilities, using either manual methods
or computerized routing. Routing shall be based upon the modified PULS method;
other routing methodologies shall be subject to the approval of the Borough
Engineer.
      12.   The stormwater collection system shall be designed using the peak
discharge computed using the rational formula.
(Ord. 2012-01, 1/3/2012, §309; as amended by Ord. 2022-01, 4/5/2022, §308)
§ 9-309.   Carbonate Geology.
   In areas of carbonate geology, a geologist shall certify to the following:
   A.   No stormwater management facility will be placed in, over, or
immediately adjacent to the following features:
      1.   Closer than 100-feet from sinkholes.
      2.   Closer than 100-feet from closed depressions.
      3.   Closer than 100-feet from caverns, intermittent lakes, or ephemeral
streams.
      4.   Closer than 50-feet from lineaments in carbonate areas.
      5.   Closer than 50-feet from fracture traces.
      6.   Closer than 25-feet from bedrock pinnacles (surface or subsurface).
   B.   Stormwater resulting from regulated activities shall not be discharged
into sinkholes.
   C.   If the developer can prove through analysis that the project site is an
area underlain by carbonate geology, and such geologic conditions may result in
sinkhole formations, then the project site is exempt from recharge requirements
as described in §9-304, "Volume Control." However, the project site shall still
be required to meet all other standards found in this Chapter.
   D.   It shall be the developer's responsibility to verify if the project
site is underlain by carbonate geology. The following note shall be attached to
all stormwater management plans and signed and sealed by the developer's
geologist: "I, __________, certify that the proposed stormwater management
facility (circle one) is/is not underlain by carbonate geology."
   E.   Whenever a stormwater management facility will be located in an area
underlain by carbonate geology, a geological evaluation of the proposed
location by a geologist shall be conducted to determine susceptibility to
sinkhole formation. The evaluation may include the use of impermeable liners to
reduce or eliminate the separation distances listed in the BMP manual.
Additionally, the evaluation shall, at a minimum, address soil permeability,
depth to bedrock, seasonally high groundwater table, susceptibility for
sinkhole formation, suitability of stormwater management facilities, subgrade
stability, and maximum infiltration capacity in depth of water per unit area.
   F.   A detailed soils evaluation of the project site shall be performed to
determine the suitability of recharge facilities. The evaluation shall be
performed by a qualified professional, and at a minimum, address soil
permeability, depth to bedrock, susceptibility to sinkhole formation, and
subgrade stability. The general process for designing the infiltration BMP
shall be:
      1.   Site evaluation to determine general areas of suitability for
infiltration practices.
      2.   Provide field percolation tests throughout the area proposed for
development to determine appropriate percolation rate and/or hydraulic
conductivity. At least one infiltration test must be included in each soil
group and at least one infiltration test must be conducted for each five lots
proposed for development. Infiltration tests must be taken at the location and
depth of all proposed infiltration structures.
      3.   Design infiltration structure for required storm volume based on all
available data.
   G.   Extreme caution shall be exercised where infiltration is proposed in
geologically susceptible areas such as strip mine or limestone areas. It is
also extremely important that the design professional evaluate the possibility
of groundwater contamination from the proposed infiltration/recharge facility
and recommend a hydrogeologic study be performed if necessary. Whenever a basin
will be located in an area underlain by limestone, a geological evaluation of
the proposed location shall be conducted to determine susceptibility to
sinkhole formations. The design of all facilities over carbonate formations
shall include measures to prevent groundwater contamination and, where
necessary, sinkhole formation. The infiltration requirement in the high
quality/exceptional waters shall be subject to the Department's 25 Pa.Code,
Chapter 93, and anti-degradation regulations. A detailed hydrogeologic
investigation may be required by the Borough, and where appropriate, the
Borough may require the installation of an impermeable liner in detention
basins.

§ 9-310.   Erosion and Sedimentation Control Requirements.
   A.   As required in §9-301.4, whenever the vegetation and topography are to
be disturbed, such activity must be in conformance with PADEP 25 Pa.Code,
Chapter 105, rules and regulations, Part I, Subpart C, "Protection of Natural
Resources," Article II, "Water Resources," Chapter 102, "Erosion Control," and
in accordance with the County Conservation District.
   B.   It is extremely important that strict erosion and sedimentation control
measures be applied surrounding infiltration structures during installation to
prevent the infiltrative surfaces from becoming clogged. Additional erosion and
sedimentation control design standards and criteria must be applied where
infiltration BMPs are proposed shall include the following:
      1.   Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from
sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase so as to maintain
their maximum infiltration capacity.
   C.   Fencing for sedimentation basins or traps must comply with §9-308.
   D.   The developer shall demonstrate that the post-development hydrograph
flows during erosion and sedimentation control phase are less than or equal to
the pre- development hydrograph flows to assure the rate and volume of runoff
leaving the site is controlled for the 2-, 5-, and 10-year frequency storms All
calculation methodology shall be in accordance with §§9-303 through 9-309.
   E.   In the event a regulated activity falls under the Chapter 102
thresholds for requiring a written erosion and sedimentation plan and/or NPDES
permit, the applicant is still required to provide suitable erosion and
sedimentation best management practices to prevent an illicit discharge caused
by erosion during a precipitation event.

the provisions of this Chapter.
   B.   From the time an application for approval of a plat involving a
subdivision or land development plan, whether preliminary or final, which
includes a SWM site plan, is duly filed with the Borough, no change or
amendment of the ordinance or other governing ordinance or plan shall affect
the decision on such application in accordance with the provisions of the
governing ordinances or plans as they stood at the time the application was
duly filed, as specified in §508(4)(i) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code, 53 P.S. §10508(4)(i).
   C.   The Borough shall notify the applicant in writing within 45 days
whether the SWM site plan is approved or disapproved. If the SWM site plan
involves a Subdivision and Land Development Plan, the notification shall occur
within the time period allowed by the Municipalities Planning Code (90 days).
If a longer notification period is provided by another statute, regulation, or
ordinance, the applicant will be notified by the Borough. If the Borough denies
approval of the SWM site plan, the Borough will state the reasons for the
denial in writing. The Borough may also approve the SWM site plan with
conditions and, if so, shall provide the acceptable conditions for approval in
writing.
   D.   For any SWM site plan that proposes to use any BMPs other than Green
Infrastructure and LID practices to achieve the volume and rate controls
required under this Chapter, the Borough will not approve the SWM site plan
unless it determines that Green Infrastructure and LID practices are not
practicable.
(Ord. 2012-01, 1/3/2012, §403; as amended by Ord. 2022-01, 4/5/2022, §403)
§ 9-404.   Modification of Plans.
   Modifications to a submitted SWM site plan that involve a change in SWM BMPs
or techniques, or that involves the relocation or redesign of SWM BMPs, or that
is necessary because soil or other conditions are not as stated on the SWM site
plan, as determined by the Borough, shall require a resubmission of the
modified SWM site plan in accordance with this Article.
   A.   When reviewing a SWM site plan, whether or not the SWM site plan is
included in a subdivision and/or land development plan application, the Borough
may, after consulting with DEP, grant a modification of the requirements of one
or more provisions of this Chapter if the literal enforcement will enact undue
hardship because of peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question,
provided that such modification will not be contrary to the public interest and
that the purpose and intent of the Chapter is observed.
   B.   All requests for a modification from an applicant shall be in writing
and shall accompany and be a part of the application for approval of a SWM site
plan and/or a subdivision or land development plan as applicable. The request
shall state in full the grounds and facts of unreasonableness or hardship on
which the request is based, the provision or provisions of the Chapter involved
and the minimum modification necessary.
   C.   In granting any modification, the Borough may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of
the Act 167 Plan and this Chapter.
   D.   The Borough shall keep a written record of all action on requests for
modifications. The response of any consultation and/or review by DEP shall be
included as an original report if available or otherwise documented in the
required written record.

   A.   SWM Site Plans Independent of Subdivision and Land Development Plans.
The Borough's approval of a SWM site plan, when such plan is submitted
independent of a subdivision and/or land development plan, authorizes the
regulated activities contained in the SWM site plan for a maximum term of
validity of 5 years following the date of approval. The Borough may specify a
term of validity shorter than 5 years in the approval for any specific SWM site
plan, particularly if the nature of the proposed SWM facilities require more
frequent maintenance and/or short-term replacement of certain components. Terms
of validity shall commence on the date the Borough signs the approval for a SWM
site plan. If an approved SWM site plan is not completed according to §9-407
within the term of validity, then the Borough may consider the SWM site plan
disapproved and may revoke any and all permits. SWM site plans that are
considered disapproved by the Borough may be resubmitted in accordance with §9-
405 of this Chapter.
   B.   SWM Site Plans Included in a Subdivision and/or Land Development Plan.
The Borough's approval of a SWM site plan, which is a part of a subdivision
and/or land development plan, authorizes that plan and the regulated activities
therein so that no subsequent change or amendment in this Chapter or other
governing ordinances or plans shall be applied to affect adversely the right of
the applicant to commence and to complete any aspect of the approved
development in accordance with the terms of such approval within 5 years from

released by the Borough, as appropriate, and may not be used or pledged by the
applicant as security in any other manner during that period.
      2.   In the case of a failure on the part of the applicant to complete
said improvements, then the institution shall immediately make the funds in
said account available to the Borough for use in the completion of those
improvements.
      3.   As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request the Borough to authorize the
release of such portions of the financial security associated with the
completed improvements. Requests for the partial release of financial security
as the work of installing the required improvements proceeds shall be made and
governed by the MPC.
      4.   At such time that the applicant has completed and installed the
required improvements, the elected officials shall consider the applicant's
request for a release from the improvement guarantee in accordance with the
procedure set forth in the MPC.
      5.   At the completion of the project, and as a prerequisite for the
release of the financial security, the applicant shall provide record plans in
accordance with §9-407.
      6.   Upon receipt of the Record Plans and prior to the release of the
remaining financial security per §9-502.4, the Borough shall conduct a final
inspection to certify compliance with this Chapter.
   In the event that any improvements which are required by this Chapter have
not been installed as provided in this Chapter or in accordance with the
approved stormwater management plan, the Borough may enforce any corporate bond
or other security by appropriate legal and equitable remedies. If proceeds of
such bond or other security are insufficient to pay the cost of installing or
making repairs or corrections to all the improvements covered by said security,
the elected officials may, at their option, install part of such improvements
in all or part of the stormwater management plan and may institute appropriate
legal or equitable action to recover the monies necessary to complete the
remainder of the improvements.

Operation and Maintenance
§ 9-601.   Responsibilities of Developers and Landowners.
   Unless otherwise noted or if a facility is located within a Borough right-
of-way, operation and maintenance of stormwater management facilities and
conveyance systems is the sole responsibility of the property owner or assigns,
in perpetuity.
   A.   The Borough shall make the final determination on the continuing
maintenance responsibilities prior to final approval of the SWM site plan. The
Borough may require a dedication of such facilities as part of the requirements
for approval of the SWM site plan. Such a requirement is not an indication that
the Borough will accept the facilities. The municipality reserves the right to
accept or reject the ownership and operating responsibility for any portion of
the stormwater management controls.
   B.   Facilities, areas, or structures used as SWM BMPs shall be enumerated
as permanent real estate appurtenances and recorded as deed restrictions or

§ 9-805.   Suspension of MS4 Access.
   A.   Suspension Due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations. The
Borough may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person
when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of
this Commonwealth. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, the Borough may take such steps as deemed necessary to
prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of this Commonwealth, or to
minimize danger to persons including, without limitation, entering onto
property for the purpose of disconnecting and/or performing emergency
maintenance or repairs to storm sewers. In the event the Borough must
disconnect or perform emergency maintenance and/or repairs, the Borough may
file and attach a Borough lien on the property which is causing the illicit
discharge.
   B.   Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge or Illicit
Connection. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this Section may
have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an
illicit discharge or illicit connection. The Borough will notify a violator of
the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the
Borough for a reconsideration and hearing.
   C.   A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this Section, without the prior approval of the
Borough.
(Ord. 2012-01, 1/3/2012, §804; as amended by Ord. 2022-01, 4/5/2022, §805)
§ 9-806.   Industrial or Construction Activity Discharges.
   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit.
Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to
the Borough prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
(Ord. 2012-01, 1/3/2012, §805; as amended by Ord. 2022-01, 4/5/2022, §806)
§ 9-807.   Monitoring of Discharges.
   A.   Applicability. This Section applies to all facilities that have
stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including
construction activity.
   B.   Access to Facilities.
      1.   The Borough shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities
subject to regulation under this Section as often as may be necessary to
determine compliance with this Section. If a discharger has security measures
in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into
its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow
access to representatives of the Borough.
      2.   Facility operators shall allow the Borough ready access to all parts
of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and
copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to
discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined
by State and Federal law.
      3.   The Borough shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility
such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized enforcement
agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater
discharge.
      4.   The Borough has the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure
stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
      5.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the Borough and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
      6.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Borough access to a permitted
facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this Section. A
person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge
stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person
denies the Borough reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose
of conducting any activity authorized or required by this Section.
      7.   If the Borough has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and it is able to demonstrate probable
cause to believe that there may be a violation of this Section, or that there
is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program designed to verify compliance with this Section or any order issued
hereunder or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the
community, then the Borough may seek issuance of a search warrant from any
court of competent jurisdiction.

§ 9-808.   Requirements to Prevent, Control and Reduce Stormwater Pollutants by
the Use of BMPs.
   The Borough will adopt requirements identifying best management practices
for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to
pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of
this Commonwealth. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial
establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal
storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-
structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premises,
which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to
implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural
BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate
storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES
permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial
activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the
provisions of this Section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution
prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the
NPDES permit.
(Ord. 2012-01, 1/3/2012, §807; as amended by Ord. 2022-01, 4/5/2022, §808)
§ 9-809.   Watercourse Protection.
   A.   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or
such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse
within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other
obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of
water through the watercourse.
   B.   In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately
owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse so that such structures
will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the
watercourse.
(Ord. 2012-01, 1/3/2012, §808; as amended by Ord. 2022-01, 4/5/2022, §809)

   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illicit discharges or pollutants
discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, or water of this
Commonwealth said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the
discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a
release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency
response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the
event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the
Borough in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day.
Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the Borough within 3 business days of the phone notice.
If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or
industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall
also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to
prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least 3 years.

pretreatment processes that may result in interference or pass through at the
wastewater treatment facility. The Township reserves the right to deny the
admission of, or to require the pretreatment of, all discharges to the public
sanitary sewer system.
   9.   Indemnification. While performing necessary work on private properties,
the wastewater treatment plant operators or duly authorized employees of the
Township shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises established
by the user. The user shall be held harmless for injury or death to a Township
employee and the Township shall indemnify the user against loss or damage to
its property by Township employees and against liabilities, claims and demands
for personal injury or property damage asserted against the user and growing
out of the gauging and sampling operations, except such as may be caused by
negligence or failure of the user to maintain safe conditions.

shall install a suitable sampling manhole, a sanitary connection fitting into
the service lateral for sampling, or manholes, flow metering chambers, flow
monitoring equipment, pH monitoring equipment and other appurtenances on his
connecting sewer or sewers to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement
of the combined flow of wastes from his premises. Such manhole or manholes or
metering chamber shall be accessible, safely located and secure and shall be
constructed in accordance with plans approved by the pretreatment
administrator.
      B.   The sampling manhole, sanitary connection fitting, or manholes, or
metering chamber shall be installed by such person at his expense and shall be
maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible to the pretreatment
administra tor or his designated representative at all times. The construction
and maintenance of such manholes or metering chamber shall be mandatory for
significant industrial users and, if deemed necessary by the pretreatment
administrator, flows from such manhole or metering chamber shall be
continuously monitored, transmitted and recorded by means of an approved
recording device.

Prohibitions,” shall be by a daily composite sample, except for those
parameters listed under subsection .3 that may be determined by either a daily
composite sample or on a grab sample (subject to the concentrations stated for
each type of sample).
[Ord. 2011-02]
   6.   Analytical Methods. All analyses of samples shall be performed in
accordance with procedures contained in 40 CFR, Part 136, and amendments
thereto or any methods approved by the EPA.
(Ord. 93-002, 8/3/1993, §18-406; as amended by Ord. 98-03, 12/8/1998, §§2, 3;
and by Ord. 2011-02, 3/1/2011, §3)
§ 18-407.   Violation Notice, Remedies and Penalties.
   1.   Enforcement Response. Enforcement action taken by the Township shall be
consistent with an enforcement response plan maintained at the wastewater
treatment facility.
   2.   Notice of Violation.
      A.   Whenever the Pretreatment Administrator finds that any industrial
user has violated any provisions of this Part or an industrial user permit, a
commer cial/industrial discharge permit, an order or compliance schedule, the
Pretreatment Administrator or his duly authorized representative shall serve
upon said industrial user a written notice of violation.
      B.   If required by the Township, a written response to this notice,
including an explanation of the cause of the violation and a plan for the
correction and prevention thereof, must be submitted to the Pretreatment
Administrator within 10 working days of receipt of the notice. Submission of
this plan in no way relieves the industrial user of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
   3.   Compliance Schedule. When required by the Pretreatment Administrator,
compliance schedules must be developed by existing or new industrial users and
approved by the Pretreatment Administrator. These schedules shall contain
increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion
of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional
pretreatment equipment required to meet present or proposed applicable
pretreatment standards. No increment of progress shall exceed 9 months. The
Pretreatment Administrator shall have the right to deny or to require the
modification of proposed compliance schedules. Industrial users under
compliance schedules shall submit progress reports to the Pretreatment
Administrator no later than 14 days following each milestone date in the
schedule and 14 days following the final date of compliance. Failure to meet
required milestone dates shall constitute a violation of this Part.
   4.   Administrative Fine. Notwithstanding any other Section of this Part,
any user, or waste hauler or waste generator who is found to have violated any
provision of this Part or an industrial user permit, or a commercial/industrial
discharge permit, or a waste hauler license or a waste permit, or any order
issued hereunder, or is found to be significant noncompliance (SNC) may be
fined in an amount no less than $1,000 per violation. Each day on which
noncompliance shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct
violation. All fine money shall be made payable to the Springetts bury Township
WWTF. The Borough and/or Township shall have such other collection remedies as
it has to collect other service charges. Unpaid charges, fines and penalties
shall constitute a lien against the individual user's property.
      A.   Any user, or waste hauler or waste generator that desires to dispute
such fines must file a request before the Township to reconsider the fine
within 10 working days of being notified of the fine. The Springettsbury
Township Treatment Facility shall include as part of the notice of an
administrative fine, a description of the applicable appeals process to be
followed, including the name, address and telephone number of the person
responsible for accepting such appeal. Where the Township believes the request
has merit, it shall convene a hearing on the matter within 15 working days of
receiving the request from the user.
      B.   Anyone assessed an administrative fine shall have 30 days to pay the
proposed fine in full or, if the user wishes to contest either the amount of
the fine or the fact of the violation, the user must file an appeal of the
action. All appeals are to be made pursuant to the instructions included in the
notice of administrative fine assessment. Failure to appeal within this period
shall result in a waiver of all legal rights to contest the violation or the
amount of the fine.
[Ord. 2011-02]
   5.   Administrative Order (AO). When the Township finds that a user has
violated or continues to violate any provisions of this Part, permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Township may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing
that the user come into compliance within a time period set by the Township. If
the user does not come into compliance within the specified time periods, sewer
service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or
other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Administrative
orders may also contain other requirements to address the noncompliance,
including additional self-monitoring, and management practices designed to
minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. An administra tive
order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a Federal
pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does an administrative order release
the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation.
Issuance of an administrative order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any
other action against the user.
   6.   Injunctive Relief. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate
the provisions of this Part, and industrial user permit or a commercial/
industrial discharge permit or an order issued hereunder, the pretreatment
administrator, through counsel, may petition the court for the issuance of a
preliminary or permanent injunction (or both, as may be appropriate), which
restrains or compels the activities on the part of the user. The pretreatment
administrator shall have such remedies to collect all fees incurred by the
Township as a result of this petition as it has to collect other sewer service
charges, including a request for payment of costs and attorney's fees as may be
authorized by law. [Ord. 2011-02]
   7.   Industrial User Permit or Commercial/Industrial Discharge Permit
Revocation.
      A.   Any industrial user who violates any of the following conditions of
this Part, or its industrial user permit, or of its commercial/industrial
discharge permit or of any order, may be subject to the revocation of its
permit:
         (1)   Failure of a user to factually report the wastewater
constituents and characteristics of his discharge.
         (2)   Failure of user to report significant changes in wastewater
constitu ents or characteristics.
         (3)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the
purposes of inspection or monitoring.
         (4)   Violations of the conditions of the permit.
      B.   The Township shall not revoke an industrial user permit or commer
cial/industrial permit without first allowing the noncompliant industrial user
the opportunity to show cause under this section why the proposed action should
not be taken. Before any further discharge of industrial wastewater may be made
by a user whose permit has been revoked, the user must apply for, and be
granted a reinstatement of the revoked permit, or a new permit, as the Township
may require, and pay all delinquent fees, charges and costs occasioned by the
violation, in accordance with all conditions set forth in this Part and the
procedural guidelines recorded and available at the wastewater treatment
facility.
   8.   Show Cause Hearing. The Pretreatment Administrator may order any
industrial user which causes or contributes to a violation of this Part or
industrial user permit or commercial/industrial discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. Notice shall be served on the industrial user specifying the time and
place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action and the reasons for such
action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served
personally or by registered or certified mail to any principal executive,
general partner, corporate officer or owner of the industrial user at least 10
days prior to the hearing. Whether or not a duly notified industrial user
appears as noticed, immediate enforcement action may be pursued.
   9.   Emergency Response.
      A.   The Pretreatment Administrator may suspend the wastewater treatment
service and/or industrial use permit or commercial/industrial discharge permit
whenever such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened
discharge presenting or causing an imminent or substantial endangerment to the
health or welfare of persons, wastewater treatment facility or the environment.
      B.   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or industrial user permit or commercial industrial discharge permit
shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of an
industrial user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension
order, the Pretreatment Administrator shall take such steps as deemed
necessary, including the immediate severance of the sewer connection, to
prevent or minimize damage to the wastewater treatment facility, its receiving
stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Pretreatment Administrator
shall allow the industrial user to recommence its discharge when the
endangerment has passed, unless the permit revocation proceedings set forth in
this Section are initiated against the user.
      C.   Any user which is responsible, in whole or in part, for imminent
endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of
the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence to the Pretreatment Administrator prior to the date of the show
cause hearing described in this Section. [Ord. 98-03]
   10.   Criminal Penalties. With or without notice, any person who shall
violate the provisions of this Part, an industrial user permit, a commercial/
industrial discharge permit, or order shall, upon conviction thereof by a
magisterial district judge, be subject to punishment as provided in this
Section. If such person violating the provisions of this Part shall be a
partnership, then the members thereof, or if such person be a corporation or
association then the officers, members, agents, servants or employees thereof
shall, in default of payment of any fine levied under this Section be
imprisoned in the county prison. Each day of continued violation of any
provisions of this Part shall constitute a separate offense. All fine money
assessed through suit or summary proceedings before any magisterial district
judge, pursuant to this Section, shall be transferred to the Township Sewer
Fund. [Ord. 2011-01]
   11.   Public Notification. The Township shall, at least annually, publish in
the largest daily newspaper distributed in the Township, a list of industrial
users which in the last 12 months were significantly violating applicable
pretreatment standards or other pretreatment requirements or that were
determined to be in significant noncompliance. Significant noncompliance shall
be determined according to guidelines set in 40 CFR §403.8(f)(2)(vii) or
amendments thereto.
   12.   Civil Penalties and Costs.
      A.   Any person who shall violate the provisions of this Part, any permit
issued pursuant to this Part or any regulation adopted under this Part, may,
after notice and hearing as hereinafter provided, be assessed a civil penalty
for such violation and, in addition to such penalty, be assessed the cost of
any damages caused by the violation or the cost of correcting such violation.
      B.   Before assessing a civil penalty or costs, the Township shall
provide the violator with a written notice of proposed assessment citing the
ordinance provision, permit or regulation violated with an offer to conduct an
assessment hearing to evaluate the violation and the amount of the penalty or
costs. Said notice shall contain an explanation of the right to a hearing and
the right to appeal from the assessment made. [Ord 2011-02]
      C.   Yoe Borough shall assign a representative to hold the assessment
hearing who will normally be Springettsbury Township's Director of Wastewater
Treatment. In no event shall the Pretreatment Administrator act as the hearing
officer.
      D.   The assessment hearing shall be informal and shall not be governed
by requirements for formal adjudicatory hearings. The hearing shall be held at
the administrative offices of the wastewater treatment facility at the
convenience of the parties; provided, however, that should the violator fail or
refuse to agree as to a time for the hearing, the hearing officer shall fix a
time and direct the violator's attendance. Should the violator fail or refuse
to attend, the hearing officer may proceed with the hearing and, if
appropriate, assess a civil penalty and/or costs.
      E.   A civil penalty may be assessed whether or not the violation was
willful. The amount of the penalty shall not be less than $1,000 per day per
violation; provided, however, that any industrial user who shall violate the
Township's pretreatment standards and/or the requirements of the Township's
approved pretreatment program may be assessed a penalty not to exceed $25,000
per day per violation as provided in the Publicly Owned Treatment Works Penalty
Law. In determining the amount of the penalty, the hearing officer shall
consider the following: [Ord. 2011-02]
         (1)   The willfulness of the violation.
         (2)   Damages to air, water, land or other natural resources or their
user.
         (3)   Cost of restoration and abatement.
   (4)    Savings resulting to the person in consequence of the violation.
         (5)   Deterrence of future violations.
         (6)   History of past violations.
         (7)   Other relevant factors.
      F.   If a person against whom a civil penalty of costs has been assessed
fails to pay the amount assessed in full or appeal the assessment de novo, as
provided in subsection .G hereof, within 30 days following the date of
assessment, such failure to pay or perfect an appeal shall constitute a
separate violation for which an additional civil penalty may be assessed, after
notice and hearing. Additional violations shall be deemed to occur and
additional civil penalties may be assessed each time a person fails to pay or
perfect an appeal.
      G.   A person assessed with a civil penalty or costs pursuant to this
Section shall have 30 days to pay the penalty and costs in full. If the person
assessed wishes to contest the violation or the penalty or costs assessed, such
person shall have the right to appeal de novo to the Springettsbury Township
Board of Supervisors for a hearing under the Local Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S.A. §751
et seq. The notice of appeal and request for hearing shall be filed within 30
days of the date of receipt of notice of the action appealed. The notice of the
appeal must be accompa nied by the amount of the civil penalty and/or costs to
be held in an escrow amount by Springettsbury Township. In lieu of such
payment, the appellant may post an irrevocable letter of credit for the
required amount issued by a Federal or Commonwealth chartered lending
institution or an appeal bond in such amount executed by a surety licensed to
do business in this Commonwealth and in a form satisfactory to Yoe Borough. If,
after the Local Agency Law review or final judicial review the civil penalty
and/or costs are removed or reduced the amount paid into escrow shall be
adjusted accordingly and the balance remitted to the appellant within 30 days,
or in the case of a letter of credit or surety bond having been posted, upon
payment of the amount due, such letter of credit or bond shall be released.
Failure to make the required deposit in escrow or submit an irrevocable letter
of credit or a surety as provided in this subsection shall result in a waiver
of all legal rights to appeal the violation or the amount of the penalty and/or
costs assessed. [Ord. 99-002]
      H.   In any case where Springettsbury Township determines that the
violation is of a continuing nature, Springettsbury Township may impose a
weekly assessment of not more than $2,500 per week for each week the violation
continues unabated by the violator. Such weekly assessment shall accrue
indefinitely after the date of notice of the assessment to the violator. [Ord.
99-002]
      I.   All civil penalties and costs assessed pursuant to this subsection
shall be payable to the Yoe Borough Sewer Fund and shall be collectible in any
manner provided by law for the collection of debts. Unpaid civil penalties and/
or costs, together with interest and any costs that may accrue, shall
constitute a judgment in favor of Yoe Borough and be a lien upon the real
property of the violator from the date such amount has been entered and
docketed on the record by the Prothonotary of York County.
[Ord. 98-03]
   13.   Fines and Civil Penalties Collected. All fines and civil penalties
collected pursuant to subsection .12.A or of this subsection shall be placed in
a restricted account and shall only be used for the repair of damage or
mitigation of threats to the public health, to pay any penalties imposed on
Springettsbury Township or Yoe Borough by the Federal or State governments for
violation of pretreatment standards, for costs inured to investigate and take
enforcement actions and for the administration of this Part and the Sewage
Facilities Act. [Ord. 98-03]

§ 24-102.   Intent and Applicable Rules.

amended. The following words and phrases, when used in this Part shall have the
meanings ascribed to them as follows:

tions as required to be reported to or as determined by the Department of
Revenue under §303 of the Act of March 4, 1971 (P.L. 6, No. 2), known as the

excluding a county of the first class, or private agency which administers and
collects earned income and net profits for one or more TCD. Unless otherwise
specifically provided, for purposes of the obligations of an employer, the term

employer is located, or if an employer maintains workplaces in more than one
TCD, the tax officer for each such TCD with respect to employees principally
employed therein.
   Taxpayer–a person or business required hereunder to file a return of earned

taxpayer fiscal year basis without the need for annual enactment or re-
enactment, unless the rate of the tax is subsequently changed. For a taxpayer
whose fiscal year is not a calendar year, the tax officer shall establish
deadlines for filing, reporting and payment of taxes which provide time periods
equivalent to those provided for a calendar year taxpayer.
(Ord. 2011-03, 11/1/2011, §4)
§ 24-105.   Declaration and Payment of Tax.
   1.   Application.
      A.   Income taxes shall be applicable to taxable income earned or

year; except that taxes imposed for the first time and changes to existing tax
rates shall become effective on January 1 or July 1, as specified in this Part,
and the tax shall continue in force on a calendar year or taxpayer fiscal year
basis, without annual reenact ment, unless the rate of the tax is subsequently
changed.
      B.   For a taxpayer whose fiscal year is not a calendar year, the tax

which provide time periods equivalent to those provided for a calendar year
taxpayer.
   2.   Partial Domicile. The taxable income subject to tax of a taxpayer who
is domiciled in a political subdivision for only a portion of the tax year
shall be an amount equal to the taxpayer’s taxable income multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar months during the
tax year that the individual is domiciled in the political subdivision, and the
denominator of which is 12. A taxpayer shall include in the numerator any
calendar month during which the taxpayer is domiciled for more than half the
calendar month. A day that a taxpayer’s domicile changes shall be included as a

B.   (1)   Every taxpayer making net profits shall, by April 15 of the current

installments shall be paid on or before June 15 of the current year, September
15 of the current year and January 15 of the succeeding year, respectively.
         (2)   Any taxpayer who first anticipates any net profit after April 15
of the current year, shall make and file the declaration required on or before
June 15 of the current year, September 15 of the current year or December 31 of
the current year, whichever date next follows the date on which the taxpayer

a taxpayer who has filed the declaration required under this subsection
anticipates additional net profits not previously declared or has overestimated
anticipated net profits.
         (5)   Every taxpayer who discontinues business prior to December 31 of
the current year, shall, within 30 days after the discontinuance of business,
file a final return as required under this Part and pay the tax due.
      C.   Every taxpayer who receives any other taxable income not subject to
withholding under §512(3) of the Act shall make and file with the resident tax
officer a quarterly return on or before April 15 of the current year, June 15

§ 24-113.   Purpose/Amendment and Restatement/Repeal.
   The primary purpose of this Part is to conform the local income tax
currently levied on earned income and net profits by the municipality with the
Act and to do so within the time frame set forth in the Act. Any prior
ordinance levying such tax is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to
read as set forth in this Part. To the extent that any previous ordinance or
portion thereof is inconsistent or conflicts with this Part, such ordinance(s)
or portion thereof shall be repealed to the extent of such inconsistency and/or
conflict. To the extent the same or any prior ordinance levying such tax in
force immediately prior to enactment of this Part, this Part is intended as a
continuation of such prior ordinance and not as the enactment of an ordinance
imposing a new tax. In the event this Part or any portion thereof is determined
to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, the prior ordinance, or portion
thereof, levying a similar tax shall remain in full force and effect and shall
not be affected by the adoption of this Part. Nothing contained herein shall
affect, impair or otherwise abrogate any act done or liability incurred, nor
shall any provision of this Part affect, impair or preclude any suit or
prosecution pending, whether or not currently initiated, to enforce any right,
penalty or violation under the authority of any previous ordinance in force
prior to adoption of this Part.

by State law, may appeal decisions under this Chapter within the provisions of
the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §10101 et seq. Any such

Municipalities Planning Code (as of the adoption date of this Chapter, such
provisions were in §§914.1 and 1002.A, 53 P.S. §§10914.1, 11002.A).
      C.   UCC Appeal. An appeal of a construction code requirement is under a

converted to a dwelling when the development is complete. Alternatively, a
modular sales office may be allowed by the Borough provided it is removed
completely when the development is complete.
         (5)   Portable Storage Containers. See §
27-807.

Land Development Ordinance (“SALDO”), then any permit or approval under this
Chapter shall automatically be conditioned upon compliance with the SALDO. See
the definitions of “land development” and “subdivision” in the SALDO.
      A.   For example, if an applicant applies for a single-family detached
dwelling on a proposed new lot, the construction permit for such dwelling shall
not be valid until after the lot is granted final subdivision approval and the

reasons.

undertake the action specified by the permit, in compliance with other Borough
ordinances. However, it is recommended that applicants wait 30 days to begin
construction if there is a possibility of an appeal by another party to have
the permit revoked. Any commencement of construction or a use within this 30-
day appeal period shall be at the risk of the applicant.
(Ord. 2014-02, 10/7/2014, §104)

any other applicable Borough ordinance.
   2.   Uses Not Specifically Regulated.
      A.   If a use clearly is not permitted by right, as a conditional use, or
as a special exception use by this Chapter within any zoning district, the use
is prohibited, except that the Borough Council may permit such use as a
conditional use if the applicant specifically proves to the clear satisfaction
of the Borough Council that all of the following conditions would be met:
         (1)   The proposed use would be no more intensive with respect to
external impacts and nuisances than uses that are permitted in the district.
         (2)   The proposed use would be closely similar in impacts and
character to uses that are permitted in that district, considering the
standards in §
27-805.6.
         (3)   The use would meet the standards that would apply under §
27-117 to a special exception use.

approval.

and believes that the ordinance should be interpreted in the applicant’s favor,
the applicant may appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board. See §
27-112.
      C.   See §
27-304.
   4.   Undefined Terms/Interpretation of Definitions. See §

and 617.2 of such Act, 53 P.S. §§10616.1, 10617, 10617.2.)
      A.   Violations. Any person who shall commit or who shall permit any of
the following actions violates this Chapter:

information from an application for a zoning permit.
         (3)   Undertaking any action in a manner which does not comply with a

competent jurisdiction, where such court has granted zoning approval with

      B.   Enforcement Notice. If the Borough has reason to believe that a
violation of a provision of this Chapter has occurred, the Borough shall
initiate enforcement proceedings by sending an enforcement notice as provided
in §616.1 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §10616.1.
Prior to sending an official enforcement notice, the Zoning Officer may at his/
her option informally request compliance.
      C.   Time Limits. An official enforcement notice shall state the deadline
to complete bringing the property into compliance with this Chapter, and shall
state that the applicant has 30 days from the receipt of the notice to appeal
to the Zoning Hearing Board. The denial of a conditional use, special exception
use or variance may also be appealed to the County Court.
      D.   Causes of Action; Enforcement Remedies. The causes of action and

permitted the violation of the provisions of this Chapter shall, upon being
found liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the
Borough, pay a judgment of not more than $500 plus all court costs, including

judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or be payable until the date of
the determina tion of a violation by the district magistrate. If the defendant
neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the Borough may enforce the
judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that a
violation continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless a district
magistrate determining that there has been a violation further determines that
there was a good faith basis for the person violating this Chapter to have
believed that there was no such violation, in which event there shall be deemed
to have been only one such violation until the fifth day following the date of
the determination of a violation by the district justice, and thereafter each
day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. All
judgments, costs and reasonable attorney’s fees collected for the violation of
this Chapter shall be paid over to the Borough for the general use of the
Borough. Imprisonment is not authorized under this Chapter.

any of the regulations made pursuant thereto or any of the permits or
certificates of use and occupancy issued under this Chapter or any conditions
imposed upon the grant of a special exception or variance by the Zoning Hearing
Board or upon the grant of a conditional use, then, in addition to any other
remedies provided by law, any appropriate action or proceeding may be
instituted or taken to prevent or restrain such unlawful erection,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance or
use or to prevent any illegal act, conduct, business or use in and about such
premises.
      E.   Enforcement Evidence. In any appeal of an enforcement notice to the
Zoning Hearing Board, the Borough shall have the responsibility of presenting
its evidence first.

      A.   Appeal of a Decision by the Zoning Officer.
         (1)   The Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by
an affected person, entity or the Borough Council that the Zoning Officer has
improperly acted under the requirements and procedures of this Chapter.
         (2)   See time limitations for appeals in subsection .6.
      B.   Challenge to the Validity of the Ordinance or Map. The applicable
provisions of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §10101 et
seq., as amended, shall apply. (Note: As of the adoption date of this Chapter,
these provisions were primarily in §§909.1 and 916 of such Act, 53 P.S.
§§10909.1, 10916).
      C.   Variance.
         (1)   The Board shall hear requests for variances filed with the
Borough staff in writing. The Borough Planning Commission should be provided
with an opportunity to review a zoning variance application. However, action by
the Zoning Hearing Board shall not be delayed by a Planning Commission review.
         (2)   Standards. The Board may grant a variance only within the
limitations of State law. As of the adoption date of this Chapter, the Pennsyl
vania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §10101 et seq., provided that all
of the following findings must be made, where relevant:
            (a)   There are unique physical circumstances or conditions
(including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or
exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property) and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such
conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of this Chapter in the neighborhood or district in which the
property is located.
            (b)   Because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there
is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with
the provisions of this Chapter and a variance is therefore necessary to enable
the reasonable use of the property.
            (c)   Such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
            (d)   The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
            (e)   The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulation in issue.
         (3)   In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of
this Chapter.
      D.   Special Exception.
         (1)   The Board shall hear and decide requests for all special
exceptions filed with the Borough staff in writing. The Board shall only permit
a special exception that is authorized by this Chapter. See §
27-117.
         (2)   The Borough Planning Commission should be provided with an
opportunity to review a special exception application. However, action by the
Zoning Hearing Board shall not be delayed by a Planning Commission review.
         (3)   Conditions. In granting a special exception, the Zoning Hearing
Board may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to
those expressed in this Chapter, as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes and intent of this Chapter.
      E.   Persons with Disabilities. After the Zoning Officer receives a
complete written application, the Zoning Hearing Board shall grant a special
exception allowing modifications to specific requirements of this Chapter that
the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing Board are
required under applicable Federal law to provide a “reasonable accommodation”
to serve persons who the applicant proves have “disabilities” as defined in and
protected by such laws.
         (1)   Such reasonable accommodations shall be requested in accordance
with the U.S. Fair Housing Act Amendments and/or the Americans with
Disabilities Act, as amended.
         (2)   If the applicant is requesting a reasonable accommodation under
the United States Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 or the Americans with
Disabilities Act, the applicant shall identify the disability which is
protected by such statutes, the extent of the modification of the provisions of
this Chapter necessary for a reasonable accommodation, and the manner by which
the reasonable accommodation requested may be removed when such person(s) with
a protected disability no longer will be present on the property.
         (3)   Any modification approved under this Section may be limited to
the time period during which the persons with disabilities occupy or utilize
the premises.
      F.   The Zoning Hearing Board shall also hear any other matters as set
forth in the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §10101 et seq.,
as amended. (Note: As of the adoption date of this Chapter, such provisions
were primarily within §909.1 of such law, 53 P.S. §10909.1.)
   5.   Time Limits for Appeals. The applicable provisions of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §10101 et seq., as amended, shall apply.
(Note: As of the adoption date of this Chapter, these provisions were in §914.1
of such Act, 53 P.S. §10914.1.)
   6.   Stay of Proceedings. The stay of proceedings provisions of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §10101 et seq., as amended,
shall apply. (Note: As of the adoption date of this Chapter, such provisions
were in §915.1 of such Act, 53 P.S. §10915.1.)
   7.   Time Limits on Permits and Approvals.
      A.   After a variance is approved or other zoning approval (such as
special exception or conditional use approval) is officially authorized, then
any applicable zoning and construction permits shall be secured by the
applicant within 18 months after the date of such approval or authorization.
The work authorized by zoning permits shall then be completed within the time
period specified in construction permits. If construction permits are not
required, then the work shall be completed within 18 months after issuance of a
zoning permit, unless an extension is granted under paragraph .B below.
         (1)   However, if a variance is approved to address a violation of
this Chapter, then the permit shall be acquired and the work completed within 6
months after the variance is approved, with no further time extension.
      B.   Extension. In response to an applicant stating good cause in
writing, the Zoning Officer may extend in writing the time limit for completion
of work under a zoning permit.
      C.   If an applicant fails to obtain the necessary permits or begin
construction within the above time periods, or allows interruptions in
substantial construction of longer than 12 months, the Zoning Officer shall
conclusively presume that the applicant has waived, withdrawn or abandoned
approvals, variances and permits under this Chapter and all such approvals,
variances and permits shall be deemed automatically rescinded by the Borough.
   8.   Multiple Applications. No more than one application for the same
property shall be pending before the Zoning Hearing Board for special exception
approval at any time.

   3.   Consideration of Special Exception Applications. When special
exceptions are allowed by this Chapter, the Zoning Hearing Board shall hear and
decide requests for such special exceptions in accordance with standards
established by this Chapter, including the following:
      A.   Compliance with this Chapter. The applicant shall establish by
credible evidence that the application complies with all applicable
requirements of this Chapter. The applicant shall provide the Board with
sufficient plans, studies or other data to demonstrate this compliance.
      B.   Compliance with Other Laws. The approval may be conditioned upon the
applicant later showing proof of compliance with other specific applicable
Borough, State and Federal laws, regulations and permits. Required permits or
other proof of compliance may be required to be presented to the Borough prior
to the issuance of any zoning permit, building permit, certification of
occupancy and/or recording of an approved plan.
      C.   Traffic. The applicant shall establish that the traffic from the
proposed use will be accommodated in a safe and efficient manner that will
minimize hazards and congestion, after considering any improvements proposed to
be made by the applicant as a condition on approval.
      D.   Site Planning. The application shall include proper site layout,
internal circulation, parking, buffering, and all other elements of proper
design as specified in this Chapter.
      E.   Neighborhood. The proposed use shall not substantially change the
character of any surrounding residential neighborhood, after considering any
proposed conditions upon approval such as limits upon hours of operation.
      F.   Safety. The proposed use shall not create a significant hazard to
the public health and safety, such as fire, toxic or explosive hazards.
      G.   Natural Features. The proposed use shall be suitable for the site,
considering the disturbance of steep slopes, mature woodland, wetlands,
floodplains, springs and other important natural features.
   4.   Conditions. In granting a special exception, the Board may require such
reasonable conditions and safeguards (in addition to those expressed in this
Chapter) as it determines are necessary to implement the purposes of this
Chapter. Conditions imposed by the Zoning Hearing Board shall automatically
become conditions of the building permit issued pursuant thereto, and any
failure to comply with said conditions shall be a violation of this Chapter.
(Ord. 2014-02, 10/7/2014, §116)
§ 27-118.   Conditional Use Process.
   1.   Purpose. The conditional use approval process is designed to allow the
Borough Council to review and approve certain uses that could have significant
impacts upon the community and the environment.
   2.   Procedure. The Borough Council shall consider the conditional use
application and render its decision in accordance with the requirements of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §10101 et seq.
      A.   Submittal. A site plan shall be submitted, which shall contain the
information listed in §
27-104.4. Detailed site engineering (such as stormwater calculations and
profiles) are not required at the conditional use stage. If a fully engineered
subdivision or land development plan will be required, it may be submitted
separately, such as after a conditional use is approved. Or, an applicant may
voluntarily choose to submit a subdivision or land development plan for review
at the same time as a conditional use application.
      B.   Reviews. The Zoning Officer should provide a review to the Council
regarding the compliance of the application with this Chapter. If the Borough
has an active Planning Commission, such Commission shall be provided with an
opportunity to review the application.
      C.   The only uses that shall be approved as conditional uses shall be
those listed as conditional uses in Part 3.
      D.   Time Limit. Borough Council shall render a written decision on each
conditional use application within 45 days after the last hearing on the
application or as may be provided otherwise in §913.2 of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §10913.2. For a conditional use
application, the same provisions shall apply for notice of persons that apply
in §
27-113.A(3).
   3.   Consideration of Conditional Use Application. The Borough Council shall
determine whether the proposed conditional use would meet the applicable
require ments of this Chapter. The same standards shall apply to a conditional
use as are listed in §
27-117.3 for a special exception use.
   4.   Conditions. In approving conditional use applications, the Borough
Council may attach conditions they consider necessary to protect the public
welfare and meet the standards of this Chapter. These conditions shall be
enforceable by the Zoning Officer and failure to comply with such conditions
shall constitute a violation of this Chapter and be subject to the penalties
described in this Chapter.
(Ord. 2014-02, 10/7/2014, §117)
§ 27-119.   Liability.
   1.   Any review of activity within the floodplain, site plan review,
subdivision or land development approval, erosion control review, wetland
delineation review, stormwater runoff review, review of activity on steep
slopes, or any other review, approval or permit under this Chapter by an
officer, employee, board, commission, solicitor, consultant or agency of the
Borough shall not constitute a representation, guarantee or warranty of any
kind by the Borough, or its employees, officials, boards, solicitor(s),
consultants or agencies of the practicality or safety of any structure, use or
subdivision, and shall create no liability upon nor a cause of action against
such entity or person for any damage that may result pursuant thereto.
   2.   If the Zoning Officer mistakenly issues a permit under this Chapter,
the Borough shall not be liable for any later lawful withdrawal of such permit.

Part 3
Districts
§ 27-301.   Designation of Districts and Purposes.
   1.   For the purpose of this Chapter, Yoe Borough is hereby divided into the
following zoning districts, with the following abbreviations:
 
LDR Low Density Residential
MDR Medium Density Residential
TC  Town Center
C   Commercial
CN  Conservation
 
   2.   For the purposes of this Chapter, the zoning districts named in
subsection .1 shall be of the number, size, shape and location shown on the
“Official Zoning Map.”
   3.   Overlay Districts. The floodplain area, as defined by the Flood Hazard
Ordinance, shall serve as an overlay district to the applicable underlying
districts. In addition, the HO Historic Overlay District applies as provided in
§
27-309.
   4.   Purposes of Each District. In addition to serving the overall purposes
and objectives of this Chapter and the Tri-Boros Comprehensive Plan and the
applicable York County Policies and the County Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance, each zoning district is intended to serve the following purposes:
      A.   LDR Low Density Residential District. To provide for low density
residential neighborhoods that are primarily composed of single-family detached
dwellings. To protect these areas from incompatible uses.
      B.   MDR Medium Density Residential District. To provide for moderate
density residential neighborhoods that allow a mix of housing types. To protect
these areas from incompatible uses.
      C.   TC Town Center District. To provide for a mix of housing,
institutional uses and light business uses in a manner that encourages reuse of
older buildings and avoids conflicts between homes and intensive commercial
uses. To promote walking and seek to maintain an historic character.
      D.   C Commercial District. To provide for a wide range of commercial
uses. To carefully locate and design commercial development to provide
compatibility with nearby homes and to also allow for some light industrial
uses, while recognizing that heavier industrial uses are not suitable in Yoe
because of the proximity of existing homes and because of the protection
available against exclusionary challenges under the Tri-Boroughs Comprehensive
Plan. To promote traffic safety and avoid congestion problems.
      E.   CN Conservation District. To recognize public parks and playgrounds,
as well as cemeteries. To allow uses that are compatible on these properties.
      F.   HO Historic Overlay District. To encourage the preservation and
appropriate reuse of historic and other architecturally important building in
Yoe, include buildings that add to the historic character and streetscape of
key blocks. See §
27-309. Principal buildings on properties within this area require conditional
use approval before they can be demolished. §
27-309 also offers certain incentives to reuse these buildings. All of the
provisions of the underlying regular zoning district also applies to land in
the HO District, except for provisions that are specifically modified in §
27-309.

Zoning Map shall only be made in conformity with the amendment procedures
specified in the PA Municipalities Planning Code. All changes should be noted
by date with a brief description of the nature of the change, either on the map
or within an appendix to this Chapter.
   3.   Replacement Map. If the Official Zoning Map becomes damaged, destroyed,
lost or difficult to interpret because of changes and additions, or needs to
have drafting errors or omissions corrected, Borough Council may, by
resolution, adopt a new copy of the Official Zoning Map which shall supersede
the prior Official Zoning Map. Unless the prior Official Zoning Map has been
lost or has been totally destroyed, the prior map or any remaining parts shall
be preserved together with all available records pertaining to its previous

center line of street rights-of-way, streams and railroads, and lot lines as
they existed on a recorded deed or plan of record in the County Recorder of
Deeds office at the time of the adoption of this Chapter, unless such district
boundary lines are fixed by dimensions as shown on the Official Zoning Map.
      B.   Where a district boundary is not fixed by dimensions and where it
approximately follows lot lines, such boundary shall be construed to follow
such lot lines unless specifically shown otherwise.
      C.   The location of a district boundary on un-subdivided land or where a
district boundary divides a lot shall be determined by the use of the scale
appearing on the Zoning Map unless indicated otherwise by dimensions.

be regulated by the municipality in which the principal use(s) are located,
unless otherwise provided by applicable case law. The land area within each
municipality shall be regulated by the use regulations and other applicable
regulations of each municipality.

27-803.2.
** =   The following exceptions shall apply:
-For accessory structures and uses, see subsection .3 below.
-Structures shall not obstruct minimum sight clearance at intersections.
-See §
27-803.2 pertaining to corner lots.
-See §
27-806 regarding extension of nonconforming setbacks.
-See §
27-803 regarding permitted reductions in setbacks to reflect average setbacks
of adjacent buildings.
(Note A) =   The side or rear setback for a principal business from a lot in a
residential district shall be increased to 50 feet for any building area or
land area used for manufacturing or an industrial tractor-trailer truck loading
space from a lot in a residential district or for any use that is open to the
public between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.
(Note B) =   If two or more side-by-side off-street parking spaces are located
in the front setback area of a single-family attached dwelling or if garage
door(s) for two or more vehicles face onto the street in the front of the
single-family attached dwelling, then the minimum building width per dwelling
along such street shall be a minimum of 24 feet. A maximum of 60 percent of the
land area between the front of each single-family attached dwelling or a
single-family semi-attached dwelling and the street right-of-way line shall be
used for vehicle parking and driveways.
(Note C) =   Setbacks shall be measured from the street right-of-way that will
exist after the development is completed. An unenclosed front porch or deck may
intrude up to 10 feet into the minimum front setback area. This porch or deck
may be covered by a roof. Steps and stoops may also intrude into this setback.
(Note D) =   Where lots on both sides of a lot are occupied by existing
principal buildings that have a front setback area that is smaller than is
required by the zoning district regulations, then the Zoning Officer may allow
the minimum front setback area to be reduced to the average of those two
existing buildings.
Abbreviations:   sq. ft. = square feet; min. = minimum; max. = maximum; ft. =
feet
   2.   Height. Except as provided in §
27-802 , or as specified otherwise in this Chapter for a particular use, the
following maximum structure height shall apply in all zoning districts:
      A.   An accessory building shall have a maximum height of 25 feet, and
include a maximum of one story (plus any unhabitable attic storage area),
unless the building meets the minimum setbacks for a principal building. If the
setbacks are met for a principal building, then the maximum height for a
principal building in that district shall apply.
      B.   The maximum height for any other structure shall be 40 feet.
   3.   Accessory Structures and Uses.
      A.   Accessory structures and uses shall meet the minimum setbacks
provided for in §
27-307.1, except as follows or specifically provided otherwise.
      B.   For a permitted detached structure that is accessory to a dwelling
(s), the minimum rear setback shall be 5 feet and the minimum side setback
shall be 5 feet, except a minimum setback of 10 feet shall apply from a street
right-of-way along the side of a corner lot. The following exceptions apply:
         (1)   A side setback is not required for a structure that is accessory
to a dwelling from a lot line along which two dwellings are attached (such as a
lot line shared by semi-detached dwellings). However, such structure shall
still meet the minimum side setback on a lot line where the dwellings are not
attached.
         (2)   A residential porch or deck that is unenclosed may extend a
maximum of 15 feet into the required rear setback. Such porch or deck may be
covered by a roof or awning. Space under an unenclosed porch may be used for
household storage. See Note D above considering front setbacks.
         (3)   See §
27-403 for swimming pools.
      C.   No accessory building and no swimming pool shall be allowed in the
minimum front setback.
      D.   In any case, an existing lawful accessory building may be replaced
with a new accessory building provided it is built on the same location
covering the same footprint.
      E.   If an accessory use is attached to a principal building (such as a
garage built onto the side of a home), the principal setbacks shall apply.
   4.   Rear Setback Abutting a Street. If a new principal building is
constructed with its rear lot line abutting a public street (not including an
alley), a row of landscaping shall be placed between such street and the
principal building, and any fencing shall be placed on the inside of such
landscaping. This requirement shall not apply where the landscaping would
interfere with required sight distances or a vehicle driveway or garage.
(Ord. 2014-02, 10/7/2014, §307)
§ 27-308.   Wetlands and Waterway Conservation.
   1.   Wetland Studies. It shall be the responsibility of each applicant to
determine whether land areas proposed for alteration meet the Federal or State
definition of a wetland prior to submittal of development plans to the Borough.
If the Zoning Officer has reason to believe that wetlands may be present on a
site proposed for development or subdivision, the Zoning Officer may require
that the applicant provide a suitable wetland delineation study prepared by a
qualified professional.
   2.   Wetland and Lake Setbacks. A minimum setback of 25 feet shall be
required between any new principal building for which a construction permit is
issued after the effective date of this Chapter and any contiguous “wetland”
area of more than ½ acre or any natural lake or pond.
   3.   Setback from Waterways. No new principal building, no new off-street
parking spaces and no new commercial or industrial outdoor storage shall be
allowed within 50 feet from the centerline of Mill Creek. Where trees and other
natural vegetation are removed within this setback, they shall be replaced with
new trees and vegetation that serve the same environmental purposes.
(Ord. 2014-02, 10/7/2014, §308)
§ 27-309.   HO Historic Overlay District.
   1.   Purposes. This Section addresses control of demolition of older
buildings, and offers re-use incentives. In addition to serving the overall
purposes of this Chapter, this Section is intended to:
      A.   Promote the retention of community character and preservation of the
local heritage by the protection of historic and architectural resources.
      B.   Establish a clear process to review and approve demolition of key
older buildings, including buildings that add to the historic character and
streetscape of Yoe.
      C.   Encourage continued use, appropriate rehabilitation and adaptive
reuse of key older buildings.
      D.   Implement §§603(b), 603(g), 604(1) and 605(2) of the Municipalities
Planning Code, 53 P.S. §§10603(b), 10603(g), 10604(1), 10605(2), which address
protecting and facilitating the preservation of historic values through zoning
and using zoning to regulate uses and structures at or near places having
unique historic, architectural or patriotic interest or value.
      E.   Strengthen the local economy by promoting heritage tourism,
improving property values and increasing investment in older buildings.
      F.   Utilize the traditional neighborhood development provisions of the
Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §10101 et seq.
      G.   Carry out recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan, including
recommendations to preserve historic buildings and community character.
   2.   Applicability.
      A.   This Section shall apply to any principal building within the HO
Historic Overlay District, other than buildings where there is evidence the
building was built after January 1, 1940.
      B.   Within the HO Historic Overlay District, all of the provisions of
the applicable underlying zoning district shall also continue to apply, except
for specific provisions that are allowed to be more permissive by this Section.
In addition, the demolition approval provisions of this Section shall also
apply.
   3.   Definitions. In addition to the definitions provided in §
27-202, the following terms shall have the following meanings for the purposes
of this Section:
      A.   Demolition. The dismantling, tearing down, removal or razing of the
exterior of a building, in whole or in part. This term shall not include
changes to the interior of a building, provided such changes do not alter the
structural integrity of the building. The removal of exterior architectural
details or porches that are visible from a street shall also be considered to
be partial demolitions.
      B.   Demolition by Neglect. The absence of routine maintenance and repair
which leads to structural weakness, decay and deterioration in a building to a
point that causes a need for major repair or may cause a need for demolition.
      C.   Maintenance and Repair. Work that is intended to only correct
existing deficiencies or to extend the life of building materials, and which
does not harm the stability of exterior features of a building, and which is
not a partial or complete demolition. An example of a repair is to replace one
type of roofing material with a different type of roofing material.
      D.   Streetscape. The overall appearance of a block along a public
street, including yards visible from a public street, the relationship of
building setbacks, the consistency of architectural styles or features, the
spacing and shapes of windows and doors and rooflines and similar features that
give the block its distinctive visual character.
   4.   Approval of Demolition of Buildings Regulated by this Section.
      A.   Any partial or complete demolition of a building regulated by this
Section shall only occur in compliance with this Section. Before a building
regulated by this Section is allowed to be partially or completely demolished,
the applicant must prove by credible evidence to the satisfaction of the
Borough Council as a conditional use that one or more of the following
conditions exist:
         (1)   The existing building cannot feasibly and reasonably be reused,
and that such situation is not the result of intentional neglect or demolition
by neglect by the owner.
         (2)   The denial of the demolition would result in unreasonable
economic hardship to the owner, and the hardship was not self-created.
         (3)   The demolition is necessary to allow a project to occur that
will have substantial, special and unusual public benefit that would greatly
outweigh the loss of the building regulated by this Section, and the project
needs to occur at this location (for example, a demolition may be needed for a
necessary expansion of an existing public building or to allow a street
improvement that is necessary to alleviate a public safety hazard).
         (4)   The existing building has no historical or architectural
significance and the demolition will not adversely impact upon the streetscape.
         (5)   The proposed design of a replacement building, porch or similar
feature will result in a net improvement to the streetscape.
         (6)   The building will be replaced with a new building that will have
essentially the same appearance as viewed from a public street.
      B.   For approval of a demolition, the standards of this Section shall
apply in place of the conditional use approval standards of §
27-118. In reviewing the application, the Borough Council shall consider the
following:
         (1)   The effect of the demolition on the historical significance,
streetscape and architectural integrity of neighboring historic buildings and
on the historic character of the surrounding neighborhood.
         (2)   The feasibility of other alternatives to demolition.
      C.   An application for partial or complete demolition of a building
regulated by this Section shall not be approved unless all of the requirements
of this Section have been met. A partial demolition shall include, but not be
limited to, removal of an attached front porch roof, removal of front porch
columns, and removal of historic architectural features on a building side that
faces a public street. See definition of “demolition” above.
         (1)   After receiving a complete application, the Zoning Officer may
approve the removal of features regulated by this Section if the applicant
proves they will be replaced with new features that will have the same
appearance as viewed from a public street. For example, a older front porch may
be replaced with a new front porch with the same appearance, even if the
materials are different.
      D.   A complete application for the demolition shall be submitted by the
applicant in writing. This application shall include the following:
         (1)   The name, address and daytime telephone number of the owner of
record and the applicant for the demolition.
         (2)   Recent exterior photographs of the building proposed for
demolition. If the applicant is alleging that the building cannot be reused or
rehabilitated, then interior photos and floor plans shall be provided as needed
to support the applicant’s claim.
         (3)   A site plan drawn to scale showing existing buildings and the
proposed demolition.
         (4)   A written statement of the reasons for the demolition.
         (5)   The proposed use of the site, and a proposed timeline for
development of that proposed use.
      E.   Procedures. The demolition application shall be submitted to the
Borough for consideration as a conditional use. The applicant shall be informed
of meeting dates where the application is intended to be discussed and
encouraged to be present to discuss the proposed demolition.
      F.   Evidence. The applicant shall provide sufficient credible evidence
to justify any claims that a building cannot feasibly be repaired or reused.
The following types of expert testimony and documentation are examples of types
of information that may be accepted to be credible evidence: (1) a property
appraisal and/or income and expense statements for the property, (2) a written
estimate of the costs of rehabilitation by a qualified contractor, (3) a
written report from a professional engineer regarding the structural soundness
of the building, (4) testimony concerning efforts to market the property over
time, (5) information regarding the applicant’s purchase price of the building,
and (6) similar relevant information.
      G.   Self-created Conditions. The conditions that justify the proposed
demolition of a building regulated by this Section shall not have been self-
created by the applicant. These conditions include, but are not limited to:
         (1)   Lack of proper maintenance of the building, including, but not
limited to, structural elements, the roof, windows or architectural elements.
         (2)   Leaving parts of a building open to the elements or accessible
to vandalism.
      H.   The Zoning Officer may require any unoccupied building to be
properly sealed and secured to prevent decay from the elements and vandalism.
      I.   Emergency. The Construction Official may issue a permit for
demolition without compliance with this Section if the Construction Official
certifies in writing that the building represents a clear and immediate hazard
to public safety, and that no other reasonable alternatives exist to
demolition.
      J.   Exceptions. Conditional use approval shall not be needed for the
following:
         (1)   Demolition of accessory buildings or structures.
         (2)   Interior renovations or removal of features (such as a rear
porch) that do not harm the structural stability of the building and that are
not visible from a public street. Features that are only visible from an alley
and not a street are not regulated by this Section.
         (3)   Removal of features that were added after 1940, such as a modern
porch, aluminum siding or carport.
         (4)   Relocation of a building within the Borough, provided that the
relocation does not result in a partial or complete demolition that is
regulated by this Section.
   5.   Demolition by Neglect (see definition above).
      A.   Every property owner of a building regulated by this Section shall
repair and maintain the building to avoid demolition by neglect.
      B.   Every property owner of a building regulated by this Section shall
properly repair and maintain the building to maintain the structural integrity
of the building and to protect the building and attached features from damage
from the elements. The attached features that shall be protected, repaired and
maintained include the roof, cornice, columns, beams, posts and lintels.
      C.   If a property owner fails to comply with an order from the
Construction Official to repair a building regulated by this Section to correct
a code violation that threatens the structural integrity of a building, such
matter shall also be considered a violation of this Chapter.
   6.   Additional Uses Allowed.
      A.   The following additional uses shall be allowed within a building
regulated by this Section in any zoning district:
         (1)   The conversion into a bed-and-breakfast inn, meeting the
additional requirements in §

crafts, which may include occasional accessory retail sales.
      B.   To be eligible for these uses, the applicant shall prove the
following to the satisfaction of the Borough Council that a registered
architect with substantial experience in the rehabilitation of historic
buildings provides a written certification that the exterior of the building as
visible from public streets will be historically rehabilitated in conformance
with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Historic Rehabilitation, as
viewed from public streets (not including an alley).
      C.   Plans shall be submitted showing the design and materials of any
exterior changes to the building that are visible from a public street.
(Ord. 2014-02, 10/7/2014, §309)
§ 27-310.   Advisory Design Guidelines.
   The following advisory guidelines should be considered in the design of new
construction, additions and exterior alterations, particularly in the TC
District:
      A.   Vehicle parking and any garage doors should be placed to the rear of
buildings as opposed to between buildings and the street. Where rear parking is
not practical, then parking should be provided to the side of a building. Where
a driveway needs to enter from the front, the garage should be setback further
from the street than the house, and the driveway should be as narrow as
practical through the front yard.
      B.   New construction should have a front setback that is similar to
adjacent older buildings.
      C.   On historic buildings, modern additions and features should be
placed towards the rear of the property.
      D.   New construction should have rooflines that are similar to adjacent
older buildings. Flat roofs should be avoided, except when a decorative cornice
is used. Where a pitched roof is not practical, then the roof should at least
appear to have angles and a pitch when viewed from the street.
      E.   On sides visible from a street, new construction should use building
materials that are similar to appearance of older buildings, such as decorative
masonry.
      F.   Blank walls without door and window openings should be avoided along
a street.
      G.   Parking. See §§
27-601.2 and
27-602.6 which allow some flexibility in parking requirements. Shared parking
among property owners and businesses is encouraged where adequate parking
spaces exist for shared usage. Landscaping should be used to buffer parking
lots from streets.
      H.   Pedestrians. Pedestrian traffic should be separated from major
vehicle routes. Developments should be designed in such a way as to be inviting
for pedestrian traffic. The development should not be surrounded by parking
lots and driveways, but should be placed on the site in such a way that it
relates to adjacent properties and streets.
      I.   Porches. Existing older porches should be maintained and new porches
should be considered on the front of new buildings.
      J.   Site Features. Parking areas, garages or storage buildings
(particularly the prefabricated metal type) should not be built near the front
or in areas visible from the street.
      K.   Fences. Chain-link metal fences should be avoided in the front yard.
Picket or ornamental fences are encouraged. Solid wooden or vinyl plank fences
should be placed in rear and side yards only. Highway-style metal guide rails
should not be used.
      L.   Utilities. New utilities should be placed underground. Where that is
not practical, they should be placed in less visible parts of the site. For
example, new utility lines should be extended from the rear of the property
instead of the front.
      M.   HVAC. Commercial HVAC systems should be screened from view from the
front of a lot using walls, fencing, roof elements or landscaping. Noise or
odor producing ventilation equipment should be placed as far away from
dwellings as is feasible.
      N.   Fire Escapes. New exterior fire escapes should not be constructed on
the front facade of a building.
(Ord. 2014-02, 10/7/2014, §310)
§ 27-311.   Common Open Space Standards.
   Where common open space is used to meet a Borough requirement, it shall meet
the following additional requirements:
      A.   The land shall be designed, intended and suitable for active or
passive recreation by residents of a development or the general public or for
another Borough-authorized open space use.
      B.   The land shall be covered by a system that ensures perpetual mainte
nance, if the land is not intended to be publicly owned.
      C.   The land shall be deeded to the Borough and/or preserved by a deed
restriction or conservation easement to permanently prevent non-authorized uses
and subdivision of the land.
      D.   The following areas shall not be used meet minimum common open space
requirements:
         (1)   Existing street rights-of-way.
         (2)   Vehicle streets or driveways providing access to other lots.
         (3)   Land beneath building(s) or land within 20 feet of a building
(other than accessory buildings and pools clearly intended for noncommercial
recreation and other than agricultural buildings and a farmstead which are
permitted within land approved by the Borough for agricultural preservation).
         (4)   Off-street parking (other than that clearly intended for
noncommercial recreation).
         (5)   Area(s) needed to meet a requirement for an individual lot.
         (6)   For land intended to be open to the public, that does not have
provisions for entry with a 15-foot minimum width by pedestrians from a street
open to the public or from adjacent preserved open space that has access to
such a street.
         (7)   Land that includes a stormwater detention basin, except for a
basin or portions of a basin that the applicant proves to the satisfaction of
Borough Council would: (a) be reasonably safe and useful for active or passive
recreation during the vast majority of weather conditions or (b) serve as a
scenic asset resembling a natural pond.
         (8)   Portions of land that have a width of less than 50 feet, except
for segments of a regional trail system.
         (9)   Areas that are under water during normal weather conditions.
         (10)   Areas that are under electric transmission lines that are
designed for a capacity of 35 kilovolts or greater.
      E.   Each square foot of preserved open space that is of 25 percent or
greater slopes and each square foot within the 100-year floodplain shall only
count as one- half square foot for the purposes of determining the amount of
preserved open space.
(Ord. 2014-02, 10/7/2014, §311)
Part 4
Additional Requirements for Specific Uses
§ 27-401.   Applicability.
   This Part establishes additional specific requirements for certain specific
uses, in addition to the sign, parking, environmental and other general
requirements of this Chapter and the requirements of each district. Wherever
two requirements conflict regarding the same matter, the stricter requirement
upon use or development shall apply.
      A.   For uses allowed within a specific zoning district as “special
exception” uses, see also the procedures and standards in §
27-117. For conditional uses, see also §
27-118.
(Ord. 2014-02, 10/7/2014, §401)
§ 27-402.   Additional Requirements for Specific Principal Uses.
   1.   Each of the following uses shall meet all of the following requirements
for that use:
      A.   Adult Use. (This is limited to the following: adult store, adult
movie theater, massage parlor, or adult live entertainment facility.)
         (1)   Purposes. The regulations on adult uses are intended to serve
the following purposes, in addition to the overall objectives of this Chapter.
            (a)   To recognize the adverse secondary impacts of adult uses that
affect health, safety and general welfare concerns of the Borough. These
secondary impacts have been documented in research conducted across the nation.
These secondary impacts typically include, but are not limited to: increases in
criminal activity, increases in activities that increase the risk of
transmission of sexually transmitted diseases, increases in activities that
increase the risk of transmission of other communicable diseases, increases in
blight, decreases in the stability of residential neighborhoods, and decreases
in property values for surrounding homes, and decreases in the marketability of
nearby commercial business space. The research conducted across the nation
concludes that adult uses typically involve insufficient self-regulation to
control these secondary effects.
            (b)   To limit adult uses to locations where these secondary
impacts can be minimized, particularly as they affect residential neighborhoods
and commercial revitalization.
            (c)   To not attempt to suppress any activities protected by the
“free speech” protections of the State and U.S. Constitutions, but instead to
control secondary effects.
         (2)   An adult use and its parking area shall not be located within
any of the following distances, whichever is most restrictive:
            (a)   One hundred fifty lineal feet from an existing dwelling on
another lot.
            (b)   Two hundred lineal feet from the lot line of any lot in a
residential zoning district.
            (c)   One thousand lineal feet from the lot line of any primary or
secondary school, place of worship, library, public park or playground,
recreation trail, day-care center or nursery school.
         (3)   No adult use shall be located within 1,000 lineal feet from any
existing “adult use.”
         (4)   A 50-foot buffer yard shall be provided, regardless of zoning
district, along the side and rear lot lines. If such buffer area does not
include substan tial mature trees that will be preserved, it shall include
continuous screening by evergreen trees with an initial height of 5 feet.
         (5)   No pornographic material, displays or words shall be placed in
view of persons who are not inside of the establishment. Definite precautions
shall be made to prohibit minors from entering the premises.
         (6)   No adult use shall be used for any purpose that violates any
Federal, State or municipal law.
         (7)   Pornographic and sexually explicit signs and displays shall be
prohibited that are visible from outside of the premises.
         (8)   The adult use shall not include the sale or display of “obscene”
materials, as defined by Pennsylvania criminal law, as may be amended by
applicable court decisions.
         (9)   An adult use shall be prohibited in all districts except where
specifically allowed under §
27-306. An adult use is a distinct use, and shall not be allowed under any
other use, such as a retail store or club.
         (10)   A minimum lot area of 1 acre is required.
         (11)   For public health reasons, private or semi-private viewing
booths of any kind are prohibited. This specifically includes, but is not
limited to, booths for viewing adult movies or nude dancers.
         (12)   No use may include live actual or simulated sex acts nor any
sexual contact between employees and entertainers nor or between employees or
entertainers and customers.
         (13)   Only “lawful” massages as defined by State court decisions
shall be performed in a massage parlor.
         (14)   All persons within any adult use shall wear non-transparent
garments that cover their genitals and the female areola, except within a
permitted lawful “adult live entertainment facility.”
         (15)   Any application for such use shall state the legal name(s) of
an on-site manager responsible to ensure compliance with this Chapter on a
daily basis. A telephone number shall be provided where the on-site manager can
be reached during the hours of the business. Such information shall be updated
whenever it changes in writing to the Zoning Officer.
         (16)   The use shall not operate between the hours of 12 midnight and
7 a.m. If State liquor laws require that the Borough allow the sale of alcohol
during later hours, the adult uses shall still cease at midnight.
         (17)   As specific conditions of approval under this Chapter, the
applicant shall prove compliance, where applicable, with the following State
laws, as amended: the Pennsylvania Liquor Code, 47 P.S. §1-101 et seq., Act 219
of 1990, 18 Pa.C.S.A. §7327 (which pertains to sale or consumption of alcohol
between 2 a.m. and 8 a.m.), Act 207 of 1990, 18 Pa.C.S.A. §5903 (which pertains
to obscenity) and Act 120 of 1996, 68 Pa.C.S.A. §5503 (which pertains to adult-
oriented establishments and which limits enclosed viewing booths among other
matters).”
         (18)   If a use will involve alcohol sales, evidence must be provided
that such alcohol sales are legal within the Borough of Yoe.
      B.   Adult Day-care Center.
         (1)   The use shall be fully licensed by the State, if required by the
State.
         (2)   The use shall include constant supervision during all hours of
operation.

      D.   Animal Cemetery.
         (1)   All the regulations for a “cemetery” in this Section shall
apply.
         (2)   The applicant shall prove to the satisfaction of the Zoning

will be used to offer space on a tower to other communications providers, which
shall serve to minimize the total number of towers necessary in the region.
This policy shall be designed to minimize the total number of towers necessary
in the Borough.
            (f)   An applicant for a new commercial communications tower shall
provide evidence to the Board or Council as applicable that they have
investigated co-locating their facilities on an existing tower and other tall
structures and have found such alternative to be unworkable. The reasons shall
be provided.

(Ord. 2014-02, 10/7/2014, §506)
§ 27-507.   Control of Light and Glare.
   This Section shall only regulate exterior lighting that spills across lot
lines or onto public streets.
      A.   Street Lighting Exempted. This Section shall not apply to: (1)
street lighting that is owned, financed or maintained by the Borough or the
State, or (2) an individual light of less than 10 feet total height in a front
yard or attached to the front of a building (not including a spot light).
      B.   Height of Lights. No luminaire that is within 150 feet of a lot line
of an existing dwelling shall be placed at a height exceeding 35 feet above the
average surrounding ground level. This limitation shall not apply to lights
needed for air safety nor lights intended solely to illuminate an architectural
feature of a building, or lighting of outdoor public recreation facilities.
      C.   Diffused. All light sources, including signs, shall be properly
diffused as needed with a translucent or similar cover and/or shielded to
prevent exposed lighting elements from being directly visible from streets,
public sidewalks, dwellings or adjacent lots.
      D.   Shielding. All light sources, including signs, shall be shielded
around the light source and carefully directed and placed to prevent the
lighting from creating a nuisance to reasonable persons in adjacent dwellings,
and to prevent the lighting from shining into the eyes of passing motorists.
      E.   Flickering. Flashing, flickering or strobe lighting are prohibited,
except for non-advertising seasonal lights between October 25 and January 10.
      F.   Spillover. Exterior lighting on an institutional, commercial or
industrial property shall not cause a spillover of light onto a residential lot
that exceeds 1.0 horizontal foot-candle inside the lot line of a lot occupied
by an existing dwelling.
      G.   Gasoline Sales Canopies. Any canopy over gasoline pumps shall have
light fixtures recessed into the canopy or screened by an extension around the
bottom of the canopy or otherwise controlled so that lighting elements are not
visible from another lot or street.
      H.   Lighting of Horizontal Surfaces. For the lighting of predominantly
horizontal surfaces (such as parking areas and vehicle sales areas), lighting
fixtures shall be aimed downward and shall include cut-off measures as needed
to properly direct the light and to meet the maximum spillover requirements of
paragraph .F and to prevent glare along streets. The Borough may require that
light fixtures for nonresidential uses be placed along the street and be aimed
away from the street in a manner that also minimizes light shining onto
residential lots.
      I.   Lighting of Vertical Surfaces. For lighting of predominantly
vertical surfaces (such as building walls and signs), lighting fixtures shall
be shielded and aimed so as to not project light towards neighboring residences
and that minimizes light that is directed skyward. Lighting of a billboard
should be attached to the top of the billboard and project downward. However,
lighting shall be allowed of the United States flag, provided the light source
shall have a beam spread no greater than necessary to illuminate the flag.

(Ord. 2014-02, 10/7/2014, §601)
§ 27-602.   General Regulations for Off-Street Parking.
   1.   General. Parking spaces and accessways shall be laid out to result in
safe and orderly use, and to fully take into account all of the following:
vehicular access onto and off the site, vehicular movement within the site,
loading areas, pedestrian patterns and any drive-through facilities. No parking
area shall cause a safety hazard or impediment to traffic off the lot.
   2.   Existing Parking.
      A.   Any parking spaces serving such pre-existing structures or uses at
the time of adoption of this Chapter shall not in the future be reduced in
number below the number required by this Chapter.
      B.   If a new principal nonresidential building is constructed on a lot,
then any existing parking on such lot that serves such building shall be
reconfigured to comply with this Chapter, including, but not limited to,
requirements for channelization of traffic from adjacent streets,
channelization of traffic within the lot, minimum aisle widths, paving and
landscaping.
   3.   Change in Use or Expansion. A structure or use in existence at the
effective date of this Chapter that expands or changes in use of an existing
principal building shall be required to provide all of the required parking for
the entire size and type of the resulting use, except as follows:
      A.   If a nonresidential use expands by an aggregate total maximum of 5
percent in the applicable measurement (such as building floor area) beyond what
existed at the time of adoption of this Chapter, then no additional parking is
required. For example, if an existing building included 3,000 square feet, and
a single minor addition of 150 square feet was proposed, then additional
parking would not be required. This addition without providing new parking
shall only be allowed one time per lot.
   4.   Continuing Obligation of Parking and Loading Spaces. All required
numbers of parking spaces and off-street loading spaces shall be available as
long as the use or building which the spaces serve still exist, and such spaces
shall not be reduced in number below the minimum required by this Chapter. No
required parking area or off- street loading spaces shall be used for any other
use (such as storage or display of materials) that interferes with the area’s
availability for parking.
   5.   Location of Parking.
      A.   Required off-street parking spaces shall be on the same lot or
abutting lot with the principal use served, unless the applicant proves to the
satisfaction of the Zoning Officer that a method of providing the spaces is
guaranteed to be available during all of the years the use is in operation
within 300 feet walking distance from the entrance of the principal use being
served. A written and signed lease shall be provided, if applicable. A sign
shall direct persons to the parking spaces.
         (1)   The Zoning Officer may require evidence at any time that the
parking continues to be available for the use. If such parking is not available
in the future, the zoning permit shall be considered to have been revoked,
unless the applicant proves that other parking is provided that meets the
requirement.
(Ord. 2014-02, 10/7/2014, §602)
§ 27-603.   Design Standards for Off-Street Parking.
   1.   General Requirements.
      A.   Backing onto a Street. No parking area of four or more parking
spaces shall be designed to require or encourage parked vehicles to back into a
public street in order to leave a parking space, except for a driveway that
enters onto a local street or a parking court. Parking spaces may back onto an
alley.
      B.   Except for spaces serving one household, every required parking
space shall be designed so that each motor vehicle may proceed to and from the
parking space provided for it without requiring the moving of any other
vehicle.
      C.   Parking areas shall not extend into a required buffer yard. New
parking spaces shall only be allowed within a street right-of-way where they
are specifically approved by the Borough.
      D.   Separation from Street. Except for parking spaces immediately in
front of individual dwellings, all areas for off-street parking, off-street
loading and unloading and the storage or movement of motor vehicles shall be
physically separated from the street by a continuous grass or landscaped
planting strip, except for necessary and approved vehicle entrances and exits
to the lot.
      E.   Stacking and Obstructions. Each lot shall provide adequate area upon
the lot to prevent back-up of vehicles on a public street while awaiting entry
to the lot, or while waiting for service at a drive-through facility.
      F.   Provisions Allowing Flexibility or Reduction of Parking
Requirements.
         (1)   See the provisions of the Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance that may allow a portion of parking to be reserved for future use if
needed. See the provisions of the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance
that may allow a reduction of parking when two or more uses share the parking
and have different peak needs. Where one of those modifications are approved, a
variance shall not be needed to the provisions of this Part.
         (2)   In the Town Center Zoning District, an applicant may count legal
on- street parking spaces that are in front of his/her lot and that are on the
same side of the street towards meeting some of the required number of parking
spaces.
   2.   Size and Marking of Parking Spaces.
      A.   Each parking space shall be a rectangle with a minimum width of 9
feet and a minimum length of 18 feet, except the minimum sized rectangle shall
be 8 feet by 22 feet for parallel parking, except as provided for parking for
persons with disabilities in subsection .7 below. The 9 by 18 feet space size
shall supercede any larger parking space requirement in the SALDO. Larger
parking spaces are required for persons with disabilities, as provided below.
      B.   All spaces shall be marked to indicate their location, except those
of a one- or two-family dwelling, and except where stone parking may be
allowed.
   3.   Parking Aisles. See the provisions in the Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance.
   4.   Driveways.
   A.
 
Width of driveway at entrance onto a public street, One-Way Use* Two-Way Use*
at the edge of the cartway*
Minimum                                             12 feet      22 feet
Maximum                                             20 feet      30 feet
*   This standard may be revised where PennDOT requires a different standard
for an entrance to a State road, or where the applicant demonstrates to the
Zoning Officer that a wider width is needed for truck access.
 
      B.   Drainage. Adequate provisions shall be made to maintain
uninterrupted parallel drainage along a public street at the point of driveway
entry. The Borough may require an applicant to install an appropriate type and
size of pipe at a driveway crossing.
      C.   Clear Sight Distances. A driveway shall be designed and located to
minimize obstructions to vision by motorists and pedestrians of other traffic.
The Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance includes sight distance require
ments for new driveways. PennDOT also has sight distance requirements for
driveways entering onto a State road.
      D.   Driveway Setbacks. A new driveway shall be set back the following
minimum distances from the following features:
         (1)   Forty feet from the intersecting street rights-of-way of two
public streets.
         (2)   Twenty feet from a fire hydrant.
         (3)   One hundred feet from another driveway on the same lot along the
same street, unless the driveways are one-way pairs or one is right hand turn
only, and except for driveways serving individual dwelling units.
         (4)   Five feet from a utility pole, electric service box or similar
utility structure.
      E.   Slope and Width. The slope of a driveway shall not exceed 8 percent
within 25 feet of a street right-of-way. The slope and width of a driveway and
the clear height above it shall be sufficient to allow access by emergency
vehicles.
      F.   Driveway Grading. Where a driveway is cut through a bank, unless an
approved retaining wall is used, the finished slope shall not result in a slope
of greater than 2:1, within 25 feet of where the driveway enters the street
right-of- way. Grading shall allow drainage to continue to gutters, unless an
alternative method of drainage is approved. Re-grading shall not result in a
slope of greater than 5 percent for public sidewalks, unless a stricter
requirement is required by PennDOT within a State road right-of-way.
   5.   Paving, Grading and Drainage. This subsection shall only apply when the
same matter is not submitted for approval under the Subdivision and Land
Develop ment Ordinance.
      A.   Parking and loading facilities and including driveways shall be
graded and adequately drained to prevent erosion or excessive water flow across
streets or adjoining properties.
      B.   Except for landscaped areas, all portions of required parking areas
for commercial, industrial, multi-family and institutional uses involving four
or more spaces, off-street loading facilities and driveways serving such uses
shall be surfaced with asphalt, concrete, paving block, or other low-dust
materials pre- approved by the Borough.
         (1)   If a residential driveway is over 100 feet long, only the first
25 feet is required to have such hard surfaces, while the remainder may be
crushed stone.
         (2)   Driveways limited to use by emergency vehicles are not required
to be paved provided the fire company approves the proposed surface.
         (3)   Driveways and parking that serve public uses, public parks and
public recreation areas are not required to be paved.
         (4)   However, by special exception, the Zoning Hearing Board may
allow parking areas with low or seasonal usage to be maintained in stone, grass
or other suitable surfaces. For example, the Board may allow parking spaces to
be grass, while major aisles are covered by stone.
         (5)   If the design and materials are found to be acceptable in
writing by the Borough Engineer, portions of parking areas may be covered with
a low- dust porous pavement surface that is designed to promote groundwater
recharge.
      C.   Motor vehicles shall not routinely be parked on grass or dirt
surfaces, except where specifically approved under the above provisions.
Entrances to parking spaces shall only occur at lawful driveway locations.
   6.   Lighting of Parking Areas. See “Light and Glare Control” in Part 5.
   7.   Parking for Persons with Disabilities.
      A.   Number of Spaces. See requirements under the Federal Americans With
Disabilities Act for parking for persons with disabilities. The following is a
summary of some of the relevant requirements in effect as of the enactment of
this Chapter.

   B.   Location. Handicapped parking spaces shall be located where they would
result in the shortest reasonable accessible distance to a handicapped
accessible building entrance. Curb cuts shall be provided as needed to provide
access from the handicapped spaces.
      C.   Minimum Size and Slope. See requirements of the Americans With
Disabilities Act regulations.
      D.   Marking. All required handicapped spaces shall be well-marked in
compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act. Such signs and/or markings
shall be maintained over time.
      E.   Paving. Handicapped parking spaces and adjacent areas needed to
access them with a wheelchair shall be covered with a smooth surface that is
usable with a wheelchair.
      F.   Note: A separate Borough ordinance addresses placement of an
individual handicapped parking space in front of a home.
   8.   Paved Area Setbacks (Including Off-Street Parking Setbacks).
      A.   Intent. To ensure that parked or moving vehicles within a lot do not
obstruct sight distance or interfere with pedestrian traffic, to aid in
stormwater management along streets, and to prevent vehicles from entering or
exiting a lot other than at approved driveways.
      B.   Any new or expanded vehicle parking or vehicle storage area of 4 or
more parking spaces that serves a principal nonresidential use shall be
separated from a public street by a planting strip. The planting strip shall
have a minimum width of 10 feet and be maintained in grass or other attractive
vegetative groundcover. The planting strip may be on one or both sides of any
sidewalk, provided the planting width totals 10 feet. This 10 feet width shall
be increased to 20 feet for a lot including 20 or more parking spaces that are
visible from the street.
         (1)   The planting strip shall not include heights or locations of
plants that would obstruct safe sight distances, but may include deciduous
trees that allow motorists to maintain views under the leaf canopy.
         (2)   The planting strip may be placed inward from the shoulder of an
uncurbed street or inward from the curb of a curbed street. The planting strip
may overlap the street right-of-way, provided it does not conflict with PennDOT
requirements, and provided that the Borough and PennDOT, as applicable,
maintain the right to replace planting areas within the right-of-way with
future street improvements.
         (3)   Approximately perpendicular driveway crossings may be placed
within the planting strip. Mostly vegetative stormwater channels may be placed
within the planting strip.
         (4)   The following shall be prohibited within the planting strip:
            (a)   Paving, except as allowed by subparagraph (3) above, and
except for street widenings that may occur after the development is completed.
            (b)   Fences.
            (c)   Parking, storage or display of vehicles or manufactured homes
or items for sale or rent or junk.
         (5)   Where feasible, where a sidewalk is not installed, this setback
should include an unobstructed generally level width running parallel to a
street that is suitable for a person to walk.
      C.   See landscaping requirements in §§
27-803 and
27-804.
(Ord. 2014-02, 10/7/2014, §603)
§ 27-604.   Off-Street Loading.
   1.   Each use shall provide off-street loading facilities, which meet the
require ments of this Section, sufficient to accommodate the maximum demand
generated by the use and the maximum size vehicle, in a manner that will not
routinely obstruct traffic on a public street and traffic entering and exiting
the lot. If no other reasonable alternative is feasible, traffic may be
obstructed for occasional loading and unloading along an alley, provided
traffic has the ability to use another method of access.
   2.   At the time of review under this Chapter. the applicant shall provide
evidence to the Zoning Officer on whether the use will have sufficient numbers
and sizes of loading facilities. The Planning Commission and/or Borough Council
may provide advice to the Zoning Officer on this matter as part of any plan
review by such boards. For the purposes of this Section, the words “loading”
and “unloading” are used interchangeably.
   3.   Each space and the needed maneuvering room shall not intrude into
approved buffer areas and landscaped areas.
(Ord. 2014-02, 10/7/2014, §604)
§ 27-605.   Fire Lanes and Access.
   1.   Fire lanes shall be provided where required by State or Federal
regulations or other local ordinances.
   2.   Access shall be also provided so that fire equipment can reach all
sides of principal nonresidential buildings and multi-family/apartment
buildings. This access shall be able to support a loaded fire pumper truck, but
shall not necessarily be paved.
   3.   The specific locations of fire lanes and fire equipment access are
subject to approval by the Borough, after review by local fire officials.

                                                                                   of the

                                                                                   Code.
 
   *   If a lot includes two or more distinct principal nonresidential uses,
the maximum freestanding sign area may be increased by 10 square feet for each
principal nonresidential use beyond the first nonresidential use. For example,
in the C District, if a lot includes three such uses, the maximum freestanding
sign area shall be 60 plus 20 equals 80 square feet.
   2.   Maximum Height of Wall Signs. The maximum height of wall signs shall be
equal to the top of the roof along the wall to which they are attached.
However, sign may be attached to a “parapet roof” that vertically extends up to
10 feet above the structural roof, provided the parapet roof appears to be an
architectural extension of the building.
   3.   Portable Signs (Including “Signs on Mobile Stands”) and Other Temporary
Signs.
      A.   Purpose. These standards recognize portable signs as a particular
type of sign that has the characteristics of a temporary sign but that has been
inappropri ately used as a permanent sign. This Section is based on the policy
that if a use desires to regularly display a sign for regularly changing
messages, that it erect a permanent sign within all of the requirements of this
Chapter.
      B.   Portable signs are prohibited in all districts, except as a
temporary charitable event sign permitted by §
27-703.
      C.   Businesses are encouraged to provide an area on a permanent sign
that displays changeable messages, as opposed to using a separate sign for such
purpose.
   4.   Signs on Freestanding Walls. An allowed freestanding sign face may be
attached to a decorative masonry or stone wall with a maximum height of 6 feet
and a maximum length of 12 feet, without being regulated by the wall setback
regulations of this Chapter and without the entire wall counting as sign area.
Such walls may be placed in a setback area, provided they do not obstruct safe
sight distances.
   5.   Major Development Sign. One two-sided sign or two one-sided signs shall
be allowed at up to two exterior street entrances to a subdivision or land
development of 20 or more dwelling units or more than 5 principal business
uses. Such sign area shall be a maximum of 40 square feet and may be attached
to a wall that meets subsection .4. It shall not be illuminated.
(Ord. 2014-02, 10/7/2014, §704)
§ 27-705.   Prohibited Signs.
   The following prohibitions on signs shall apply in all zoning districts:
      A.   Any moving object used to attract attention to a commercial use is
prohibited. However, certain flags and banners may be allowed as provided in §
27-703.
      B.   Flashing, blinking, twinkling, animated, scrolling or moving signs
of any type are prohibited. A sign shall not display electronically moving
images. Signs may change their message from time to time provided that each
message is visible for a minimum of 15 seconds, except as follows: (1) time and
temperature signs may change more frequently, and (2) if there is an
electronically changing sign area of greater than 30 square feet, the sign
shall not change its message more frequently than once every 20 seconds.
         (1)   In addition, flashing lights visible from a street shall not be
used to attract attention to a business. This restriction specifically includes
window signs, but does not prohibit Christmas lighting or displays, within §
27-703.
         (2)   Electronically changeable message signs shall not be allowed in
a residential district.
      C.   Signs which emit smoke, visible vapors or particles, sound or odor
are prohibited.
      D.   Signs which contain information that states that a lot may be used
for a purpose not permitted under this Chapter are prohibited.
      E.   Signs that are of such form, shape or color that they resemble an
official traffic control sign, signal or device or that have any
characteristics which are likely to confuse or distract the operator of a motor
vehicle on a public street (such as prominent use of the words “danger”) are
prohibited.
      F.   Signs or displays visible from a lot line that include words or
images that are obscene or pornographic are prohibited.
      G.   Balloons of greater than 50 cubic feet that are tethered to the
ground or a structure for periods of over a day and that are primarily intended
for advertising purposes are prohibited.
      H.   Floodlights and outdoor lasers for advertising purposes are
prohibited.
(Ord. 2014-02 , 10/7/2014, §705)
§ 27-706.   Off-Premises Signs (Including Billboards).
   1.   Purposes. Off-premises signs are controlled by this Chapter for the
following purposes, to: ensure that a physical environment is maintained that
is attractive to desirable types of development, especially light industrial
and office parks; prevent visual pollution in the Borough and protect property
values, especially in consideration of the fact that most commercial areas of
the Borough are within close proximity to existing residences; prevent glare on
adjacent property and streets; avoid the creation of additional visual
distractions to motorists, especially along busy arterial streets that involve
complex turning movements and numerous traffic hazards; recognize the numerous
alternative forms of free speech available in the Borough, including existing
nonconforming off-premises signs, on-premises signs and temporary signs and
printed and electronic media; carry out the purposes listed in §
27-701.
   2.   Nonconforming Off-Premises Signs. This Section is not intended to
require the removal of an existing lawfully-placed off-premises sign that is in
structurally sound condition.
   3.   PennDOT Sign. Signs erected and maintained by PennDOT are permitted by
right in all districts.
   4.   Permitted Off-Premises Signs. Except for other types of signs that are
specifically allowed by this Section to be off-premises, an off-premises sign
is only permitted if it meets the following requirements:
      A.   District. An off-premises sign is only permitted in the C Commercial
District.
      B.   Location. An off-premises sign shall be set back a minimum of 25
feet from all lot lines and street rights-of-way.
      C.   Maximum total sign area, on each of two sides–300 square feet. The
two sides shall be arranged so that only one side is readable at one time.
      D.   Spacing. Any off-premises sign of more than 50 square feet of sign
area shall be separated by a minimum of 500 feet from any other off-premises
sign with a sign area greater than 50 square feet, including signs on either
side of a street and including existing signs in other municipalities.
      E.   Maximum height–35 feet above the elevation of the adjacent street,
measured at the street centerline.
      F.   Control of Lighting and Glare. See standards in §
27-507. Lights shall be directed so they do not shine into the eyes of
motorists nor residents of homes. Lighting shall be directed downwards towards
the sign area and shall be turned off between the hours of midnight and 6 a.m.
      G.   Setbacks. No off-premises sign greater than 50 square feet in sign
area shall be located within 250 feet from the lot line of an existing
principal dwelling.
      H.   Condition. The sign shall be maintained in a good and safe
condition, particularly to avoid hazards in high winds. The area around the
sign shall be kept free of debris. If the message of a sign is no longer
intact, it shall be replaced with a solid color or a “for lease” sign.
(Ord. 2014-02, 10/7/2014, §706)
§ 27-707.   General Design, Location and Construction of Signs.
   1.   Setbacks.
      A.   Signs shall not be located within the existing street right-of-way,
except for allowed projecting and sandwich board signs.
      B.   A freestanding illuminated sign shall not be located within 5 feet
from an abutting lot line of principal dwelling in a residential district.
      C.   These setbacks shall not apply to official signs, nameplate signs,
public service signs and directional signs.
   2.   Sight Clearance. No sign shall be located in a way that interferes with
the sight clearance requirements of §
27-803.
   3.   Off-Premises. No signs except permitted off-premise, official,
political or public service signs shall be erected on a property to which it
does not relate.
   4.   Permission of Owner. No sign shall be posted on any property or sign
pole or public utility pole, unless permission has been received by the owner.
   5.   Signs on Trees, Utility Poles and Street Signs. No sign shall be
attached to a utility pole or street sign post, except by a utility or
government agency. A sign shall not be attached to a tree.
   6.   Construction of Signs. Every sign permitted in this Section (other than
temporary and window signs) shall be constructed of durable materials and shall
be kept in good condition and repair. The Zoning Officer shall by written
notice require a property owner or lessee to repair or remove a dilapidated or
unsafe sign within a specified period of time. If such order is not complied
with, the Borough may repair or remove such sign at the expense of such owner
or lessee.
   7.   Wiring of Signs. Signs shall be prohibited that involve electrical
cords laying across parking lots, driveways or sidewalks, except for temporary
Christmas season lighting.
   8.   Banners and Overhanging Signs. Borough Council may approve the hanging
of decorative banners within the street right-of-way (such as from utility
poles or street lights) and may approve a sign overhanging across a street to
advertise a community event or festival. One approval may cover multiple years
for an event that is held annually. Approval from PennDOT may also be needed if
a State road is involved.
(Ord. 2014-02, 10/7/2014, §707)
§ 27-708.   Vehicles Functioning as Signs.
   Any vehicle, trailer or structure to which a sign is affixed in such a
manner that the carrying of such sign(s) no longer is incidental to the primary
purpose of the vehicle, trailer or structure but instead becomes a primary
purpose in itself shall be considered a freestanding sign and shall be subject
to all of the requirements for freestanding signs in the district in which such
vehicle, trailer or structure is located.
(Ord. 2014-02, 10/7/2014, §708)
§ 27-709.   Abandoned or Outdated Signs.
   Signs advertising a use no longer in existence (other than a sign relating
to a building that is clearly temporarily vacant and being offered to new
tenants or for purchase) shall be removed within 180 days of the cessation of
such use.
(Ord. 2014-02, 10/7/2014, §709)
§ 27-710.   Measurement of Signs.
   Measurement of Sign Area.
      A.   Sign area shall include all lettering, wording and accompanying
designs and symbols, together with related background areas on which they are
displayed. One “freestanding sign” may include several signs that are all
attached to one structure, with the total “sign area” being the combined area
of all signs on that side of the sign.
      B.   The sign area shall not include any structural supports that do not
include a message.
      C.   Where the sign consists of individual letters or symbols attached to
or painted directly on a building or window, other than an illuminated
background that is a part of the sign, the sign area shall be the smallest one
or two rectangle(s) or triangle(s) that includes all of the letters and
symbols.
      D.   The maximum sign area of sign shall be for each of two sides of a
sign, provided that only one side of a sign is readable from any location.
      E.   Unless otherwise specified, all square footages in regards to signs
are maximum sizes.
(Ord. 2014-02, 10/7/2014, §710)
§ 27-711.   Illumination of Signs.
   See “Light and Glare Control” in Part 5.
(Ord. 2014-02, 10/7/2014, §711)
§ 27-712.   Nonconforming Signs.
   1.   Signs legally existing at the time of enactment of this Chapter and
which do not conform to the requirements of this Chapter shall be considered
nonconforming signs.
   2.   An existing lawful nonconforming sign that was lawful when it was
initially placed may be replaced with a new sign, provided the new sign is not
more nonconforming in any manner than the previous sign. A nonconforming sign
shall not be expanded in a manner that does not conform to this Chapter.
   3.   Unlawful Signs. If a sign was placed without a required permit by the
Borough, and does not comply with this Chapter, it shall not be considered
lawful, and shall be required to be removed. See the enforcement notice
requirements in Part 1.
(Ord. 2014-02, 10/7/2014, §712)
Part 8
General Regulations
§ 27-801.   Frontage onto Improved Streets; Number of Uses or Buildings;
Minimum Size of Dwellings.
   1.   Frontage Required onto Improved Street. Each proposed new lot, each
land development and each proposed principal building shall be on a lot which
directly abuts a public street, a street proposed to be dedicated to the
Borough by the subdivision plan which created or creates such lot, or a private
street which meets all of the require ments of the Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance. This requirement shall not be met by an “alley.” In the
case of townhouses, manufactured/mobile home park, or apartments, each unit may
have access onto a parking court which then has access onto a public or private
street meeting Borough standards.
   2.   Number of Principal Uses and Principal Buildings per Lot.
      A.   A lot in a C or TC District may include more than one permitted
principal use per lot and/or more than one permitted principal building per
lot, provided that all of the requirements are met for each use and each
building. If differing dimensional requirements apply for different uses on the
lot, then the most restrictive requirement shall apply.
         (1)   For example, if use one requires a 1-acre lot area and use two
on the same lot requires a 2-acre lot area, then the lot shall have a minimum
lot area of 2 acres.
         (2)   The applicant shall submit a site plan that demonstrates that
each structure would meet the requirements of this Chapter.
         (3)   The uses and buildings shall be in common ownership. However, a
condominium form of ownership of individual buildings, with a legally binding
property owners association, may be established if the applicant proves to the
satisfaction of the Zoning Officer, based upon review by the Borough Solicitor,
that there will be appropriate legal mechanisms in place.
      B.   A lot within a residential district shall not include more than one
principal use and shall not include more than one principal building unless
specifically permitted by this Chapter.
         (1)   A manufactured/mobile home park, condominium residential
development or apartment development may include more than one principal
building per lot, provided all other requirements of this Chapter are met. A
condominium form of ownership of individual dwelling units, with a legally
binding homeowners association, may be established if the applicant proves to
the satisfaction of the Zoning Officer, based upon review by the Borough
Solicitor, that there will be appropriate legal mechanisms in place and
compliance with applicable State law.
   3.   Minimum Size of Dwellings. Each dwelling unit shall include a minimum
of 500 square feet of enclosed habitable, indoor and heated floor area, which
shall be primarily above the ground level. This 500 square footage may be
reduced to 400 square feet for each dwelling unit that is permanently legally
restricted to occupancy by at least one person age 55 and older, with no
residents under age 18.
   4.   Maximum Occupancy. No recreational vehicle shall be occupied on a lot
for more than 30 days in a calendar year, except as may be approved within a
campground with suitable central water and sewage service. No mobile/
manufactured home shall be occupied on a lot as a dwelling unless it meets all
of the requirements for a dwelling. A mobile/manufactured home shall not be
used as a storage building, except as may be allowed temporarily during on-site
construction under a Borough construction permit.
(Ord. 2014-02, 10/7/2014, §801)
§ 27-802.   Height Exceptions.
   The maximum structure height specified for each district shall not apply to:
antenna and communications towers that meet the requirements of this Chapter,
water towers, clock or bell towers, steeples and religious symbols attached to
places of worship, utility lines and poles and towers, elevator shafts, rooftop
stairways, wind turbines that comply with this Chapter, skylights, chimneys,
heating/ventilation/air conditional equipment, industrial mechanical equipment
areas that are not occupied by humans, solar energy collection devices, or
other appurtenances usually required to be and customarily placed above the
roof level and not intended for human occupancy. See also definition of
“height” in §
27-202 and provisions in §
27-307.2.
(Ord. 2014-02, 10/7/2014, §802)
§ 27-803.   Special Lot and Setback Requirements, Sight Distance and Buffer
Yards.
   1.   In General.
      A.   No lot, structure or use shall be created or developed in such a way
that it would result in another lot, building or use not being able to meet the
require ments of this Chapter. This includes, but is not limited to: setback
areas, non- impervious areas and off-street parking areas.
      B.   Emergency Access. All uses and structures shall have adequate
provisions for access by emergency vehicles and fire ladders. Such access shall
be maintained in a passable condition by the owner of the lot, or where
applicable by the property- owner association.
   2.   Exceptions to Minimum Lot Areas, Lot Widths and Setbacks.
      A.   Corner Lots. For a corner lot, each setback that abuts a public
street shall be considered a front setback and meet the requirements for
minimum depth of a front setback. See definition of “lot, corner” in §
27-202.
      B.   Projections into Required Setbacks.
         (1)   Cornices, footers, eaves, roof overhangs, sills or other similar
architectural features, exterior stairways, unenclosed fire escapes or other
required means of egress, rain leads, chimneys, slanted exterior doors for
basement access, window awnings, chaise for heating pipes or other similar
structures that do not include space usable by persons may extend or project
into a required setback not more than 3 feet.
         (2)   Exterior steps, stoops, fire escapes, handicapped ramps, and
landings necessary to provide entrance to a building may be located within a
required setback area.
         (3)   For decks and porches, see §
27-307.
      C.   Lot Widths Around Curves. Around the bulb of a cul-de-sac street or
on the outside of the curve of a street with a radius of less than 150 feet,
the minimum lot width at the minimum required building setback line may be
reduced to 60 percent of the width that would otherwise be required.
      D.   Front Setbacks. See Note D at the end of §
27-307.1, which may allow a reduced front setback where adjacent buildings have
smaller existing front setbacks.
   3.   Sight Clearance at Intersections. At the intersection of two streets, a
clear sight triangle shall be provided. Within this triangle, no visual
obstructions shall be allowed between the height of 3 feet and 10 feet above
the ground level, except for fences that are almost entirely transparent fences
(such as chain link), utility posts, mailboxes, single sign posts less than 1
feet in diameter and the trunks of canopy trees. Re-grading shall also not
reduce visibility within the sight clearance triangle. The triangle shall be
measured along the centerline of the streets. Each leg of the triangle shall be
measured 75 feet from the intersection of the centerlines of the travel lanes
of a local or collector street and 150 feet along an arterial street. A third
longer leg shall connect the ends of the two legs to form the triangle.

IMAGES/0-0-0-1153.png]
      A.   However, in place of the above sight triangle, where a local street
intersects a collector or arterial street with a stop sign only at the local
street, the leg of the triangle along the collector or arterial street in each
direction shall be increased to 250 feet and the leg along the local street
shall be decreased to 20 feet back from the edge of the intersecting travel
lane.
      B.   The clear sight triangle shall be kept free of such obstructions in
perpetuity.
      C.   Note: As of 2014, the Comprehensive Plan that includes Yoe Borough
classified Main Street as an arterial street, George Street as a collector
street, and all other streets as local streets.
      D.   Where an alley intersects with a street, a clear sight triangle
shall be required that is 15 feet along the closest cartway of a street and 10
feet long along the centerline of the alley. Where an alley intersects with
another alley, a clear sight triangle shall be required that is 10 feet long
along the centerlines of both alleys. For example, this sight triangle may
require that a rear garage be set back from a corner or that a solid fence be
angled near the intersection to avoid intruding into the sight triangle.
      E.   For driveway sight clearance, see §
27-603.4.
   4.   Buffers and Planting Screening.
      A.   All subdivisions and land developments shall be landscaped with the
following two components:
         (1)   Property line buffers, which act to integrate new development
with its surroundings and to separate incompatible land uses.
         (2)   Site element screens, which act to minimize or eliminate views
to certain site elements located within 100 feet of property lines or street
rights- of-way (either public or private).
      B.   The following requirements are minimum standards, and additional
plant material, berms, or architectural elements may be included at the
developer’s discretion.
      C.   Property Line Buffer Requirements.
         (1)   Property line buffers shall be required for all proposed
development, in accordance with this Section.
         (2)   All on-site investigation by the applicant shall determine the
adjacent land uses along each property boundary.
         (3)   In the case of vacant land, the existing zoning district shall
be used.
         (4)   Where more than one use is proposed on a lot, the more
restrictive buffer requirement shall apply.
         (5)   The amount and type of plant material required shall be
determined by the intensity of the proposed land use and the adjacent use, as
provided below:
            (a)   Where a new single-family attached building is proposed
adjacent to an existing single-family detached dwelling, a low intensity buffer
is required.
            (b)   Where a new multi-family/apartment building or rooming house
is proposed adjacent to an existing single-family detached dwelling, a medium
intensity buffer is required.
            (c)   Where a new or expanded principal commercial use or an off-
street parking area of five or more new motor vehicle parking spaces is
proposed adjacent to an existing principal residential use, a medium intensity
buffer is required. For the purposes of this Section, a nursing home, personal
care center or similar use shall be considered to be a residential use.
            (d)   Where a new or expanded principal industrial use or related
trucking or industrial processing area is proposed adjacent to an existing
principal residential use, a high intensity buffer is required.
            (e)   If an area is routinely used for the loading or unloading or
overnight parking of one or more tractor-trailer trucks within 200 feet of an
existing principal residential use, then a high intensity buffer is required.
            (f)   Where a new electric sub-station or sewage pump station is
proposed adjacent to an existing principal residential use, a medium intensity
buffer is required.
            (g)   If an area is routinely used for the loading or unloading or
overnight parking of one or more tractor-trailer trucks or for industrial
outdoor storage within 100 feet of a public street and is visible from that
street, a low intensity buffer is required.
            (h)   If two or more inoperable motor vehicles or vehicles that do
not display current registration and/or safety inspection stickers are kept on
a lot for more than 7 days within view of a public street or a dwelling on
another lot, they shall be screened from view of the dwelling or street by a
high intensity buffer or by a well-maintained solid fence constructed of wood,
vinyl or similar materials with a minimum height of 6 feet.
         (6)   Buffer Area Location and Dimensions.
            (a)   A buffer area of not less than 20 feet in width shall be
established along all property lines of a lot of a use required to provide a
buffer under this Section, unless otherwise specified. The Zoning Officer may
allow the width to be reduced to 8 feet in the TC District where the applicant
proves that a 20 feet width is not feasible.
            (b)   The buffer area shall not include trash dumpsters or
driveways, except at necessary perpendicular crossings.
            (c)   The buffer area shall be a continuous pervious planting bed
consisting of trees and shrubs, with grass or other vegetative ground cover.
            (d)   Parking is not permitted within the buffer area. A pedestrian
trail may be located in a buffer area.
            (e)   Site element screens are permitted within the buffer area.
            (f)   Hard-surfaced stormwater basins are not permitted within the
buffer area.
            (g)   Wetlands are permitted within the buffer area.
         (7)   Plant Material Quantities and Types. For every 100 linear feet
of property line to be buffered, the following minimum quantities and types of
plant material shall be required:
            (a)   Low intensity–one canopy tree and two ornamental trees. (One
evergreen tree may be substituted for one of the required ornamental trees.)
            (b)   Medium intensity–one canopy tree, two ornamental trees, two
evergreen trees, and five shrubs.
            (c)   High intensity–an average of one evergreen tree shall be
placed for each 8 feet of length of the area being buffered, with the trees
being staggered so that the center of each tree is at least 10 feet diagonally
away from each other tree to provide room for future growth and more complete
buffering. In addition, an average of two ornamental trees and one canopy tree
shall be provided for every 100 feet of property line length to be buffered.
               1)   Such landscaping may be combined with an earth berm. This
berm should have an average minimum height of 5 feet and maximum side slopes of
3:1, except that a retaining wall may be used on a commercial or industrial
side.
               2)   If landscaping is combined with a berm, at least 60 percent
of the landscaping shall be placed on the outside slope of the berm.
Landscaping may be placed on the top of the berm if there will be proper
moisture at the top of the berm. Any other required landscap ing shall be
placed between the berm and the adjacent street or lot line.
         (8)   Design Criteria.
            (a)   The required plant material shall be distributed over the
entire length and width of the buffer area.
            (b)   Buffer plant material may be arranged symmetrically (formal)
or asymmetrically (informal) and may be grouped to form plant clusters.
However, informal groupings that reflect a more natural character are
encouraged.
            (c)   Plants shall be spaced to provide optimum growing conditions.
            (d)   All plant materials shall meet the requirements of this
Chapter.
            (e)   A variety of tree species is required according to the
following:
 
Number of Trees Minimum Number of Tree Species Maximum Percent of Any One
                                               Species
0 to 5          1                              100
6 to 15         2                              50
16 to 30        3                              40
31 to 50        4                              30
51 plus         6                              20
 
   (9)   If an applicant proposes to preserve existing healthy trees, shrubs or
woodlands, such plants may be approved by the Borough to meet part or all of
the required plant material. The minimum quantities and/or visual effect of the
existing vegetation shall be equal to or exceed that of the required buffer.
         (10)   Where buffering is required to be provided by more than one
Section of the Borough ordinances and the provisions of such Sections differ,
the requirements that will provide the most buffering shall apply.
         (11)   The following species of trees and other plants are not allowed
to be used to meet Borough requirements:
            (a)   Species listed officially as “invasive species” by the State
Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.
            (b)   Paper/White Birch.

visual impact shall be screened according to the requirements for the most
similar elements.
         (3)   The site element screen shall be placed between the site element
and the property line and shall be designed to block views from a street and
dwelling to the maximum extent possible. The screen shall surround the element
as much as practical without impeding the functions on the lot or encroaching
on sight clearance triangles.
         (4)   Design of Alternative Screen Types. The following types of
screens shall be used where specified in paragraph .D(1) above:
            (a)   Screen Type No. 1, Evergreen or Deciduous Shrubs. Shrubs

(Ord. 2014-02, 10/7/2014, §804)
§ 27-805.   Nonconformities.
   1.   Proof and Registration of Nonconformities. It shall be the
responsibility of, with the burden of proof upon a party asserting a
nonconformity to provide the evidence that it is lawful. A property owner may
request a written statement of nonconformity from the Zoning Officer after
providing sufficient evidence.
   2.   Continuation of Nonconformities.
      A.   A lawful nonconforming use, structure or lot as defined by this
Chapter may be continued and may be sold and continued by new owners.
      B.   Any expansion of, construction upon or change in use of a
nonconformity shall only occur in conformance with this Section.
      C.   If an existing use was not lawfully established, it shall not have
any right to continue as a nonconforming use.
   3.   Expansion of or Construction Involving Nonconformities. The following
shall apply, unless the structure is approved under subsection .4.
      A.   Nonconforming Structure.
         (1)   The Zoning Officer shall permit a nonconforming structure to be
reconstructed or expanded provided:
            (a)   That such action will not increase the severity or amount of
the nonconformity (such as the area of the building extending into the required
setback) or create any new nonconformity.
            (b)   That any expanded area will comply with the applicable
setbacks in that district and other requirements of this Chapter, except as may
be allowed under paragraph .B(3) below.
         (2)   In the case of a nonconforming structure which is used by a
noncon forming use, any expansion shall also meet the requirements of this
Section regarding nonconforming uses.
      B.   Nonconforming Lots.
         (1)   Permitted Construction on a Nonconforming Lot. A single
permitted by right principal use and its customary accessory uses may be
constructed, reconstructed or expanded on a nonconforming lot provided all of
the following additional requirements are met:
            (a)   The lot must be a lawful nonconforming lot of record.
            (b)   Minimum setback requirements shall be met, except as is
allowed in subparagraph (3) below.
            (c)   State and Federal wetland regulations shall be met.
            (d)   If a septic or well is used, the requirements for such shall
be met.
         (2)   Lot Width. The fact that an existing lawful lot of record does
not meet the minimum lot width requirements of this Chapter shall not by itself
cause such lot to be considered to be a nonconforming lot.
         (3)   Reduction of Side Setbacks. On an existing lawful lot with a
noncon forming width, as a special exception, the Zoning Hearing Board may
approve a reduction of up to 50 percent in each side setback if the applicant
proves such reduction is necessary to allow a customary addition to an existing
dwelling, a replacement of an existing undersized dwelling with a new dwelling,
or to avoid the construction of a new dwelling that would be inconsistent with
the building width of adjacent dwellings. This subsection shall not allow a
reduction in setback to increase the number of dwelling units on the lot,
except for a unit for care of relative.
         (4)   Where part of an existing one family dwelling has side setback
that is smaller than would normally be required, other parts of that dwelling
may be expanded on that same side, provided that the extension does not go
beyond the side setback that already exists on that side.
      C.   Expansion of a Nonconforming Nonresidential Use. A nonconforming use
or a building used by a nonconforming use shall only be expanded if there is
compliance with the following provisions:
         (1)   An expansion of more than 5 percent in total building floor area
shall require special exception approval from the Zoning Hearing Board under
Part 1.
         (2)   Such reconstruction or expansion shall be only upon the same lot
that the nonconforming use was located upon at the time the use became noncon
forming.
         (3)   The (a) total building floor area used by a nonconforming use or
the (b) total land area covered by the nonconforming use, whichever is more
restrictive, shall not be increased by greater than 35 percent beyond what
existed in the nonconforming use at the time the use first became noncon
forming.
            (a)   The above maximum increase shall be measured in aggregate
over the entire life of the nonconformity. All expansions of the noncon forming
use and/or building(s) that occurred since the use originally became
nonconforming shall count towards the above maximum increase.
         (4)   Any expansion of a nonconforming use shall meet the required
setbacks and other requirements of this Chapter, unless the Zoning Hearing
Board grants a variance.
      D.   Expansion of a Nonconforming Residential Use. An existing
nonconforming residential use may be expanded as a permitted by right use
provided that: (1) the number of dwelling units or rooming house units are not
increased, (2) the expansion meets all applicable setbacks, (3) no new types of
nonconformities are created and (4) a nonconformity is not made more severe.
      E.   Nonconforming Sign. The provisions of this Chapter shall not provide
a right to expand or extend a nonconforming sign. Instead, any expansions or
extensions of a nonconforming sign shall comply with this Chapter. See also §
27-707.
   4.   Damaged or Destroyed Nonconformities. A nonconforming structure or
nonconforming use that has been destroyed or damaged may be rebuilt in a noncon
forming fashion only if: (A) the application for a building permit is submitted
within 12 months after the date of damage or destruction, (B) work begins in
earnest within 12 months after the building permit is issued and continues, and
(C) no nonconformity may be newly created or increased by any reconstruction.
The property shall be properly secured during such time in such a way to keep
out trespassers and to avoid harm to neighboring properties. See the Property
Maintenance Code [
Chapter 5, Part 2].
   5.   Abandonment of a Nonconformity.
      A.   If a nonconforming use of a building or land is discontinued, razed,
removed or abandoned for 12 or more months, subsequent use of such building or
land shall conform with the regulations of the district in which it is located,
except:
         (1)   As provided for in the “damaged or destroyed nonconformities”
provisions of subsection .4.
      B.   The applicant shall be responsible to provide clear and convincing
evidence that the nonconformity was not abandoned.
      C.   An existing lawful separate dwelling unit may be unrented for any
period of time without being considered “abandoned” under this Chapter.
   6.   Changes from One Nonconforming Use to Another.
      A.   Once changed to a conforming use, a structure or land shall not
revert to a nonconforming use.
      B.   A nonconforming use may be changed to a different nonconforming use
only if approved as a special exception by the Zoning Hearing Board. However,
special exception approval is not needed for a simple change within an existing
building from one lawful nonconforming retail store use to another retail store
use or from one lawful nonconforming personal service use to another personal
service use provided that the new use complies with any Zoning Hearing Board
conditions that applied to the previous use and is not more objectionable in
external effects than the previous use.
      C.   Where special exception approval is required for a change of a
noncon forming use, the Board shall determine whether the applicant has
provided sufficient proof to show that the proposed new use will be equal or
less objection able in external effects than the preexisting nonconforming use
with regard to:
         (1)   Traffic safety and generation (especially truck traffic).
         (2)   Noise, dust, fumes, vapors, gases, odor, glare, vibration, fire,
hazardous substances, and explosive hazards.
         (3)   Amount and character of outdoor storage.
         (4)   Hours of operation if the use would be close to dwellings.
         (5)   Compatibility with the character of the surrounding area.
      D.   A nonconforming use shall not be changed to a nonconforming adult
use.
   7.   District Changes. Any uses, structures or lots that become
nonconforming because of a zoning district change shall be regulated under this
Section on noncon formities.
(Ord. 2014-02, 10/7/2014, §805)
§ 27-806.   Dumpster Screening and Location.
   1.   See §
27-803.4.D for screening requirements. Site plans submitted to the Borough
shall show the proposed location of any garbage dumpsters. The Borough may
require that such proposed location be modified to provide compatibility with
adjacent uses.
   2.   The Borough staff may issue a permit to place a temporary dumpster
within a street right-of-way where necessary for on-site work, provided such
dumpster does not obstruct traffic or safe sight distances. A maximum time
period shall be established on the permit.
(Ord. 2014-02, 10/7/2014, §806)
§ 27-807.   Portable Storage Containers.
   1.   This Section shall apply to a portable storage container that is kept
outside of a building and which has a length greater than 10 feet and which is
not currently attached to a motor vehicle or railroad and which is not part of
a permitted industrial use.
   2.   The following regulations shall apply on a principally residential lot:
      A.   A portable storage container shall not be kept on a principally
residential lot for a total of more than 4 months in any 2-year period, unless
it is being used as part of an active construction permit for the lot. A
temporary zoning permit shall be required if the portable storage container is
kept on the lot for more than 30 days.
      B.   A maximum of one portable storage container shall be allowed per
lot.
   3.   On a lot that is not a principally residential lot, any portable
storage container that is kept on a lot for more than 30 days shall meet the
setbacks that apply to a principal building, unless it is necessary to
temporarily hold materials for on-site construction.
   4.   The following shall apply to any portable storage container:
      A.   The container shall not obstruct safe sight distances at
intersections.
      B.   The container shall not obstruct travel lanes of a street or a
public sidewalk.
      C.   The container shall only be allowed to be placed within a street
right-of- way if a permit for such placement is issued by the Borough. Such
permit shall specify a maximum number of days during which the container may be
placed within the right-of-way.
      D.   The container shall not be used to store hazardous, explosive or
toxic substances or putrescent garbage.
      E.   A facility that stores portable storage containers that have been
leased by others or are available for lease shall be considered a warehouse.
