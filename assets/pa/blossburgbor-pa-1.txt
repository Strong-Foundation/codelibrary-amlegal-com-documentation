(A.O.)
§1-104.   Headings.
   Chapter, Subchapter, Part, Subpart, Section, Subsection, Paragraph,
Subparagraph, Clause, and Subclause headings contained in the Code may not be
deemed to govern, limit, modify or affect the scope, meaning or intent of the
Code. The headings of Sections, Subsections or other divisions of this Code are
intended as mere captions to indicate the contents of the Section, Subsection
or other division and shall not be deemed to be taken as titles of such
Section, Subsection or other division, nor as any part of said Section,
Subsection or other division unless expressly so provided.
(A.O.)
§1-105.   Tenses, Gender and Number.
   Except as may be otherwise stated in any provision of this Code, the present
tense includes the past and future tenses, and the future the present; the
masculine gender includes the feminine and neuter, the feminine includes the
masculine and neuter, and the neuter includes the masculine and feminine; and
the singular includes the plural, and the plural the singular.
(A.O.)
§1-106.   Construction.
   1.   Except as may be otherwise specifically provided by any provision of
this Code, the Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S.A. §1501 et seq.,
shall be applied in construing this Code.
   2.   Effect of Repeal or Expiration of Code Section.
      A.   The repeal of a Code Section or ordinance, or its expiration by
virtue of any provision contained therein, shall not affect any right accrued
or any offense committed, any penalty or punishment incurred, or any proceeding
commenced before the repeal took effect or the ordinance expired.
      B.   When any ordinance repealing a former Code Section, ordinance,
clause or provision shall itself be repealed, such repeal shall not be
construed to revive such former Code Section, ordinance, clause or provision,
unless it shall be expressly so provided.
   3.   Saving Clause. The provisions of this Code, so far as they are the same
as those ordinances and regulations in force immediately prior to the adoption
of this Code, are intended as a continuation of such ordinances, resolutions
and regulations and not as a new enactment. The provisions of this Code shall
not affect any suit or prosecution pending or to be instituted to enforce any
of the prior ordinances or regulations. Except as specifically stated in this
Code or in the ordinance adopting this consolidation, codification and revision
of the ordinances and regulations, it is the intention of the Borough Council
that no ordinance or regulation of the Borough be amended, revised or repealed
by implication.
   4.   Resolutions. The provisions of this Code of Ordinances may contain
resolutions, that is, actions of the Borough Council (in written form and
designated "resolution”) which did not require prior public notice in
accordance with the provisions of the Borough Code, 53 P.S. §45101 et seq., at
the time of their passage by the Borough Council. Such "resolutions” are
included herein for ease of reference and the Borough Council does not intend
by their inclusion herein to require prior public notice before amending,
revising or repealing such resolution or resolutions as may have been included
herein in the future. It is the intention of the Borough Council that such
actions of the Borough Council that may be included in this Code and
specifically cited and designated as a resolution shall not become an ordinance
(requiring prior public notice before amendment, revision or repeal) by the
simple fact of inclusion in this Code.
(A.O.)
§1-107.   Normal Numbering.
   1.   Chapters. Chapters are numbered sequentially in Arabic throughout this
Code.
   2.   Parts. Parts are numbered sequentially in Arabic throughout this Code.
   3.   Whenever other divisions are necessary, Chapters shall be divided into
Subchapters, Parts into Subparts and designated with the Chapter or Part number
followed by a capital letter. For instance, Chapter 1 may be divided into
Subchapters 1A and 1B.
   4.   Sections. Sections are numbered sequentially throughout a Chapter and a
Part such that the first number or numbers is the Chapter number, followed by a
hyphen, followed by the Part number, followed by the Section number within the
Part. For example, "§1-101" designates Chapter 1, Part 1, Section 1. Similarly,
“§27-305" designates Chapter 27, Part 3, Section 5.
   5.   Internal Divisions of Sections. Whenever internal divisions are
necessary, Sections shall be divided into Subsections, Subsections into
Paragraphs, Paragraphs into Subparagraphs, Subparagraphs into Clauses, and
Clauses into Subclauses, and Subclauses into Items, designated as follows:
   1.   Subsection.
   A.   Paragraph.
   (1)   Subparagraph.
   (a)   Clause.
   1)   Subclause.
   a)   Item.
   i.   Subitem.
(A.O.)
§1-108.   Special Numbering Problems.
   1.   Addition of New Units Between Existing Units. If it becomes necessary
to introduce a new Chapter, Part or Section between existing Chapters, Parts or
Sections, the new Chapter, Part or Section shall be designated by the addition
of a capital letter suffix to the preceding Chapter, Part or Section number.
Thus, a Chapter introduced between Chapters 5 and 6 would be Chapter 5A and
Sections in that Chapter would be numbered, for instance, “§5A-101.” If it
becomes necessary to introduce a Part between existing Parts 5 and 6 the new
Part would be Part 5A and Sections in that Part would be numbered, for
instance, “§5-5A01.” A new Section introduced between existing Sections 5 and 6
would be “§5-105A.” When a number of new Parts or Sections have been introduced
the Chapter or Part shall be renumbered.
   2.   If it becomes necessary to introduce a Subsection between Subsections,
for instance, Subsections .5 and .6, the new Subsection would be numbered
Subsection .5-A.
   3.   If it becomes necessary to introduce a unit smaller than a Subsection
between existing units, the entire Subsection shall be revised and renumbered.
   4.   Vacated Numbers. Whenever a number is vacated by a revocation or
repeal, the remaining elements in the overall unit shall retain their old
numbers until the overall unit is completely revised. Prior to revision, the
vacated number may be marked: “[Reserved].”
(A.O.)
§1-109.   Amending Code.
   1.   All ordinances passed subsequent to the adoption of this Code which
amend, repeal or in any way affect this Code shall be numbered in accordance
with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion herein. In the
case of repealed Chapters, Parts, Sections, Paragraphs, Clauses or other part
or provision hereof, by subsequent ordinance, such repealed portions may be
excluded from this Code by omission from reprinted pages affected thereby. The
subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed, or omitted in the case of
repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such
time as this Code and subsequent ordinances omitted are readopted as a new Code
by the Borough Council.
   2.   Amendment to any provision of this Code shall be made by specific
reference to the Chapter, Part, Section and/or Subsection number of this Code
in the following language:
      A.   Amendment or Revision. "Chapter        , Part        , Section
       , Subsection        , is hereby amended (revised) to read as follows . .
. .” The amended or revised provisions may then be set out in full as desired.
      B.   Addition. "Chapter        , Part        , Section        ,
Subsection        , is hereby amended by the addition of the following . . . .”
The new provision shall then be set out in full as desired.
      C.   Repeal. "Chapter        , Part       , Section        , Subsection
       , is hereby repealed in its entirety.”
   3.   It is the intention of the Borough Council that the numbering scheme of
this Code be adhered to in enacting future ordinances. In the event that any
ordinance or other enactment be adopted which does not conform to the numbering
system of this Code, it is the intention of the Borough Council that such
enactment be renumbered in the process of supplementing, revising or updating
this Code to conform to the numbering scheme of this Code. The Borough Council
hereby acknowledges and confirms that the numbering scheme herein is for ease
of reference and that the renumbering of any enactment when added to this Code
shall not in any manner affect the validity of said enactment.
(A.O.)
§1-110.   Altering Code.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to change or amend by addition or
deletion any part or portion of this Code, or to insert or delete pages or
portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner
whatsoever, except by ordinance or resolution or other official act of the
Borough Council.
(A.O.)
§1-111.   Penalties.
   1.   Penalty Where No Penalty Provided. Whenever in this Code or in any
ordinance of the Borough any act is prohibited or is declared to be unlawful,
or whenever in this Code or other ordinance the doing of any act is declared to
be unlawful, and no specific penalty is provided therefor:
      A.   Violations of Health, Safety and Welfare Provisions. For violations
of ordinances adopting building, housing, property maintenance, health, fire or
public safety codes; and for ordinances regulating water services, water
pollution, air pollution and noise, the following penalty shall be provided:
         (1)   Any person, firm or corporation who shall violate any provision
of this Part, upon conviction thereof in an action brought before a magisterial
district judge in the manner provided for the enforcement of summary offenses
under the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, shall be sentenced to pay a
fine of not more than $1,000 plus costs together with reasonable attorney fees
and, in default of payment of said fine and costs, to a term of imprisonment
not to exceed 90 days. Each day that a violation of this Part continues or each
Section of this Part which shall be found to have been violated shall
constitute a separate offense.
      B.   Other Violations. All other penalties, except for penalties in
Chapter 15, “Motor Vehicles and Traffic” (based on the Vehicle Code, 75
Pa.C.S.A. §101 et seq.), penalties and ordinances adopted under the authority
of the Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §10101 et seq., earned income tax
ordinances adopted under the Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. §6913, and
ordinances adopted under authority of the Sewage Facilities Act, 35 P.S. §750.1
et seq., should provide, generally:
         (1)   Any person, partnership, or corporation who or which has
violated or permitted the violation of the provisions of this Part, upon being
found liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the
Borough, shall pay a judgment of not more than $600 plus all court costs and
reasonable attorney fees. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or
payable until the date of the determination of a violation by a magisterial
district judge. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment,
the Borough may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil
procedure. Each day that a violation continues or each Section of this Part
which shall be found to have been violated shall constitute a separate
violation.
   2.   The imposition of a penalty under the provisions of this Code shall not
prevent the revocation of any permit or license or the taking of other punitive
or remedial action where called for or permitted under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the United States of America. In addition, the
Borough may institute injunctive, mandamus or any other appropriate action or
proceeding at law or in equity for the enforcement of this Code. Any court of
competent jurisdiction shall have the right to issue restraining orders,
temporary or permanent injunctions, mandamus, or other appropriate forms of
remedy or relief.

   1.   No insurance company, association or exchange (hereinafter “insurer”)
doing business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall pay a claim of a named
insured for fire damage to a structure located within the Borough where the
amount recoverable for the fire loss to the structure under all policies
exceeds $7,500, unless the insurer is furnished by the Borough Treasurer with a
certificate pursuant to 508(b) of the Insurance Company Law of 1921, as amended
by Act 98 of 1992 and Act 93 of 1994 (collectively, the “Act”) and unless there
is compliance with the procedures set forth in 508(c) and (d) of the Act.
   2.   Where there are delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties or user
charges against the property (“municipal claims”), or there are expenses which
the Borough has incurred as a cost for the removal, repair or securing of a
building or other structure on the property (collectively “municipal
expenses”), the Secretary/Treasurer or such official’s designee of the Borough
shall immediately render a bill for such work, if he has not already done so.
Upon written request of the named insured specifying the tax description of the
property, the name and address of the insurer and the date of receipt by the
insurer of a loss report of the claim, the Treasurer shall furnish a
certificate within 14 working days after the request, to the insurer, a
certificate (or at his discretion an oral notice confirmed in writing) either:
      A.   Stating that there are no unpaid municipal claims or municipal
expenses against the property.
      B.   Specifying the nature and amount of such claims or expenses,
accompanied by a bill for such amounts.
      C.   Taxes, assessments, penalties and user charges shall be deemed
delinquent for this purpose if a lien could have been filed for such claims
under applicable law. Upon receipt of a certificate and bill pursuant to
subsection .2.A of this Section, the insurer shall transfer to the Treasurer an
amount from the insurance proceeds sufficient to pay such sums prior to making
payment to the named insured, subject to the provisions of subsection .3
hereof.
   3.   When all municipal claims and municipal expenses have been paid
pursuant to subsection .2 of this Section, or where the Treasurer has issued a
certificate described in subsection .2.A indicating that there are no municipal
claims or municipal expenses against the property, the insurer shall pay the
claim of the named insured; provided, however, that if the loss agreed upon by
the named insured and the insurer equals or exceeds 60 percent of the aggregate
limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or structure,
the following procedures must be followed:
      A.   The insurer shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the
Treasurer, in the aggregate, $2,000 for each $15,000 of such claim or fraction
thereof.   
      B.   If at the time a loss report is submitted by the insured, such
insured has submitted to the insurer, with a copy to the Borough, a
contractor’s signed estimate of the cost of removing, repairing or securing the
building or other structure in an amount less than the amount calculated under
the foregoing transfer formula, the insurer shall transfer to the Treasurer
from the insurance proceeds the amount specified in the estimate. If there is
more than one insurer, the transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by
all insurers insuring the building or other structure.
      C.   Upon receipt of the above described portion of the insurance
proceeds, the Treasurer shall do the following:
         (1)   Place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used solely as
security against the total municipal expenses anticipated by the Borough to be
required in removing, repairing or securing the building or structure as
required by this Part. Such costs shall include, without limitation, any
engineering, legal or administrative costs incurred by the Borough in
connection with such removal, repair or securing or any proceedings related
thereto.
         (2)   Mail to the named insured, at the address received from the
insurer, a notice the proceeds have been received by the Borough and that the
proce dures under this subsection shall be followed.
         (3)   After the transfer, the named insured may submit to the Borough
a contractor’s signed estimate of the cost of removing, repairing or securing
the building or other structure, in which event the Treasurer shall, if such
estimate is deemed by the Treasurer to be reasonable, return to the insured the
amount of the funds transferred to the Borough in excess of that required to
pay the municipal expenses; provided, the Borough has not commenced to remove,
repair or secure the building or other structure, in which case the Borough
will complete the work.
         (4)   Pay to the Borough Secretary/Treasurer or such official’s
designee for reimbursement to the Borough general fund, the amount of the
municipal expenses paid by the Borough.
         (5)   Pay the remaining balance in the fund (without interest) to the
named insured upon receipt of a certificate issued by the Borough Secretary/
Treasurer or such official’s designee that the repair, removal or securing of
the building or other structure has been completed in accordance with all
applicable codes and regulations of the Borough.
         (6)   Nothing in this Section shall be construed to limit the ability
of the Borough to recover any deficiency in the amount of municipal claims or
municipal expenses recovered pursuant to this Part, or to insurance proceeds,
by an action at law or in equity to enforce the codes of the Borough or to
enter into an agreement with the named insured with regard to such other dispo
sition of the proceeds as the Borough may deem responsible.
(A.O.)
§1-502.   Limits of Liability.
   Nothing in this Part shall be construed to make an insurance company,
association or exchange liable for any amount in excess of proceeds payable
under its insurance policy or for any other act performed pursuant to this Part
or to make this Borough, any Borough official, a municipality or public
official an insured under a policy of insurance or to create an obligation to
pay delinquent property taxes or unpaid removal liens or expenses other than as
provided in this Part.
(A.O.)
§1-503.   Insurance Company Rights Reserved.

Property Address Numbering and Private Street Name Signage
§4-101.   Street Number Regulations.
   The owners of all buildings or structure/property within the Borough to
which street numbers have been assigned shall have the street number
prominently displayed at all times in accordance with the following standards.
For purposes of this Part a “street number” is an address number established in
accordance with the County-wide 911 Public Safety System with reference to the
adjacent road or street, assigned and given to a particular building or
structure/property by Tioga County 911 and the United States Postal Service.
For specific sections of roadways with an existing addressing system that is
approved by Tioga County 911, the “street number” is the retained street number
in the existing addressing system that is established in conjunction with the
County Addressing Project.
   A.   Each building to which a street number has been assigned shall have a
street number displayed upon the building except for buildings which are
located a distance greater than 200 feet from the nearest edge of the cartway
of the public roadway or upon which signage cannot be attached which would be
readable from the nearest public roadway by reason of natural or man-made
obstructions, the owner of said structure/property shall be required to provide
posted street number signage at least 20 feet and not more than 30 feet from
the nearest edge of the cartway of the public or private roadway, which post
shall have affixed thereon the street number which has been assigned to the
building.
   B.   The assigned street numbers shall be either affixed directly to the
building or post or displayed on a sign affixed to the building or post. The
street number shall be displayed in such a manner that the numbers will
contrast in color with the background and will be observed and readable from
the nearest public or private roadway. All numbers shall be in standard Arabic
numerals, not less than 4 inches in height and not less than ½ inch in stroke
width. It is recommended that the numbers be reflective for greater nighttime
visibility. [A.O.]
   C.   If, for any reason the street number of a particular building is not
readily identifiable by posted signage along the roadway whether due to the
proximity of multiple buildings with different street numbers or some other
reason, the street number should be affixed to the building as well as posted
by the road. Similarly, if a single building has multiple street numbers or
apartment numbers such as professional buildings or apartments, a building
directory should be posted at the main entrance of the building.

owner whose residence or business abuts said private drive or roadway shall, in
addition to the other requirements set forth in this Part install a sign, if
not installed by the Borough, which identifies the private road or private
drive name as adopted by the Borough, with said signage to be placed at the
entrance where the private road or private drive intersects with the public
roadway, but not creating an obstruction to visibility of motorists. The road
sign stall meet Pennsylvania Department of Transportation regulations for size,
placement and be brown with white reflective letters.

§4-103.   Prohibited Activity.
   It shall be unlawful to cover, conceal, obstruct, destroy, remove, deface or
vandalize any street number or road/street name sign or placard, installed or
displayed pursuant to and in accordance with the requirements of this Part.
(Ord. 400, 3/8/2004, §3)
§4-104.   Enforcement.
    Once determined that a building or structure/property owner has not
complied with the street numbering or road name signage regulations of this
Part, the Borough Council or their designated representative, with Borough
Council consent, may pursue any of the following enforcement remedies:
   A.   The Borough Council may provide written notice to the owners,
occupants, and other persons in possession of building or structure/property
which has not been numbered in accordance with these regulations, of the
violation and the need to comply.
   B.   In the event that persons persist in refusing to comply with these
regulations despite notices to do so, the Borough Council may issue a written
order directing the owners, occupants or others in possession of the building
or structure/property in violation of this Part to comply with the applicable
requirements of this Part. Any person who is aggrieved by any order issued
pursuant to this Part may appeal to the Borough Council by filing a written
notice of appeal to the office of the Borough Secretary within 10 days of the
date of the subject order or notice.
   C.   In the event the structure/property owners or occupants or possessors
fail or refuse to take action in accordance with the notices and an order
issued pursuant to this Part, the Borough Council may provide the signage, as
necessary, in order to bring the structure/property owner into compliance with
the standards promulgated in this Part. The Borough may recover the cost of
materials and labor for the purchase and installation of signage from the
structure/property owners, occupants or possessors reasonable administrative
fees, interest or other charges allowed by law. In the event the owners,
occupants or possessors of the subject structure/property fail to pay the loss
of such installation as determined and approved then the Borough may institute
proceedings at law to collect the full cost together with all penalties,
interest, fees, and other charges against the premises and the owners thereof
and collect same as a municipal lien or may take other action to collect these
sums as may be permitted by law.
(Ord. 400, 3/8/2004, §4)
§4-105.   Penalty for Violation.
   Any person who shall be found to have engaged in the prohibited unlawful
conduct as set for in §
4-103 of this Part or who shall willfully fail to comply with any order to
comply with the street numbering regulations, upon conviction thereof in an
action brought before a magisterial district judge in the manner provided for
the enforcement of summary offenses under the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal
Procedure, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not less than $100 nor more than
$1,000 plus costs together with reasonable attorney fees and, in default of
payment of said fine and costs, to a term of imprisonment not to exceed 90
days. Each day that a violation of this Part continues or each Section of this
Part which shall be found to have been violated shall constitute a separate
offense.

Statutory Authorization
§8-101.   Statutory Authorization.
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage of
the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978, 32 P.S. § 679.101 et seq.,
delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain
management regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general
welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Council of the Borough of Blossburg
does hereby order as follows.
(A.O.; as amended by Ord. 441, 6/10/2015)
Part 2
General Provisions
§8-201.   Intent.
   The intent of this Chapter is to:
   A.   Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
   B.   Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in
order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
   C.   Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and natural
drainage.
   D.   Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units, and its residents, by preventing excessive development in areas subject
to flooding.
   E.   Comply with Federal and State floodplain management requirements.
(A.O.; as amended by Ord. 441, 6/10/2015)
§8-202.   Applicability.
   1.   It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or
corporation to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or
development anywhere within the Borough of Blossburg unless a permit has been
obtained from the Floodplain Administrator.
   2.   A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing buildings
or structures.
(A.O.; as amended by Ord. 441, 6/10/2015)
§8-203.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.
   This Chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in
effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance provisions
shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those provisions are
more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of
this Chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
(A.O.; as amended by Ord. 441, 6/10/2015)
§8-204.   Severability.
   If any Section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this
Chapter shall be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such a decision
shall not affect the remaining portions of this Chapter, which shall remain in
full force and effect, and for this purpose the provisions of this Chapter are
hereby declared to be severable.
(A.O.; as amended by Ord. 441, 6/10/2015)
§8-205.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
   1.   The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this Chapter
is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on acceptable
engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be
increased by man- made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings
restricted by debris. This Chapter does not imply that areas outside any
identified floodplain areas, or that land uses permitted within such areas will
be free from flooding or flood damages.
   2.   This Chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Borough of
Blossburg or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result
from reliance on this Chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
there under.
(A.O.; as amended by Ord. 441, 6/10/2015)

Part 4
Identification of Floodplain Areas
§8-401.   Identification.
   1.   A.   The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of Borough of
Blossburg, classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs)
dated July 16, 2015 and issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof, including all digital data
developed as part of the Flood Insurance Studyand,
      B.   Any community identified flood hazard areas.
   2.   The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and
amendments are hereby adopted by Borough of Blossburg and declared to be a part
of this Chapter.
(A.O.; as amended by Ord. 441, 6/10/2015)
§8-402.   Description and Special Requirements of Identified Floodplain Areas.
   The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific
areas:
      A.   The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation by more than 1 foot
at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas which have been
identified in other available studies or sources of information for those
Special Flood Hazard Areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS and
FIRM.
         1.   Any encroachments whatsoever shall be prohibited unless it has
been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in
accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during
the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
         2.   No new construction or development shall be allowed, unless a
permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection Regional
Office.
      B.   The AE Area /District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone
on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided.
         1.   The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for
which base flood elevations have been provided and a floodway has been
delineated.
      C.   The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as Zone A on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base flood
elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and floodway
information from other Federal, State, or other applicable sources shall be
used when available. Where other acceptable information is not available, the
base flood elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on
the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site.
         In lieu of the above, the Borough of Blossburg may require the
applicant to determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by
professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall
certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted
technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted
in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the municipality.
      D.   Community identified flood hazard areas shall be those areas where
the Borough of Blossburg has identified local flood hazard or ponding areas, as
delineated and adopted on a “Local Flood Hazard Map” using best available
topographic data and locally derived information such as flood of record,
historic high water marks, soils or approximate study methodologies.
(A.O.; as amended by Ord. 441, 6/10/2015)
§8-403.   Changes in Identification of Area.
   The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Council
where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person documents
the need for such revision. However, prior to any such change, approval must be
obtained from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than 6
months after the date such information becomes available, a community shall
notify FEMA of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data. See §
8-501.2 for situations where FEMA notification is required.
(A.O.; as amended by Ord. 441, 6/10/2015)
§8-404.   Boundary Disputes.
   Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Borough of Blossburg and any party
aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the Borough Council.
The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
(A.O.; as amended by Ord. 441, 6/10/2015)
§8-405.   Jurisdictional Boundary Changes.
   Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other corporate
boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the Borough Council shall
review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary changes. The
community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in areas subject to
annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or exceed those in CFR 44
60.3.
(Ord. 441, 6/10/2015)
Part 5
Technical Provisions
§8-501.   General.
   1.   Alteration or Relocation of Watercourse.
      A.   No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse until all adjacent municipalities which may be affected
by such action have been notified by the municipality, and until all required
permits or approvals have been first obtained from the Department of
Environmental Protection Regional Office.
      B.   No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be

brake or an engine suppression device or a compression brake on a gasoline
powered or diesel powered motor vehicle not equipped with exhaust mufflers, or
equipped with defective or modified exhaust mufflers, so as to create excessive
noise through the use of said engine brake or engine suppression device or
compression brake, adversely affects the public health, safety and welfare of
the residents of the Borough of Blossburg and therefore, is a nuisance in fact.
   3.   Engine brakes prohibited. No gasoline powered or diesel powered motor
vehicles shall be operated on the streets, roads, alleys or highways listed
below within the Borough of Blossburg, Tioga County, Pennsylvania, utilizing,
in said operation, an engine brake, engine suppression device or compression
brake, without exhaust mufflers, or with defective or modified exhaust mufflers
permitting excessive noise to be created by said motor vehicle.

situations requiring the utilization of an engine brake to protect the safety
and property of the residents of Blossburg Borough, other motor vehicle
operators, pedestrians, and the operator and passengers of the motor vehicle
involved in said emergency situation.
   6.   Penalty. Any person, firm, corporation or organization violating any of
the provisions of this section shall, upon summary conviction before a District
Magistrate having jurisdiction, be sentenced to pay a find of not less than $50
or more than $300 and costs of prosecution, and in default of the payment

B.   Disposal of Grass Clippings and Yard Waste
§21-111.   Preamble.
   The Borough Council makes the following findings:
      A.   The deposit and accumulation of grass clippings, leaves and other
yard waste upon and into the streets of the Borough have created a public
problem by increasing the amount of waste and debris in the streets making the
Borough less visually attractive and increasing pollution and run-off into the
Borough storm sewers; and
      B.   The Borough is currently incurring great expenses for storm water
drainage and does not wish for its new infrastructure investment to be degraded
by run-off of yard waste; and
      C.   A significant portion of the run-off and debris in the streets
results from persons intentionally dumping or placing grass clippings, leaves
and yard waste in the Borough Streets; and
      D.   That an ordinance is required to remediate the problems identified
herein and such ordinance is in the best interest of the health, safety and
welfare of the residents of the Borough.
(Ord. 447, 10/9/2019, § I)
§21-112.   Offense Defined.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly cause grass clippings,
leaves or other debris or waste production in conjunction with yard maintenance
or gardening onto the streets, alleys and other public roads of the Borough of
Blossburg. A homeowner is responsible to ensure that any persons hired to cut
their grass or maintain their yard abide by this Part 1, Subpart B. Any grass
or waste which inadvertendy is caused to enter the streets or alleys of the
Borough shall be promptly removed; there is no "grace period" within which to
remove grass or leaves or other yard waste.
(Ord. 447, 10/9/2019, § II)
§21-113.   Enforcement.
   1.    This Part may be enforced by the Police Department or Code Enforcement
Officer. A violation of this Part 1, Subpart B shall initially be sanctioned by
the civil penalty method as set forth in §
21-114 herein. The enforcing officer will use common sense and discretion in
the enforcement of this Part 1, Subpart B and shall consider means other than
the issuance of a summons where appropriate.
   2.    There shall be a presumption that grass clippings, leaves or yard
waste immediately adjacent to a property were caused to be placed there by the
property owner. This is a rebuttable presumption.
(Ord. 447, passed 10/9/2019, § III)
§21-114.   Civil Penalty.
   A violation of this Part 1, Subpart B shall constitute a civil penalty
punishable by a fine of not more than $25. A summons, similar in form to a
parking summons, shall be tendered by the officer to the responsible party. The
summons shall be paid at the Borough Office within 72 hours of the issuance.
The fine shall be increased thereafter to $50, if not paid within the initial
time period of 72 hours.
(Ord. 447, 10/9/2019, § IV)
§21-115.   Criminal Penalty.

General Regulations
§22-101.   Legislative Authority.
   The Borough of Blossburg, Tioga County, Pennsylvania, under authority
granted by the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, 53 P.S.
§10101 et seq., hereby adopts the following regulations governing the
subdivision and development of land within the Borough.
(Ord. 164, 8/20/1965, § 1.100; as amended by Ord. 350, 5/6/1991, §3)
§22-102.   Application.
   1.   No subdivision of any lot, tract or parcel of land shall be effected,
no street, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, water main, or other facilities in
connecting therewith, shall be laid out, constructed, opened or dedicated for
public use and travel, or the common use of occupants of buildings abutting
thereon, except in strict accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.
   2.   All plans for subdivisions shall be submitted to the Borough Planning
Commission and approved by it and the Borough Council before they shall be
recorded.
   3.   The provisions contained herein shall apply to all land within the
Borough limits of the Borough of Blossburg.
(Ord. 164, 8/20/1965, §1.200)
§22-103.   Purpose.
   This Chapter has been adopted in order to create conditions favorable to the
health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of the Borough of
Blossburg through the provision of regulations that will ensure the harmonious
development of the community.
(Ord. 164, 8/20/1965, §1.300)
§22-104.   Short Title.
   This Chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance of the Borough of Blossburg.”
(Ord. 164, 8/20/1965, § 1.400; as amended by Ord. 350, 5/6/1991, §3)
§22-105.   Effect of Change in This Chapter.
   Changes in this Chapter shall affect plats as follows:
      A.   From the time an application for approval of a plat, whether
preliminary or final, is duly filed as provided in this Chapter, and while such
application is pending approval or disapproval, no change or amendment of this
Chapter, zoning or other governing ordinance or plan shall affect the decision
on such application adversely to the applicant and the applicant shall be
entitled to a decision in accordance with the provisions of the governing
ordinances or plans as they stood at the time the application was duly
approved. The applicant shall be entitled to final approval in accordance with
the terms of the approved preliminary application as hereinafter provided.
However, if an application is properly and finally denied, any subsequent
application shall be subject to the intervening change in governing
regulations.
   2.   When an application for approval of a plat, whether preliminary or
final, has been approved without conditions or approved by the applicant's
acceptance of conditions, no subsequent change or amendment in this Chapter,
zoning or other governing ordinance or plan shall be applied to affect
adversely the right of the applicant to commence and to complete any aspect of
the approved development in accordance with the terms of such approval within 5
years from such approval.
   3.   Where final approval is preceded by preliminary approval, the aforesaid
5 year period shall be counted from the date of the preliminary approval. In
the case of any doubt as to the terms of a preliminary approval, the terms
shall be construed in the light of the provisions of this Chapter or the
governing ordinance or plans as they stood at the time when the application for
such approval was duly filed.
   4.   Where the landowner has substantially completed the required
improvements as depicted upon the final plat within the aforesaid 5-year limit,
or any extension thereof as may be granted by the Borough Council, no change of
any ordinance or plan enacted subsequent to the date of filing of the
preliminary plat shall modify or revoke any aspect of the approved final plat
pertaining to zoning classification or density, lot, building, street or
utility location.
   5.   In the case of a preliminary plat calling for the installation of
improvements beyond the 5-year period, a schedule shall be filed by the
landowner with the preliminary plat delineating all proposed sections es well
as deadlines within which applications for final plat approval of each section
are intended to be filed. Such schedule shall be updated annually by the
applicant on or before the anniversary of the preliminary plat approval, until
final plat approval of the final section has been granted and any modification
in the aforesaid schedule shall be subject to approval of the Borough Council
in its discretion.
   6.   Each section in any residential subdivision or land development, except
for the last section, shall contain a minimum of 25 percent of the total number
of dwelling units as depicted on the preliminary plan, unless a lesser
percentage is approved by the Borough Council in its discretion. Provided, the
landowner has not defaulted with regard to or violated any of the conditions of
the preliminary plat approval, including compliance with landowner's aforesaid
schedule of submission of final plats for the various sections, then the
aforesaid protections afforded by substantially completing the improvements
depicted upon the final plat within 5 years shall apply and for any section or
sections, beyond the initial section, in which the required improvements have
not been substantially completed within said 5-year period the aforesaid
protections shall apply for an additional term or terms of 3 years from the
date of final plat approval for each section.
   7.   Failure of landowner to adhere to the aforesaid schedule of submission
of final plats for the various sections shall subject any such section to any
and all changes in this Chapter, zoning, and other governing ordinance enacted
by the Borough of Blossburg subsequent to the date of the initial preliminary
plan submission.
(Ord. 164, 8/20/1965; as added by Ord. 350, 5/6/1991, §2)

Part 3
Design Standards and Required Improvements
§22-301.   Design Standards.
   The design standards listed below and in Tables
22-3-1 and
22-3-2, shall be incorporated in all proposed plans.
   A.   Land Requirements. Land shall be suited to the purposes for which it is
to be subdivided. In general, the Commission shall take the following factors
into consideration prior to the approval of any subdivision plan:
      (1)   Subdivisions laid out on land subject to periodic flooding shall
not be approved unless adequate safeguards against such hazards are provided by
the plan.
      (2)   Areas characterized by steep slopes, rock formations, or other
features, shall not be subdivided into residential lots.
   B.   Street System Layout.
      (1)   Street dimensions and design standards shall be in accordance with
Table 22-3-2.
      (2)   The location of all major streets in the proposed subdivision shall
conform in general alignment to the traffic plan adopted by the Borough
Planning Commission.
      (3)   The proposed street layout shall provide for the continuation or
projection of existing streets in the surrounding area unless the Commission
deems such extension undesirable for specific reasons of topography or design.
      (4)   Streets shall be logically related to the topography to produce
usable lots and reasonable grades.
      (5)   Minor streets shall be laid out to discourage through traffic, but
provision for street connections into and from adjacent areas will generally be
required.
      (6)   Proposed streets shall be extended to provide access to adjoining
property where necessary.
      (7)   Adequate street rights-of-way shall be provided as necessary where
lots in the proposal are large enough to permit resubdivision, or if a portion
of the tract is not subdivided.
      (8)   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major
traffic street, the Commission may require marginal access streets, rear
service alleys, reverse frontage lots or such other treatment will provide
protection for abutting properties, reduction in the number of intersections
with the major street, and separation of local and through traffic.
      (9)   New half or partial streets will not be permitted, except where
essential to reasonable subdivision of a tract in conformance with the other
requirements and standards contained herein and where, in addition,
satisfactory assurance for dedication of the remaining part of the street can
be secured.
      (10)   Wherever a tract to be subdivided borders an existing half or
partial street, the other part of the street shall be plotted within such
tract.
      (11)   Dead-end streets shall be prohibited, except as stubs to permit
future street extension into adjoining tracts, or when designed as culs-de-sac.
New reserve strips, including those controlling access to street shall be
prohibited.
   C.   Street Intersections.
      (1)   Streets shall be laid out to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles. No street shall intersect another at an angle of less than 60
degrees.
      (2)   Multiple intersections involving junction of more than two streets
shall be avoided. Where this proves impossible, such intersections shall be
designed with extreme care for both pedestrians and vehicular safety.
      (3)   Clear-sight triangles of 30 feet measured along street right-of-way
lines from their point of junction shall be provided at all intersections, and
no building shall be permitted within such sight triangles.
      (4)   To the fullest extent possible, intersections with major traffic
streets shall be located not less than 800 feet apar measured from center line
to center line.
      (5)   Streets entering opposite sides of another street shall be laid out
either directly opposite one another or with a minimum offset of 125 feet
between their center lines.
      (6)   Minimum curb, radii at street intersections shall be 15 feet for
intersections involving only minor streets, 25 feet for intersections involving
other type streets, or such greater radius as is suited to the specific
intersection.
      (7)   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing street of
inadequate right-of-way width, additional right-of-way width in conformance
with Table 22-3-2 will be required.
      (8)   Where the grade of any street at the approach to an intersection
exceeds 7 percent, a leveling area shall be provided having not greater than 4
percent grades for a distance of 25 feet measured from the nearest right-of-way
line of the intersecting street.
   D.   Cul-de-sac Streets.
      (1)   Cul-de-sac streets, permanently designed as such, shall not exceed
500 feet in length, and shall furnish access to not more than 20 dwelling
units.
      (2)   Cul-de-sac streets shall be provided at the closed end with a paved
turnaround having a minimum radius to the outer pavement edge or curb line of
40 feet.
      (3)   Unless future extension is clearly impractical or undesirable, a
turnaround right-of-way of the same width as the street shall be carried to the
property line in such a way as to permit future extension of the street into
the adjoining tract.
   E.   Lots and Lot Sizes.
      (1)   Lot sizes and dimensions shall be in accordance with
Table 22-3-1.
      (2)   Where evidence indicates that minimum lot requirements shown in
Table 22-3-1 are not adequate to permit the installation of individual on-lot
water supply and/or sewage disposal facilities, the Commission may require the
developer to undertake tests prescribed by the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Resources to determine the adequacy of the proposed facilities in
relation to the proposed lot size, existing grade and soil conditions. Where
tests indicate a larger lot size to be necessary, the Commission may employ the
services of a registered and qualified independent sanitary engineer for advice
as to the minimum lot size and/or facilities necessary to prevent unsanitary
conditions and hazards to the public. The cost of retaining the services of
such an engineer shall be borne by the developer. [Ord. 350]
      (3)   All lots shall front upon a public street.
      (4)   The ratio of the depth of any lot to its width shall not be greater
than 2 ½, except as may be specified in the Zoning Ordinance of the Borough.
      (5)   Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to
street lines.
      (6)   If remnants of land exist after subdividing, they shall be
incorporated in existing or proposed lots, or dedicated to public use if
acceptable to the Borough.
      (7)   Double frontage lots are prohibited, except where employed to
prevent vehicular access to major traffic streets.
      (8)   Depth and width of parcels laid out or reserved for nonresidential
use shall be sufficient to provide satisfactory space for off-street parking
and unloading as required by the provisions of this Chapter.
   F.   Easements.
      (1)   Easements with a minimum width of 10 feet plus the width of any
required pipe or other improvement shall be provided as necessary for
utilities.
      (2)   To the fullest extent possible, easements shall be centered on or
adjacent to rear or side lot lines.
      (3)   Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, there shall be
provided a drainage easement or right-of-way conforming substantially with the
line of such watercourse and of such width as will be adequate to preserve
natural drainage.
   G.   Blocks.
      (1)   The length, width and shape of blocks shall be determined with due
regard to the following:
         (a)   Provision of adequate sites for buildings of the type proposed.
         (b)   Zoning requirements.
         (c)   Topography.
         (d)   Requirements for safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian
circulation.
      (2)   Blocks shall have a minimum length of 750 feet and a maximum length
of 1200 feet. In the design of blocks longer than 1,000 feet, special
consideration shall be given to the requirements of satisfactory fire
protection.
      (3)   Residential blocks shall be of sufficient depth to accommodate two
tiers of lots, except where reverse frontage lots bordering a major traffic
street are used.
      (4)   Pedestrian interior walks may be required where necessary assist
circulation or provide access to community facilities. Such crosswalks shall
have a width of not less than 10 feet and a paved walk of not less than 4 feet.
   H.   Storm Drainage.
      (1)   Lots shall be laid out and graded to provide positive drainage away
from buildings.
      (2)   Storm sewers, culverts and related installations shall be provided:
         (a)   To permit unimpeded flow of natural watercourses.
         (b)   To insure adequate drainage of all low points along the line of
streets.
      (3)   To intercept stormwater runoff along streets and intervals
reasonably related to the extent and grade of the area drained.
      (4)   In the design of storm sewerage installations, special
consideration shall be given to avoidance of problems which may arise from
concentration of stormwater runoff over adjacent properties.
   I.   Community Facilities and Master Plan Requirements.
      (1)   In reviewing subdivision plans, the Commission will consider the
adequacy of existing or proposed community facilities to serve the additional
dwelling proposed by the subdivision.
      (2)   Where a proposed park, playground, school or other public use shown
in the master plan is located in whole or in part in a subdivision, the
Commission may require the reservation of such area as may be deemed
reasonable. Where said area is not dedicated, it shall be reserved for
acquisition by the Borough for a period of 3 years.
      (3)   Area provided or reserved for such community facilities should be
adequate to provide for building sites, landscaping and off-street parking as
appropriate to the use proposed.
      (4)   The layout of the proposed subdivision shall be in general
conformity with the features or development proposed in the master plan of the
Borough.
(Ord. 164, 8/20/1965, § 3.100; as amended by Ord. 350, 5/6/1991, §3)
§22-302.   Required Improvements.
   1.   Minimum improvements and construction standards required of all
subdivisions shall be as set forth in this Section, and as listed in Table 22-
3-2. Where not set forth, they shall be in accordance with the prevailing
standards as established by the Commission upon advice of the Borough Engineer.
Alternative improvement standards may be permitted if the Commission deems them
equal or superior performance characteristics to the specified improvements.
Additional or higher type improvements may be required in specific cases where
the Commission believes it necessary to create conditions essential to the
health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of the Borough.
[Ord. 350]
   2.   Monuments and Markers. Monuments shall be placed so that the scored or
marked point shall coincide exactly with the intersection of the lines to be
marked, and shall be set so that the top of the monument or marker is level
with the surface of the surrounding ground.
      A.   Monuments shall be set at the intersection of all lines forming
angles in the boundary of the subdivision. Monuments maybe of the following
three types:
         (1)   Cut stone 5" x 5"x 3'0" long with a drill hole in the center.
         (2)   Concrete 5" x 5"x 3'0" long with a ½-inch round brass pin in the
center.
         (3)   A 2-foot round galvanized 3'0" long pipe with a brass cap with a
punch hole for center.
      B.   Markers shall be set at the beginning and ending of all curves along
street property lines; at all points where lot lines intersect curve; either
front or rear; at all angles in property lines of lots; at all corner lots.
Markers shall consist of steel bars at least 15 inches long and not less than
¾-inch in diameter.
   3.   Streets.
      A.   Required improvements and construction standards shall be in
accordance with Table 22-3-2.
      B.   Streets (and alleys where provided) shall be graded, surfaced, and
improved to the grades and dimensions shown on plans, profiles, aid cross-
sections submitted by the subdivider and approved by the Commission.
   4.   Public Water Supply. Where public water supply, in the opinion of the
Commission, is reasonably accessible, the subdivision shall be provided with a
complete water distribution system, including a connection for each lot and
appropriately spaced fire hydrants. Where public water supply is not in
reasonable distance, an alternate supply, approved by the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Resources Protection, shall be furnished. [A.O.]
   5.   Public Water Supply. If water is to be provided by means other than
private wells owned and maintained by the individual owners of lots within the
subdivision or development, applicants shall present evidence to the Borough
Council that the subdivision is to be supplied by a certified public utility, a
bona fide cooperative association of lot owners, or by a municipal corporation,
authority or utility. A copy of a certificate of public convenience from the
Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission or an application for such certificate,
a cooperative agreement or a commitment or agreement to serve the area in
question, whichever is appropriate, shall be acceptable. [Ord. 350]
   6.   Public Sanitary Sewer System.
      A.   Where the public sanitary sewer system, in the opinion of the
Commission, is reasonably accessible, sanitary sewers shall be installed to
adequately serve all lots with connections to the public system. Where lots
cannot be served by the extension of an existing public sanitary sewer, the
subdivider shall obtain approval of lot sizes as provided in
Table 22-3-1. In addition, individual septic tanks and disposal fields, and/or
neighborhood disposal systems, shall be approved by the Pennsylvania Department
of Environmental Resources. [Ord. 350]
      B.   Where the Borough of Blossburg has a plan for extending the public
sanitary sewer system into an area that is being subdivided, and it is
reasonably expected that the area will be serviced by the public system within
a period of 5 years, capped sewers shall be installed to adequately service all
lots in the proposed subdivision.
   7.   Storm Sewers. Storm sewers shall be installed when, in the opinion of
the Commission, it is deemed necessary to provide adequate drainage for the
subdivision.
(Ord. 164, 8/20/1965, § 3.200; as amended by Ord. 350, 5/6/1991, §3, as amended
by A.O.)
§22-303.   Procedure for Installation of Requirement Improvements.
   1.   Improvements to be Provided by Subdivider. In all cases, the subdivider
shall be responsible for the installation of all required improvements under
supervision of the Borough Engineer, and in the manner specified below. [Ord.
350]
(Ord. 164, 8/20/1965, § 3.300; as amended by Ord. 350, 5/6/1991, §3)
§22-304.   Completion of Improvements or Guarantee Thereof Prerequisite to
Final Plat Approval.
   1.   No plat shall be finally approved unless the streets shown on such plat
have been improved to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable condition,
or improved as may be otherwise required by this Chapter and any walkways,
curls, gutters, street lights, fire hydrants, shade trees, water mains,
sanitary sewers, storm sewers and other improvements as may be required by this
Chapter have been installed in accordance with this Chapter. In lieu of the
completion of any improvements required as a condition for the final approval
of a plat, including improvements or fees otherwise required by this Chapter,
the developer may deposit with the Borough of Blossburg financial security in
an amount sufficient to cover the costs of such improvements or common
amenities including basins and other related drainage facilities, recreational
facilities, open space improvements, or buffer or screen plantings which may be
required.
   2.   When requested by the developer, in order to facilitate financing, the
Borough Council, shall furnish the developer with a signed copy of a resolution
indicating approval of the final plat contingent upon the developer obtaining a
satisfactory financial security. The final plat or record plan shall not be
signed nor recorded until the financial improvements agreement is executed. The
resolution or letter of contingent approval shall expire and be deemed to be
revoked if the financial security agreement is not executed within 90 days
unless a written extension is granted by the Borough Council; such extension
shall not be unreasonably withheld and shall be placed in writing at the
request of the developer.
   3.   Without limitation as to other types of financial security which the
Borough of Blossburg may approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, Federal or Commonwealth chartered lending institution irrevocable
letters of credit and restrictive or escrow accounts in such lending
institutions shall be deemed acceptable financial security for the purposes of
this Section.
   4.   Such financial security shall be posted with a bonding company or
Federal or Commonwealth chartered lending institution chosen by the party
posting the financial security, provided said bonding company or lending
institution is authorized to conduct such business within the Commonwealth.
   5.   Such bond, or other security shall provide for, and secure to the
public, the completion of any improvements which may be required on or before
the date fixed in the formal action of approval or accompanying agreement for
completion of the improvements.
   6.   The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of the
required improvements shall be equal to 110 percent of the cost of completion
estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for completion by the
developer. Annually, the Borough of Blossburg may adjust the amount of the
financial security by comparing the actual cost of the improvements which have
been completed and the estimated cost for the completion of the remaining
improvements as of the expiration of the ninetieth day after either the
original date scheduled for completion or a rescheduled date of completion,
subsequent to said adjustment, the Borough of Blossburg may require the
developer to post additional security in order to assure that the financial
security equals said 110 percent. Any additional security shall be posted by
the developer in accordance with this subsection.
   7.   The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an
estimate of the cost of completion of the required improvements, submitted by
the applicant or developer and prepared by a professional engineer licensed as
such in this Commonwealth and certified by such engineer to be a fair and
reasonable estimate of such cost. The Borough of Blossburg, upon the
recommendation of the Borough engineer, may refuse to accept such estimate for
good cause shown. If the applicant or developer and the Borough of Blossburg
are unable to agree upon an estimate, then the estimate shall be recalculated
and recertified by another professional engineer licensed as such in this
Commonwealth and chosen mutually by the Borough of Blossburg and the applicant
or developer. The estimate certified by the third engineer shall be presumed
fair and reasonable and shall be the final estimate. In the event that a third
engineer is so chosen, fees for the services of said engineer shall be paid
equally by the Borough of Blossburg and the applicant or developer.
   8.   If the party posting the financial security requires more than 1 year
from the date of posting of the financial security to complete the required
improvements, the amount of financial security may be increased by an
additional 10 percent for each 1- year period beyond the first anniversary date
from posting of financial security or to an amount not exceeding 110 percent of
the cost of completing the required improvements as reestablished on or about
the expiration of the preceding 1-year period by using the above bidding
procedure.
   9.   In the case where development is projected over a period of years, the
Borough Council may authorize submission of final plats by sections or stages
of development subject to such requirements or guarantees as to improvements in
future sections or stages of development as it finds essential for the
protection of any finally approved section of the development.
   10.   As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request the Borough Council to release
or authorize the release, from time to time, of such portions of the financial
security necessary for payment to the contractor or contractors performing the
work. Any such requests shall be in writing addressed to the Borough Council,
and the Borough Council shall have 45 days from receipt of such request within
which to allow the Borough Engineer to certify, in writing, to the Borough
Council that such portion of the work upon the improvements has been completed
in accordance with the approved plat. Upon such certification the Borough
Council shall authorize release by the bonding company or lending institution
of an amount as estimated by the Borough Engineer fairly representing the value
of the improvements completed or, if the Borough Council fails to act within
said 45-day period, the Borough Council shall be deemed to have approved the
release of funds as requested. The Borough Council may, prior to final release
at the time of completion and certification by its Engineer, require retention
of 10 percent of the estimated cost of the aforesaid improvements.
   11.   Where the Borough Council accepts dedication of all or some of the
required improvements following completion, the Borough Council may require the
posting of financial security to secure structural integrity of said
improvements as well as the functioning of said improvements in accordance with
the design and specifications as depicted on the final plat for a term not to
exceed 18 months from the date of acceptance of dedication. Said financial
security shall be of the same type as otherwise required in this Section with
regard to installation of such improvements, and the amount of the financial
security shall not exceed 15 percent of the actual cost of installation of said
improvements.
   12.   If water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with apparatus
or facilities related thereto, are to be installed under the jurisdiction aid
pursuant to the rules and regulations of a public utility or municipal
authority separate and distinct from the Borough of Blossburg, financial
security to assure proper completion and maintenance thereof shall be posted in
accordance with the regulations of the controlling public utility or municipal
authority and shall not be included within the financial security as otherwise
required by this Section.
   13.   If financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion of
improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a plat as set
forth in this Section, the Borough of Blossburg shall not condition the
issuance of building, grading or other permits relating to the erection or
placement of improvements, including buildings, upon the lots or land as
depicted upon the final plat upon actual completion of the improvements
depicted upon the approved final plat. Moreover, if said financial security has
been provided, occupancy permits for any building or buildings to be erected
shall not be withheld following the improvement of the streets providing access
to and from existing public roads to such building or buildings to a mud-free
or otherwise permanently passable condition, as well as the completion of all
other improvements as depicted upon the approved plat, either upon the lot or
lots or beyond the lot or lots in question if such improvements are necessary
for the reasonable use of or occupancy of the building or buildings.
(Ord. 164, 8/20/1965; as added by Ord. 350, 5/6/1991, §2)
§22-305.   Release from Improvement Bond.
   1.   When the developer has completed all of the necessary and appropriate
improvements, the developer shall notify the Borough Council, in writing, by
certified or registered mail, of the completion of the aforesaid improvements
and shall send a copy thereof to the Borough Engineer. The Borough Council
shall, within 10 days after receipt of such notice, direct and authorize the
Borough Engineer to inspect all of the aforesaid improvements. The Borough
Engineer shall, thereupon, file a report in writing, with the Borough Council,
and shall promptly mail a copy of the same to the developer by certified or
registered mail. The report shall be made and mailed within 30 days after
receipt by the Borough Engineer of the aforesaid authorization from the Borough
Council; said report shall be detailed and shall indicate approval or rejection
of said improvements, either in whole or in part, and if said improvements, or
any portion thereof, shall not be approved or shall be rejected by the Borough
Engineer, said report shall contain a statement of reasons for such nonapproval
or   rejection.
   2.   The Borough Council shall notify the developer, within 15 days of
receipt of the Engineer's report, in writing by certified or registered mail,
of the action of said Borough Council with relation thereto.
   3.   If the Borough Council or the Borough Engineer fails to comply with the
time limitation provisions contained herein, all improvements will be deemed to
have been approved and the developer shall be released from all liability,
pursuant to its performance guaranty bond or other security agreement.
   4.   If any portion of the said improvements shall not be approved or shall
be rejected by the Borough Council, the developer shall proceed to complete the
same and, upon completion, the same procedure of notification, as outlined
herein, shall be followed.
   5.   Nothing herein, however, shall be construed in limitation of the
developer’s right to contest or question by legal proceedings or otherwise, any
determination of the Borough Council or the Borough Engineer.
   6.   Where herein reference is made to the Borough Engineer, he shall be as
a consultant thereto.
   7.   The applicant or developer shall reimburse the Borough of Blossburg for
the reasonable and necessary expense incurred for the inspection of
improvements according to a schedule of fees adopted by resolution of the
Borough Council and as from time to time amended. Such expense shall be
reasonable and in accordance with the ordinary and customary fees charged by
the Borough Engineer or consultant or work performed for similar services in
the community, but in no event shall the fees exceed the rate or cost charged
by the engineer or consultant to the Borough of Blossburg when fees are not
reimbursed or otherwise imposed on applicant
      A.   In the event the applicant disputes the amount of any such expense
in connection with the inspection of improvements, the applicant shall, within
10 working days of the date of billing, notify the Borough of Blossburg that
such expenses are disputed as unreasonable or unnecessary, in which case the
Borough of Blossburg shall not delay or disapprove a subdivision or land
development application or any approval or permit related to development due to
the applicant's request over disputed engineer expenses.
      B.   If, within 20 days from the date of billing, the Borough and the
applicant cannot agree on the amount of expenses which are reasonable and
necessary, then the applicant and the Borough of Blossburg shall jointly, by
mutual agreement, appoint another professional engineer licensed as such in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to review the said expenses and make a
determination as to the amount thereof which is reasonable and necessary.
      C.   The professional engineer so appointed shall hear such evidence and
review such documentation as the professional engineer in his or her sole
opinion deems necessary and render a decision within 50 days of the billing
date. The applicant shall be required to pay the entire amount determined in
the decision immediately.
      D.   In the event that the Borough of Blossburg and applicant cannot
agree upon the professional engineer to be appointed within 20 days of the
billing date, then, upon application of either party, the President Judge of
the Court of Common Pleas of the judicial district in which the Borough of
Blossburg is located (or if at the time there be no President Judge, then the
senior active judge then sitting) shall appoint such engineer, who, in that
case, shall be neither the Borough engineer nor any professional engineer who
has been retained by, or performed services for, the Borough of Blossburg or
the applicant within the preceding 5 years.
      E.   The fee of the appointed professional engineer for determining the
reasonable and necessary expenses shall be paid by the applicant if the amount
of payment required in the decision is equal to or greater than the original
bill. If the amount of payment required in the decision is less than the
original bill by $1,000 or more, the Borough of Blossburg shall pay the fee of
the professional engineer, but otherwise the Borough of Blossburg and the
applicant shall each pay one-half of the fee of the appointed professional
engineer.
(Ord. 164, 8/20/1965; as added by Ord. 350, 5/6/1991, §2)
§22-306.   Remedies to Effect Completion of Improvements.
   In the event that any improvements which may be required have not been
installed as provided in this Chapter or in accord with the approved final plat
the Borough Council is hereby granted the power to enforce any corporate bond,
or other security by appropriate legal and equitable remedies. If the proceeds
of such bond, or other security are insufficient to pay the cost of installing
or making repairs or corrections to all the improvements covered by said
security, the Borough Council may, at its option, install part of such
improvements in all or part of the subdivision or land development and may
institute appropriate legal or equitable action to recover the moneys necessary
to complete the remainder of the improvements. All of the proceeds, whether
resulting from the security or from any legal or equitable action brought
against the developer, or both, shall be used solely for the installation of
the improvements covered by such security, and not for any other Borough
purpose.

violation continues or each Section of this Part which shall be found to have
been violated shall constitute a separate violation. [A.O.]

   4.   The failure of any person to receive or procure forms required for
making the declaration or returns required hereunder shall not excuse him from
making such declaration or return.

Borough of Blossburg. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each
calendar year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within
which a person may be employed.
(Ord. 437, 12/11/2013, §24-503)
§24-204.   Exemption and Refunds.
   1.   Exemption. Any person whose total earned income and net profits from
all sources within the Borough is less than $12,000 for any calendar year in
which the tax is levied is exempt from the payment of the tax for that calendar
year. In addition, the following persons are exempt from payment of the tax:
      A.   Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which the
United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or released under
honorable circumstances from active service if, as a result of military
service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double or quadruple amputee or
has a service- connected disability declared by the United States Veterans’
Administration or its successor to be a total 100 percent disability.
      B.   Any person who serves as a member of a reserve component of the

For the purposes of this paragraph, “reserve component of the armed forces”
shall mean the United States Army Reserve, United States Navy Reserve, United
States Marine Corps Reserve, United States Coast Guard Reserve, United States
Air Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the Pennsylvania Air
National Guard.
   2.   Procedure to Claim Exemption.
      A.   A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
shall annually file an exemption certificate with the Borough and with the
person’s employer affirming that the person reasonably expects to receive
earned income and net profits from all sources within the Borough of less than
$12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is filed. In
the event the Borough utilizes a tax collection officer, it shall provide a
copy of the exemption certificate to that officer. The exemption certificate
shall have attached to it a copy of all the employee’s last pay stubs or W-
2 forms from the employment within the Borough for the year prior to the fiscal
year for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax. Upon
receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise instructed by the
Borough or except as required by paragraph .B, the employer shall not withhold
the tax from the person during the calendar year or the remainder of the
calendar year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall
ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to employees
at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a form at the time of
hiring.
      B.   With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the person or
by the Borough that the person has received earned income and net profits from
all sources within the Borough equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that
calendar year or that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption
for that calendar year, or upon an employer’s payment to the person of earned
income within the Borough in an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that
calendar year, an employer shall withhold the local services tax from the
person under paragraph .C.
      C.   If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year from
the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under paragraph .B,
the employer shall withhold the tax for the remainder of that calendar year.
The employer shall withhold from the person, for the first payroll period after
receipt of the notification under paragraph .B, a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption claimed by
the person under this subsection, plus the per payroll amount due for that
first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld per payroll period for the
remaining payroll periods in that calendar year shall be the same amount
withheld for other employees. In the event the employment of a person subject
to withholding of the tax under this paragraph is subsequently severed in that
calendar year, the person shall be liable for any outstanding balance of tax
due, and the Borough may pursue collection under this Act.
      D.   Except as provided in paragraph .B, it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating exemption
certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or exempting any employee
from a local tax services tax.
   3.   Refunds. The Borough Manager, in consultation with the Collector and
DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims for any
tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which procedures shall be
in accord with provisions of the general municipal law relating to refunds of
overpayments and interest on overpayments. Refunds made within 75 days of a
refund request or 75 days after the last day the employer is required to remit
the tax for the last quarter of the calendar year, whichever is later, shall
not be subject to interest. No refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a
calendar year that do not exceed $1. The Borough Manager or the Collector shall
determine eligibility for refunds to exempt persons and provide refunds.
(Ord. 437, 12/11/2013, §24-504)
§24-205.   Duty of Employers to Collect.
   1.   Each employer within the Borough of Blossburg; as well as those
employers situated outside the Borough of Blossburg but who engage in business
within the Borough of Blossburg, is hereby charged with the duty of collecting
the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or performing for him within
the Borough of Blossburg and making a return and payment thereof to the
Collector. Further, each employer is hereby authorized to deduct this tax from
each employee in his or her employ, whether said employee is paid by salary,
wage or commission and whether or not all such services are performed within
the Borough of Blossburg. With respect to refunds, see 53 Pa.C.S. §8425; with
respect to interest, see 53 Pa.C.S. §8426.
   2.   A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro
rata share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person for a
payroll period shall be determined by dividing the combined rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods established by
the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of determining the pro rata
share, an employer shall round down the amount of the tax collected each
payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of a dollar. Collection of the tax shall be
made on a payroll period basis for each payroll period in which the person is
engaging in an occupation, except as provided in subsection .4 of this Section.
For purposes of this subsection, “combined rate” shall mean the aggregate
annual rate of the tax levied by the School District and the Borough.
   3.   No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
   4.   In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement from a
principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the length of the
payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a statement from the
employee that the pay statement is from the employee’s principal employer and
the employee will notify other employers of a change in principal place of
employment within 2 weeks of its occurrence. The employee’s statement shall be
provided on the form approved by DCED.
   5.   The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The Borough shall provide a taxpayer a receipt of
payment upon request by the taxpayer.
   6.   No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for
the payment of the withheld tax money to the Borough if the failure to withhold
taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the employee as to the
employee’s place or places of employment, the employee’s principal office or
where the employee is principally employed. Further, an employer shall not be
liable for payment of the local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount
withheld by the employer if the employer complies with the provisions of §24-
504.2 of this Part and this Section and remits the amount so withheld in
accordance with this Part.
   7.   Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
(Ord. 437, 12/11/2013, §24-505)
§24-206.   Returns.
   Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her to
an employee, except as provided hereafter in this Part, the employer shall be
responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had been
originally levied against the employer.
(Ord. 437, 12/11/2013, §24-506)
§24-207.   Dates for Determining Tax Liability and Payment.
   In each tax year each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted and paid
over to the Collector on or before the thirtieth day following the end of each
calendar quarter of each such tax year.
(Ord. 437, 12/11/2013, §24-507)
§24-208.   Self-Employed Individuals.
   Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind or
engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of employment
within the Borough of Blossburg shall be required to comply with this Part and
pay the pro rata portion of the tax due to the Collector on or before the
thirtieth day following the end of each quarter.
(Ord. 437, 12/11/2013, §24-508)
§24-209.   Individuals Engaged in More than One Occupation or Employed in More
than One Political Subdivision.
   1.   The sites of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day
the person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the event
a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is, concurrent
employment, or an occupation which requires the person working in more than one
political subdivision during a payroll period, the priority of claim to collect
the local services tax shall be in the following order:
      A.   First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed.
      B.   Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision.
      C.   Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person’s home.
   2.   In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that
calendar year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
(Ord. 437, 12/11/2013, §24-509)
§24-210.   Nonresidents Subject to Tax.
   All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their place

type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the Borough of
Blossburg do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject themselves to
the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under this Part with the

Blossburg. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation within the Borough
of Blossburg and an employee of a nonresidential employer may, for the purpose

tax is not paid, the Borough shall have the option of proceeding against either
the employer or employee for the collection of this tax as hereinafter

the Court of Common Pleas of Tioga County as in other cases provided.
   3.   The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return made by
an employer or, if no return was made by an employer or, if no return was made,
to ascertain the tax due. Each employer is hereby directed and required to give
the Collector the means, facilities and opportunity for such examinations.

after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for the recovery of
any such tax due or unpaid under this Part, together with interest and penally.
   2.   If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of

date of the tax and a penalty of 6 percent shall be added to the flat rate of
such tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery of this
tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable therefore
shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of collection.

instance, at the time of commencement of construction.

its designated officer, to the Tioga County Board of Assessment and Revision of
Taxes. Thereafter, such Board shall, after completion of the improvement,
assess the improvement separately, calculate the amount of the assessment
eligible for tax exemption in accordance with the limits established in this
Part and notify both the taxpayer and the Borough of the reassessment and of
the amounts of the assessment eligible for an exemption. Appeals from the
reassessment and the amounts eligible for the exemption may be taken by the
taxpayer or by the Borough as provided by general law.
   3.   The form hereinbefore prescribed shall require the following verified
information:
      A.   The date the building permit or alteration permit was issued for
such improvements, if applicable.

      C.   A summary of the plan of the improvement.

presumed to be a waiver of any right to claim a real estate exemption as
provided by this Part.

enactment of this Chapter although such use does not conform with the
provisions of this Chapter; provided, however, that the nonconforming use shall
not be:
   A.   Enlarged, extended, or increased, unless such enlargement would tend to
reduce the degree of nonconformance.
   B.   Further increased in size.
   C.   Changed to another nonconforming use.
   D.   Changed whenever the boundaries of a district shall transfer an area
from one district classification to another, the foregoing provisions shall
apply to any nonconforming use therein or created thereby.

§27-502.   Registration of Nonconforming Uses.
   Zoning permits shall be required for nonconforming uses existing at the time
of passage of this Chapter and shall be issued by the Zoning Officer without
charge stating that the use is nonconforming. Registration shall be preceded by
a notice from the Zoning Officer to the property owner that the use is
nonconforming. Upon receipt of said notice the property owner shall apply for
the above permit within 1 year.
(Ord. 244A, 3/3/1975, Art. VII, §7.200)
§27-503.   Regulation of Nonconforming Uses.
   An existing nonconforming us, building or structure cannot be enlarged,
reconstructed, substituted or structurally altered unless required to do so by
law or order and as follow:
      A.   Enlargement. Any nonconforming use, building or structure may be
enlarged up to, but not more than 25 percent of its floor area and/or lot area,
as it existed at the time of passage of this Chapter. Such enlargement must
conform to all other regulations of the district where it is situated. This
provision may be used only once for each zone lot.
      B.   Repairs and Maintenance.
         (1)   Normal maintenance repairs and incidental alteration of a
building or other structure containing a nonconforming use is permitted
provided it does not extend the area or volume of space occupied by the
nonconforming use.
         (2)   A building or other structure containing residential
nonconforming uses may be altered in any way to improve interior livability,
provided that no structural alterations shall be made which would increase the
number of dwelling units or the bulk of the building.
      C.   Displacement and Change of Use.
         (1)   A nonconforming use may be changed into a conforming use only,
or to another nonconforming use more closely approaching the uses permitted in
the district in which such use is located as determined by the Zoning Hearing
Board in the manner set forth for the review
         (2)   A nonconforming use shall not be extended to displace a
conforming use, except to provide room for parking or loading facilities which
will serve the nonconforming use and which will substantially lessen congestion
resulting from the nonconforming use.
         (3)   Buildings or structures, regardless of conformity or ownership
shall not be combined for the purpose of extending an existing nonconforming
use, or for creating a different nonconforming use.
      D.   Restoration. Any nonconforming building or structure damaged less
than 50 percent of its then existing floor area may be restored reconstructed
or used as before; provided, that the volume of such use, building or structure
shall not exceed the volume which existed prior to such damage, and that it be
complete within 1 year of such happening.
      E.   Termination.
         (1)   When 50 percent or more of the existing floor area volume or use
of land is destroyed by fire, casualty, or act of God, it shall thereafter be
terminated as a nonconforming use, building structure.
         (2)   When discontinued for a period of 1 year or more, a
nonconforming use shall be terminated. Change to a lower number use
classification or to a conforming use shall be considered an abandonment
thereof, and such nonconforming use cannot be revived.
      F.   Approval Granted Prior to Passage of Chapter. A building, structure
or use, planned, constructed or designed in compliance with existing law prior
to the adoption of this Chapter, shall be deemed a legal nonconforming use;
provided, that:
         (1)   The construction or use was actually started prior to the
adoption of this Chapter.
         (2)   The ground-story framework including the second tier of beams is
completed within 6 months of the adoption of this Chapter.
         (3)   The entire building, structure or use is completed or installed
and ready for occupancy or operation within 1 year of the adoption of this
Chapter.
(Ord. 244A, 3/3/1975, Art. VII, §7.300)
Part 6
Supplementary Regulations
§27-601.   Supplementary Regulations Governing the Size of Lots, Yards and
Buildings.
   1.   Required Area Cannot Be Reduced. No zone lot, yard, parking are or

the minimum required by this Chapter, but if already less than the minimum
required by this Chapter, said area may be continued but not further reduced.
   2.   Exception for Small Existing Nonconforming Lots in Residential
Districts. A single-family dwelling may be constructed on any vacant
nonconforming lot, irrespective of its area or width which is located in all R
Districts if it complies with the following:
      A.   Said lot is in existence as an entity at the time of the adoption of
this Chapter.
      B.   The owner of the lot does not own an adjoining lot.
      C.   The front yard conforms with the requirements of §501.
      D.   Each side yard is not less than 5 feet.
   3.   Usable Open Space. An area of at least 250 square feet of usable open
space shall be provided for every dwelling unit erected on any lot.
   4.   Height Limitations. District height limitations shall not apply church
spires, cupolas and domes, monuments, water towers, chimney smokestacks, silos,
aerials, farm structures, and parapet walls extending not more than 4 feet
above the limiting height of the building.
   5.   Yard Regulations.
      A.   Front Yard Requirements. All yards facing on a public street shall
be considered front yards and shall conform to the minimum front yard
requirements for the one in which located. Corner lots should provide the
minimum front yard requirements for the respective zone for both intersection
streets.
      B.   No front yards shall be used for open storage of boats, trucks,
recreational vehicles, or any other equipment except for vehicular parking on
driveways.
      C.   Wherever there is pronounced alignment of buildings and depth of
front yards on one side of a street within a given block, said alignment
existed at the time of enactment of this Chapter, any buildings erected on such
side of such street within such block may conform in alignment with those on
adjoining lots, notwithstanding front yard requirements set forth in Schedule
27-II of this Chapter.
      D.   Width of One Side Yard May be Reduced. The width of one side yard
may be reduced to not less than 3 feet, provided that the combined side yards
shall not be less than the minimum required for the lot. Similarly, the
distance between the proposed structure and another existing or proposed
structure on an adjacent lot, may not be less than the minimum sum of the two
side yards. A reduction of width may be authorized only by the Board when
warranted by the location of existing buildings, or when conducive to the
desirable development of two or more lots.
      E.   Side Yard or Corner Lot. The side yard on the side street of a
corner lot shall be equal to one-half of the required front yard.
      F.   Fences and Walls Located in Yards. Fences, walls, and hedges not
exceeding 6 feet in height may be located in any yard or court.
      G.   Projections into Yards. Projections into required yards shall be
permitted as follows, except that in no case shall a structure or projection be
located closer than 3 feet to any side or rear line, or 10 feet to any front
lot line:
         (1)   Cornices, canopies, eaves, or other architectural features not
required for structural support may project into a side yard not more than 3
inches per foot of side yard width, but may not exceed a total of 3 feet.
         (2)   Fire escapes and balconies to fire exits may not project into a
front yard.
         (3)   Bay windows, fireplaces, chimneys, uncovered stairs and
landings, and balconies not required for fire escape purposes may project up to
4 feet provided that they do not together occupy more than one-third of the
length of the building wall.
      H.   Patios. Patios may be located in side and rear yards no closer than
3 feet to any adjacent property line. In case of a corner lot, they shall not
reduce the side yard on the side street below the required width.
   6.   Two or More Buildings on a Lot. Two or more principal buildings located
on a parcel in single ownership shall conform to all the requirements of this
Chapter which would normally apply to each building if each were on a separate

Planning Commission. [Ord. 270]
   7.   Corner Lots. At the intersection of two or more streets, no hedge,
fence, or wall which is higher than 3 feet above curb level nor any other
obstruction (other than a post or tree) to vision, shall be permitted in the
area formed by a 15-foot radius whose center point is either the intersection
of the face of curb lines or the intersection of the paved portion of street
right-of-way.
   8.   Through Lots. Where a single lot under individual ownership extends
from one street to another parallel or nearly parallel street or alley the
widest street shall be deemed the street upon which the property fronts. No
principal structure shall be erected on the rear of the lot, except specified
in subsection .6.

§27-605.   Regulations Applying to Flood-Prone Areas.
   1.   Delineation of Flood-Prone Areas. For the purposes of this Chapter, the
identified floodprone area shall be those areas of the Borough which have been
identified as being subject to flooding by a 100-year flood in the Flood
Insurance Study prepared for the Borough by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, dated January, 1980. A map showing all areas considered to be flood-
prone is available for inspection at the Borough Offices. For the purposes of
this Chapter the following nomenclature is used in referring to the various
kinds of flood-prone areas:
      A.   The floodway area is based on the criteria that the portion of the
floodplain selected must be capable of carrying the waters of the 100-year
flood without increasing the water surface elevation of the flood more than 1
foot at any one point. The areas identified as “Floodway” in the FIS prepared
by the FEMA shall be supplemented with floodway areas which have been
identified in other available studies or sources of information.
      B.   The Flood-Fringe Area (FF) shall be that area of the 100-year
floodplain not included in the Floodway Area. The basis for the outermost
boundary of this area shall be the 100-year flood elevation contained in the
flood profiles of the above-referenced Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and as shown
on the accompanying Flood Boundary and Floodway Map.
   The areas considered to be flood-prone may be revised or modified by the
Borough where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person
documents the need or possibility for such revision. No modification or
revision of any area identified as being flood-prone in the Flood Insurance
Study prepared by tie Federal Insurance Administration shall be made without
prior approval from the Federal Insurance Administration.
   2.   Use of Flood Prone Areas.
      A.   No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse until all adjacent municipalities which may be affected
by such action have been notified by the municipality, and until all required
permits or approvals have been first obtained from the Department of
Environmental Resources, Dams and Encroachment Division Protection. [A.O.]
      B.   Within any designated floodway (FW) area, no new construction,
development, use, activity, or encroachment of any kind shall be allowed,
except where the rise in flood heights caused by the proposal development is
fully offset by accompanying improvements. Any development that is permitted
shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the provisions contained in this
Chapter and any other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations,
particularly the Flood Damage Control Regulations of the Blossburg Borough
Building Code.
      C.   Within any designated flood-fringe (FF) area new construction and
other development, uses and activities shall be allowed, provided that they are
undertaken in strict compliance with the provisions contained in this Chapter
and any other applicable code ordinances and regulations, particularly the
Flood Damage Control Regulations of the Blossburg Borough Building Code.

data available from Federal, State, or other sources to regulate construction
in a floodprone area. The Permit Office shall also review the application for
permit to determine if all other necessary governmental permits such as those
required by Federal, State County, and Municipal laws have been obtained
including those required by Act 537, the Pennsylvania Sewage Facilities Act, 35
P.S. §750.1 et seq., the Water Obstruction Act of 1913 Dam Safety and
Encroachments Act, 32 P.S. §693.1 et seq. and the Federal Water Pollution
Control Amendments of 1972, §404, 33 USC 1334. No permit shall be issued until
these documents have been made.

27-701, the applicant for zoning permit shall include the following:
         (1)   One hundred year flood elevations.
         (2)   Proposed lowest floor elevations in relation to mean sea level,
i.e., National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929.
      D.   For structures to be floodproofed to the regulatory flood elevation,
a document, certified by a registered professional engine or architect, which
states that the proposed construction has been adequately designed to withstand
the 100- year flood elevations, pressures, velocities, impact, and uplift
forces and other hydrostatic, hydrodynamic and buoyancy factors associated with
the 100-year flood. Such statement shall include a description of the type and
extent of floodproofing measures which have to be incorporated into the design
of the structure.
      E.   In granting any variance the Zoning Hearing Board shall employ the
following criteria in addition to those required by §
27-715.
         (1)   No variance shall be granted for any construction, development,
use or activity within any floodway area that would cause any increase in the
100- year flood elevation.
         (2)   Whenever a variance is granted, the Borough shall notify the
applicant in writing that:
            (a)   The granting of the variance may result in increased premium
rates for flood insurance.
            (b)   Such variances may increase the risks to life and property.
   4.   Supplementary Definitions.
      Development–any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, the placement of
mobile homes, streets, and other paving, utilities, filling, grading,

Part 7
Administration and Enforcement
§27-701.   General Procedure.
   1.   Sequence of Steps. Under the terms of this Chapter, all new
construction, additions, and changes in the type of occupancy must be made in
conformance with the requirements contained herein. All persons desiring to
undertake such new construction, additions, or changes shall conform to the
following general procedure, as well as to all other applicable provisions this
Chapter:
      A.   Application for Permit. Applicant applies to the Zoning Officer for
a zoning permit and occupancy permit by filling out the appropriate application
and by submitting the required fee.
      B.   Issuance of Zoning Permit. If the action proposed in the application
is in accord with the regulations contained in this Chapter a zoning permit
will be issued by the Zoning Official either on his own authority or, in
certain cases as described in subsection .2, below, after referral to the
Zoning Hearing Board or to the Planning Commission.
      C.   Action in Accordance with Zoning Permit. After receipt of the zoning
permit the applicant may proceed to undertake the construction, alteration or
change in use permitted by the zoning permit.
      D.   Inspection by Zoning Official. After completion of the construction,
alteration or change in use and before occupancy take place on the premises,
the Zoning Official inspects the premises and issues an occupancy permit if he
finds the action has occurred in accordance with the zoning permit.
   2.   Zoning Permit Types. Under the terms of this Chapter, five general
classes of zoning permits may be issued under which compliance with this
Chapter may occur. Each of these classes requires a different procedural action
as described below:
      A.   Permitted Uses. An application for a zoning permit for permitted use
in a zoning district requires only the review of the Zoning Official, who
determines whether the proposed construction, major alteration or change in use
is in accordance with the requirements this Chapter. The Zoning Official then
either issues or refuses to issue a zoning permit according to his decision.
      B.   Special Uses. An application for a zoning permit for a special use
must be referred to the Zoning Hearing Board and to the Planning Commission by
the Zoning Official. The Zoning Official is not empowered to make an
independent decision on this matter, although he may submit recommendations to
the Zoning Hearing Board and to the Planning Commission. The Planning
Commission reviews the application and analyzes the proposed special use to
determine compliance with provisions of this Chapter. The Planning Commission
then gives recommendations to the Zoning Hearing Board who meets and makes a
final decision on the special use. The Zoning Hearing Board then notifies the
Zoning Official to either issue or refuse a zoning permit accordingly.
      C.   Zoning Permit After an Appeal. The applicant may appeal to the
Zoning Hearing Board any action taken by the Zoning Official by submitting an
application for an appeal to the Zoning Official and to the Secretary of the
Zoning Hearing Board. The Board gives notice of the date for a public hearing
and reviews the application to determine if the Zoning Official has acted
properly. After the public hearing, and after reaching its decision, the Zoning
Hearing Board can order the Zoning Official to either issue or refuse a permit
accordingly.
      D.   Permit After a Variance Request. Where the applicant feels that
there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of
carrying out the strict letter of this Chapter he may appeal for a variance by
submitting an application requesting such variance to the Zoning Official and
to the Secretary of the Zoning Hearing Board. The Board gives notice of the
date for a public hearing and reviews the application. After the public hearing
and after reaching its decision the Board can order the Zoning Official to
issue or refuse a zoning permit accordingly.
      E.   Permit After Request for Reclassification or Amendment. Where the
applicant feels that this Chapter is in need of change in any part, the
applicant may petition the Borough Council to consider an amendment to this
Chapter. Such a petition shall be referred to the Planning Commission for their
recommendation. The Borough Council may then, after proper notice, hold a
public hearing on the proposed amendment. After the hearing the Borough Council
shall make their decision on the proposed amendment. If the amendment is
adopted the applicant can then proceed to apply for a zoning permit in the
manner applicable to the type of use that he wishes to propose.
(Ord. 244A, 3/3/1975, Art. IX, §9.100)
§27-702.   Enactment of Zoning. Ordinance Amendments.
   1.   The Borough Council may from time to time amend, supplement, or repeal
any of the regulations and provisions of this Chapter. The procedure for the
preparation of a proposed zoning ordinance as set forth in §607 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §10607, is hereby declared
optional.
   2.   Before voting on the enactment of an amendment, the Borough Council
shall hold a public hearing thereon, pursuant to public notice. In addition, if
the proposed amendment involves a zoning map change, notice of said public
hearing shall be conspicuously posted by the Borough of Blossburg at points
deemed sufficient by the Borough of Blossburg along the perimeter of the tract
to notify potentially interested citizens. The affected tract or area shall be
posted at least 1 week prior to the date of the hearing.
   3. In the case of an amendment other than that prepared by the Planning
Commission the Borough Council shall submit each such amendment to the Planning
Commission at least 30 days prior to the hearing on such proposed amendment to
provide the Planning Commission an opportunity to submit recommendations.
   4.   If, after any public hearing held upon an amendment, the proposed
amendment is changed substantially, or is revised, to include land previously
not affected by it, the Borough Council shall hold another public hearing,
pursuant to public notice, before proceeding to vote on the amendment.
   5.   At least 30 days prior to the public hearing on the amendment by the
Borough Council, the Borough of Blossburg shall submit the proposed amendment
to the County planning agency for recommendations.
   6.   Within 30 days after enactment, a copy of the amendment to this Chapter
shall be forwarded to the County planning agency.

§27-703.   Procedure for Landowner Curative Amendments.
   1.   A landowner who desires to challenge on substantive grounds the
validity of this Chapter or the Zoning Map or any provision thereof, which
prohibits or restricts the use or development of land in which he has an
interest may submit a curative amendment to the Borough Council with a written
request that his challenge and proposed amendment be heard and decided as
provided in § 916.1 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code
(hereinafter “MPC”), 53 P.S. § 10916.1. The curative amendment and challenge
shall be referred to the Planning Commission and the County planning agency as

P.S. §10908, and all references therein to the Zoning Hearing Board shall, for
purposes of this Section, be references to the Borough Council. If the Borough
of Blossburg does not accept a landowner's curative amendment brought in
accordance with this subsection and a court subsequently rules that the
challenge has merit, the court's decision shall not result in a declaration of
invalidity for this entire Chapter and Zoning Map, but only for those
provisions which specifically relate to the landowner's curative amendment and
challenge.
   3.   The Borough Council, if it determines that a validity challenge has
merit, may accept a landowner's curative amendment, with or without revision,
or may adopt an alternative amendment which will cure the challenged defects.
The Borough Council shall consider the curative amendments, plans and
explanatory material submitted by the landowner and shall also consider:
      A.   The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools and other public service facilities.
      B.   If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the proposal
upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of the proposal in providing
housing units of a type actually available to and affordable by classes of
persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by the challenged provisions of this
Chapter or Zoning Map.
      C.   The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by the
site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers, natural
resources and other natural features.
      D.   The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes,
woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, natural resources and natural features, the
degree to which these are protected or destroyed, the tolerance of the
resources to development and any adverse environmental impacts.
      E.   The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture and
other land uses which are essential to public health and welfare
(Ord. 244A, 3/3/1975; as added by Ord. 349, 5/6/1991, §1)

portion hereof, is substantially invalid, it shall take the following actions:
      A.   The Borough of Blossburg shall declare by formal action this Chapter
or portions hereof substantially invalid and propose to prepare a curative
amendment to overcome such invalidity. Within 30 days such declaration and
proposal the Borough Council shall:

   2.   Within 180 days from the date of the declaration and proposal, the
Borough of Blossburg shall enact a curative amendment to validate, or reaffirm
the validity of, this Chapter pursuant to the provisions of §609 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (hereinafter “MPC”), 53 P.S. §10609,
in order to cure the declared invalidity of this Chapter.
   3.   Upon the initiation of the procedures as set forth in subsection .1,
the Borough Council shall not be required to entertain or consider any
landowner's curative amendment filed under § 609.1 of the MPC, 53 P.S. §
10609.1, nor shall the Zoning Hearing Board be required to give a report
requested under §§909.1 or 916.1 of the MPC, 53 P.S. §§10909.1, 10916,
subsequent to the declaration and proposal based upon the grounds identical or
substantially similar to those specified by the resolution required by
subsection .1.A. Upon completion of the procedures set forth in subsections .1
and .2, no rights to a cure pursuant to the provisions of §§609.1 and 916.1 of
the MPC, 53 P.S. §§10609.1, 10916.1, shall, from the date of the declaration
and proposal, accrue to any landowner on the basis of the substantive
invalidity of this Chapter for which there has been a curative amendment
pursuant to this Section.
   4.   The Borough of Blossburg, having utilized the procedures set forth in
this Section, may not again utilize said procedure for a period of 36 months
following the date of enactment of a curative amendment or reaffirmation of the
validity of this Chapter; provided, however, if after the date of declaration
and proposal there is a substantially new duty imposed upon the Borough of

§27-713.   Time Limitations.
   1.   No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Zoning
Hearing Board later than 30 days after an application for development,
preliminary or final, has been approved by the Borough of Blossburg if such
proceeding is designed to secure reversal or to limit the approval in any
manner unless such person alleges and proves that he had no notice, knowledge
or reason to believe that such approval had been given. If such person has
succeeded to his interest after such approval, he shall be bound by the
knowledge of his predecessor in interest. The failure of anyone other than the
landowner to appeal from an adverse decision on a tentative plan or from an
adverse decision by the Zoning Officer on a challenge to the validity of this
Chapter or an amendment hereto or map or an amendment thereto shall preclude an
appeal from a final approval except in the case where the final submission
substantially deviates from the approved tentative approval.
   2.   All appeals from determinations adverse to the landowner shall be filed
by the landowner within 30 days after notice of the determination is issued.
(Ord. 244A, 3/3/1975; as added by Ord. 349, 5/6/1991, §1)
§27-714.   Stay of Proceedings.
   1.   Upon filing of any appeal proceeding before the Zoning Hearing Board
and during its pendency before the Board, all land development pursuant to any
challenged ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning Officer or of any agency
or body, and all official action thereunder, shall be stayed unless the Zoning
Officer or any other appropriate agency or body certifies to the Board facts
indicating that such stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, in
which case the development or official action shall not be stayed otherwise
than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Board or by the court
having jurisdiction of zoning appeals, on petition after notice to the Zoning
Officer or other appropriate agency or body. When an application for
development, preliminary or final, has been duly approved and proceedings
designed to reverse or limit the approval are filed with the Board by persons
other than the applicant, the applicant may petition the court having
jurisdiction of zoning appeals to order such persons to post bond as a
condition to continuing the proceedings before the Board.
   2.   After the petition is presented, the court shall hold a hearing to
determine if the filing of the appeal is frivolous. At the hearing, evidence
may be presented on the merits of the case. It shall be the burden of applicant
for a bond to prove the appeal is frivolous. After consideration of all
evidence presented, if the court determines that the appeal is frivolous, it
shall grant the petition for a bond. The right to petition the court to order
the appellants to post bond may be waived by the appellee, but such waiver may
be revoked by him if an appeal is taken from a final decision of the court.
   3.   The question whether or not such petition should be granted and amount
of the bond shall be within the sound discretion of the court. An order denying
a petition for bond shall be interlocutory. An order directing the responding
party to post a bond shall be interlocutory.
   4.   If an appeal is taken by a respondent to the petition for a bond from
an order of the court dismissing a zoning appeal for refusal to post a bond and
the appellate court sustains the order of the court below to post a bond, the
respondent to the petition for a bond, upon motion of the petitioner and after
hearing in the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals, shall be liable for
all reasonable costs, expenses and attorney fees incurred by the petitioner.

§27-715.   Variances.
   1.   The Zoning Hearing Board shall hear requests for variances where it is
alleged that the provisions of this Chapter inflict unnecessary hardship upon
the applicant. The Board may by rule prescribe the form of application and may
require preliminary application to the Zoning Officer. The Board may grant a
variance, provided that all of the following findings are made where relevant
in a given case:
      A.   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions including
irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property
and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of this Chapter
in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
      B.   That because of such physical circumstances or condition, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of this Chapter and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
      C.   That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant.
      D.   That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use development of adjacent
property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
      E.   That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulation in issue.
   2.   In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of
this Chapter and the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §10101
et seq.
(Ord. 244A, 3/3/1975, Art. IX, § 9.600; as amended by Ord. 349, 5/6/1991, §2)
§27-716.   Special Exceptions.
   Where the Borough Council, in this Chapter has stated special exceptions to
be granted or denied by the Zoning Hearing Board pursuant to express standards
and criteria, the Board shall hear and decide requests for such special
exceptions in accordance with such standards and criteria. In granting a
special exception, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and
safeguards, in addition to those expressed in this Chapter, as it may deem
necessary to implement the purposes of this Chapter and the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §10101 et seq.

Board and accept the decision or findings of the hearing officer as final.
      D.   The parties to the hearing shall be the Borough of Blossburg any
person affected by the application who has made timely appearance of record

      J.   The Board or the hearing officer, as the case may be, shall render a
written decision or, when no decision is called for, make written findings on
the application within 45 days after the last hearing before the Board or
hearing officer. Where the application is contested or denied, each decision
shall be accompanied by findings of fact and conclusions based thereon together
with the reasons therefor. Conclusions based on any provisions of this Chapter
or of any law, ordinance, rule or regulation shall contain a reference to the
provision relied on and the reasons why the conclusion is deemed appropriate in
the light of the facts found. If the hearing is conducted by a hearing officer,
and there has been no stipulation that his decision or findings are final, the
Board shall make his report and recommendations available to the parties within
45 days and the parties shall be entitled to make written representations

be deemed to have been rendered in favor of the applicant unless the applicant
has agreed in writing or on the record to an extension of time. When a decision
has been rendered in favor of the applicant because of the failure of the Board
to meet or render a decision as herein above provided, the Board shall give
public notice of the said decision within 10 days from the last day it could
have met to render a decision in the same manner as provided in paragraph .A of
this Section. If the Board shall fail to provide such notice, the applicant may
do so. Nothing in this paragraph shall prejudice the right of any party
