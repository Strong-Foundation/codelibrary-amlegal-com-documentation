Part 1 General Provisions
§ 101. Statutory Authorization.
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage of
the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978, delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Council of the Borough of Shamokin Dam does hereby
order as follows.
(Ord. 2021-5, 8/2/2021)
§ 102. Intent.
   The intent of this Chapter is to:
   1.   Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
   2.   Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in
order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
   3.   Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and natural
drainage.
   4.   Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units, and its residents, by preventing excessive development in areas subject
to flooding.
   5.   Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
(Ord. 2021-5, 8/2/2021)
§ 103 Applicability.
   It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or corporation to
undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or development anywhere
within the Borough of Shamokin Dam unless a permit has been obtained from the
Floodplain Administrator.
(Ord. 2021-5, 8/2/2021)
§ 104 Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.
   This Chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in
effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance provisions
shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those provisions are
more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of
this Chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
(Ord. 2021-5, 8/2/2021)
§ 105 Severability.
   If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this
Chapter shall be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such a decision
shall not affect the remaining portions of the Chapter, which shall remain in
full force and effect, and for this purpose the provisions of this Chapter are
hereby declared to be severable.
(Ord. 2021-5, 8/2/2021)
§ 106 Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
   1.   The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this Chapter
is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on accepted
engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be
increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings
restricted by debris. This Chapter does not imply that areas outside any
identified floodplain areas, or that land uses permitted within such areas will
be free from flooding or flood damages.
   2.   This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Borough of
Shamokin Dam or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this Chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder.
(Ord. 2021-5, 8/2/2021)
Part 2 Administration
§ 201 Designation of the Floodplain Administrator.
   1.   The Borough Manager is hereby appointed to administer and enforce this

employees; or
      C.   Enter into a written agreement or written contract with another
agency or private sector entity to administer specific provisions of these
regulations.
   2.   Administration of any part of these regulations by another entity shall
not relieve the community of its responsibilities pursuant to the participation
requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program as set forth in the Code
of Federal Regulations at 44 C.F.R. 59.22.
   3.   In the absence of a designated Floodplain Administrator, the Floodplain
Administrator duties are to be fulfilled by the President of the Council.
(Ord. 2021-5, 8/2/2021)
§ 202 Permits Required.
   A permit shall be required before any construction or development is

(Ord. 2021-5, 8/2/2021)
§ 203 Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator.
   1.   The Floodplain Administrator shall issue a permit only after it has
been determined that the proposed work to be undertaken will be in conformance
with the requirements of this Chapter and all other applicable codes and
ordinances.
   2.   Prior to the issuance of any permit, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review the application for the permit to determine if all other necessary
government permits required by state and federal laws have been obtained, such
as those required by the Pennsylvania Sewage Facilities Act (Act 1966-537, as
amended); the Pennsylvania Dam Safety and Encroachments Act (Act 1978-325, as
amended); the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Act (Act 1937-394, as amended); and
the U.S. Clean Water Act, Section 404, 33, U.S.C. 1344. No permit shall be
issued until this determination has been made.
   3.   In the case of existing structures, prior to the issuance of any
development/permit, the Floodplain Administrator shall review the proposed cost
of improvements or repairs and the pre-improvement market value of the
structure, so that a substantial improvement/substantial damage determination
can be made, in accordance with FEMA’s Substantial Improvement/Substantial
Damage Desk Reference.
   4.   During the construction period, the Floodplain Administrator or other
authorized official shall inspect the premises to determine that the work is
progressing in compliance with the information provided on the permit
application and with all applicable municipal laws and ordinances. He/she shall
make as many inspections during and upon completion of the work as are
necessary.
   5.   In the discharge of his/her duties, the Floodplain Administrator shall
have the authority to enter any building, structure, premises or development in
the identified floodplain area, upon presentation of proper credentials, at any
reasonable hour to enforce the provisions of this Chapter.
   6.   In the event the Floodplain Administrator discovers that the work does
not comply with the permit application or any applicable laws and ordinances,
or that there has been a false statement or misrepresentation by any applicant,
the Floodplain Administrator shall revoke the permit and report such fact to
the Council for whatever action it considers necessary.
   7.   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain in perpetuity, or for the
lifetime of the structure, all records associated with the requirements of this
Chapter including, but not limited to, finished construction elevation data,
permitting, inspection and enforcement.
   8.   The Floodplain Administrator is the official responsible for submitting
a biennial report to FEMA concerning community participation in the National
Flood Insurance Program as requested.
   9.   The responsibility, authority and means to implement the commitments of
the Floodplain Administrator can be delegated from the person identified.
However, the ultimate responsibility lies with the person identified in the
floodplain ordinance as the Floodplain Administrator/Manager.
   10.   The Floodplain Administrator shall consider the requirements of the 34
PA Code and the 2015 IBC and the 2015 IRC, or the latest revision thereof as
adopted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

of any regulations adopted pursuant thereto, the Floodplain Administrator shall
give notice of such alleged violation as hereinafter provided. Such notice
shall:
      A.   Be in writing;
      B.   Include a statement of the reasons for its issuance;
      C.   Allow a reasonable time not to exceed a period of thirty (30) days
for the performance of any act it requires;
      D.   Be served upon the property owner or his or her agent as the case
may require; provided, however, that such notice or order shall be deemed to
have been properly served upon such owner or agent when a copy thereof has been
served with such notice by any other method authorized or required by the laws
of this state; and
      E.   Contain an outline of remedial actions which, if taken, will effect
compliance with the provisions of this Chapter.
   2.   Penalties. Any person who fails to comply with any or all of the
requirements or provisions of this chapter or who fails or refuses to comply

other authorized employee of the municipality shall be guilty of a summary
offense and upon conviction shall pay a fine to Borough of Shamokin Dam of not
less than three hundred dollars ($300) nor more than one thousand dollars
($1000), plus costs of prosecution. In default of such payment, such person
shall be imprisoned in county prison for a period not to exceed thirty (30)
days. Each day during which any violation of this Chapter continues shall
constitute a separate offense. In addition to the above penalties, all other
actions are hereby reserved, including an action in equity for the proper
enforcement of this Chapter. The imposition of a fine or penalty for any
violation of, or noncompliance with this Chapter shall not excuse the violation
or noncompliance or permit it to continue.
   All such persons shall be required to correct or remedy such violations and
noncompliance within a reasonable time. Any development initiated or any
structure or building constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered, or
relocated, in noncompliance with this chapter may be declared by the Council to
be a public nuisance and abatable as such.

adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without increasing the water surface elevation by more than one (1) foot at any
point. This term shall also include floodway areas which have been identified
in other available studies or sources of information for those Special Flood
Hazard Areas (SFHAs) where no floodway has been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
      A.   Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted
unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed

incurred "substantial damage” regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure
to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety
code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.

Part 3 Outdoor Fuel Burning Appliances
§ 301. Purpose and Scope.
   1.   Residences, commercial and industrial establishments situated within
the Borough are entitled to clean air and environmental circumstances free of
unreasonable dust, obnoxious odors, noxious fumes and smells, as well as an
environment free of stored debris and storage of combustible fuels in adjacent
or exposed exterior areas within densely populated area.
   2.   Research indicates that outdoor fuel burning appliances cause emission
problems that cross property lines. Because the smoke stays close to the
ground, it can easily reach humans working or playing outdoors or penetrate
neighboring buildings. It also causes problems with smoke visibility. The low
lying smoke can worsen cardiovascular problems such as angina, irritate eyes
and lungs, trigger headaches, worsen respiratory diseases such as asthma,
emphysema and bronchitis.
(Ord. 08-6, 12/8/2008, §1)

boiler designed and constructed to burn oil, wood, coal or other fuels
manufactured for placement outside of the structure for the heating of the

Part 3 Landlord Registration and Licensing
§ 301. Title.
   This Part shall be known as the Borough of Shamokin Dam "Landlord
Registration and Licensing Ordinance."
(Ord. 2010-5, 9/13/2010)
§ 302. General.
   It is the purpose of this Part and the policy of the Council of the Borough
of Shamokin Dam, in order to protect and promote the public health, safety and
welfare of its citizens, to establish rights and obligations of owners and
occupants relating to the rental of certain residential rental units in the
Borough and to encourage owners and occupants to maintain and improve the
quality of rental housing within the community. It is also the policy of the
Borough that owners, managers and occupants sham responsibilities to obey the
various codes adopted to protect and promote public health, safety and welfare.
As a means to those ends, this Part provides for a system of inspections,
issuance and renewal of occupancy licenses and sets penalties for violations.
This Part shall be liberally construed and applied to promote its purposes and
policies. In considering the adoption of this Part, the Borough of Shamokin Dam
makes the following findings.
   In recent years, many formerly private homes have been turned into
residential rental units. Those rental units have oftentimes been rented to
individuals who, because they have no ownership interest in the property, have
allowed the properties to deteriorate. In many cases, the owners of the
properties live long distances from the Borough. As a result, property
maintenance of many rental units in the Borough has been somewhat lax. In
addition, problems have occurred because many tenants, because they have no
ownership interest in the real estate, have not been concerned about following
Codes of the Borough of Shamokin Dam, including Codes which govern maintenance
and safety of the property. This, in turn, has caused problems for other home
owners near the rental units. In addition, there is a greater incidence of
violation of various Codes of the Borough of Shamokin Dam in residential rental
properties where owners rent properties to tenants. Estimates are that the
majority of all code violations in the Borough of Shamokin Dam occur in tenant
occupied structures.

§ 409. Residential Permit Parking.
   1.   Findings and Purpose:
      The Borough of Shamokin Dam finds that:
      A.   Certain residential areas in the Borough are subjected to commuter
vehicle parkings, therefore depriving the residents of those areas of spaces in
which to park their own vehicles;
      B.   Those residential streets are also subjected to a high degree of
commuter traffic which substantially reduces the quality of the ambient air
level; and
      C.   The establishment of a parking permit program for certain affected
areas should facilitate efficient movement of traffic by providing for parking
preference during certain hours of the day and days of the week. Therefore, the
Borough of Shamokin Dam considers it to be in the interest of the people of the
Borough to provide for the establishment of a residential permit parking
program to insure primary access to available parking spaces by neighborhood
residents and also to provide a cleaner ambient air level.
   2.   Definitions - For the purpose of this section, words and terms listed
in this subsection, as follows, shall have the following meanings:
      COMMUTER VEHICLE - a motor vehicle parked in a residential area by a
person not a resident of that residential area;
      PROPRIETOR - a person who owns or leases real estate within a residential
area of which he is not a resident, but who owns or manages a business
enterprise or professional office maintained at that address; for the purpose
of this section, a proprietor shall be entitled to one (1) parking permit for
that business or professional office address;
      RESIDENT - a person who owns or leases real property within a residential
area and who maintains either a voting residence, or bona fide occupancy, or
both, at that address;
      RESIDENTIAL AREA - a contiguous area containing public highways or parts
of public highways primarily abutted by residential property or residential and
non-business property (such as schools, parks, places of worship, hospitals and
nursing homes).
   3.   Criteria - The residential areas designated in subsection 4 of this
section are those deemed impacted and hence eligible for residential parking on
the basis of the following criteria:
      A.   During any period between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m.,
Monday through Saturday, except legal holidays, the number of vehicles parked
(or standing), legally or illegally, on the streets in the area is equal to
seventy percent (70%) or more of the legal, on-street parking capacity of the
area. For the purpose of this criterion, a legal parking space shall be twenty
(20) linear feet.
      B.   During the same period as specified in A, directly above, ten
percent (10%) or more of the vehicles parked (or standing) on the streets in
the area are not registered in the name of a person residing in the area. For
the purpose of this criterion, the latest available information from the Bureau
of Motor Vehicles and Licensing of the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation regarding registration of motor vehicles shall be used.
      Provided: In determining that a specific area identified as impacted and
eligible for residential permit parking is designated as a residential permit
parking area, the following factors are taken into consideration:
         (1)   The local and metropolitan needs with respect to clean air and
environment;
         (2)   The possibility of a reduction in total vehicle miles driven in
the Borough of Shamokin Dam;
         (3)   The likelihood of alleviating traffic congestion, illegal
parking and related health and safety hazards;
         (4)   The proximity of public transportation to the residential area;
         (5)   The desire and need of the residents for residential permit
parking and their willingness to bear the administrative costs in connection
with it; and
         (6)   The need for parking in excess of the residential permit parking
program in proximity to establishments located in the residential permit
parking area and used by the general public for religious, health or
educational purposes.
   4.   Designation of residential permit parking areas - The following are
designated as residential permit parking areas:
 
Area Bounded by and Including
(Reserved)
 
   Signs shall be erected along the streets in each residential permit parking
area, indicating the days, hours, locations and conditions under which parking
shall be by permit only.
   5.   Application for permit - Application for a residential parking permit
shall be made to the Chief of Police by the person desiring the permit, who
shall be only the owner or the driver of a motor vehicle who resides on or is a
proprietor of property immediately adjacent to a street or other location
within a residential parking permit area. A separate application shall be
required for each motor vehicle, and each application shall be accompanied by a
ten dollar ($10.00) permit fee, which shall be for the use of the Borough of
Shamokin Dam, to be applied to the cost of administering the residential permit
parking program. Each application shall contain the following information: the
name of the owner or the driver, as the case may be, of the motor vehicle; the
address of the resident or the proprietor, as the case may be; the make, model
and registration number of the motor vehicle; and the driver number as taken
from the applicant's current driver's license. At the discretion of the Chief
of Police, the applicant shall be required, at the time of making application,
to present his driver's license and the vehicle registration card.
   6.   Issuance of permit - Upon receipt of the application and the permit
fee, and determination by him that the information upon the application shows
that the applicant is entitled to a residential parking permit, the Chief of
Police shall issue to the applicant a residential parking permit, which shall
be valid for the remainder of the calendar year. The permit shall display the
serial and registration numbers of the motor vehicles, the residential parking
area number, and the expiration date. The permit shall be renewable annually
before the expiration date, upon making application for renewal and payment of
the ten dollar ($10.00) permit fee. It shall be unlawful and a violation of
this Section for any person to display other than the current and valid permit
while standing or parking in a residential permit parking area at any time when
those permits are to be displayed.
   7.   Temporary and exemption parking permits - Temporary parking permits may
be issued by the Chief of Police, upon payment of a fee of two dollars ($2.00),
to bona fide visitors of residents of a designated residential permit parking
area, and exemption parking permits may be issued, without payment of a fee, to

(Ord. 2017-2, 5/1/2017)
B. Applications for Connections.
§ 121. Application For Available Service.
   Service connections will be made and water or sewer service, or both, will
be furnished upon written application to the Borough by the owner or the
prospective owner of the property to be served, or his proper agency duly
authorized in writing, on a form supplied by the Borough. The application for
service shall state the purpose or purposes for which the water or sewer will
be used and such other appropriate information as shall be required by the
Borough.
(Reenacted by Ord. 88-3, 10/17/1988)
§ 122. Connection Fees.
   The owner or person submitting an application to the Borough for service
connections will pay a connection fee, as established by resolution of Borough
Council, for each connection.
(Ord. 74-4, 6/3/1974; as amended by Ord. 88-3, 10/17/1988)
§ 123. Service Connections and Lines.
   1.   The Borough or its duly authorized representatives will make all
connections to the sewer and water mains and shall provide for the furnishing,
installation and maintenance of all service lines from the sewer and water
mains to the curb line. (Curb line means either the road side of an established
curb or the equivalent thereof.) All service lines from the curb line to the
structure to be served shall be installed by the owner or person to be served
at his expense and shall be of a pipe approved by the Borough. No service
connection facility between the curb line and the structure to be served shall
be covered up in the process of installation until inspected and approved by
the Borough or its duly authorized representative. Owners or persons making new
or replacement water line connections shall provide a meter pit and meter at
the curb line in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Borough
currently in effect covering such connections.
   2.   No sewer service line shall be laid in the same trench with gas lines,
water lines or any other facilities of a public service company. The size of
the service connection from the sewer main to the curb line will be a minimum
diameter of six (6) inches and the service connection from the curb line to the
structure to be served will be a pipe of PVC (polyvinyl chloride) or other type
specifically authorized and approved by the Borough and with a minimum inside
diameter of four (4) inches and will have a type 0 ring joint or leaded joint.
Only persons properly authorized by the Borough shall be permitted to make
service line connection installations. The Borough shall not be responsible for
the maintenance of any service line or any other line, pipe or fixture from the
curb line to the structure to be served, nor shall the Borough be responsible
for any damages resulting from the escape of water or sewage from any service
connection from the curb line to the structure to be served. The owner ad any
other person being served at all times shall comply with all Federal, State and
municipal regulations and shall make any and all changes to their service
connections between the curb line and the structure to be served, which shall
be required or shall be made necessary as a result of any change of grade of
the main lines or otherwise.
   3.   In the event any existing service line is determined to be defective in
that it is leaking sewage or allowing the infiltration of ground water, the
property owner is required to replace the defective service line with a pipe of
PVC (polyvinyl chloride) and no other type.
(Reenacted by Ord. 88-3, 10/17/1988; as amended by Ord. 98-4, 12/7/1998, §1; as
amended by Ord. 2017-2, 5/1/2017)
§ 124. Application When Service Is Not Available.
   If sewer or water service is not available, any property owner or other
proper person may make application to the Borough for service upon a form
provided by the Borough setting forth the location, estimated date and type of
proposed connection, together with such other information as the Borough may
require. After receipt of such application, the Borough will determine whether
the construction of an addition of the water or sewer system is economically
feasible, based upon engineering estimates of costs of construction and
revenues from proposed or expected use of such addition.
   1.   Extension of Water or System if Feasible. If in the opinion of the
Borough the construction of an addition to then existing water or sewer system
to serve the applicant is economically feasible and if the Borough or Authority
has sufficient funds, or is able to borrow sufficient funds, to finance such
construction, and the Borough and Authority can obtain permission from
appropriate governmental agencies as required, the Borough or Authority may
construct an addition to the existing water or sewer system.
   Before construction of such addition is begun, the Borough or Authority may
require the applicant to post a bond, either in cash or with other sufficient
surety, guaranteeing and providing for the annual payment of a sum which
together with the annual rental and charges for the use of the additional  *
would be sufficient to amortize the cost of such construction with interest
thereon, whether or not interest is actually paid by the Borough or Authority
over the then projected useful life or such addition.
   2.   Extension Of Water Or Sewer System With Contribution Of Applicant. If
in the opinion of the Borough the construction of an addition to the existing
water or sewer system to serve the applicant is not economically feasible and
the applicant nevertheless desires sewer service or water service, the Borough
and Authority may require a cash contribution by the applicant toward the costs
of constructing such additions so that the project would be economically
feasible.
   3.   Borough Not Restricted To Financially Feasible Additions. Nothing in
this section shall be construed as preventing the Borough from extending any
water or sewer line beyond the then apparently financially feasible limits, if
such extensions are needed for reasons of public health and water purity and
are approved by holders of any revenue indentures, real estate mortgages or
other security given by the Authority or Borough, or to require hookup after
such construction and to require reasonable contributions from users for
construction costs of such additions, in addition to normal rates and charges
for hookup to and use of the water or sewer system.
(Reenacted by Ord. 88-3, 10/17/1988)

§ 125. Borough May Limit Size of Sewer Collector System.
   No sewer line extension may be added to the Borough's system without Borough
approval and the Shamokin Dam Borough reserves the right to deny a connection
of an extension to its collector system to limit the size of its collector
sewer system for any reason without limitation including but not limited to the
following:
      A.   the exceeding of the Borough's share of capacity in the Regional
Sewer System;
      B.   the consideration of the excessiveness of the cost to replace
existing sewer mains with larger size pipe to handle increased flows in the
system; and
      C.   the reserving of capacity for extensions to property owners within
Borough boundaries.
(Added by Ord. 87-7, 12/7/1987, §823.05)
§ 126. Prohibiting Connections of Sewer Extensions from Outside the Borough.
   In order to protect the Borough of Shamokin Dam's share of capacity in the
Regional Sewer System and recognizing the limitations on the Borough's
collection system, any further connections to the Borough sewer system from
outside the Borough limits is hereby and hereinafter prohibited. For purposes
of this prohibition, an extension of a sewer line is any of the following:
      A.   any sewer line constructed for which there is a possibility that
other establishments or properties will connect into the sewer at some time in
the future;
      B.   any sewer line laid in a public right-of-way;
      C.   any sewer line laid in streets which will eventually be turned over
to a municipality and become public rights-of-way; and
      D.   any extensions of a line now outside the Borough boundary lines to
any additional point outside the Borough boundary lines.
(Added by Ord. 87-7, 12/7/1987, §823.06)
§ 127. Sewer Line Extensions Within the Borough Regulated.
   Any sewer line extension to be constructed within the Borough shall comply
with all State and Borough regulations before attachment to the Borough system
is permitted. A sewer line extension is defined as:
      A.   any sewer line constructed for which there is a possibility that
other establishments or properties will connect into the sewer at some time in
the future;
      B.   any sewer line laid in a public right-of-way; and
      C.   any sewer line laid in streets which will eventually be turned over
to the Borough as public ways.

served, or fraction thereof, and seven dollars ($7.00) per thousand (1,000)
gallons, or fraction thereof, for water served over and above the first six
thousand five hundred gallons during each quarter. [Ord. 2014-2]
   B.   Non-Metered Water Service. Non-metered water service shall not be
permitted in the Borough except under special conditions, and then only for the
period of time necessary to procure and install a meter. Whenever water is

service, the minimum rental per quarter shall be ninety-five dollars ($95.00)
for the first six thousand five hundred (6,500) gallons of water served, or
fraction thereof, and eleven dollars ($11.00) per thousand (1,000) gallons, or
fraction thereof, of water served over and above the first six thousand five
hundred gallons during each quarter. [Ord. 2014-2]
   B.   Sewer Service to Improved Property Without Water Meter. Whenever sewer
service is provided to an improved property which does not have metered water
service, the Borough shall estimate the number of gallons of water used per
quarter at the improved property by reference to quantities served to similar
users and shall charge the rental rate established for metered water service
for the estimated gallonage in determining the rental charge per quarter for
said property. Owners of improved properties who are dissatisfied with the
Borough's estimate of gallonage may be billed on a metered basis if they
consent to the installation of meters on their water service and pay a meter
installation fee, as established by resolution of Borough Council, or the
Borough's costs of installation, whichever is greater.
   C.   Eastern Snyder County Regional Authority Surcharges. Any surcharge
imposed upon the Borough of Shamokin Dam by the Eastern Snyder County Regional
Authority on account of nitrogen and/or phosphorus concentrations in Borough
sewer system effluent, shall be passed through to property owners prorated on
the basis of water consumed, billed with the quarterly bill and collected as a
regular sewer charge. [Ord. 2011]

connected to the water system or sewer system shall initially provide the
Borough with, and thereafter shall keep the Borough advised of, his correct
address. Failure of any person to receive bills for water or sewer rentals or
charges shall not be considered an excuse for non-payment nor shall failure
result in an extension of the period of time during which the net bill is paid.

Part 4 Allotment of Reserve Capacity
§ 401. Purpose.
   That part of the Shamokin Dam Borough sewer system that connects to the
Eastern Snyder County Regional Authority (ESCRA) pumping station, hereinafter
called pump station tributary, has been determined to cause an hydraulic
overload at the pump station. It is determined that this overload is the result
of excessive inflow and infiltration of surface water and the ground water
table into the Shamokin Dam Borough sewer system. Shamokin Dam Borough has been
directed by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources to cease
connection to sewers tributary to the pump station. The Borough recognizes that
correction of the problem will take time and that with each element of
correction some sewer capacity will become available for use. In the interest
of fairness to all those who will seek the limited capacity to be made
available by corrections to the system and to assure that such capacity is used
and not returned for speculation, the Borough deems it necessary to regulate
the awarding and use of the finite sewer capacity in the Shamokin Dam Borough
sewer system that tributaries to the Eastern Snyder County Regional Authority
(ESCRA) pump station. Another part of the Borough sewer system, hereinafter
called the "gravity tributary" is not subject to capacity limitations.
(Ord 91-4, 4/22/1991, §1; as amended by Ord. 2014-5, 6/2/2014, §3)
§ 402. Determining Available Sewer Capacity.
   As of the date of passage of these regulations, Shamokin Dam Borough does
not have sewer capacity available in that part of its sewer system that
connects to the Selinsgrove Municipal Authority pump station, the pump station
tributary, because of inflow/infiltration problems. The Borough is taking steps
to correct the inflow/infiltration problems and as it does such corrections its
available capacity will be determined and certified by Borough Engineers. When
such certification is made:
      A.   In determining available capacity, the Borough shall identify all
existing vacant lots entitled to connection to the Borough sewer system by
virtue of their being part of the previously approved sewer planning module
where they have been adjacent to existing Borough sewer mains for use as
residential lots and reserve specific capacity for these lots thereby
grandfathering their priority right for connection to the sewer system and omit
that amount from available capacity.
      B.   After determining grandfathered capacity, the Borough will release
capacity for development in quantities of no less than five thousand (5,000)
gallons per day to persons whose sewer module plans show that their planned
peak flows do not exceed the sewer capacity being made available, under the
terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.
(Ord. 91-4, 4/22/1991)
§ 403. Announcement of Available Capacity.
   At such time as Borough Engineers certify to the Borough that it has sewer
capacity available in its pump station tributary in the amount of six thousand
two hundred fifty (6,250) gallons per day or more, the Borough will make public
announcement of the availability of eighty (80) percent of said capacity and
invite persons to submit proposed sewer plan modules whose anticipated peak
flows do not exceed the flow capacity made available. Such plan shall be filed
within thirty (30) days of the public announcement advertised in a newspaper of
general circulation in the Borough. Persons may submit modules for less than
the amount of sewer capacity made available but not for more than the amount
made available. Persons may submit plans for sewer capacity amounts greater
than the capacity made available where they demonstrate a workable plan,
subject to Borough engineering approval, for a system of flow equalization
whereby the applicant's peak flows would be controlled so as to limit admission
of flowage into the sewer system at a rate equal to or lesser than the
announced capacity being made available.
(Ord. 91-4, 4/22/1991, §1)
§ 404. Allotting Available Sewer Capacity to Active Development.
   At such time as the Borough of Shamokin Dam determines that it has available
sewer capacity, it shall allot that sewer capacity to those persons who file
final approved subdivision and/or land development plans for recording and
implementations with the sewer line having been constructed or appropriate
bonds having been issued to assure their construction.
   Sewer capacity shall be in the exclusive control of the Borough until it is
allotted for actual use in an active subdivision or land development project.
Furthermore, this allocation shall be in conjunction with the availability of
capacity from the Eastern Snyder County Sewer Authority who operates the
treatment plant that treats Shamokin Dam Borough sewage flows.
(Ord. 91-4, 4/22/1991, §1; as amended by Ord. 93-6, 12/6/1993, §1; and by Ord.
05-8, 12/5/2005, §2)
§ 405. Capacity Not Transferable.
   Sewer capacity in Borough's pump station tributary or gravity tributary
awarded under these regulations is not transferable to another module. It is
required that the capacity be used for the project and land for which
application was made in accordance with the time restrictions set forth in
these regulations.
(Ord. 91-4, 4/22/1991, §1)
§ 406. Time Limitation.
   All sewer capacity awarded in the Borough, whether it is pump station
tributary or gravity tributary, shall be subject to recall if not used within
two (2) years of the award of such capacity. For the purpose of these
regulations, "used" shall mean the following:
      A.   In residential developments - when final subdivision plans have been
approved and utility lines are in place and connected or bonds have been issued
to assure construction and connection.
      B.   In commercial developments - construction must be commenced within
one (1) year of the award and the project must be completed and operational
with sewer connections, completed within two (2) years of the award.
(Ord. 91-4, 4/22/1991, §1)
§ 407. Failure to Utilize Capacity.
   1.   In the event projects for which capacity has been awarded have failed
to complete the project and utilize the capacity, the award shall be considered
withdrawn and shall be made available for other projects in the same manner as
initial capacity is made available.
   2.   The Shamokin Dam Borough shall have the discretionary authority to
extend the time limitation established in §
406, above, for what it determines is a good cause shown. Such extensions shall
not exceed the original time allotted.

additional sixty (60) days. If additional time is necessary to come into
compliance, the food service facility may be issued a compliance schedule which
establishes a schedule of certain milestones for bringing the food service
facility into compliance. If the repair or replacement requires approval and/or
permitting by others, it shall be the responsibility of the food service
facility to obtain such approval or permit prior to repair or replacement.
      C.   Disposal. Wastes removed from each grease trap shall be disposed of
at a facility allowed to receive such wastes. Neither grease nor solid
materials removed from grease traps shall be returned to any grease trap,
private sewer line or to any portion of the Borough's wastewater collection
system without prior written permission from the Borough Council.
      D.   Recordkeeping and Reporting. The food service facility shall
maintain written records and receipts of the date and time of all examinations,
cleanings and maintenance of each grease trap, a notation as to where any
removed grease was disposed of and the volume of grease disposed, and shall
make these records available for inspection by Borough officials or agents upon
request. The food service facility shall also maintain the written protocol
concerning grease trap cleaning and maintenance procedures and shall make this
available to the Borough representative upon request. The food service facility
shall file such reports regarding grease traps operation, cleaning and
maintenance, as the Borough may, from time to time require, upon such frequency
as the Borough may determine and require based upon the experience of the food
service facility.
   4.   Grease interceptors. Grease interceptors shall be designed and
installed in accordance with this Chapter. Each food service facility shall
operate and maintain its grease interceptor in accordance with the following
criteria:
      A.   Examination, Cleaning and Maintenance.
         (1)   Each food service facility shall be responsible for the costs of
installing, examining, pumping, cleaning and maintaining its grease
interceptor. All food service facilities that have grease interceptors shall
contract with a grease hauler that performs the following service during each

materials, wastewater, and bottom sludge and solids from the grease intercep-
tor, as well as scraping and removing excessive solids from the walls, floors,
baffles and all pipe work.
         (2)   It shall be the responsibility of each food service facility to
examine its grease interceptor during the cleaning procedure to ensure that the
grease interceptor is properly cleaned and that all fittings and fixtures
inside the grease interceptor are in working condition and functioning
properly.
      B.   Grease Interceptor Cleaning Frequency. Each food service facility
shall have its grease interceptor(s) cleaned according to the following
criteria:
         (1)   When the floatable grease layer exceeds six (6) inches in depth
as measured by an approved measuring method; or,
         (2)   When the settle-able solids layer exceeds eight (8) inches in
depth as measured by an approved measuring method; or,
         (3)   When the total volume of captured grease and solid material
displaces more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the capacity of the grease
interceptor as calculated using an approved measuring method; or,
         (4)   When the grease interceptor is not retaining/capturing oils and
greases.
      C.   Repairs and Replacement. Each food service facility shall be
responsible for the cost and scheduling of all repairs to or replacement of its
grease interceptor(s). Repairs or replacement required by a Borough official
shall be corrected within thirty (30) calendar days after the date of written
notice of requiring the repairs or replacement is received by the food service
facility. The Borough may authorize an extension of time for an additional
sixty (60) days to achieve compliance. If additional time is necessary to come
into compliance, the food service facility may be issued a compliance schedule
which establishes a schedule of certain milestones for bringing the food
service facility into compliance. If the repair or replacement requires
municipal approval and/or permitting, it shall be the responsibility of the
food service facility to obtain such approval or permit prior to repair or
replacement.
      D.   Disposal. Wastes removed from each grease interceptor shall be
disposed of at a facility permitted by PA Department of Environmental
Protection to receive such wastes. Neither grease nor solid materials removed
from grease interceptors shall be returned to any grease interceptor, private
sewer line or to any portion of the Borough's collection system without prior
written permission from the Executive Director.
      E.   Recordkeeping. Each food service facility shall maintain written
records and receipts of all grease interceptor examinations and maintenance,
including the date and time of the examination, cleaning or maintenance, a
notation as to the volume of grease, where the grease was disposed of, details
of any repairs required and dates of repair completion and any other records
pertaining to the grease interceptor. The records shall be made available for
review upon request by the Borough when deemed necessary.
   5.   Alternative Grease Removal Devices or Technologies. Alternative devices
and technologies such as automatic grease removal systems shall be subject to
written approval by the Borough prior to installation. Approval of the device
shall be based on demonstrated (proven) removal efficiencies and reliability of
operation. The Borough, at its sole discretion, may approve these types of
devices depending on manufacturer's specifications on a case-by-case basis. The
food service facility may be required to furnish analytical data demonstrating
that food service facility discharge concentrations to the Borough's wastewater
collection system will not exceed the limitations established in this Chapter.
Permission to use any specific technology does not invalidate any other Chapter
of these regulations, and does not preclude any enforcement actions or
remedies.
(Ord. 2014-5, 6/2/2014, §4)
§ 503. Borough Inspection Program.
   1.   Entry. Each food service facility shall allow duly authorized employees
or agents of the Borough bearing proper credentials and identifications access
at all reasonable times to the premises for the purpose of inspection,

   1.   Discussion of Requirements. Before preparing the sketch plan for a
subdivision, the applicant should discuss with the Administrative Assis­ tant
to the Planning Commission, or with the Planning Commission itself, the
procedure for adoption of a subdivision and land development plan and the
requirements as to the general layout of streets and reservation of land,
street improvements, drainage, sewerage, fire protection, and similar matters,
as well as the availability of existing services. The Adminis­ trative
Assistant shall also advise the applicant, where appropriate, to discuss the
proposed subdivision or land development with those officials (such as the Soil
Conservationist, Borough Engineer, and Sewage Enforcement Officer) who must
eventually prove these aspects of the subdivision or land development plan
coming within their jurisdiction.
   2.   Application Procedure and Requirements. Prior to subdividing or
developing land, a landowner; or his representative, is advised, but not
required, to file an application for approval of a sketch plan. The submission
of a sketch plan application shall not constitute the filing of an application
for preliminary or final plan review and approval. The sketch plan application
should:

the Assessor's files. This infor­ mation shall be shown on a separate current
Assessment Map repro­ duction from the Assessor's Office showing the
subdivision super­ imposed thereon.

described in Part 4 of these regulations and complying in all respects with
these regulations.

   3.   Classification. Tentative classification of the sketch plan shall be
made upon receipt by the Administrative Assistant. The subdivision shall be
classified as either major or minor, as defined in these regula­ tions. The
application shall then be accepted by the Planning Commission at its next
regular meeting for further processing. If classified as a minor subdivision by
the Planning Commission, an application may then be filed for approval of a
final subdivision plan as provided in these regula­ tions. If classified as a
major subdivision by the Planning Commission, an application must then be filed
for approval of a preliminary subdivision plan before filing for final
subdivision plan approval.
   4.   Report of Administrative Assistant. The Administrative Assistant shall
process the sketch plan and make a determination as to whether it is complete
according to the requirements of Part 4. The Administrative Assistant shall

topography, sewage disposal, drainage, water supply, lot sizes and arrangement,
and further development of adjoining lands as yet unsubdivided.

subdivision or land development is first discussed, the Planning Commission may
schedule a field trip to the site of the proposed sub­ division or development,
accompanied by the applicant or his represen­ tative.

plan and report from the Administrative Assistant, the Planning Commission will
advise the applicant of the specific changes or additions, if any,. it will
require in the layout, and the character and extent of required improvements
and reservations which it will require as a prerequisite to the approval of the
subdivision plan. The Planning Commission may require additional changes as a
result of further study of the subdivision plan in final form.
   Approval of the sketch plan, although not required for further plan
processing, shall constitute authorization to prepare and submit a pre­
liminary plan in the case of a major subdivision and a final plan in the case
.of a minor subdivision. Such approval by the Planning Commission shall be made
at a regularly scheduled meeting.
   Within fifteen (15) days after the meeting at which the sketch plan was
approved or disapproved by the Planning Commission, the Administrative
Assistant shall send written notice of the Commission's recommendations,
including changes and modifications requested by the Commission, to the

shall review the preliminary plan and official comments and reports received
thereon and shall render its recommendation to the Borough Council in writing.
The following shall constitute the types of action the Planning Commission may
take:

preliminary plan, in which case it shall specify the defects found in the
application and describe the requirements which have not been met and shall, in
each case, cite the provision of the Ordinance relied upon.
      B.   The Planning Commission may recommend conditional approval of the
preliminary plan, in which case it shall specify all additional information or
changes needed, describing the requirements that have not been met, citing, in

additional information shall be required prior to further preliminary plan
consideration or the submission of the final plan. Conditional approval may
only be granted where the conditions are acceptable to the applicant.
      C.   The Planning Commission may reconnnend approval of the preliminary
plan. Such recommendation of approval shall constitute recommended approval of
the subdivision or land development as to the character and intensity of
development, the arrangement and approx­ imate dimensions of streets, lots, and
other planned features. Later approval by Council binds the subdivider to the
general scheme of the subdivision shown and permits the subdivider to proceed
with final detailed design of improvements, to arrange for a performance bond
to cover installation of improvements, and to prepare the final plan. Council's
approval of the preliminary plan does no·t authorize the sale of lots or the
recording of the preliminary plan.
   4.   Signing of Plan by Planning Commission. In approving the plan the
Chairman and Secretary of the Planning Commission shall sign and date the major
original and three (3) copies of the plan and forward the original and all
copies to Borough Council for their action.

mendations from the Planning Commission, Council shall consider the preliminary
plan at its next regularly scheduled meeting or a specially scheduled public

next following the date the complete application is filed with the Planning
Commission (which first reviews the applications, provided that, should the
next regular meeting occur more than thirty (30) days following the filing of
the application, the said ninety-day period shall be measured from the
thirtieth day following the day the application has been filed, Borough Council
shall review the preliminary plan, official comments and reports, and written
recommendation of the Planning Commission received thereon and shall render its
decision in writing and shall communicate it to the applicant personally or
mail it to him at his last known address not later than fifteen (15) days
following the decision.
   The following shall constitute the types of action the Borough Council may
take:
      A.   Council may disapprove the preliminary plan, in which case it shall
specify the defects found in the application and describe the requirements
which have not been met and shall, in each case, cite the provisions of the
Ordinance relied upon.
      B.   Council may conditionally approve the preliminary plan, in which
case it shall specify all additional information or changes needed, describing
the requirements that have not been met, citing, in each case, the provisions
of the Ordinance which were relied upon. This additional information shall be
required prior to further preliminary plan consideration or the submission of
the final plan. Conditional approval may only be granted where the conditions
are acceptable to the applicant.
      C.   Council may approve the preliminary plan. Such approval shall
constitute approval of the subdivision or land development as to the character
and intensity of development, the arrangement and approximate dimensions of
streets, lots, and other planned features. The approval binds the subdivider to
the general scheme of the sub­ division shown and permits the subdivider to
proceed with the final detailed design of improvements, to arrange for a
performance bond to cover installation of improvements, and to prepare the
final plan. Approval of the preliminary plan does not authorize the sale of
lots or the recording of the preliminary plan. If a final plan is not submitted
within five (5) years after preliminary plan approval, that approval shall be
null and void.
   Failure of Borough Council to render a decision and communicate it to the
applicant within the time and in the manner required herein shall be deemed an
approval of the preliminary plan application in terms as pre­ sented unless the
applicant has agreed in writing to an extension of the time or change in the
prescribed manner of presentation of communication of the decision, in which
case, failure to meet the extended time or change in manner of presentation of
communication shall have like effect.
   6.   Signing of Plan by Council. In approving the preliminary plan the
President and Secretary of Council shall sign and date the major original and
three (3) copies of the plan and shall include a notation as to any
modifications required for final plan consideration.
   Borough Council shall return the major original to the applicant for
compliance with submission of the final plan. Copies of the signed preliminary
plan shall be distributed to the County Planning Commission and to the Borough
Planning Commission. One (1) copy shall be retained for Council's files. All
other officials and agencies which previously received copies of the
preliminary plan shall be notified in writing of Council's action.

aspect of the approved final plan pertaining to zoning classification or
density, lot, building, street or utility location.
   2.   Effect on Installation of Required Improvements Beyond the is a
preliminary plan filed Five-Year Period. Where the installation of required

term or terms of three (3) years from the date of approved final plan for each
section.

   No plan shall be finally approved unless the streets shown have been
improved as required by this Part, and any walkways, curbs, gutters, street
lights, fire hydrants, shade trees, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm drains
and any other required improvements have been installed as required by this
Part.
(Ord. 86-2, 5/5/1986; Section 3.01)
§ 302. Guarantee of Completion of Improvements.
   In lieu of the completion of any improvements required as a condition for
the final approval of a plan, the deposit with the Borough of a financial
security shall be required in an amount sufficient to cover the costs of any
improvements or common amenities which may be required, including, but not
limited to, roads, storm water detention and/or retention basins and other
related drainage facilities, recreational facilities, open space improvements,
or buffer or screen plantings.
   1.   Types of Financial Security. Without limitation as to other types of
financial security which the Borough may approve, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, irrevocable letters of credit and restrictive or escrow
accounts from Federal or Commonwealth chartered lending insti­ tutions shall be
deemed acceptable financial security for the purposes of this Chapter.
   2.   Posting of Financial Security. Such financial security shall be posted
with a bonding company or Federal or Commonwealth chartered lending institution
chosen by the party pos ing the financial security, provided said bonding
company or lending institution is authorized to conduct such business within
the Commonwealth.
   3.   Time Period for Completion of Improvements. Such bond or other security
shall provide for, and secure to the public, the completion of any improvements
which may be required within one (1) year of the date fixed in the subdivision
plan for completion of such improvements.
   4.   Amount of Financial Security. The amount of financial security shall be
equal to one hundred ten percent (110%) of the cost of required improvements
for which financial security is posted.
   5.   Establishment of Improvement Cost. The cost of the improvements shall
be established by either (a) submission to Borough Council of a bona fide bid
or bids from the contractor or contractors chosen by the party posting the
financial security to complete the improvements or (b) an estimate prepared by
the Borough Engineer in the absence of such bona fide bids.
   6.   Increase in Time Period and Amount of Financial Security for Completion
of Improvements. If the party posting the financial security requires more than
one (1) year from this date of posting of the financial security to complete
the required improvements, the amount of financial security may be increased by
an additional ten percent (10%) for each one-year period beyond the first
anniversary date from posting of the financial security or to an amount not
exceeding one hundred ten percent (110%) of the cost of completing the required
improvements as reestab­ lished on or about the expiration of the preceding
one-year period by using the bidding procedure described in (5) above.
   7.   Phasing of Developments. In the case where development is pro­ jected
over a period of years, Borough Council may authorize the submission of final
plans by sections or phases of development subject to such requirements or
guarantees as to improvements in future sections or phases of development as it
finds essential for the protection of any finally approved section of the
development.
   8.   Release of Portions of Financial Security. As the work of instal­ ling
the required improvements proceeds, the party posting the financial security
may request Borough Council to release or authorize the release, from time to
time, of such portions of the financial security necessary for payment to the
contractor or contractors performing the work.
   Any such request shall be in writing addressed to Borough Council, and
Council shall have forty-five (45) days from receipt of such request within
which to allow the Borough Engineer to certify, in writing, to Council that
such portion of the work upon the improvements has been completed in accordance
with the approved plan.
   Upon such certification Borough Coun.::i.l shall authorize release by the
bonding company or lending institution of an amount as estimated by the Borough
Engineer as fairly representing the value of the improvements completed.
Failure of Council to act within the said forty-five-day (45) period shall be
deemed an approval of the release of the funds requested,
   Borough Council may, prior to final release at the time of completion and
certification by its Engineer, require retention of ten percent (10%) of the
estimated cost of the aforesaid improvements.
   9.   Financial Security for Maintenance of Improvements. Where Borough
Council accepts dedication of all or some of the required improvements
following completion, it shall require the posting of financial security to
secure structural integrity of said improvements as well as the functioning of
said improvements in accordance with the design and specifications as shown on
the final plan for a term not to exceed eighteen (18) months from the date of
acceptance of dedication.
   Said financial security shall be of the same type as otherwise re­ quired in
this section with regard to installation of such improvements, and the amount
of the financial security shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the actual
cost of installation of said improvements.
   10.   Financial Security for Improvements Under Jurisdiction of Public
Utility or Municipal Authority. If water mains or sanitary sewer lines or both,
along with apparatus or facilities related thereto, are to be instal­ led under
the jurisdiction and pursuant to the rules and regulations of a public utility
or municipal authority separate and distinct from the municipality, financial
security to assure proper completion and mainten­ ance thereof shall be posted
in accordance with the regulations of the controlling public utility or
municipal authority and shall not be included within the financial security as
otherwise required by this section.
   11.   Issuance of Permits When Financial Security Has Been Posted. If
financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion of improve­
ments required as a condition for final plan approval as set forth in this
section, the Borough shall not condition the issuance of zoning, building,
grading or other permits relating to the erection or placement of improve­
ments, including buildings, upon the lots or land as shown on the final plan
upon actual completion of the improvements shown on the approved final plan.
   12.   Certificates of Zoning Compliance (Occupancy) Not to be Withheld Under
Certain Conditions. If said financial security has been provided, certificates

Council may, at its option, install part of such improvements in all or part of
the subdivision or land development and may institute appropriate legal or
equitable action to recover the moneys necessary to complete the remainder of

Part 5
Required Improvements and Design Standards
§ 501. General Improvements
   1.   Conformance to Applicable Rules and Regulations. In addition to the
requirements established herein, all subdivision plans shall comply with the
following laws, rules and regulations:
      A.   All applicable statutory provisions.
      B.   The Borough Zoning Ordinance, building and housing codes, and all
other applicable laws of the appropriate jurisdiction.
      C.   The Comprehensive Plan, Official Map, Public Utilities Plan, and
Capital Improvements Program of the Borough, including all streets and drainage
systems shown on the Comprehensive Plan as adopted.
      D.   The special requirements of these regulations and any rules of the
Department of Environmental Resources or other appropriate state agencies.
      E.   The rules of the State Department of Transportation if the
subdivision or any lot contained therein abuts a state highway or connecting
street.
      F.   The standards and regulations adopted by the Borough Engineer and
all boards, commissions, agencies, and officials of the Borough.
      G.   Plan approval may be withheld if a subdivision is not in conformance
with the above guides or policy and purposes of these regulations as
established in § 501.
   2.   Self-Imposed Restrictions. If the owner places restrictions on any of
the land contained in the subdivision greater than those required by the Zoning
Ordinance or these regulations, such restrictions or reference thereto may be
required to be indicated on the subdivision plan, or the Planning Commission
may require that restrictive covenants be recorded with the County Recorder of
Deeds in a form to be approved by the Borough Solicitor.
   3.   Plans Straddling :Municipal Boundaries. Whenever access to the
subdivision is required across land in another local government, the Planning
Commission may request assurance from the Borough Solicitor that access is
legally established, and from the Borough Engineer that the access road is
adequately improved, or that a performance bond has been duly executed and is
sufficient in amount to assure the construction of the access road. In general,
lot lines should be laid out so as not to cross municipal boundary lines.
   4.   Monuments. The applicant shall place permanent reference monu­ ments in
the subdivision as required herein and as approved by a Registered Land
Surveyor.
      A.   Monuments shall be located on street right-of-way lines, at street
intersections, angle points of curve and block corners. They shall be spaced so
as to be within sight of each other, the sight lines being contained wholly
within the street limits.
      B.   The external boundaries of a subdivision shall be monumented in the
field by monuments of stone or concrete, not less than thirty­ six (36) inches
in length, not less than four (4) inches square, or four (4) inches in
diameter, and marked on the top with a cross, brass plug, iron rod, or other
durable material securely imbedded; or by iron rods or pipes at least thirty-
six (36) inches long and two (2) inches in diameter. These monuments shall be
placed not more than 1,400 feet apart at any straight line and at all corners,
at each end of all curves, at the point where the curve changes its radius, at
all angle points in any line, and at all angle points along the meander line,
said points to be not less than twenty (20) feet back from the bank of any
river or stream, except that when such corners or points fall within a street,
or proposed future street, the monuments shall be placed in the side line of
the street.
      C.   All internal boundaries and those corners and points not referred to
in the preceding paragraph shall be monumented in the field by iron pipes at
least thirty-six (36) inches long and five­ eighths (5/8) inch in diameter or
by round or square bars at least thirty-six (36) inches long. These monuments
shall be placed at all block corners, at each end of all curves, at a point
where a river changes its radius, and at all angle points in any property line
of lots.
      D.   The lines of lots that extend to rivers or streams shall be
monumented in the field by iron pipes at least thirty-six (36) inches long and
five-eighths (5/8) inch in diameter or by round or square bars at least thirty
(30) inches long. These monuments shall be placed at the point of intersection
of the river or stream lot line, with a meander line established no less than
twenty (20) feet back from the bank of the river or stream.
      E.   All such monuments shall be set flush with the ground and planted in
such a manner that they will not be removed by frost.
      F.   All monuments shall be properly set in the ground and approved by a
Registered Land Surveyor prior to the time the Planning Commission recommends
approval of the final plan. The proposed replacement of any existing monuments
shall be clearly indicated on the Final Plan.
   5.   Character of the Land. Land which the Planning Commission finds to be
unsuitable for subdivision or development due to flooding, improper drainage,
steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth formations or topography, utility
easements, or other features which will reasonably be harmful to the safety,
health, and general welfare of the present or future inhabitants of the
subdivision and/or its surrounding areas, shall not be subdivided or developed
unless adequate methods are formulated by the developer and approved by the
Planning Commission, upon recommendation by the Borough Engineer, to solve the
problems created by the unsuitable land conditions, such land shall be set
aside for such uses as shall not involve such a danger.
   6.   Subdivision Name. The proposed name of the subdivision snall not
duplicate, or too closely approximate phonetically, the name of any other
subdivision in the area covered by these regulations. The Planning Commission
shall have authority to recommend to Council the designation of the name of the
subdivision.
(Ord. 86-2, 5/5/1986; Section 5.01)
§ 502. Lot Improvements.
   1.   Lot Arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be
no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in
securing zoning permits to build on all lots in compliance with the Zoning
Chapter and Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources regulations and
in providing driveway access to buildings on such lots from an approved street.
   2.   Lot Dimensions. Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards
of the Zoning Chapter. Where lots are more than double the minimum required
area for the zoning district, the Planning Commission may require that such
lots be arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of future
streets where they would be necessary to serve such potential lots, all in
compliance with the Zoning Chapter and these regulations. In general, side lot
lines shall be at right angles to street lines (or radial to curving street
lines) unless a variation from this rule will give a better street or lot plan.
Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to allow for erection of
buildings, observing the minimum front yard setback from both streets. Depth
and width of properties reserved or laid out for business, commercial, or
industrial pur·poses shall be adequate to provide for the off-street parking
and loading facilities required for the type of use and development
contemplated, as established in the Zoning Chapter.
   3.   Double-Frontage Lots and Access to Lots.
      A.   Double-Frontage Lots. Double-frontage and reversed-frontage lots
shall be avoided except where necessary to provide separation of residential
development from traffic arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of
topography and orientation.
      B.   Access from Arterials. Lots shall not, in general, derive access
exclusively from arterial streets. Where driveway access from an arterial may
be necessary for several adjoining lots, the Planning Commission may require
that such lots be served by a combined access drive in order to limit possible
traffic hazards on such street. Where possible, driveways should be designed
and arranged so as to avoid requiring vehicles to back into traffic arterials.
   4.   Lot Drainage. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage
away from all buildings, and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with
the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage shall be designed so
as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from each lot to adjacent
lots.
   5.   Debris and Waste. No cut trees, timber, debris, junk, rubbish, or other
waste-materials of any kind shall be buried in any land, or left or deposited
on any lot or street at the time of the expiration of the performance bond or
dedication of public improvements, whichever is sooner.
   6.   Fencing. The subdivider or developer shall be required to furnish and
install fences wherever the Planning Connnission determines that a hazardous
condition may exist. Barbed wire will be installed only on a fence with a
minimum height of seven (7) feet. Fences at the corners of street intersections
will be a maximum of three (3) feet in height and located at such a distance
from the corner so as to conform to the clear sight distance referred to in §
503 Table 1.
(Ord. 86-2, 5/5/1986, Section 5.02)
§ 503. Roads
   1.   General Requirements
      A.   Access on Approved Roads. No subdivision shall be approved unless
the area to be subdivided shall have access from an existing State, County, or
Borough Road.
      B.   Grading and Improvement Plan. Roads shall be graded and improved and
conform to Borough construction standards and specifi­ cations and shall be
approved as to design and specifications by the Borough Engineer, in accordance
with the construction plans required to be submitted prior to final plan
approval.
      C.   Topography and Arrangement.
         (1)   Roads shall be related appropriately to the topography. Local
roads shall be curved wherever possible to avoid conformity of lot appearance.
All streets shall be so arranged so as to obtain as many as possible of the
building sites at, or above, the grades of the streets. Grades of streets shall
conform as closely as possible to the original topography. A combination of
steep grades and curves shall be avoided. Specific standards are contained in
the design standards of these regulations.
         (2)   All streets shall be properly integrated with the dedicated
existing and proposed system of thoroughfares and rights-of-way as established
in the Comprehensive Plan.
         (3)   All through fares shall be properly related to specific traffic
generators such as industries, business districts, schools, churches, and
shopping centers; to population densities and to the pattern of existing and
proposed land uses.
         (4)   Minor or local streets shall be laid out to conform as much as
possible to the topography, to discourage use by through­ traffic, to permit
efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of
streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property.
         (5)   The rigid, rectangular grid iron pattern need not necessarily be
adhered to, and the use of curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs, or U-shaped
streets shall be encouraged where such use will result in a more desirable
layout.
         (6)   Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the
tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topo­ graphy or other physical
conditions, or unless in the opinion of the Planning Commission such extension
is not necessary or such extension is not necessary or desirable for the
coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the existing layout or the
most advantageous future development on adjacent tracts.
      D.   Blocks.
         (1)   Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two
         (2)   tiers of lots of appropriate depths. Exceptions to this
prescribed block width shall be permitted in blocks adjacent to major streets,
railroads, or waterways.
         (2)   The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be such as are
appropriate for the locality and the type of development contemplated, but
block lengths in residential areas shall not exceed two thousand, two hundred
(2,200) feet or twelve (12) times the minimum lot width required in the zoning
district, nor be less that for hundred (400) feet in length. Whenever pract­
icable, blocks along arterials and collector streets shall not be less than one
thousand (1,000) feet in length.
         (3)   In long blocks the Planning Connnission may require the
reservation of an easement through the block to accommodate utilities, drainage
facilities, or pedestrian traffic.
      Pedestrian ways or crosswalks, not less than ten (10) feet wide, may be
required by the Planning Commission through the center of blocks more than
eight hundred (800) feet long where deemed essential to provide circulation or
access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation, or other
community facilities. Blocks designed for industrial uses shall be of such
length and width as may be determined suitable by the Planning Commission for
prospective use.
      E.   Access to Arterials. Where a subdivision borders on or contains an
existing or proposed arterial, the Planning Connnission may require that access
to such streets be limited by one of the following means:
         (1)   The subdivision of lots so as to back onto the arterial and
front onto a parallel local street; no access shall be provided from the
arterial, and screening shall be provided in a strip of land along the rear
property line of such lots.
         (2)   A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loops
entered from and designed generally at right angles to such a parallel street,
with the rear lines of their terminal lots backing onto the arterial.
         (3)   A marginal access or service road (separated from the arterial
by a planting or grass strip and having access thereto at suitable points).
      F.   Road Names. Any sketch plans submitted shall not indicate any names
upon proposed streets. The Planning Commission shall name all roads at the time
of preliminary plan approval. The local Post­ master should be consulted in
this regard. Names shall be suffi­ ciently different in sound and in spelling
from other road names in the Borough so as not to cause confusion. A road which
is or is planned as a continuation of an existing road shall bear the same
name.
      G.   Road Regulatory Signs. The applicant shall deposit with the Borough
at the time of final plan approval the requisite sum for each road sign
required by the Borough Engineer at all road intersections. The Borough shall
install all road signs before any residence on an approved street is occupied.
      H.   Street Lights. Installation of street lights, when required, shall
be in accordance with design and specification standards ap­ proved by the
Borough Engineer.
      I.   Reserve Strips. The creation of reserve strips shall not be
permitted adjacent to a proposed street in such a manner as to deny access from
adjacent property to such street.
      J.   Construction of Roads and Dead-End Roads.
         (1)   Construction of Roads. The arrangement of streets shall provide
for the continuation of principal streets between adjacent properties when such
continuation is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire
protection, for efficient provision of utilities, and where such continuation
is in accordance with the Borough plan. If the adjacent property is undeveloped
and the street must be a dead-end street temporarily, the right-of-way shall be
extended to the property line. A temporary T- or L-shaped turnabout shall be
provided on all temporary dead-end streets, with a notation on the subdivision
plan that land outside the normal street right-of-way shall revert to abuttors
whenever the street is continued. The Plan­ ning Commission may limit the
length of temporary dead-end streets in accordance with the design standards of
these regula­ tions.
         (2)   Dead-End Roads (Permanent). Where a road does not extend to the
boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not required by the
Planning Commission for access to adjoining property, its terminous shall
normally not be nearer to such boundary than fifty (SO) feet. However, the
Planning Commission may require the reservation of an appropriate easement to
accom­ modate drainage facilities, pedestrian traffic, or utilities. A cul-de-
sac turnaround shall be provided at the end of a permanent dead-end street in
accordance with Borough construction standards and specifications. For greater
convenience to traffic and more effective police and fire protection, permanent
dead-end streets shall, in general, be limited in length in accordance with the
design standards of these regulations.
   2.   Design Standards
      A.   General. In order to provide for roads of suitable location, width,
and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory
access to police, firefighting, snow removal, sanitation, and road-maintenance
equipment, and to coordinate roads so as to compose a convenient system and
avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties, the following design standards
for roads are hereby required. (If the classification of a road is not
indicated in the Comprehensive Plan, it shall be determined by the Planning
Commission according to the definitions herein and designation as found in
Table 1 herein.)
      B.   Road Surfacing and Improvements. After sewer and water utilities, if
required, have been installed by the developer, the applicant shall construct
curbs and gutters and surface or cause to be surfaced roadways to the widths
prescribed in these regulations as a condition precedent to final approval of
the plan.
   Types of pavement shall meet the specifications of the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation as determined by the Engineer. (See PennDOT
Publication 70, latest edition.) provision shall be made for culverts, drains,
and bridges accordance with Pennsylvania Department of Transportation ­ Borough
Adequate also in specifications.
All road pavement, shoulders, drainage improvements, and struc­ tures, curbs,
turnarounds, and sidewalks shall conform to all cons­ truction standards and
specifications adopted by the Planning Commission, Borough Engineer, or Borough
Council and shall be incor­ porated into the construction plans required to be
submitted by the developer for plan approval.
      C.   Excess Right-of-Way. Right-of-way widths in excess of the standards
designated in these regulations shall be required whenever, due to topography,
additional width is necessary to provide adequate earth slopes. Such slopes
shall not be in excess of three to one.
      D.   Railroads and Limited Access Highways. Railroad rights­ of-way and
limited access highways where so located as to affect the subdivision of
adjoining lands shall be treated as follows:
         (1)   In residential districts a buffer strip at least twenty-five
(25) feet in depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the
district shall be provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited
access highway. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be
designated on the plan: "This strip is reserved for screening. The placement of
structures hereon is prohibited."
         (2)   In districts zoned for business, commercial, or industrial uses
the nearest street extending alley to the railroad shall, wherever practicable,
be at a sufficient distance there­ from to ensure suitable depth for commercial
and industrial sit es.
         (3)   Streets parallel to the railroad when intersecting a street
which crosses the railroad at grade shall, to the extent practicable, be at a
distance of at least one hundred fifty (150) feet from the railroad right-of-
way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum
distance re­ quired for future separation of grades by means appropriate
gradients.
      E.   Intersections.
         (1)   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as
possible at right angles. A proposed intersection of two (2) new streets at an
angle of less than seventy-five (75) degrees shall not be acceptable. An
oblique street should be curved approaching an intersection and should be
approximately at right angles for at least one hundred (100) feet therefrom.
Not more than two (2) streets shall intersect at any one point unless
specifically approved by the Planning Commission.
         (2)   Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street
shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the
opposite side of such street. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than
one hundred fifty (150) feet shall not be permitted, except where the inter­
sected street has separated dual drives without median breaks at either
intersection, where streets intersect major streets, their alignment shall be
continuous. Intersection of major streets shall be at least eight hundred (800)
feet apart.
         (3)   Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two (2) local streets
shall be at least twenty (20) feet; and minimum curb radius at an intersection
involving a collector street shall be at least twenty-five (25) feet. Alley
intersections and abrupt changes in alignment within a block shall have the
corners cut off in accordance with standard engineering practice to permit safe
vehicular movement.
         (4)   Intersections shall be designed with a flat Grade wherever
practical. In hilly or rolling acres, at the approach to an intersection, a
leveling area shall be provided having not greater than a two percent (2%) rate
at a distance of sixty (60) feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line
of the intersecting street.
         (5)   Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or
existing vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by
limiting visibility, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation
(including trees) in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to
the extent deemed necessary to provide an adequate sight distance.
         (6)   The cross-slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall
be a maximum of 5 and a minimum of 2.
      F.   Bridges. Bridges of primary benefit to the applicant, as determined
by the Planning Commission, shall be construction at the full expense of the
applicant without reimbursement from the Borough Council. The sharing of
expense for the construction of bridges not of primary benefit to the
applicant, as determined by the Planning Commission, will be fixed by special
agreement between the Borough Council and the applicant. Said cost shall be
charged to the app­ licant pro-rata as the percentage of his land developed and
so served.
   3.   Road Dedications and Reservations.
      A.   New Perimeter Streets. Street systems in new subdivisions shall be
laid out so as to eliminate or avoid new perimeter half- streets. Where an
existing half-street is adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the
adjacent street shall be improved and dedicated by the subdivider. The Planning
Commission may authorize a new perimeter street where the subdivider improves
and dedicates the entire required street right-of-way width within his own
subdivision boundaries.
      B.   Widening and Realignment of Existing Roads. Where a subdivision
borders an existing narrow road or when the Comprehensive Plan, Official Map,
or zoning setback regulations indicate plans for realignment or widening a road
that would require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the applicant
shall be required to improve and dedicate at his expense such areas for
widening or realignment of such roads. Such frontage roads and streets shall be
improved and dedicated by the applicant at his own expense to the full width as
required by these subdivision regulations. Land reserved for any road purposes
may not be counted in satisfying yard or area requirements of the Zoning
Chapter whether the land is to be dedicated to the Borough in fee simple or an
easement is granted to the Borough Council.
(Ord. 86-2, 5/5/1986, Section 5.03; as amended by Ord. 04-9, 11/1/2004, §1)

§ 504. Water Facilities.
   1.   General Requirements.
      A.   Necessary action shall be taken by the applicant to extend or create
a water supply district for the purpose of providing a water supply system
capable of providing domestic water use and fire protec­ tion.
      B.   Where a public water main is accessible, the subdivider shall
install adequate water facilities (including fire hydrants) subject to the
specifications of the Borough. All water mains shall be at least six (6) inches
in diameter.
      C.   Water main extensions shall be approved by the Borough.
      D.   To facilitate the above, the location of all fire hydrants, all
water supply improvements, and the boundary lines of all proposed districts,
indicating all improvements proposed to be served, shall be shown on the
Preliminary Plan, and the cost of installing the same shall be included in a
performance bond to be furnished by the developer.
   2.   Individual Wells and Central Water Systems.
      A.   In the discretion of the Planning Commission, if a public water
system is not available in certain areas of the Borough, individ­ ual wells may
be used.
      B.   If the Planning Commission requires that a connection to a public
water main be eventually provided as a condition to approval of an individual
well or central for future water service at the time the plan receives final
approval. Performance bonds or other form of financial security may be required
to insure compliance.
   3.   Fire Hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be required for all subdivisions
except those coming under § 504(2), above. Fire hydrants shall be located no
more than one thousand, two hundred (1,200) feet apart and within five hundred
(500) feet of any structure and shall be approved by the local Volunteer Fire
Department. To eliminate future street openings, all underground utilities for
fire hydrants, improvements shall be installed before any final paving of a
street shown on the subdivision plan.
(Ord. 86-2, 5/5/1986; Section 5.04)
§ 505. Sewerage Facilities.
   1.   General Requirements. The applicant shall install sanitary sewer
facilities in a manner prescribed by the construction standards and
specifications of the Borough. All plans shall be designed in accordance with
the rules, regulations, and standards of the Borough Engineer and other
appropriate agencies. Plans shall be approved by the above agencies. Necessary
action shall be taken by the applicant to extend or create a sanitary sewer
district for the purpose of providing sewerage facilities to the subdivision
where no district exists for the land to be subdivided.
   2.   Residential Districts not having Public Sewers. Sanitary sewerage
systems shall be constructed as follows:
      A.   Where a public sanitary sewerage system is reasonably accessible,
the applicant shall connect with the system and provide sewers accessible to
each lot in the subdivision.
      B.   Where public sanitary sewerage systems are not reasonably accessible
but will become available within a reasonable period of time (not to exceed
five (5) years), the applicant may choose one of the following alternatives:
         (1)   Central Sewerage System. The maintenance cost shall be assessed
against each property benefitted. Where plans for future public sanitary
sewerage systems exist, the applicant shall install the sewer lines, laterals,
and mains to be in permanent conformance with such plans and ready for
connection to such public sewer drains or
         (2)   Individual Disposal Systems. These shall be allowed, provided
the applicant shall install sanitary sewer lines, laterals, and mains from the
street curb to a point in the subdivision boundary where a future connection
with the public sewer main shall be made. Sewer lines shall be laid from the
house to the street line, and a connection shall be available in the house to
connect from the individual disposal system to the sewer system when the public
sewers become available. Such sewer systems shall be capped unt.il ready for
use and shall conform to all plans for installation of the public sewer system,
and shall be ready for connection to such public sewer main.
      C.   Where sanitary sewer systems are not reasonably accessible and will
not become available for a period in excess of five (5) years, the applicant
may install sewerage systems as follows:
         (1)   Medium-Density Residential Districts. A central sewerage system
shall only be used. An individual disposal system shall be permitted. Where
plans exist for a public sewer system to be built, for a period in excess of
five (5) years, the applicant shall install all sewer lines, laterals, and
mains to be in permanent conformance with such plans and ready for connection
to such public sewer main.
         (2)   Low-Density Residential Districts. Individual disposal systems
or central sewerage systems shall be used.
         (3)   Mandatory Connection to Public Sewer System. If a public
sanitary sewer is accessible and a sanitary sewer is placed in a street or
alley abutting upon property, the owner thereof shall be required to connect to
said sewer for the purpose of disposing of waste, and it shall be unlawful for
any such owner or occupant to maintain upon any such property an individual
sewage disposal system.
         (4)   Individual Disposal System Requirements. If public sewer
facilities are not available and individual disposal systems are proposed,
either for temporary or permanent disposal service, minimum lot areas shall
conform to the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 27), but in no
case shall a lot be less than two (2) acres. Approval by the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection of a sewage-planning module for the
proposed subdivision shall be obtained prior to final plan approval. Test sites
and proposed system locations shall be depicted on the subdivision plat. [Ord.
02-3]
         (5)   Design Criteria for Sanitary Sewers.
            (a)   General Requirements. These criteria are not intended to
cover extraordinary situations. Deviations will be allowed and may be required
in those instances where considered justified by the Borough Engineer.
            (b)   Design Factors. Sanitary sewer systems should be designed for
the ultimate tributary population. Due consider­ ation should be given to
current Zoning regulations and approved planning and zoning reports where
applicable. Sewer capacities should be adequate to handle the anticipated
maximum hourly quantity of sewage and industrial waste together with an
adequate allowance for infiltration and other extraneous flow. The unit design
flows presented hereinafter should be adequate in each case for the particular
type of development indicated. Sewers shall be designed for the total tributary
area using the following criteria:
One-and two-family dwelling               .02 cubic feet per second (c.f.s.)
per acre
Apartments
One and two story                     .02 c.f. s./acre
Three through six story                  .03 c.f. s./acre
Commercial
Small stores, offices & miscellaneous businesses      .02 c.f. s./acre
Shopping centers                      .02 c.f. s./acre
Industrial                        As directed by the Borough Engineer
   These design factors shall apply to watersheds of 300 acres or less. Design
factors for watersheds larger than 300 acres and smaller than 1,000 acres shall
be computed on the basis of a linear decrease from the applicable design factor
of .01 c.f.s./acre for an area of 1,000 acres unless otherwise directed by the
Borough Engineer. Design factors for water­sheds larger than 1,000 acres shall
be .01 c.f.s./ acre unless otherwise directed by the Borough Engineer.
            (c)   Maximum Size. The diameter of sewers proposed shall not
exceed the diameter of the existing or proposed outlet, whichever is
applicable, unless otherwise approved by the Borough Engineer.
            (d)   Minimum Size. No public sewer shall be less than eight (8)
inches in diameter.
            (e)   Minimum Slope. All sewers shall be designed to give mean
velocities when flowing full of not less than 2.0 feet per second. All velocity
and flow calculations shall be based on the Manning Formula using an N value of
0.013. The design slopes shall be evenly divisible by four (4). The slopes
shall be minimum for the size indicated. Exceptions to these minimum slopes
shall be made at the upper end of lateral sewers serving under thirty (30)
houses. Said sewers shall have a minimum slope of O. 76 percent. Where lateral
sewers serve fewer than (10) houses, the minimum slope shall be not less than
one percent (1%). (See Table 2.)
Table 2
MINIMUM SLOPES FOR SEWER SIZE INDICATED
Sewer Size  Minimum Slope
(in inches) (in feet per 100 feet)
8           0.40
10          0.28
12          0.22
15          0.15
18          0.12
21          0.10
24          0.08
            (f)   Alignment. All sewers shall be laid with straight alignment
between manholes, unless otherwise directed or approved by the Borough
Engineer.
            (g)   Manhole Location. Manholes shall be installed at the end of
each line; at all changes in grade, size, or alignment; at all intersections
and at distances not greater than 400 feet for sewers 15 inches in diameter and
smaller, and 500 feet for sewers 18 inches in diameter and larger.
            (h)   Manholes. The difference in elevation between any incoming
sewer and the manhole invert shall not exceed twelve (12) inches. The use of
drop manholes will require approval by the Borough Engineer. The minimum inside
diameter of the manholes shall conform to those specified by the Borough
Engineer. Inside drop manholes will require special consider­ ations; however,
in no case shall the minimum clear distance be less than that indicated above.
When a smaller sewer joins a larger one, the crown of the smaller sewer shall
not be lower than that of the larger one. The minimum drop through manholes
shall be 0.2 feet.
            (i)   Sewerage Locations. Sanitary sewers shall be located within
street or alley rights-of-way unless topography indicates otherwise. When
located in easements on private property, access shall be to all manholes. A
manhole shall be provided at each street or alley crossing. End lines shall be
extended to provide access from street or alley rights-of-way where possible.
Imposed loading shall be considered at all locations. The Borough Engineer
shall review cover require­ ments and pipe specifications. Buildings shall be
set back at least ten (10) feet from the easement line.
            (j)   Cleanouts and Lampholes. Cleanouts and lampholes shall not be
permitted.
            (k)   Water Supply Interconnections. There shall be no physical
connection between a public or private potable water supply system and a sewer
which will permit the passage of any sewage or polluted water into the potable
supply. Sewers shall be kept removed from the water supply wells or other water
supply sources and structures.
            (l)   Relation of Sewers to Water Mains. A minimum horizontal
distance of ten (10) feet shall be maintained between parallel water and sewer
lines. At points where sewers cross water mains, the sewers shall be
constructed of cast iron pipe or encased in concrete for a distance of ten (10)
feet in each direction from the crossing, measured perpendicu­ lar to the water
line. This will not be required when the water main is at least two (2) feet
above the sewer.
(Ord. 86-2, 5/5/1986; Section 5.05; as amended by Ord. 02-3, 3/4/2002, §1)
§ 506. Stormwater Drainage.
   1.   General Requirements. The Planning Commission shall not recommend for
approval any subdivision plan which does not make adequate provision for storm
or flood water runoff channels, basins, and detention facilities. The storm
water drainage system shall be separate and independent of any sanitary sewer
system. Storm sewers, where required, shall be designed by the Rational Method,
or other methods as approved by the Planning Commission, and a copy of design
computations shall be submitted along with plans. When calculations indicate
that curb capacities are exceeded at a point, no further allowance shall be
made for flow beyond that point. Surface water drainage patterns shall be shown
generally.
   2.   Nature of Storm Water Facilities.
      A.   Location. The applicant may be required by the Planning Commission
to carry away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist
either previously to, or as a result of, the subdivision. Such drainage
facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible, or in
perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate width, and shall be constructed
in accordance with construc­ tion standards and specifications acceptable to
the Planning Commission.
      B.   Accessibility to Public Storm Sewers. Where a public storm sewer is
accessible, the applicant shall install storm sewer facilities, or if no
outlets are within a reasonable distance, adequate provision shall be made for
the disposal of storm waters, subject to the specifi­ cations of the Borough
Engineer. However, in subdivisions containing lots less than 20,000 square feet
in area and in business and industrial districts, underground storm sewer
systems shall be constructed throughout the subdivisions and be conducted to an
approved outfall. Inspection of facilities shall be conducted by the Borough
Engineer.
      C.   Accommodation of Upstream Drainage Areas. A culvert or other
drainage facility shall in each case be large enough to accommodate potential
runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the
subdivision. The Borough Engineer shall determine the necessary size of the
facility, based on the provisions of the construc­ tion standards and
specifications assuming conditions of maximum potential watershed development
permitted by the Zoning Chapter.
      D.   Effect on Downstream Drainage Areas. The Borough Engineer shall also
study the effect of each subdivision on existing downstream drainage facilities
outside the area of the subdivision. The Borough drainage studies together with
such other studies as shall be appropri­ ate, shall serve as a guide to needed
improvements. Where it is anticipated that the additional runoff incident to
the development of the subdivision will overload an existing downstream
drainage facility, the Planning Commission may withhold approval of the
subdivision until provision has been made for the improvement of said potential
condition. No subdivision shall be approved unless adequate drainage will be
provided to an adequate drainage watercourse or facility.
      E.   Areas of Poor Drainage. Whenever a plan is submitted for an area
which is subject to poor drainage, the Planning Commission may approve such
subdivision provided that the applicant fills the affected area of such
subdivision to an elevation sufficient to provide positive drainage, as
determined by the Borough Engineer.
      F.   Flood Plain Areas. Development of flood plain areas shall be subject
to the provisions of the Borough's Flood Plain Chapter.
   3.   Dedication of Drainage Easements.
      A.   General Requirements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a
watercourse, drainage way, channel, or stream, there shall be provided a storm
water easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially to the lines
of such watercourse, and of such width and construction or both as will be
adequate for the purpose. Wherever possible, it is desirable that the drainage
be maintained by an open channel with landscaped banks and adequate width for
maximum potential volume of flow.
      B.   Drainage Easements.
         (1)   Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within road rights-of-way,
perpetual unobstructed easements at least twenty (20) feet in width for such
drainage facilities shall be provided across property outside the road lines
and with satisfactory access to the road. Drainage easements shall be carried
from the road to the natural watercourse or other drainage facilities.
         (2)   When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private
land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and
indicated on the plan.
   The applicant shall dedicate, either in fee or by drainage or conservation
easement, land on both sides of existing watercourses, to a distance to be
determined by the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 86-2, 5/5/1986; Section 5.06)
§ 507. Erosion and Sediment Control.
   1.   General Requirements. No changes shall be made in the contour of the
land; no grading, excavating, removal or destruction of the topsoil, trees or
other vegetative cover of the land shall be commenced; and no subdivision or
land development plan shall be approved unless:
      A.   There has been a plan approved by the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Resources or the County Soil and Water Conservation District that
provides for minimizing erosion and sedimentation consistent with this
Subsection 1 or
      B.   There has been a determination by the Borough Planning Corrnnission
that a plan for minimizing erosion and sedimenta·tion is not necessary.
   2.   State Requirements. Measures used to control erosion and reduce
sedimentation shall, as a minimum, be in accordance with the Rules and
Regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources and/or
the standards and specifications set forth in the Soil Erosion and
Sedimentation Control Manual (published by the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Resources) as well as those set forth in this Section.
   3.   Drainage Areas in Excess of 320 Acres. Stream channel construction on
watersheds with drainage areas in excess of 320 acres, or in those cases where
downstream hazards exist, shall conform to criteria administered by the
Division of Dams and Encroachments, Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Resources.
   4.   Compliance. The Borough Engineer shall ensure compliance with the
appropriate erosion and sedimentation control plans and specifications.
   5.   Flood Plain Chapter. Compliance with the Borough's Flood Plain Chapter
is also required.
   6.   Performance Requirements. The following measures are effective in
minimizing erosion sedimentation and shall be included where applicable in the
control plan.
      A.   Stripping of vegetation, regrading, or other development shall be
done in a way that will minimize erosion.
      B.   Development plans shall preserve the salient natural features, keep
cut-fill operations to a minimum, and ensure conformity with topography so as
to create the least erosion potential and adequately handle the volume and
velocity of surface water runoff.
(22, §S07(6)(C))   (22, §507(6)(C))
      C.   Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected,
and supplemented.
      D.   The disturbed area and the duration of exposure shall be kept to a
practical minimum.
      E.   Disturbed soils shall be stabilized as quickly as prac­ ticable.
      F.   Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect
exposed critical areas during development.
      G.   The permanent (final) vegetation and structural erosion control and
drainage measures shall be installed as soon as practical in the development.
      H.   Provisions shall be made to effectively accommodate the increased
runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after
development. Where necessary, the rate of surface water runoff will be
structurally retarded.
      I.   Sediment in the runoff water shall be trapped until the disturbed
area is stabilized by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or
similar measures.
   7.   Grading and Drainage Requirements. In order to provide more suitable
sites for building and other uses, improved surface drainage, and control
erosion, the following requirements shall be met:
      A.   All lots, tracts, or parcels shall be graded to provide proper
drainage away from buildings and dispose of the runoff without ponding, and all
land within a development shall be graded to drain and dispose of surface water
without ponding, except where other arrangements are approved by the
Commission.
      B.   All drainage provisions shall be of such design to adequately handle
the surface runoff and carry it to the nearest suitable outlet such as a curbed
street, storm drain, or natural water course. Where drainage swales are used to
divert surface waters away from buildings, they shall be sodded or planted and
shall be of such slope, shape and size as to conform with the requirements of
the Borough and/or the standards of the Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control
Manual.
      C.   Concentration of surface water runoff shall only be permitted in
swales or watercourses.
   8.   Cuts and Fills. The following standards shall be applied as needed in
cuts and fills as part of erosion and sediment controls:
      A.   Adequate provisions shall be made to prevent surface water from
damaging the cut face of excavations or the sloping surfaces of fills.
      B.   Cuts and fills shall not endanger adjoining property.
      C.   Unless an adequate retaining wall, cribbing, or structure is
provided:
         (1)   Fill slopes shall not be steeper than three (3) feet of
horizontal measurement for one (1) foot of vertical measurement; and
         (2)   Cut slopes shall not be steeper than two (2) feet of horizontal
measurement for one (1) foot of vertical measurement.
      D.   Fill shall be placed and mechanically compacted so as to minimize
sliding or erosion of the soil.
      E.   Fills shall not encroach on natural watercourses or con­ structed
channels.
      F.   Fills placed adjacent to natural watercourses or constructed
channels shall have suitable protection against erosion during periods of
flooding.
      G.   Grading will not be done in such a way so as to divert water or fill
onto the property of another landowner without the expressed consent of the
Commission and the affected landowner.
      H.   During grading operations necessary measures for dust control will
be exercised.
      I.   Top soil shall be preserved and redistributed as cover and shall be
expeditiously planted with perennial grasses or ground cover.
      J.   Tree guards during construction and draining and limitations as to
cuts and fills, both temporary and permanent, near trees shall be provided as
unnecessary to give reasonable assurance of their continued healthy growth.
      K.   Grading equipment will not be allowed to cross live streams.
Provision will be made for the installation of culverts or bridges.
(Ord. 86-2, 5/5/1986; Section 5.07)

§ 510. Public Uses.
   1.   Parks, Playgrounds, and Recreation Areas
      A.   Recreation Standards. The Planning Commission may request that land
be reserved for parks, playgrounds, or other recreation purposes in locations
designated in the Comprehensive Plan or other­ wise where such reservations
would be appropriate. Each reservation should be of suitable size, dimension,
character, and topography and should have adequate road access for its
particular purpose. Such area shall be shown and marked on the preliminary plan
as "Reserved for Park and/or Recreation Purposes". When recreation areas are to
be provided, the developer should determine the number of acres to be reserved
from the following table, which is based on the provision of three (3) acres of
recreation area for every one hundred (100) dwel­ ling units. The Planning
Commission shall refer such proposed reser­ vations to the Borough official or
commission in charge of parks and recreation for recommendation.

Residential                   number of dwelling units for the site and
                              on the type of occupancy.
      B.   Financial Security. Where a developer proposes to provide parks,
playgrounds, and recreation areas, such improvements shall be included in the
performance bond or other financial security if not to be completed before
final plan approval.
   2.   Other Public Uses.
      A.   Community Facilities Plan. Whenever a tract to be subdivided
includes a site for a school or other public use, as indicated in the Community
Facilities Plan of the Borough's Comprehensive Plan, such space shall be
incorporated by the applicant into the preliminary plan.
      B.   Referral to Appropriate Public Agency. The Planning Com­ mission
shall refer the preliminary plan to the appropriate public agency involved with
the acquisition of such site for a determination of the agency's intent to
acquire the proposed site or an alternative site. Upon receipt of an
affirmative report from such agency the Planning Commission shall notify the
property owner and shall desig­ nate on the preliminary and final plans the
site to be acquired by the public agency.
      C.   Land Reservation, Where sites are identified for eventual public
acquisition in an Official Map Ordinance or an adopted Compre­ hensive Plan, no
building or development shall be permitted for a period of twelve (12) months
after the owner of such property submits an application to build or develop and
applies for necessary permits. The reservation for public ground shall then
elapse within twelve (12) months unless the landowner consents in writing to an
extension of time or the Borough Council begins condemnation proceedings.
(Ord. 86-2, 5/5/1986; Section 5.10)
§ 511. Preservation of Natural Features and Amenities.
   1.   General. Existing features which would add value to residential
development or to the Borough as a whole, such as trees, watercourses, historic
sites, and similar irreplaceable assets, should be preserved in the design of
the subdivision or land development, if possible.
(Ord. 86-2, 5/5/1986; Section 5.11)   --
§ 512. Nonresidential Subdivisions.
   1.   General. If a proposed subdivision includes land that is zoned for
commercial or industrial purposes, the layout of the subdivision or land
development with respect to such land shall make such provision as the Planning
Commission may require.
   A nonresidential subdivision or land development shall also be subject to
all the requirements of site plan approval set forth in the Zoning Chapter.
Site plan approval and nonresidential subdivision plan approval may proceed
simultaneously at the discretion of the Planning Commission. A nonresidential
subdivision shall be subject to all the requirements of these regulations as
such additional standards required by the Planning Commission and shall conform
to the proposed land use standards established in the Comprehensive Plan,
Official Map, and Zoning Chapter.

Each mobile home site shall also be provided with a poured concrete outdoor
patio one (1) foot deep and at least one hundred eighty ( 180) square feet in
the area at the main entrance to the mobile home. The mobile home shall be
required to be provided with anchors and tie-downs which are able to sustain a
total tensile load equal to four times the weight of the particular mobile
home.
   3.   Mobile Home Lot and Parking Requirements. Lot area, dimension, setback,
and coverage regulations shall comply with the Zoning Chapter. Parking
requirements for each mobile home lot shall also comply with the standards of
the Zoning Chapter.
   4.   Buffer Areas. All mobile home parks shall be bounded by a buffer area
ten (10) feet in depth as measured at right angles to the tract boundary lines.

access roads cross it.
   5.   Ingress and Egress. Access points to public streets from a mobile home
park shall be located no less that two hundred fifty (250) feet from any public
street intersection. Streets within the mobile home park shall be constructed
to Borough specifications as described in Part 5, except that the Planning
Corrnnission may allow for one-way streets, provided access by fire and other
emergency vehicles is not impaired and provided the street plan is reviewed and
approved by the Borough Engineer.
   6.   Sidewalks. All mobile home parks shall be provided with safe,
convenient, all season pedestrian walks of ID-2 Bituminous concrete or Portland
cement concrete to a depth and width approved by the Borough Engineer between
individual mobile homes and streets and all park facil­ ities provided for the
residents. Walkways serving park facilities shall have a minimum width of four
(4) feet.
   7.   Recreation Areas. All mobile home parks shall be provided with a
recreation area for mobile home park residents. A recreation area shall be no
less than five (5%) percent of the total area of the park. Such an area shall
be appropriately developed with recreation facilities and easily accessible to
all homes in the park.
   8.   Laundromats. At least one (1) laundromat shall be provided for every
mobile home park for the exclusive use of residents of that park. At least one
(1) washer for every ten (10) mobile homes and one (1) dryer for every fifteen
(15) mobile homes shall be provided unless it can be shown to the satisfaction

delivered, accepted or presented for recording, shall be subject to pay for and
in respect to the transaction or any part thereof, a tax at the rate of one
percent (1%) of the value of the real estate represented by such document,
which tax shall be payable at the earlier of the time the document is presented
for recording or within thirty (30) days of acceptance of such document or
within thirty (30) days of becoming an acquired company.
   2.   The payment of the tax imposed herein shall be evidenced by the
affixing of an official stamp or writing by the recorder of deeds whereon the
date of the payment of the tax, amount of the tax and the signature of the
collecting agent shall be set forth.
   3.   It is the intent of this Part that the entire burden of the tax imposed
herein on a person or transfer shall not exceed the limitations prescribed in
the Local Tax Enabling Act, Act of December 31, 1965, P.L. 1257, 53 P.S. §6901
et seq., so that if any other political subdivision shall impose or hereafter
shall impose such tax on the same person or transfer then the tax levied by the
Borough Council under the authority of that Act shall during the time such
duplication of the tax exists, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, be
one-half (1/2) of the rate and such one-half (1/2) shall become effective
without any action on the part of the Borough Council provided, however, that
the Borough of Shamokin Dam and any other political subdivision which impose
such tax on the same person or transfer may agree that, instead of limiting
their respective rates to one-half (1/2) of the rate herein provided, they will
impose respectively different rates, the total of which shall not exceed the
maximum rate permitted under "The Local Tax Enabling Act."
   4.   If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate in
effect at the time the tax is due, shall be added and collected.
(Ord. 79-6, 5/7/1979; as revised by Ord. 88-3, 10/17/1988)
§ 105. Exempt Parties.
   The United States, the Commonwealth or any of their instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions shall be exempt from payment of the tax
imposed by this Part. The exemption of such governmental bodies shall not,
however, relieve any other party to a transaction from liability for the tax.
(Ord. 79-6, 5/7/1979; as revised by Ord. 88-3, 10/17/1988)
§ 106. Excluded Transactions.
   The tax imposed by §4 shall not be imposed upon:
      A.   A transfer to the Commonwealth, or to any of its instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions, by gift, dedication or deed in lieu of
condemnation or deed or confirmation in connection with condemnation
proceedings, or a reconveyance by the condemning body of the property condemned
to the owner of record at the time of condemnation which reconveyance may
include property line adjustments provided said reconveyance is made within one
(1) year from the date of condemnation.
      B.   A document which the Borough of Shamokin Dam is prohibited from
taxing under the Constitution or statutes of the United States.
      C.   A conveyance to a municipality, township, school district or county
pursuant to acquisition by the municipality, township, school district or
county of a tax delinquent property at sheriff sale or tax claim bureau sale.
      D.   A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration which corrects or
confirms a transfer previously recorded, but which does not extend or limit
existing record legal title or interest.
      E.   A transfer or division in kind for no or nominal actual
consideration of property passed by testate or intestate succession and held by
covenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in value than
their undivided interest, tax is due on the excess.
      F.   A transfer between husband and wife, between persons who were
previously husband and wife who have since been divorced, provided the property
or interest therein subject to such transfer was acquired by the husband and
wife or husband or wife prior to the granting of the final decree in divorce,
between parent and child or the spouse of such child, between brother or sister
or spouse of a brother or sister, and between a grandparent and grandchild or
the spouse of such grandchild, except that a subsequent transfer by the grantee
within one (1) year shall be subject to tax as if the grantor were making such
transfer.
      G.   A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration of property
passing by testate or intestate succession from a personal representative of a
decedent to the decedent’s devisee or heir.
      H.   A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration to a trustee of an
ordinary trust where the transfer of the same property would be exempt if the
transfer was made directly from the grantor to all of the possible
beneficiaries, whether or not such beneficiaries are contingent or specifically
named. No such exemption shall be granted unless the recorder of deeds is
presented with a copy of the trust instrument that clearly identifies the
grantor and all possible beneficiaries.

under this Part. Where the document by which title is acquired by a grantee or
statement of value fails to set forth that the property was acquired by the
grantee from, or for the benefit of, his principal, there is a rebuttable
presumption that the property is the property of the grantee in his individual
capacity if the grantee claims an exemption from taxation under this clause.
      L.   A transfer made pursuant to the statutory merger or consolidation of
a corporation or statutory division of a nonprofit corporation, except where
the department reasonably determines that the primary intent for such merger,
consolidation or division is avoidance of the tax imposed by this Part.

record in the name of the corporation or association where the grantee owns
stock of the corporation or an interest in the association in the same
proportion as his interest in or ownership of the real estate being conveyed
and where the stock of the corporation or the interest in the association has
been held by the grantee for more than two (2) years.

development, transportation, energy conversion, energy production, pollution
control, warehousing or agriculture; and (ii) the agency or authority has the
full ownership interest in the real estate transferred.
      P.   A transfer by a mortgagor to the holder of a bona fide mortgage in

persons holding title for a religious organization if such real estate is not
being or has not been used by such transferor for commercial purposes.
      R.   A transfer to a conservancy which possesses a tax exempt status
pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, (68A Stat.
3, 26 U.S.C. §501(c)(3)) and which has as its primary purpose preservation of
land for historic, recreational, scenic, agricultural or open space

Partners, Stockholders or Shareholders Thereof.

of assets that are devoted to the business of agriculture, it fails to meet the
minimum requirements of a family farm corporation under this Part.
   3.   Within thirty (30) days after becoming an acquired company, the company
shall present a declaration of acquisition with the recorder of each county in
which it holds real estate for the affixation of documentary stamps and
recording. Such declaration shall set forth the value of real estate holdings
of the acquired company in such county. A copy of the Pennsylvania Realty

Part 2 Community Development Objectives
§ 201. Community Development Objectives.
   This Zoning Chapter has been adopted in part to assist in carrying out the
"Statement of Objectives" of the Comprehensive Plan. The Community Development
Objectives include the following:
   As part of a regional center, the primary goal for the future of Shamokin
Dam Borough is to maintain its mixed urban-suburban character, a character
symbolized by a vital "Golden Strip" of commercial activities and by a variety
of well-maintained, pleasant neighborhoods populated by friendly and concerned
people. This means:
   A.   Commercial activities on the "Golden Strip" will be recognized as
serving the needs of both highway-oriented and neighborhood users. And the area
will be improved in terms of aesthetics, function, and reuse of vacant
buildings. The traveler and tourist trade will also be given recognition.
   The relationship of the Borough's commercial area to downtown Sunbury,
downtown Selinsgrove, and the Susquehanna Mall in Hummel's Wharf will be
emphasized.
   Neighborhood commercial facilities in the Old Trail area will be retained
and improved.
   B.   The Borough's small industrial base will be protected as an important
local source of employment and tax revenues; and possible environmental,
transportation, and land use conflicts between industrial and other activities
will be controlled.
   C.   Residential neighborhoods will be preserved in their attractive and
neat state and improved wherever needed.
   Housing will be consistent with the suburban character of the Borough, with
a variety of types at various price ranges, but new single-family homes will
continue to be the dominant type. Housing maintenance and rehabilitation will
be encouraged.
   D.   Community pride and identity will be enhanced by giving special
recognition to every neighborhood of the Borough and by emphasizing the
friendly and cooperative spirit of the people.
   Outward symbols of the Borough's friendliness will be established to let
travelers from other parts of the State and nation know they are welcome.
   The Borough will continue its "open door" policy by barring discrimination
against potential residents on the basis of color, age or creed.
   The special needs of the elderly and handicapped in regard to housing,
transportation, recreation, health, social and employment policies will be
recognized.
   E.   The traffic problems of Routes 11 and 15 will be addressed,
particularly with regard to traffic volume and flow, the design of access
points for development along these routes, and the new bridge and interchange
at the juncture of these routes.
   Borough streets will be maintained at the highest standards in winter as
well as summer. Streets will be reconstructed or repaved as needed, and
curbing, gutters, and street lights will be provided where appropriate. The
Borough will continue to require adequate off-street parking in all new
developments.
   The Borough will provide for pedestrian needs by constructing or maintaining
sidewalks in higher-density residential areas and in commercial developments.
   The special transportation needs of the elderly and handicapped will be
addressed.
   F.   Historic buildings and places will be preserved and restored wherever
possible throughout the Borough.
   Community facilities in the Borough will be maintained in good condition or
constructed as needed. A new municipal building is provided to accommodate the
administrative functions of government, while the municipal garage will be
maintained. Semi-public organizations, such as the fire hall, churches, and
Yoke-Fellows half-way house, will be encouraged to maintain their facilities at
high standards.
   The Borough will maintain its sewer and water utility systems at the highest
possible standards.
   The Borough's recreation facilities will serve all age groups and will be
attractive, functional, and well-maintained. Particular attention will be paid
to the unique riverside recreational facility at the Fabridam, providing for
fishing, biking, picnicking and boating.
   G.   The Borough will cooperate with the Selinsgrove Area School District to
provide the best possible education for students in the most efficient and
economical manner.
   Police protection, government administration, code and ordinance enforcement
, and sewer and water service will continue to be provided in the most
efficient and economical manner by the Borough government.
   Support will be provided to the agencies and organizations providing Borough
residents with fire protection, ambulance service, health care, and social
services.
   Problems resulting from the burning of garbage and trash by residents will
be resolved by enforcing present laws and by improving the collection of
garbage and trash. Arrangements for refuse disposal will be made in a manner
that best protects the public health, is efficient and economical, and meets
the requirements of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources.
   H.   The Borough of Shamokin Dam will cooperate with other levels of
government, nearby municipalities, and community service organizations to make
Shamokin Dam a community in which all can take pride.

      A.   Purpose: The purpose of this conditional use as stated in the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (Act 247 as amended) and as intended
by the residents of Shamokin Dam Borough, is to achieve the following:
         (1)   To ensure that the provisions of the Shamokin Dam Borough Zoning
Chapter which are concerned with the uniform treatment of dwelling type, bulk,
density and open space within each zoning district, shall not be applied to the
improvement of land by other than lot-by-lot development in a manner which
would distort the objectives of the Zoning Chapter;
         (2)   To encourage innovations in residential development and renewal
so that the growing demand for housing may be met by greater variety in type,
design and layout of dwellings and by the conservation and more efficient use
of open space ancillary to said dwellings;
         (3)   To provide greater opportunities for better housing and
recreation for all who are or will be residents of the Borough;
         (4)   To encourage a more efficient use of land and public services
and to reflect changes in the technology of land development so that the
economies so secured may inure to the benefit of those who need homes;
         (5)   To encourage more flexible land development which will respect
and conserve natural resources such as streams, flood plains, ground water,
wooded areas, steeply-sloping areas of unusual attractiveness in the natural
environment; and
         (6)   In aid of these purposes, to provide a procedure which can
relate the type, design and layout of residential development to the particular
site and the particular demand for housing existing at the time of development
in a manner consistent with the preservation of the property values within
existing residential areas, and to assure that the increased flexibility of
regulations over land development established hereby is carried out pursuant to
sound, expeditious and fair administrative standards and procedures.

will accept such dedication;
         - retain ownership and responsibility for maintenance of such open
space land; or
         - provide for and establish one or more organizations for the
ownership and maintenance of all common open space.
      In the case of the establishment of an organization, each such
organization shall be a non-profit homeowners' corporation, unless the
developer demonstrates that a community open space trust is a more appropriate
form of organization.

the tentatively approved plan and in no stage contain less than fifteen percent
(15%) of the dwelling units receiving tentative approval.
      J.   Enforcement and Modification of Provisions of the Plan: To further
the mutual interest of the residents of the planned residential development and
of the public in the preservation of the integrity of the development plan, as
finally approved, and to insure that modifications, if any, in the development
plan shall not impair the reasonable reliance of the said residents upon the
provisions of the development plan, nor result in changes that would adversely
affect the public interest, the enforcement and modifications of the provisions
of the development plan as finally approved, whether those are recorded by
plat, covenant, easement or otherwise, shall be subject to the following
provisions:
         (1)   The provisions of the development plan relating to:
            (a)   the use, bulk and location of buildings and structures, (b)
the quantity and location of common open space, except as otherwise provided
herein, and (c) the intensity of use or the density of residential units, shall
run in favor of the Borough and shall be enforceable in law or in equity by the
Borough without limitation on any powers of regulation otherwise granted the
Borough by law.
         (2)   All provisions of the development plan shall run in favor of the
residents of the planned residential development but only to the extent
expressly provided in the development plan and in accordance with the terms of
the development plan, and to that extent said provisions, whether recorded by
plat, covenant, easement or otherwise, may be enforced at law or equity by said
residents acting individually, jointly, or through an organization designated
in the development plan to act on their behalf; provided, however, that no
provisions of the development plan shall be implied to exist in favor of
residents of the planned residential development except as to those portions of
the development plan which have been finally approved and have been recorded.
         (3)   All those provisions of the development plan authorized to be
enforced by the Borough under this section may be modified, removed, or
released by the Borough, except grants of easements relating to the service or
equipment of a public utility, subject to the following conditions: a) no such
modification, removal or release of the provisions of the development plan by
the Borough shall affect the rights of the residents of the planned residential
development to maintain and enforce those provisions, at law or equity, as
provided in this Section; b) no modification, removal or release of the
provisions of the development plan by the Borough shall be permitted except
upon a finding by the Borough Council after review by the Planning Commission,
following a public hearing thereon pursuant to public notice called and held in
accordance with the provisions or this Section, that the same is consistent
with the efficient development and preservation of the entire planned
residential development, does not adversely affect either the enjoyment of land
abutting upon or across the street from the planned residential development or
the public interest, and is not granted solely to confer a special benefit upon
any person.
         (4)   Residents of the planned residential development may, to the
extent and in the manner expressly authorized by the provisions of the

pursuant to this Section, a public hearing pursuant to public notice on said
application shall be held by the Borough Council in the manner prescribed in
the Chapter for the enactment of an amendment to the Zoning Chapter.
      The President or Vice President of the Borough Council may administer
oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All testimony by witnesses at any
hearing shall be given under oath and every party of record at a hearing shall
have the right to crossexamine adverse witnesses.
      A verbatim record of the hearing shall be caused to be made by the
Borough Council whenever such records are requested by any party to the
proceedings; but the cost of making and transcribing such a record shall be
borne by those who wish to obtain such copies. All exhibits accepted in
evidence, shall be properly identified and the reason for the exclusion clearly
noted in the record.
      The Borough Council may continue the hearing from to time, and may refer
the matter back to the Planning Commission for a report, provided, however,
that in any event, the public hearing or hearings shall be concluded within
sixty (60) days after the date of the first public hearing.
      M.   The Findings
         (1)   The Borough Council, within sixty (60) days following the
conclusion of the public hearing provided for by this Section, shall, by
official written communication to the landowner, either:
         -Grant tentative approval to the development plan as submitted;
         -Grant tentative approval subject to specified conditions not included
in the development plan as submitted; or
         -Deny tentative approval to the development plan.
      Failure to act within said period shall be deemed to be a grant of
tentative approval of the development plan as submitted. In the event, however,
that tentative approval is granted subject to conditions, the landowner may,
within thirty (30) days after receiving a copy of the official written
communication of the Borough Council, notify such Council of his refusal to
accept all said conditions, in which case the Council shall be deemed to have
denied tentative approval of the development plan. In the event the landowner
does not, within said period, notify the Council of his refusal to accept all
said conditions, tentative approval of the development plan, with all said
conditions, shall stand as granted.
         (2)   The grant or denial of tentative approval by official written
communication shall include not only conclusions but also findings of fact
related to the specific proposal and shall set forth the reasons for the
denial, and said communication shall set forth with particularity in what
respects the development plan would or would not be in the public interest
including but not limited to findings of fact and conclusions on the following;
         - Those respects in which the development plan is or is not consistent
with the Comprehensive Plan for the development of the Borough;
         - The extent to which the development plan departs from zoning and
subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the subject property, including
but not limited to density, bulk, and use, and the reasons why such departures
are or are not deemed to be in the public interest;
         - The purpose, location and amount of the common open space in the
planned residential development, the reliability of the proposals for
maintenance and conservation of the common open space, and the adequacy or
inadequacy of the amount and purpose of the common open space as related to the
proposed density and type of residential development;
         -The physical design of the development plan and the manner in which
said design does or does not make adequate provision for public services,
provide adequate control over vehicular traffic, and further the amenities of
light and air, recreation and visual enjoyment;
         - The relationship, beneficial or adverse, of the proposed planned
residential development to the neighborhood in which it is proposed to be
established; and
         - In the case of a development plan which proposes development over a
period of years, the sufficiency of the terms and conditions intended to
protect the interest of the public and of the residents of the planned
residential development in the integrity of the development plan.
         (3)   In the event a development plan is granted tentative approval,
with or without conditions, the Borough Council may set forth in the official
written communication the time within which an application for final approval
of the development plan shall be filed or, in the case of a development plan
which provides for development over a period of years, the periods of time
within which applications for final approval of each part thereof shall be
filed. Except upon the consent of the landowner, the time so established
between grant of tentative approval and an application for final approval shall
not be less than three (3) months and, in the case of developments over a
period of years, the time between applications for final approval of each part
of the plan shall not be less than twelve (12) months.
      N.   Status of Plan After Tentative Approval
         (1)   The official written communication provided for in this Section
shall be certified by the Borough Manager and shall be filed in his or her
office , and a certified copy shall be mailed to the landowner. Where tentative
approval has been granted, the same shall be noted on the Zoning Map.
         (2)   Tentative approval of a development plan shall not qualify a
plan of the planned residential development for recording nor authorize
development or the issuance of any zoning permit. A development plan which has
been given tentative approval as submitted, or which has been given tentative
approval with conditions which have been accepted by the landowner (and
provided that the landowner has not defaulted nor violated any of the
conditions of the tentative approval), shall not be modified or revoked nor
otherwise impaired by action of the Borough pending an application or
applications for final approval, without the consent of the landowner, provided
an application for final approval is filed, or, in the case of development over
a period of years, provided applications are filed, within the periods of time
specified in the official written communication granting tentative approval.
         (3)   In the event that a development plan is given tentative approval
and thereafter, but prior to final approval, the landowner shall elect to
abandon said development plan and shall so notify the Borough Council in
writing, or in the event the landowner shall fail to file application or
applications for final approval within the required period of time or times, as
the case may be, the tentative approval shall be deemed to be revoked, and all
that portion of the area included in the development plan for which final
approval has not been given shall be subject to those local ordinances
otherwise applicable thereto as they may be amended from time to time, and the
same shall be noted on the Zoning Map and in the records of the Borough
Manager.
      O.   Application for Final Approval
         (1)   An application for final approval may be for all the land
included in a development plan or, to the extent set forth in the tentative
approval, a section thereof. Said application shall be made through the Zoning
Officer to the Borough Planning Commission or the Borough Council and within
the time or times specified by the official written communication granting
tentative approval. If the application for final approval is in compliance with
the tentatively approved development plan, a public hearing need not be held.
         (2)   The application shall include all drawings, specifications,
covenants, easements, performance bond and such other requirements as specified
in the Subdivision and Land Development Chapter, as well as any conditions set
forth in the official written communication at the time of tentative approval.
         (3)   In the event that the application for final approval has been
filed, together with all drawings, specifications and other documents in
support thereof, and as required by the ordinance and the official written
communication of tentative approval, the Borough Council shall, within forty-
five (45) days of such filing, grant such development plan final approval.
         (4)   In the event the development plan as submitted contains
variations from the development plan given tentative approval, the Borough
Council may refuse to grant final approval and shall, within forty-five (45)
days from the filing of the application for final approval, so advise the
landowner in writing of said refusal, setting forth in said notice the reasons
why one or more of said variations are not in the public interest. In the event
of such refusal, the landowner may either:
         -Refile his application for final approval without the variations
objected, or
         -File a written request with the Borough Council that it hold a public
hearing on his application for final approval.
      If the landowner wishes to take either such alternate action, he may do
so at any time within which he shall be entitled to apply for final approval,
or within thirty (30) additional days if the time for applying for final
approval shall have already passed at the time when the landowner was advised
that the development plan was not in substantial compliance.
      In the event the landowner shall fail to take either of these alternate
actions within said time, he shall be deemed to have abandoned the development
plan.
      Any such public hearing shall be held pursuant to public notice within
thirty (30) days after request for the hearing is made in writing by the
landowner, and the hearing shall be conducted in the manner prescribed in this
Chapter for public hearings on applications for tentative approval. Within
thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the hearing, the Borough Council
shall, by official written communication, either grant final approval to the
development plan or deny final approval.
      The grant or denial of final approval of the development plan shall, in
cases arising under this section, be in the form and contain the findings
required for an application for tentative approval set forth in this Section.
         (5)   A development plan, or any part thereof, which has been given
final approval shall be so certified without delay by the Borough Council and
shall be filed of record forthwith in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds of
the County before any development shall take place in accordance therewith.
Upon the filing of record of the development plan, the zoning and subdivision
regulations otherwise applicable to the land included in such plan shall cease
to apply thereto. Pending completion within a reasonable time of said planned
residential development or of that part thereof, as the case may be, that has
been finally approved, no modification of the provisions of said development
plan, or part thereof, as finally approved, shall be made except with the
consent of the landowner.
         (6)   In the event that a development plan, or a section thereof, is
given final approval and thereafter the landowner shall abandon such plan or
the section thereof that has been finally approved, and shall so notify the
Borough Council in writing; or, in the event the landowner shall fail to
commence and carry out the planned residential development within such
reasonable period of time as may be fixed by ordinance after final approval has
been granted, no development or further development shall take place on the
property included in the development plan until after the said property is re-
subdivided and is reclassified by enactment of an amendment to the Borough
Zoning Chapter in the manner prescribed for such amendments in Part 12.
   4.   Billboards (C-1 District).
      A.   Definition. A “billboard” is a freestanding sign which directs
attention to an object, product, service, place, activity, person, institution,
organization or business that is offered or located primarily at a location
other than the lot upon which the sign is located. A billboard is the only
permitted class of off-premises sign.
      B.   Purpose and Intent. The purpose of these regulations is to provide
an area for the placement of billboards in the Borough. The goals of these
regulations are to:
         (1)   Provide clear guidelines and regulations for the placement of
billboards.
         (2)   Provide standards for construction of billboards.
         (3)   Provide for the location of billboards so that such signs are
not adverse to the health, safety and welfare of the public.
      C.   General Regulations.
         (1)   Signs Permitted. Billboards may be permitted by conditional use
in that portion of the C-1, Commercial, Highway District, beginning at the
property boundary of the Orchard Hill Cemetery (land owned by C. Gee, Inc., tax
parcel 16-06030) and Kulp’s Transmissions (land owned by Michael A. H. Bordner,
Tax Parcel 16-01-016A) on Routes 11 & 15 North to the Borough line on Route 15
North, subject to the requirements contained in this Section.
         (2)   Size of Sign Face. A billboard face may not exceed two hundred
fifty (250) square feet per side in area, with a maximum face length of twenty-
five (25) feet and a maximum face width of fifteen (15) feet. Each face of a
two (2) faced sign shall be the same size.
         (3)   Height. Billboards shall not exceed thirty (30) feet in height.
The height shall be measured from the grade of the immediately adjoining
street, road, highway or alley to which the sign is oriented to the highest
part of the sign. Each face of a two (2) faced sign shall be of the same
height.
         (4)   Construction. Billboards shall be of unipole construction. No
portable billboards are permitted.
         (5)   Location of Sign. The applicable District Dimensional
Regulations as to yards shall apply with respect to the placement of billboards
within the district. In addition, a ten (10) foot minimum setback from any
utility lines or easements and from any building or buildings on the lot must
be maintained. Additionally, billboards may not be closer than one thousand
(1,000) feet from another billboard measured radially. No billboard shall be
located within five hundred (500) feet of any right-of-way of any interchange,
measured along the interstate or limited-access primary highway from the
beginning or ending of pavement widening at the exit from or entrance to the
main traveled way. No billboard or portion thereof shall be permitted within
the clear sight triangle at any intersection of a driveway with a street. No
billboards shall be located within five hundred (500) feet of an R-1,
Residential Medium Density District, R-2, Residential High Density District, or
R-3, Residential Multi-Family District measured on the same side of the
highway. No billboards shall be permitted on the roof or side of any building.
         (6)   Number of Signs per Lot. There shall be no more than one (1)
billboard per lot.
         (7)   Content. No billboard shall advertise any adult or sexually
oriented businesses or materials, contain any obscene or profane language, emit
any verbal announcement or noises of any kind, or otherwise display any content
prohibited by 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 5903. In addition, such signs shall not display
any moving, flashing, scrolling, fading, brightening or animated text or video.
No use of the colors red or green shall be made within two hundred fifty (250)
feet of a signalized intersection. The use of “stop,” “go,” “warning,”
“emergency,” or any other words that could be construed as traffic or warning
information is prohibited.
         (8)   Lighting. Illumination of billboards shall follow the standards
and requirements of the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America
(IESNA) and shall be subject to review and approval of the Borough. To the
extent that there is a conflict between a standard and/or requirements of the
IESNA and the provisions of this Section, the provisions of this Section shall
control. Illumination of all billboards shall be by external illumination or
light-emitting diode (LED) only. Animated, flashing, revolving, scrolling,
rotating and oscillating style signs shall be prohibited. The copy or image on
an LED sign shall not change more than once per eight (8) seconds. All copy or
image changes shall be instantaneous and shall not fade in or out of the
digital active area. Any external illumination shall be shielded as necessary
to direct light onto the sign without spillover on any side of the sign. Any
resulting glare generated by an off-premises advertising sign shall not exceed
one eighth (1/8) foot-candle, as measured on the ground at the curb-line or
shoulder, so as not to impair the vision of any motor vehicle driver or
otherwise interfere with a driver’s operation of his or her motor vehicle.
         (9)   Luminance. At no point shall the luminance of any or billboard
exceed the following:
            (a)   Billboards using external illumination shall not exceed one
and seventy-five hundredths (1.75) watts per square foot of board face.
            (b)   LED signs shall not exceed three-tenths (0.3) footcandle over
surrounding ambient light levels during daylight hours. They shall be dimmed
between dusk and dawn to a maximum illumination of one-fifth (1/5) the
permitted daylight luminance.
         (10)   Lot Size. The minimum lot size for a property on which an off-
premises advertising sign may be located is ten thousand (10,000) square feet.
         (11)   Maintenance of Sign. All billboards shall be structurally sound
and maintained in good condition. If the signs are not structurally sound or
maintained in good condition, the signs shall be immediately repaired or
removed at the sole cost and expense of the owner of the sign. If a billboard
is not structurally sound or remains in poor condition, the Borough shall
notify the owner of the property on which the sign is located and provide the
owner thirty (30) days written notice certified mail, sent to the owner’s last
known address, to repair or remove the sign. If the sign is not repaired or
removed within thirty (30) days of the date of the notice, the Borough may
remove the sign, and the cost thereof shall be paid by the owner of the
property on which the sign is erected.
         The Borough may file a municipal lien against the property or take any
action permitted by law to collect the cost of removal if it is not paid by the
owner of the property.
         (12)   Sign Arrangement. When two (2) sign faces are used in a back-
to-back arrangement on an outdoor advertisement sign or billboard, they shall
be parallel, directly aligned with each other and not more than five (5) feet
apart. When a V-type sign arrangement is used for two (2) sign faces of any
billboard, the sign faces shall not be located more than fifteen (15) feet
apart at the furthest point, nor shall the interior angle be greater than
forty-five (45) degrees. The rear side of any single-face, billboard shall be
of one (1) neutral color, which shall be specified in the order of the Borough
Council.
         (13)   Agreement of Property Owner. No part or foundation or support
of billboard shall be placed on, in or over any private property without the
written agreement of the property owner. The agreement shall be presented as
part of the application for said sign permit but the consideration or price
figures bargained between the private parties may be redacted.
         (14)   Owner Identification. All billboards shall be identified on the
structure with the name of the owner of each sign. The signs within an area
regulated by 67 Pa.Code, Chapter 445, shall further be identified with a permit
number or tag issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.
         (15)   Discontinued Sign. A billboard shall be considered a
discontinued sign where it has carried no message for a period of one hundred
eighty (180) consecutive days or where such sign no longer identifies a bona
fide business, commodity, service, entertainment or facility or where the
majority of the message on such sign has deteriorated to the condition that it
is not clearly discernible. A billboard which has been discontinued shall be
presumed to be abandoned and shall constitute an illegal billboard.
      Any period of time for which the discontinued use of a billboard is
proved to be caused by government actions, labor strikes, material shortages or
acts of god, and without any contributing fault of the owner of the sign or
user of the sign, shall not be calculated toward the number of days of
discontinued use. Any discontinued billboard shall be removed at the expense of
the owner of the sign. In the event that the owner of the sign cannot be
ascertained after the Borough’s reasonable inquiry, the discontinued sign and
structure shall be removed at the expense of the owner of the property on which
the sign is erected.
         (16)   Annual Fee for Billboards.
            (a)   In order for a billboard sign permitted by this Chapter, or
one that is already built, to continue to be a lawful use the owner or lessee
of such sign shall pay annually to Shamokin Dam Borough the required fee on or
before February 1st of each calendar year, and default of such payment shall be
considered a violation of this Section, and such sign may be removed as
provided for in subparagraph (14) above.
            (b)   On the effective date of this subsection (4) the fee shall be
five hundred ($500.00) dollars per face per year and may be modified by
resolution of the Borough Council at any time, and shall be kept on file at the
Borough office.
         (17)   Additional Regulations. In addition to the requirements
contained in this Section, all billboards shall comply with any and all
applicable zoning regulations not specifically established herein and any and
all Borough, State and/or Federal regulations, including, but not limited to,
the Shamokin Dam Building Code [Chapter 5, Part 1], Uniform Construction Code
[Chapter 5, Part 5], and all applicable Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation regulations. [Ord. 2014-4]

non-resident person working on the premises. Not more than twenty-five percent
(25%) of the building floor area (including the floor areas of both the
principal and accessory structures) shall be used for the home occupation.
   The exterior appearance of the structure or premises shall be maintained in
its residential character with the home occupation conducted entirely within
the enclosed structure and with no goods publicly displayed on the premises
other than a sign indicating the presence of the home occupation. The home

   5.   Non-Conforming Structures and Uses.
      A.   Continuation: Any lawful use of any dwelling, building, structure,
or land existing at the effective date of this Chapter may be continued' even
though such use does not conform to the provisions of this Chapter, except as
otherwise provided.
   A "certificate of non-conformance" shall be issued by the Zoning Officer for
all structures and uses which do not conform to the provisions of this Chapter,
The Zoning Officer shall maintain a map and register showing the registration,
identity, and location of non-conforming uses for which "certificates of
nonconformance" have been issued. The Zoning Officer shall also examine such
non-conforming uses periodically to determine that they do not expand beyond
the limitations prescribed in this Chapter.
      B.   Change of Use: The Zoning Hearing Board may grant a special
exception for a change from one non-conforming use to another non-conforming
use if it finds that the following are met: i) the proposed change will be less
objectionable in external effects than the previous non-conforming use and will
be more consistent physically with its surroundings; ii) no increases in
traffic generation or congestion, including both vehicular and pedestrian
traffic, will result from the change; iii) no increase in noise, smoke, dust,
fumes, vapor, gases, heat, odor, glare, vibration, or electrical disturbances
will result from the change; and iv) no increased threat to health by reason of
rodent infestation or otherwise will result from the change.
      C.   Extension of Use: The Zoning Hearing Board may grant a special
exception for an extension of a non-conforming use if it finds that all of the
following standards are met: i) the yard and coverage requirements for the
District in which it is located are not violated; ii) all off-street parking
and loading requirements applicable to the use are retained; iii) no more than
one enlargement of a non-conforming use or structure is made; and iv) the
extension is no more than thirty-three percent (33%) of the floor or land area
as it existed at the time the structure or use first became non-conforming.
      D.   Abandonment of Use: If a non-conforming structure or use is
abandoned or discontinued for a continuous period of one (1) year, it shall not
again be used except in conformity with the regulations of the District in
which it is located.
      E.   Structures Condemned: A non-conforming structure which has been
legally condemned shall not be rebuilt or used in accordance with the
provisions of this Chapter.
      F.   Restoration of Structure or Use: A non-conforming building or other
structure which has been damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion, windstorm,
flood or other similar active cause may be rebuilt.
      G.   Non-Conforming Use of Open Land: All non-conforming signs,
billboards, junk storage areas, storage areas, and similar non-conforming use
of open land, when discontinued for a period of ninety (90) days or damaged to
an extent of sixty percent (60%) or more of replacement costs, shall not be
continued, repaired or reconstructed.
   6.   Off-Street Parking and Loading.
      A.   Size of Off-Street Parking Spaces: Each off-street parking space
shall have an area of not less than one hundred seventy-one (171) square feet
and have dimensions of nine (9) feet in width and nineteen (19) feet in depth,
exclusive of access drives or aisles.
      All such spaces shall be kept in usable shape and condition. Except in
the case of dwellings, no parking area shall contain fewer than three (3)
spaces. Open parking areas shall be calculated as yard area.
      B.   Garages and Carports: A garage or carport may be located wholly or
partly inside the walls of the principal building, attached to the outer walls
of the principal building, or completely separated from the principal building.
If connected to the principal building, it shall be considered part of the
principal building in calculating yard requirements. If separated from the
principal building, it shall be considered an accessory building. The garage
may be constructed under a yard or court, in which case the space above the
underground garage shall be deemed to be part of the open space of the lot on
which it is located.
      C.   Location of Parking Spaces: Required parking spaces shall be located
either:
         -on the same lot as the use to which they are accessory, or
         -on another lot zoned the same, under the same ownership, and within
four hundred (400) feet of the boundary of the property of the principal use.
      If the spaces are on another lot, such spaces shall be subject to deed
restrictions filed in the County Office of the Recorder of Deeds binding the
owner of such lot and his heirs or assigns to maintain the required number of
spaces throughout the life of such use.
      D.   Size of Off-Street Loading Spaces: Each off-street loading space
shall be a minimum of seventy (70) feet in length, twelve (12) feet in width,
and have an overhead clearance of at least fourteen (14) feet.
      E.   Access to Off-Street Parking and Loading Areas: There shall be
adequate ingress and egress to all parking and loading areas.
      There shall be provided an access drive leading to the parking or storage
areas or loading spaces. Such access drive shall be not less than ten (10) feet
in width in the case of a dwelling, and not less than twenty (20) feet in width
in all other cases. Access to offstreet parking areas shall be limited to
several well-defined, separate or common access points which shall comply with
the following:
         (1)   Access drives for dwellings shall not open upon any public
right-of-way within sixty (60) feet of the nearest rightof- way line of any
intersecting public street or highway; in all other cases it shall be ninety
(90) feet.
         (2)   Access drives shall not open upon any public right-ofway where
the sight distance in either direction along the public thoroughfare would be
less than five hundred (500) feet when the posted speed limit is greater than
35 miles per hour; however, when the posted speed limit is 35 miles per hour or
less, the sight distance requirement may be reduced to two hundred fifty (250)
feet.
         (3)   In no case shall there be unrestricted access along the length
of a street or alley.
      F.   Parking Lot Screening and Landscaping: The purposes for providing
such landscaping are: to protect the public safety, to allow precipitation to
return to the underground aquifers, to provide for natural drainage and, hence,
for flood protection, to reduce the level of carbon dioxide and to return
oxygen to the air, to provide shade and reduce blighting effects of parking
lots, and to preserve property values of adjacent properties, and to improve
the appearance of the community.
         (1)   Off-street parking areas for more than five (5) vehicles and all
off-street loading areas shall abide by the following:
            (a)   Such areas shall be effectively screened by a planting strip
at least five (5) feet in depth along all abutting property lines. The planting
strip shall include a solid wall or a substantial, attractive, tight fence or
evergreen hedges a minimum of four (4) feet in height, and other shrubbery,
vines, flowers, grass, and other foliage.
            (b)   A planting strip at least ten (10) feet in depth shall be
located between the parking lot and abutting rightof- way except for accessways
crossing the strip. Such a strip shall contain one (1) shade tree for each
forty (40) linear feet of the strip, and no tree shall be less than eight (8)
feet in height at the time of planting. The planting strip shall also contain

§ 904. Complaints; Causes of Action; Enforcement Notice; Enforcement Remedies.

or, with the approval of Borough Council, an officer of the Borough, or any
aggrieved owner or tenant of real property who shows that his property or

other remedies, may institute any appropriate action or proceeding to prevent,
restrain, correct or abate such building, structure, landscaping or land, or to
prevent, in or about such premises any act, conduct, business or use
constituting a violation. When any such action is instituted by a landowner or
tenant, notice of that action shall be served upon the Borough at least thirty
(30) days prior to the time the action is beginning by serving a copy of the
complaint on the Borough Council. No such action may be maintained until such
notice has been given.

occurred, the Borough shall initiate enforcement proceedings by sending an
enforcement notice as provided in this Section.

written request to receive enforcement notices regarding that parcel and to any
other person requested in writing by the owner of record.

         (1)   The name of the owner of record and any other person against
whom the Borough intends to take action.

specified, unless extended by appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board, constitutes a
violation with possible sanctions clearly described.
   4.   Enforcement Remedies.
      A.   Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated or
permitted the violation of the provisions of this Chapter shall, upon being
found liable therefore in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the
Borough, pay a judgment of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) plus
all court costs, including reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Borough as
a result thereof.
      No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or payable until the
date of the determination of a violation by the district justice. If the
defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the Borough may enforce
the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that
a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation unless the district
justice determining that there has been a violation further determines that
there was a good faith basis for the person, partnership or corporation
violating this Chapter to have believed that there was no such violation, in
which event there shall be deemed to have been only one (1) such violation
until the fifth day following the date of the determination of a violation by
the district justice and thereafter each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation.

stay, upon case shown, tolling the per diem fine pending a final adjudication
of the violation and judgment.

extension, replacement, and/or use of any building, structure, sign, and/or
land for construction or use purposes shall be issued until the fees, as

Officer. The payment of such fees shall not relieve the applicant or holder of
said permit from payment of other fees that may be required by this Chapter, or
any other Chapter or law. (Ord. 87-8, 12/10/1987; as amended by Ord. 88-3, 10/

hardship upon the applicant. The Board may, by rule, prescribe the form of
application and may require preliminary application to the Zoning Officer. The
Board may grant a variance; provided, that all of the following findings are
made where relevant in a given case:
      A.   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape, or
exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions
and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of
this Chapter in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
      B.   That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of this Chapter and that the authorization of a variance is therefor
necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
      C.   That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant.
      D.   That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
      E.   That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulation in issue.
      In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions
and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this
Chapter and the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §10101 et
seq.
   4.   Standards for Grant of Variance.
      A.   Under no circumstances shall the Zoning Hearing Board grant a
variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this Chapter in the
district involved or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the
terms of this Chapter in said District.
      B.   A variance from the terms of this Chapter shall not be granted by
the Zoning Hearing Board unless and until:
         (1)   A written application for a variance is submitted demonstrating
that:
            (a)   Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar
to the land, structure or building involved and which are not applicable to
other lands, structures or building in the same district.
            (b)   Literal interpretation of the provisions of this Chapter
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same district under the terms of this Chapter.
            (c)   The special conditions and circumstances do not result from
the action of the applicant.
            (d)   Granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this Chapter to other lands,
structures or buildings in the same district.
      No conforming use of neighboring lands, structures or buildings in the
same district and no permitted or nonconforming use of lands, structures or
buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a
variance.
         (2)   Notice of public hearing shall be given as in §1002, above.
         (3)   The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in person
or by agent or by attorney.
         (4)   The Zoning Hearing Board shall make findings that the
requirements of subsection (3) have been met by the applicant for a variance.
         (5)   The Zoning Hearing Board shall further make a finding that the
reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance and
that the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the
reasonable use of the land, building or structure.
   5.   Special Exceptions.
      A.   Where the Borough Council, in this Chapter, has stated special
exceptions to be granted or denied by the Zoning Hearing Board pursuant to
express standards and criteria, the Board shall hear and decide requests for
such special exceptions in accordance with such standards and criteria. In
granting a special exception, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions
and safeguards, in addition to those expressed in this Chapter, as it may deem
necessary to implement the purposes of this Chapter and the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §10101 et seq.
      B.   A special exception shall not be granted by the Zoning Hearing Board
unless and until:
         (1)   A written application for a special exception is submitted
indicating the Section of this Chapter under which the special exception is
sought and stating the grounds on which it is requested.
         (2)   The Zoning Hearing Board shall make a finding that it is
empowered under the Section of this Chapter described in the application to
grant the special exception and that the grant of the special exception will
not adversely affect the public interest.
         (3)   Before any special exception shall be issued, the Zoning Hearing
Board shall make written findings certifying compliance with the specific rules
governing individual special exceptions and that satisfactory provisions and
arrangement has been made concerning the following, where applicable:
            (a)   Ingress and egress to property and proposed structures
thereon, with particular reference to automotive and pedestrian safety and
conveniences, traffic flow and control and access in case of fire or
catastrophe.
            (b)   Off-street parking and loading areas where required, with
particular attention to the items in subsection (5) (B) (3) (a) , above, and
the economic, noise, glare or odor effects of the special exception on
adjoining properties and properties generally in the district.

            (h)   General compatibility with adjacent properties and other
property in the district.
         (4)   In granting any special exception, the Zoning Hearing Board may
prescribe additional conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Chapter.
Violation of such conditions and safe guards, when made a part of the terms
under which the special exception is granted, shall be deemed a violation of
this Chapter and punishable under Part 9, "Administration and Enforcement." The
Zoning Hearing Board shall prescribe a time limit within which the action for
which the special exception is required shall be begun or completed, or both.
Failure to begin or complete, or both, such action within the time limit set
shall void the special exception.
   6.   Borough Council's Function; Conditional Uses. Where this Chapter has
stated conditional uses to be granted by Borough Council pursuant to express
standards and criteria, the Borough Council shall hold hearings on and decide
requests for such conditional use, the Borough Council may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to those expressed in this
Chapter, as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of the Municipal
Planning Act and this Chapter.

§ 1004. Unified Appeals.
   Where the Board has jurisdiction over a zoning matter pursuant to §1003,
above, the Board shall also hear all appeals which an applicant may elect to
bring before it with respect to any Borough ordinance or requirement pertaining
to the same development plan or development. In any such case, the Board shall
have no power to pass upon the nonzoning issues, but shall take evidence and
make a record thereon as provided in §1002. At the conclusion of the hearing,
the Board shall make findings on all relevant issues of fact which shall become
part of the record on appeal to the court.
(Ord. 87-8, 12/10/1987; as amended by Ord. 97-3A, 3/3/1997)
§ 1005. Parties Appellant Before the Board.
   Appeals raising the substantive validity of any land use ordinance (except
those to be brought before the Borough Council pursuant to the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Code), procedural questions or alleged defects in the process of
enactment or adoption of a land use ordinance; or from the determination of the
Zoning Officer including, but not limited to, the granting or denial of any
permit, or failure to act on the application therefor, the issuance of any
cease and desist order or the registration or refusal to register any
nonconforming use, structure or lot; from a determination by the Borough
Engineer or the Zoning Officer with reference to the administration of any
floodplain or flood hazard ordinance or such provisions within a land use
ordinance; from the determination of any officer or agency charged with the
administration of any transfer of development rights or performance density
provisions of this Chapter, from the determination of the Zoning Officer or
Borough Engineer in the administration of any land use ordinance or provision
thereof with reference to sedimentation and erosion control and stormwater
management insofar as the same relate to development not involving subdivision
and land development or planned residential development may be filed with the
Zoning Hearing Board in writing by the landowner affected, any officer or
agency of the Borough or any person aggrieved. Request for a variance and for
special exception may be filed with the Board by any landowner or any tenant
with the permission of such landowner.
(Ord. 87-8, 12/10/1987; as amended by Ord. 97-3A, 3/3/1997)
§ 1006. Time Limitations.
   1.   No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Zoning
Hearing Board later than thirty (30) days after an application for development,
preliminary or final, has been approved by the Borough if such proceeding is
designed to secure reversal or to limit approval in any manner, unless such
person alleges and proves that he had no notice, knowledge or reason to believe
that such approval had been given. If such person has succeeded to his interest
after such approval, he shall be bound by the knowledge of predecessor in
interest. The failure of anyone other than the landowner to appeal from an
adverse decision on a tentative plan or from an adverse decision by the Zoning
Officer on a challenge to the validity of this Chapter or an amendment hereto
or map or amendment thereto shall preclude an appeal from a final approval,
except in the case where the final submission substantially deviates from the
approved tentative approval.
   2.   All appeals from determinations adverse to the landowner shall be filed
within thirty (30) days after notice of the determination is issued.
(Ord. 87-8, 12/10/1987; as amended by Ord. 97-3A, 3/3/1997)
§ 1007. Stay of Proceedings.
   1.   Upon filing of any appeal proceeding before the Zoning Hearing Board
and during its pendency before the Board, all land development pursuant to any
challenged ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning Officer or of any agency
or body, and all official action thereunder, shall be stayed unless the Zoning
Officer or any other appropriate agency or body certifies to the Board facts
indicating that such stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, in
which case the development or official action shall not be stayed otherwise
than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board or by the court
having jurisdiction of zoning appeals, on petition, after notice to the Zoning
Officer or other appropriate agency or body. When an application for
development, preliminary or final, has been duly approved and proceedings
designed to reverse or limit the approval are filed with the Board by persons
other than the applicant, the applicant may petition the court having
jurisdiction of zoning appeals to order such persons to post bond as a
condition to continuing the proceedings before the Board.
   2.   After the petition is presented, the court shall hold a hearing to
determine if the filing of an appeal is frivolous. At the hearing, evidence may
be presented on the merits of the case. It shall be the burden of the applicant
for a bond to prove the appeal is frivolous. After consideration of all
evidence presented, if the court determines that the appeal is frivolous, it
shall grant the petition for a bond. The right to petition the court to order
the appellants to post bond may be waived by the appellee, but such waiver may
be revoked by him if an appeal is taken from a final decision of the court.
   3.   The question whether or not such petition should be granted and the
amount of the bond shall be within the sound discretion of the court. An order
denying a petition for bond shall be interlocutory. An order directing the
responding party to post a bond shall be interlocutory.
   4.   If an appeal is taken by a respondent to the petition for a bond from
an order of the court dismissing a zoning appeal for refusal to post a bond and
the appellate court sustains the order of the court below to post bond, the
respondent to the petition for a bond, upon motion of the petitioner and after
hearing in the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals, shall be liable for
all reasonable costs, expenses and attorney fees incurred by the petitioner.

Part 11 Appeals
§ 1101. Zoning Appeals.
   All zoning appeals are statutory and shall be pursuant to Article X-A of the
Pennsylvania Municipal Planning Code. That Code is the exclusive mode of
appeal. (Ord. 87-8, 12/10/1987; as amended by
Ord. 97-3A, 3/3/1997)
§ 1102. Validity of Chapter; Substantive Questions.
   1.   A landowner who, on substantive grounds, desires to challenge the
validity of the ordinance or map or any provision thereof which prohibit or
restricts the use or development of land in which he has an interest shall
submit a challenge either:
      A.   To the Zoning Hearing Board under §909.1(a) of the Municipal
Planning Act.
      B.   To the Borough Council under §909.1(b)(4) of the Municipal Planning
Act, together with a request for a curative amendment under § 609.1 of the
Municipal Planning Act.
   2.   Persons aggrieved by a use or development permitted on the land of
another by an ordinance or map, or any provision thereof, who desires to
challenge its validity on substantive grounds shall first submit their
challenge to the Zoning Hearing Board for a decision thereon un §909.1(a)(1) of
the Municipal Planning Act.
   3.   The submissions referred to in subsections (1) and (2), above, shall be
governed by the following:
      A.   In challenges before the Zoning Hearing Board, the challenging party
shall make a written request to the Board that it hold a hearing on its
challenge. Where the landowner desires to challenge the validity of such
ordinance and elects to proceed by curative amendment un §609.1 of the
Municipal Planning Act, his application to the Borough Council shall contain,
in addition to the requirements of the written request hereof, the plans and
explanatory materials describing the use or development proposed by the
landowner in lieu of the use or development permitted by the challenged
ordinance or map. Such plans or other materials shall not be required to meet
the standards prescribed for preliminary, tentative or final approval or for
the issuance of a permit, so long as they provide reasonable notice of the
proposed use or development and a sufficient basis for evaluating the
challenged ordinance or map in light thereof. Nothing herein contained shall
preclude the landowner from first seeking a final approval before submitting
his challenge.
      B.   If the submission is made by the landowner to the Borough Council
under §909.1(a)(2), the request also shall be accompanied by an amendment or
amendments to the ordinance proposed by the landowner to cure the alleged
defects therein.
      C.   If the submission is made to the Borough Council, the Borough
Solicitor shall represent and advise it at the hearing or hearings referred to
in §909.1(b)(4) of the Municipal Planning Act.
      D.   The Borough Council may retain an independent attorney to present
the defense of the challenged ordinance or map on its behalf and to present
their witness on its behalf.
      E.   Based on the testimony presented at the hearing or hearings, the
Borough Council or the Zoning Board, as the case may be, shall determine
whether the challenged ordinance or map is defective, as alleged by the
landowner. If a challenge heard by the Borough Council is found to have merit,
the Borough Council shall proceed as provide in § 609.1 of the Municipal
Planning Act. If a challenge heard by a Zoning Hearing Board is found to have
merit, the decision of the Zoning Hearing Board shall include recommended
amendments to the challenged ordinance which will cure the defects found. In
reaching its decision, the Zoning Hearing Board shall consider the amendments,
plans and explanatory material submitted by the landowner and shall also
consider:
         (1)   The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools and other public service facilities.
         (2)   If the proposal is for residential use, the impact of the
proposal upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of the proposal in
providing housing units of a type actually available to and affordable by
classes of persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by the challenged provisions
of the ordinance or map.
         (3)   The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by
the site's soils, slopes, woodlands, floodplains, aquifers, natural resources
and other natural features.
         (4)   The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes,
woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, natural resources and natural features, the
degree to which these are protected or destroyed, the tolerance of the
resources to development and any adverse environmental impacts.
         (5)   The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture
and other land uses which are essential to public health and welfare.
      F.   The Borough Council or the Zoning Hearing Board, as the case may be,
shall render its decision within forty-five (45) days after conclusion of the
last hearing.
      G.   If the Borough Council or the Zoning Board, as the case may be,
fails to act on the landowner's request within the time limits referred to in
subsection (3)(F), a denial of the request is deemed to have occurred on the 46
th day after the close of the last hearing.
   4.   The Zoning Hearing Board or Borough Council, as the case may be, shall
commence its hearings within sixty (60) days after the request is filed unless
the landowner requests or consents to an extension of time.
   5.   Public notice of the hearing shall include notice that the validity of
the ordinance or map is in question and shall give the place where and when the
times when copy of the request, including any plans, explanatory material or
proposed amendments may be examined by the public.
   6.   The challenge shall be deemed denied when:
      A.   The Zoning Hearing Board or Borough Council, as the case may be,
fails to commence the hearing within the time limits set forth in subsection
(4).
      B.   The Borough Council notifies the landowner that it will not adopt
the curative amendment.
      C.   The Borough Council adopts another curative amendment which is
acceptable to the landowner.
      D.   The Zoning Hearing Board or Borough Council, as the case may be,
fails to act on the request forty-five (45) days after the close of the last
hearing on the request, unless the time is extended by mutual consent by the
landowner and the Borough.
   7.   Where, after the effective date of this act, a curative amendment
proposal is approved by the grant of a curative amendment application by the
Borough Council pursuant to §909.1(b)(4) of the Municipal Planning Act or a
validity challenge sustained by the Zoning Hearing Board pursuant to § 909.1(a)
(1) of the Municipal Planning Act or the court acts finally on appeal from
denial of a curative amendment proposal or a validity challenge, and the
proposal or challenge so approved requires a further application for
subdivision or land development, the developer shall have two (2) years from
the date of such approval to file an application for preliminary or tentative
approval pursuant to Article V or VII of the Municipal Planning Act. Within the
two (2) year period, no subsequent change or amendment in the zoning,
subdivision or other governing ordinance or plan shall be applied in any manner
which adversely affects the rights of the applicant as granted in the curative
amendment or the sustained validity challenge. Upon filing of the preliminary
or tentative plan, the provisions of §508(4) of the Municipal Planning Act
shall apply. Where the proposal appended to the curative amendment application
or the validity challenge is approved, but does not require further application
under any subdivision or land development ordinance, the developer shall have
one (1) year within which to file for a building permit. Within the one (1)
year period, no subsequent change or amendment in the zoning, subdivision or
other governing ordinance or plan shall be applied in any manner which
adversely affects the rights of the applicant as granted in the curative
amendment or the sustained validity challenge. During these protected periods,
the court shall retain or assume jurisdiction for the purpose of awarding such
supplemental relief as may be necessary.

§ 1103. Procedure to Obtain Preliminary Opinion.
   In order not to unreasonably delay the time when a landowner may secure
assurance that the ordinance or map under which he proposed to build is free
from challenge and, recognizing that the procedure for preliminary approval of
his development may be too cumbersome or may be unavailable, the landowner may
advance the date from which time for any challenge to the ordinance or map will
run under § 914.1 of the Municipal Planning Act by the following procedure:
   1.   The landowner may submit plans and other materials describing his
proposed use or development to the Zoning Officer for a preliminary opinion as
to their compliance with the applicable ordinances and maps. Such plans and
other materials shall not be required to meet the standards prescribed for
preliminary, tentative or final approval or for the issuance of a building
permit so long as they provide reasonable notice of the proposed use or
development and a sufficient basis for a preliminary opinion as to its
compliance.
   2.   If the Zoning Officer's preliminary opinion is that the use or
development complies with the ordinance or map, notice thereof shall be
published once each week for two (2) successive weeks in a newspaper of general
circulation in the Borough. Such notice shall include a general description of
the proposed use or development and its location by some readily identifiable
directive and the place and time where the plans and other materials may be
examined by the public. The favorable preliminary approval under § 914.1 of the
Municipal Planning Act and the time therein specified for commencing a
proceeding with the Board shall run from the time when the second notice
thereof has been published.

site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers, natural
resources and other natural features.

requested under §§909.1 or 916.1 of the MPC, 53 P.S. §§10909.1, 10916.1,
subsequent to the declaration and proposal based upon the grounds identical or
