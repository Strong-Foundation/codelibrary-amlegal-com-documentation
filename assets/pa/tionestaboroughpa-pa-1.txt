   1.   No insurance company, association or exchange (hereinafter the
"insuring agent") doing business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall pay
a claim of a named insured for fire damage to a structure located within the

all policies exceeds $5,000 unless the named insured or insuring agent is
furnished by the Borough Treasurer with a municipal certificate pursuant to
Section 508(b) of Act 98 of 1992 and unless there is compliance with Section
508(c) and (d) of Act 98 of 1992 and the provisions of this Part.
   2.   Where, pursuant to Section 508(b)(l)(i) of Act 98 of 1992, the Borough

applied such that if the claim is $20,000 or less, the amount transferred to
the Borough shall be $1,000; or
      B.   If at the time of a proof of loss agreed to between the named

signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or
other structure, the insuring agent shall trans£er to the Borough from the
insurance proceeds the amount specified in the estimate.
      C.   The transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all
companies, associations or exchanges insuring the building or other structure.
      D.   After the transfer, the named insured may submit a contractor's

other structure, and the designated officer shall return the amount of the
funds transferred to the Borough in excess of the estimate to the named
insured, if the Borough has not commenced to remove, repair or secure the
building or other structure.
      E.   Upon receipt of proceeds under this section, the Borough shall do
the following:
         (1)   The designated officer shall place the proceeds in the separate
fund to be used solely as security against the total costs of removing,

or administrative costs incurred by the Borough in connection with such
removal, repair or securing of the building or any proceed­ ings related

structure have been completed in accordance with all applicable regulations and
orders of the Borough and the required proof of such completion received by the
designated officer, and if the Borough has not incurred any costs for repairs,
removal or securing, the fund shall be returned to the named insured. If the
Borough has incurred costs for repairs, removal or securing of the building or
other structure, the cost shall be paid from the fund and, if excess funds
remain, the Borough shall transfer the remaining funds to the named insured;
and
         (4)   To the extent that interest is earned on proceeds held by the
Borough pursuant to this section, which proceeds are not returned to the named
insured, such interest shall belong to the Borough. To the extent that proceeds
are returned to the named insured, interest earned on such proceeds shall be
distributed to the named insured at the time that the proceeds are returned.
      F.   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ability of
the Borough to recover any deficiency. Furthermore, nothing in this subsection
shall be construed to prohibit the Borough and the named insured from entering
into an agreement that permits the transfer of funds to the named insured of
some other reasonable disposition of the damaged property has been negotiated.

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION
§ 8-101. Statutory Authority.
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage of
the Penn­ sylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978, delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Council of the Borough of Tionesta does hereby order
as follows.
(Ord. 261, 11/16/2010)
PART 2
GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 8-201. Intent.
   1.   The intent of this Chapter is to:
      A.   Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
      B.   Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in
order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
      C.   Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.
      D.   Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units, and its residents, by preventing excessive development in areas sub­
ject to flooding.
      E.   Comply with Federal and State floodplain management requirements.
(Ord. 261, 11/16/2010)
§ 8-202. Applicability.
   1.   It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or
corporation to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or
development anywhere within the Borough of Tionesta unless a permit has been
obtained from the Borough Floodplain Administrator.
   2.   A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing buildings
or structures.
(Ord. 261, 11/16/2010)
§ 8-203. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.
   This Chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in
effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance provisions
shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those provisions are
more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of
this Chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
(Ord. 261, 11/16/2010)
§ 8-204. Severability.
   If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this
Chapter shall be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such a decision
shall not affect the remaining portions of the Ordinance, which shall remain in
full force and effect, and for this purpose the provisions of this Chapter are
hereby declared to be severable.
(Ord. 261, 11/16/2010)
§ 8-205. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
   1.   The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this Chapter
is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on acceptable
engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be
increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings
restricted by debris. This Chapter does not imply that areas outside any
identified floodplain areas or that land uses permitted within such areas will
be free from flooding or flood damages.
   2.   This Chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Borough of
Tionesta or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result
from reliance on this Chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
(Ord. 261, 11/16/2010)

damage (or "repetitive loss" when a repetitive loss provision is used),
regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however
include either:
      A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing

§ 409. RESIDENTIAL PERMIT PARKING.
   1.   Findings and Purpose. The Borough of Tionesta finds that:
      A.   Certain residential areas in the Borough are subjected to commuter
vehicle parking, therefore, depriving the residents of those areas of spaces in
which to park their own vehicles.
      B.   Those residential streets are also subjected to a high degree of
commuter traffic which substantially reduces the quality of the ambient air
level.
      C.   The establishment of a parking permit program for certain affected
areas should facilitate efficient movement of traffic by providing for parking
preference during certain hours of the day and days of the week. Therefore, the
Borough of Tionesta considers it to be in the interest of the people of the
Borough to provide for the establishment of a residential permit parking
program to insure primary access to available parking spaces by neighborhood
residents and also to provide a cleaner ambient air level.
   2.   Definitions. For the purpose of this Section, words and terms listed in
this subsection, as follows, shall have the following meanings:
      COMMUTER VEHICLE - a motor vehicle parked in a residential area by a
person not a resident of that residential area.
      PROPRIETOR - a person who owns or leases real estate within a residential
area of which he is not a resident, but who owns or manages a business
enterprise or professional office maintained at that address; for the purpose
of this Section, a proprietor shall be entitled to one (1) parking permit for
that business or professional office address.
      RESIDENT - a person who owns or leases real property within a residential
area and who maintains either a voting residence, or bona fide occupancy, or
both, at that address.
      RESIDENTIAL AREA - a contiguous area containing public highways or parts
of public highways primarily abutted by residential property or residential and
non-business property (such as schools, parks, places of worship, hospitals and
nursing homes).
   3.   Criteria. The residential areas designated in subsection (4) of this
Section are those deemed impacted and hence eligible for residential parking on
the basis of the following criteria:
      A.   During any period between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m.,
Monday through Saturday, except legal holidays, the number of vehicles parked
(or standing), legally or illegally, on the streets in the area is equal to
seventy (70) percent or more of the legal, on-street parking capacity of the
area. For the purpose of this criterion, a legal parking space shall be twenty
(20) linear feet.
      B.   During the same period as specified in subsection (A), directly
above, ten (10) percent or more of the vehicles parked (or standing) on the
streets in the area are not registered in the name of a person residing in the
area. For the purpose of this criterion, the latest available information from
the Bureau of Motor Vehicles and Licensing of the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation regarding registration of motor vehicles shall be used.
      Provided: In deterrnining that a specific area identified as impacted and
eligible for residential permit parking is designated as a residential permit
parking area, the following factors are taken into consideration:
         (1)   The local and metropolitan needs with respect to clean air and
environment.
         (2)   The possibility of a reduction in total vehicle miles driven in
the Borough.
         (3)   The likelihood of alleviating traffic congestion, illegal
parking and related health and safety hazards.
         (4)   The proximity of public transportation to the residential area.
         (5)   The desire and need of the residents for residential permit
parking and their willingness to bear the adnriinistrative costs in connection
with it.
         (6)   The need for parking in excess of the residential permit parking
program in proximity to establishments located in the residential permit
parking area and used by the general public for religious, health or
educational purposes.
   4.   Designation of Residential Permit Parking Areas. The following are
designated as residential permit parking areas:
 
Area Bounded by and Including
(Reserved)
 
   Signs shall be erected along the streets in each residential permit parking
area, indicating the days, hours, locations and conditions under which parking
shall be by permit only.
   5.   Application for Permit. Application for a residential parking permit
shall be made to the Chief of Police by the person desiring the permit, who
shall be only the owner or the driver of a motor vehicle who resides on or is a
proprietor of property immediately adjacent to a street or other location
within a residential parking permit area. A separate application shall be
required for each motor vehicle, and each application shall be accompanied by a
permit fee, set pursuant to resolution of the Borough Council, which shall be
for the use of the borough to be applied to the cost of administering the
residential permit parking program. Each application shall contain the
following information: the name of the owner or the driver, as the case may be,
of the motor vehicle; the address of the resident or the proprietor, as the
case may be; the make, model and registration number of the motor vehicle; and
the driver number as taken from the applicant's current driver's license. At
the discretion of the Chief of Police, the applicant shall be required, at the
time of making application, to present his driver's license and the vehicle
registration card.
   6.   Issuance of Permit. Upon receipt of the application and the permit fee,
and determination by him that the information upon the application shows that
the applicant is entitled to a residential parking permit, the Chief of Police
shall issue to the applicant a residential parking permit, which shall be valid
for the remainder of the calendar year. The permit shall display the serial and
registration numbers of the motor vehicles, the residential parking area
number, and the expiration date. The permit shall be renewable annually before
the expiration date, upon making application for renewal and payment of the
permit fee. It shall be unlawful and a violation of this Section for any person
to display other than the current and valid permit while standing or parking in
a residential permit parking area at any time when those permits are to be
displayed.
   7.   Temporary and Exemption Parking Permits. Temporary parking permits may
be issued by the Chief of Police, upon payment of a fee established pursuant to
a resolution, to bona fide visitors of residents of a designated residential
permit parking area, and exemption parking permits may be issued, without
payment of a fee, to handicapped persons.
   8.   Responsibility of Permit Holder.
      A.   Notwithstanding any provision of this Section to the contrary, the
holder of a residential parking permit shall be permitted to stand or park a
motor vehicle operated by him in any designated residential parking area during
those times when parking of motor vehicles is permitted in that area. While a
vehicle for which a residential parking permit has been issued is so parked,
that permit shall be displayed so as to be clearly visible through the
windshield of the vehicle. A residential parking permit shall not guarantee or
reserve to the holder a parking space within a designated residential permit
parking area.
      B.   A residential parking permit shall not authorize its holder to stand
or park a motor vehicle in any place where or at any time when stopping,
standing or parking of motor vehicles is prohibited or set aside for other
specified types of vehicles, nor shall the permit exempt its holder form the
observance of any traffic or parking regulation other than residential permit
parking regulation or restriction.
      C.   No person other than the permit holder whose name appears on the
permit shall use a residential parking permit or display it on a vehicle
operated; any such use or display by a person other than the permit holder
shall constitute a violation of this Section by the permit holder and by the
person who so used or displayed the parking permit.
      D.   It shall constitute a violation of this Section for any person
falsely to represent himself as eligible for a residential parking permit or to
furnish false information in an application to the Chief of Police in order to
obtain a residential parking permit.
         (1)   Revocation of Permits. The Chief of Police shall have authority
to revoke the residential parking permit of any permit holder found to be in
violation of any provision of this Section. Upon written notification to him of
the revocation, the permit holder shall surrender the permit to the Chief of
Police. Failure to do so, when so requested, shall constitute a violation of
this Section. Provided, any person receiving such a notice may, within ten (10)
days after the date of the notice, appeal to Borough Council for a hearing on
the revocation, and the decision of Borough Council shall be final.

or within 30 days of acceptance of such document or within 30 days of becoming

affixing of an official stamp or writing by the recorder of deeds whereon the
date of the payment of the tax, amount of the tax and the signature of the
collecting agent be set forth.
   3.   It is the intent of this Part that the entire burden of the tax imposed
herein on a person or transfer shall not exceed the limitations prescribed by
State law, so that if any political subdivision shall impose or hereafter shall
impose such tax on the same person or transfer then the tax levied by Tionesta
Borough under the au­ thority of the Act shall during the time such duplication
of the tax exists, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, be 1/2 of the rate
shall become effective without any action on the part Tionesta Borough;
provided, however, that Tionesta Bor­ ough and any other political subdivision
which impose such tax on the same per­ son or transfer may agree that, instead
of limiting their respective rates to 1/2 of the rate herein provided, they
will impose respectively different rates, the total of which shall not exceed
the maximum rate permitted under State law.
   4.   If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate in
effect at the time the tax is due shall be added and collected.
(Ord. 200, 3/3/1992, §4)
§ 24-105. Exempt Parties.
   The United States, the Commonwealth or any of their instrumentalities,
agencies or po­ litical subdivisions shall be exempt from payment of the tax
imposed by this Part. The exemption of such governmental bodies shall not,
however, relieve any other party to a transaction from liability for the tax.
(Ord. 200, 3/3/1992, §5)
§ 24-106. Excluded Transactions.
   1.   The tax imposed by §24-104 shall not be imposed upon:
      A.   A transfer to the Commonwealth, or to any of its instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions, by gift, dedication or deed in lieu of
condemnation or deed or confirmation in connection with condemnation
proceedings, or a reconveyance by the condemning body of the property condemned
to the owner of record at the time of condemnation which reconveyance may
include property line adjustments provided said reconveyance is made within one
year from the date of condemnation.
      B.   A document which Tionesta Borough is prohibited from taxing under
the Constitution or statutes of the United States.
      C.   A conveyance to a municipality, township, school district or county
pursuant to acquisition by the municipality, township, school district or
county of a tax delinquent property at sheriff sale or tax claim bureau sale.
      D.   A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration which corrects or
confirms a transfer previously recorded, but which does not extend or limit
existing record legal title or interest.
      E.   A transfer or division in kind for no or nominal actual
consideration of property passed by tenants or intestate succession and held by
covenants; how­ ever, if any of the parties take shares greater in value than
their undivided interest, tax is due on the excess.
      F.   A transfer between husband and wife, between persons who were
previously husband and wife who have since been divorced, provided the property
or interest therein subject to such transfer was acquired by the husband and
wife or husband or wife prior to the granting of the final decree in divorce,
between parent and child or the spouse of such child, between brother or sister

passing by testate or intestate succession from a personal representative of a
decedent to the decedent's devisee or heir.
      H.   A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration to a trustee of an
ordinary trustee where the transfer of the same property would be exempt if the
transfer was made directly from the grantor to all of the possible
beneficiaries whether or not such beneficiaries are contingent or specifically
named. No such exemption shall be granted unless the recorder of deeds is
presented with a copy of the trust instrument that clearly identifies the
grantor and all possible beneficiaries.

a beneficiary of an ordinary trust.

under this Part. Where the document by which title is acquired by a grantee or
statement of value fails to set forth that the property was acquired by the
grantee from, or for the benefit of, his principal, there is a rebuttable
presumption that the property is the property of the grantee in his individual
capacity if the grantee claims an exemption from taxation under this
subsection.

a corporation or statutory division of a nonprofit corporation, except where
the Department reasonably determines that the primary intent for such merger,

control, warehousing or agriculture; and (iii) the agency or authority has the
full ownership interest in the real estate transferred.
      P.   A transfer by a mortgagor to the holder of a bona fide mortgage in

persons holding title for a religious organization if such real estate is not
being or has not been used by such transferor for commercial purposes.

document is not subject to tax under this Part.

Partners, Stockholders or Shareholders Thereof.
   Except as otherwise provided in §24-106, documents which make, confirm or
evidence any transfer or demise of title to real estate between associations or
corporations and the members, partners, shareholders or stockholders thereof
are fully taxable. For the purposes of this Section, corporations and
associations are entities separate from their members, partners, stockholders
and shareholders.

changes has the effect of transferring, directly or indirectly, 90% or more of
the total ownership interest in the company within a period of three years.

cur­ rent year, shall, within 30 days after the discontinuance of business,
file a final return as required under this paragraph and pay the tax due.

electronically. The employer must file a notice of intention to file com­ bined
returns and make combined payments with the tax officer for each place of

commencing January 1, 2008, upon the privilege of engaging in an occupation
with a primary place of employment within the Borough of Tionesta during the
tax year. Each natural person who exercises such privilege for any length of

ser­ vices; (2) road construction and/or maintenance; (3) reduction of property
taxes; or (4) property tax relief through implementation of a homestead and
farmstead exclusion in accordance with 53 Pa.C.S. Chapter 85, Subchapter F
(relating to homestead property exclusion). The Borough shall use no less than

addition to all other taxes of any kind or nature here­ tofore levied by the
Borough of Tionesta. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each per­ son for
each calendar year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within
which a person may be employed.
(Ord. 258, 1/7/2008)
§ 24-504. Exemption and Refunds.
   1.   Exemption. Any person, whose total earned income and net profits from
all sources within the Borough is less than $12,000 for any calendar year in
which the tax is levied is exempt from the payment of the tax for that calendar
year. In addition, the following persons are exempt from payment of the tax:
      A.    Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which the
United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or released under
honorable circumstances from active service if, as a result of military ser­
vice, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double or quadruple amputee or has a
service-connected disability declared by the United Stales Veterans' Ad­
ministration or its successor to be a total one-hundred-percent disability.
      B.   Any person who serves as a member of a reserve component of the

shall mean the United States Army Reserve, United States Navy Reserve, United
States Marine Corps Reserve, United States Coast Guard Reserve, United States
Air Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the Pennsylvania Air
National Guard.
   2.   Procedure to Claim Exemption.
      A.   A person seeking to claim an exemption from the Local Services Tax
shall annually file an exemption certificate with the Borough and with the per­
son's employer affirming that the person reasonably expects to receive earned
income and net profits from all sources within the Borough of less than $12,000
in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is filed. In the event
that the Borough utilizes a tax collection officer, it shall provide a copy of
the exemption certificate to that officer. The exemption certificate shall have
attached to it a copy of all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from
employment within the Borough for the year prior to the fiscal year for which
the employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax. Upon receipt of the
exemption certificate and until otherwise in­ structed by the Borough or except
as required by Subsection 2B, the em­ ployer shall not withhold the tax from
the person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar year for
which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall ensure that the
exemption certificate forms are readily available to employees at all times and
shall furnish each new em­ ployee with a form at the time of hiring.
      B.   With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the person or
by the Borough that the person has received earned income and net profits from
all sources within the Borough equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that
calendar year or that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption
for that calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of earned
in­ come within the Borough in an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in
that calendar year, an employer shall withhold the local services tax from the
person under Subsection 2C.
      C.   If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year from
the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under Subsection 2B,
the employer shall withhold the tax for the remainder of that calendar year.
The employer shall withhold from the person, for the first payroll period af­
ter receipt of the notification under Subsection 2B, a lump sum equal to the
amount of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per payroll amount due
for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld per payroll pe­ riod
for the remaining payroll periods in that calendar year shall be the same
amount withheld for other employees. In the event the employment of a person
subject to withholding of the tax under this subsection is subse­ quently
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any out­ standing
balance of tax due, and the Borough may pursue collection under this Part.
      D.   Except as provided in Subsection 2B, it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating exemption
certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or exempting any employee
from a local services tax.
   3.   Refunds. The Borough Manager, in collaboration with the Collector and
DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims for any
tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which procedures shall be
in accord with provisions of the general municipal law relating to refunds of
overpayments and interest on overpayments. Refunds made within 75 days of a
refund request or 75 days after the last day the employer is required to remit
the tax for the last quar­ ter of the calendar year, whichever is later, shall
not be subject to interest. No re­ funds shall be made for amounts overpaid in
a calendar year that do not exceed $1. The Borough Manager or the Collector
shall determine eligibility for refunds to exempt persons and provide refunds.
(Ord. 258, 1/7/2008)
§ 24-505. Duty of Employers to Collect.
   1.   Each employer within the Borough of Tionesta, as well as those
employers situ­ ated outside the Borough of Tionesta, but who engage in
business within the Bor­ ough of Tionesta, is hereby charged with the duty of
collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or performing for
him within the Borough of Tio­ nesta and making a return and payment thereof to
the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby authorized to deduct this tax
from each employee in his or her employ, whether said employee is paid by
salary, wage or commission and whether or not all such services are performed
within the Borough of Tionesta.
   2.   A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro
rata share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person for a
payroll period shall be determined by dividing the combined rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods established by
the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of determining the pro rata
share, an employer shall round down the amount of the tax collected each
payroll period to the nearest one­ hundredth of a dollar. Collection of the tax
shall be made on a payroll period basis for each payroll period in which the
person is engaging in an occupation, except as provided in Subsection 4 of this
Section. For purposes of this subsection, "com­ bined rate" shall mean the
aggregate annual rate of the lax levied by the school district and the Borough.
   3.   No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
   4.   In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement from a
principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the length of the
payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a statement from the
employee that the pay statement is from the employee's principal employer and
the employee will notify other employers of a change in principal place of
employment within two weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall
be provided on the form approved byDCED.
   5.   The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, regard­ less of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be em­ ployed. The Borough shall provide a taxpayer a receipt of
payment upon request by the taxpayer.
   6.   No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for
the payment of the withheld tax money to the Borough if the failure to withhold
taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the employee as to the
employee's place or places of employment, the employee's principal office or
where the employee is principally employed. Further, an employer shall not be
liable for payment of the local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount
withheld by the employer if the employer complies with the provisions of
Section 24-504.2 of this Part and this Section and remits the amount so
withheld in accordance with this Part.
   7.   Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
(Ord. 258, 1/7/2008)
§ 24-506. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the tax
on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer fails
to file the re­ turn and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commission paid by him or her to
an employee, except as provided hereafter in this Part, the employer shall be
responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had been
originally levied against the employer.
(Ord. 258, 1/7/2008)
§ 24-507. Dates for Determining Tax Liability and Payment.
   In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted and paid
over to the Collector on or before the 30th day following the end of each
calendar quarter of each such tax year.
(Ord. 258, 1/7/2008)
§ 24-508. Self-Employed Individuals.
   Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind or
engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of employment
within the Borough of Tionesta shall be required to comply with this Part and
pay the pro rata portion of the tax due to the Collector on or before the 30th
day following the end of each quarter.
(Ord. 258, 1/7/2008)
§ 24-509. Individuals Engaged in Multiple Occupations or Employed in More Than
One. Political Subdivision.
   1.   The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day
the person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the event
a person is en­ gaged in more than one occupation, that is, concurrent
employment, or an occupa­ tion which requires the person working in more than
one political subdivision dur­ ing a payroll period, the priority of claim to
collect the local services tax shall be in the following order:
      A.   First, the political subdivision in which the person maintains his
or her principal office or is principally employed.
      B.   Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision.
      C.   Third, the political subdivision in which the person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
   2.   In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that
calendar year de­ claring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certifi­ cation of payment to all other political subdivisions.
(Ord. 258, 1/7/2008)
§ 24-510. Nonresidents Subject to Tax.
   All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the Borough of Tionesta but who perform services of any
type or kind or en­ gage in any occupation or profession within the Borough of
Tionesta do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject themselves to
the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under this Part with the
same force and effect as though they were residents of the Borough of Tionesta.
Further, any individual engaged in an occu­ pation within the Borough of
Tionesta and an employee of a nonresidential employer may, for the purpose of
this Part, be considered a self-employed person, and in the event his or her
tax is not paid, the Borough shall have the option of proceeding against either
the employer or employee for the collection of this tax as hereinafter
provided.
(Ord. 258, 1/7/2008)

tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount received by him from each
employer or self­ employed person, together with the date the tax was received.
   2.   The Collector is hereby charged with the administration and enforcement
of this Part and is hereby charged and empowered, subject to Borough Council

any matter pertaining to the administration and enforcement of this Part,
including provi­ sions for the examination of payroll records of any employer
subject to this Part, the examination and correction of any return made in
compliance with this Part, and any payment alleged or found to be incorrect or
as to which overpayment is claimed or found to have occurred. Any person
aggrieved by any decision of the Collector shall have the right to appeal to
the Court of Common Pleas of Forest County as in other cases provided.
   3.   The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return made by
an employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax due. Each employer
is hereby di­ rected and required to give the Collector the means, facilities
and opportunity for such examination.
(Ord. 258, 1/7/2008)
§ 24-512. Suits for Collection.
   1.   In the event that any tax under this Part remains due or unpaid 30 days
after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for the recovery of
any such tax due or unpaid under this Part together with interest and penalty.
   2.   If, for any reason, the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate
of 6% on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning with the due date
of the tax and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of such tax for
nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery of this tax or other
appropriate remedy un­ dertaken, the individual liable therefor shall, in
addition to the taxes, interests and penalty amounts due, be responsible and
liable for the costs of collection.
(Ord. 258, 1/7/2008)

Part, or whoever refuses inspection of the books, records or accounts in his or
her custody and control setting forth the number of employees subject to this
tax who are in his or her employment, or whoever fails or refuses to file any
return required by this Part shall be guilty of a violation and, upon
conviction thereof shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $600 and
costs of prosecution, and, in default of payment of such fine and costs, to
imprisonment for not more than 30 days. The action to enforce the penalty
herein prescribed may be instituted against any person in charge of the
business of any employer who shall have failed or who refuses to file a return
required by this Part.
(Ord. 258, 1/7/2008)
§ 24-514. Interpretation.

Borough of Tio­ nesta to levy and collect the tax hereby imposed on any
occupation not within the taxing power of the Borough under the Constitution of
the United States and the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
   2.   If the tax hereby imposed under the provisions of this Part shall be
held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of the
Constitution of the United States or of the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania as to any individual, the decision of the court shall not affect
or impair the right to impose or collect said tax or the validity of the tax so
imposed on other persons or individuals as herein provided.

is Colleen M. Call, Borough Administrator.
Taxpayer: An individual, partnership, association, corporation, limited
liability com­ pany, estate, trust, trustee, fiduciary or any other entity

101.   Requirements for Requests for Taxpayer Information:
   (a)   Minimum time periods for taxpayer response.
      (1)   The taxpayer shall have at least 30 calendar days from the mailing
date to respond to requests for information by the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall grant a reasonable extension upon writ­ ten application
explaining the reason(s) necessitating the extension, which must amount to good
cause. If the Tax Administrator denies a request for extension, the Tax
Administrator must inform the tax­ payer in writing of the basis for the denial
and that the taxpayer must immediately provide the requested information. If
the Tax Adminis­ trator grants an extension request, he must notify the
taxpayer in writing of the amount of extension granted. Generally, an extension
will not exceed 30 calendar days in length, and bay be less, depending on
circumstances.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer of the procedures
to obtain an extension in its initial request for information. Please refer to
the notice explaining the Request for Extension of Time to Provide Information
attached as Schedule 5.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator shall take no lawful action against a
taxpayer for the tax year in question until the expiration of the applicable
re­ sponse period for submission of the information requested, including
extensions. For example, the Tax Administrator may not engage in any collection
efforts until after expiration of the response period. Af. ter expiration of
this response period, the Tax Administrator may en­ gage in collection efforts
permitted by the LTBR and discussed in Sec­ tion 113 below.
   (b)   Requests for prior year tax returns.
      (1)   Except as provided in Subsection (b)(2), an initial inquiry by the
Tax Administrator regarding a taxpayer's compliance with an Eligible Tax may
include taxes required to be paid or tax returns required to be filed no more
than three years prior to the mailing date of the notice.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may make an additional subsequent request for
a tax return or supporting information if, after the initial request, the Tax
Administrator determines that the taxpayer failed to file a tax return, under
reported income or failed to pay a tax for one or more of the tax periods
covered by the initial request. Generally, however, the Tax Administrator
should not make routine requests for additional prior year returns.
   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations in Subsection (b)(2) above on
subsequent requests for prior year returns shall not apply if the Tax
Administrator has sufficient information to indicate that the taxpayer failed
to file a required return or to pay an Eligible Tax which was due more than
three years prior to the date of the notice. Thus, in situations involving
failure to file a required return or to pay a required Eligible Tax, the Tax
Administrator shall, in his discretion, have the ability to request prior year
returns due more than three years prior and supporting information.
   (c)   Use of Federal or State tax information. The Tax Administrator may
require a taxpayer to provide copies of the taxpayer's Federal individual
income tax return if the Tax Administrator can demonstrate that the Federal tax
in­ formation is reasonably necessary for the enforcement or collection of tax
and the information is not available from other available sources or the
Pennsylvania Department of Revenue. The Tax Administrator may also re­ quire a
taxpayer to provide copies of the taxpayer's State individual income tax
return.
102.   Notice of Basis of Underpayment.
   The Tax Administrator must notify the taxpayer in writing of the basis for
any under­ payment that the Tax Administrator has determined to exist with
respect to any Eligi­ ble Tax. The purpose of this notification is for the
taxpayer to understand the exact rea­ son why the Tax Administrator believes an
underpayment exists. This notification from the Tax Administrator shall be
written in a manner calculated to be understood by an average person. The
notification must include:
   (a)   The tax period or periods (usually measured in calendar years) for
which the underpayment is asserted.
   (b)   The amount of the alleged underpayment of the Eligible Tax detailed by
tax period.
   (c)   The legal basis (including any statutory or case law citations) upon
which the Tax Administrator has relied to determine that an underpayment of an
Eligible Tax exists.
   (d)   An itemization of the changes made by the Tax Administrator to a
return or report filed by the taxpayer that results in the determination that
an un­ derpayment exists. A copy of any revised return or report in the Tax
Admin­ istrator's file must be provided to the taxpayer.
102. Petitions for Appeals of Assessments or Refund of Taxes Paid:
   (a)   Filing of Petitions. A taxpayer has the legal right to challenge an
assess­ ment or denial of a refund claim under the LTBR. However, a taxpayer
has a right to one appeal only. If a taxpayer loses an assessment appeal, the
taxpayer is not entitled to a second refund appeal after paying the tax. In
addition, no administrative appeals are provided for other decisions, includ­
ing but not limited to the denial of an extension of time to provide informa­
tion or the modification or termination of an installment agreement.
   The LTBR requires political subdivisions to establish appeals procedures. In
order to begin the appeals process, the taxpayer must file a complete and
timely petition (the "Petition). A Petition it timely filed if the letter
trans­ mitting the Petition is postmarked by the United States Postal Service
or actually received on or before the final day on which the Petition is due.
Re­ ceipts from carriers other than the United States Postal Service are not
ac­ cepted as proof of timely filing. Deadlines for filing a petition are as
follows:
      (1)   Petitions challenging the denial of a refund shall be filed within
three years after the due date for filing the report or return as extended or
one year after actual payment of the tax, whichever is later. If no re­ port or
return is required, the Petition shall be filed within three years after the
due date for payment of the Eligible Tax or within one year after actual
payment, whichever is later.
      (2)   Petitions for reassessment of tax shall be filed within 90 days of
the date of the assessment notice which has been sent to the taxpayer by the
Tax Administrator.
   (b)   The Tax Administrator shall make available a form of Petition for
Appeal and Refund attached as Schedule 3.
   (c)   Contents. Any Petition filed under Section 103(a)(l) shall (1) state
the legal basis for claiming the refund or disagreeing with the Tax
Administrator's assessment, (2) state the tax period or periods (i.e., years)
to which it per­ tains, (3) state the amount of the claim and the type of
Eligible Tax detailed by tax period (4) include all supporting documentation
and calculations, (5) provide the name, address and telephone number of the
taxpayer's repre­ sentative, if any, (6) include a statement certifying that
the facts in the Peti­ tion are true and correct, under penalty of perjury, and
that the Petition is not filed for purposes of delay; and (7) include such
other information (es­ sentially identification) as is reasonably requested by
the Tax Administra­ tor on the Petition for Appeal and Refund provided to
taxpayer.
   (d)   The taxpayer shall have his or her Petition decided by the governing
body acting in executive session based solely on the Petition and record
(including information on file and information submitted by the taxpayer). No
hearing, oral testimony or oral argument is required, but can be requested by
the taxpayer. The governing body may choose to grant a hearing in its sole dis­
cretion.
104.   Appeals Board/Hearing Officer:
   The Appeals Board shall consist of the governing body acting in executive
session, with­ out any maximum or minimum limitation on the number of persons
acting as the gov­ erning body, provided that a quorum exists. In this
situation, the Local Government has chosen Tionesta Borough Council as the
Appeals Board required by the LTBR.
   (a)   The decision by the governing body acting in executive session shall
be based solely on the Petition and record. Decisions on Petitions shall be is­
sued within 60 days of the date a complete and accurate Petition is received.
Failure to act within 60 days shall result in the Petition being deemed ap­
proved.
   (b)   Any person aggrieved by a decision under this Section 104 who has a
direct interest in the decision shall have the right to appeal to the Court of
Com­ mon Pleas of the County of Forest vested with the jurisdiction of local
tax appeals by or pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. §5571(b).
   (c)   Decisions by the Appeals Board shall be made according to principles
of law and equity.
105.   Conduct of Appeals:
   (a)   A taxpayer may or may not choose to be represented by a taxpayer
repre­ sentative. The taxpayer representative may be a lawyer, certified public
ac­ countant or other tax advisor possessing appropriate tax training to repre­
sent taxpayers in tax appeals. The taxpayer must submit a written authori­
zation to use a taxpayer representative. However, a simple letter signed by a
taxpayer authorizing representation will be accepted as authorization. Such
authorization shall include the representative's name, address and telephone
number.
   (b)   Copies of notices or communications may be sent by the Tax
Administrator or other representative of the political subdivision to the
taxpayer's repre­ sentative. However, the original notice or communications
will always be sent directly to the taxpayer. Action taken by the taxpayer's
authorized rep­ resentative (for example, requesting an extension of time or
submitting fac­ tual information) shall have the same force or effect as if
taken directly by the taxpayer).
   (c)   The Appeals Board's final decision shall be in writing and signed by
the Representative of the Appeals Board. The final decision shall be mailed to
the taxpayer, with a copy also mailed to the taxpayer's authorized represen­
tative (if any).
106.   Refunds:
   (a)   A taxpayer who has paid on Eligible Tax may file a written request for
re­ fund or credit. A request for refund shall be made within three years of
the due date, as extended, for filing the report or tax return, or one year
after actual payment of the tax, whichever is later. If no report is required,
the request shall be made within three years after the date for payment of the
tax or within one year after actual payment of the tax whichever is later.
   (b)   A tax refund filed by the taxpayer showing an overpayment shall be
deemed to be a written request for a cash refund unless otherwise indicated on
the tax return.
   (c)   A request for refund under this Section 106 shall not be considered a
Peti­ tion under Section 103 and shall not preclude a taxpayer from submitting
a Petition under Section 103.
   (d)   For amounts paid as a result of a notice asserting or informing a
taxpayer of an underpayment, a written request for refund shall be filed within
one year of the date of payment.
107.   Disclosure Statement and Taxpayer Notice:
   Any taxpayer contacted by the Tax Administrator regarding the assessment,
audit, de­ termination, review or collection of an Eligible Tax will receive a
Taxpayer Notice. The Notice shall be incorporated into any other correspondence
sent to a taxpayer by the Tax Administrator regarding the assessment, audit,
determination, review or collection of tax. The Notice shall be substantially

of the Disclosure Statement.

   (e)   Definitions. As used in this Section 108, the following words and
phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this Subsection (e):
   "Date of Overpayment" - shall mean the later of the date paid or the date

days, whether or not the refund check is accepted by the taxpayer after tender.
109.   Abatement of Certain Interest and Penalty:
   (a)   Errors and Delays. The purpose of this provision is to provide, in the
discre­ tion of the Tax Administrator, a mechanism to abate (i.e., reduce)
interest and/or penalties where an underpayment is the result of an error or
delay in performance by a representative of the Tax Administrator. Accordingly,
in the case of any underpayment, the Tax Administrator, in its discretion, may
offer to abate all or any part of the interest relating to an Eligible Tax for
any period for any one or all of the following reasons:
      (1)   Any underpayment of an Eligible Tax finally determined to be due,
which is attributable in whole or in part to any error or delay by the Tax
Administrator in the performance of a ministerial act. For pur­ poses of this
paragraph, an error or delay shall be taken into account only if no significant
aspect of the error or delay can be attributed to the taxpayer and after the
Tax Administrator has contacted the tax­ payer in writing with respect to the
underpayment of tax finally de­ termined to be due or payable.
      (2)   Any payment of an Eligible Tax to the extent that any error or
delay in the payment is attributable to an officer, employee or agent of the
Tax Administrator being erroneous or dilatory in performance of a ministerial
act.
   The Tax Administrator shall determine what constitutes timely performance of
ministerial acts performed under this Subsection (a).
   (b)   Abatement of any penalty or excess interest due to erroneous written
advice by the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall abate any portion
of any penalty or excess interest attributable to erroneous advice furnished to
the taxpayer in writing by an officer, employee or agent of the Tax Adminis­
trator acting in the officer's, employee's or agent's official capacity if:
      (1)   The written advice was reasonably relied upon by the taxpayer and
was in response to a specific written request of the taxpayer; and
      (2)   The portion of the penalty or addition to tax or excess interest
did not result from a failure by the taxpayer to provide adequate or accurate
information to the Tax Administrator.
   Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall be in the sole discretion of the Tax
Admin­ istrator whether or not to provide written tax advice to a taxpayer.
Taxpayers shall not have any right to compel the Tax Administrator to provide
written tax advice.
110.   Application of Payments:
   Unless otherwise specified by the taxpayer, all voluntary payments of an
Eligible Tax shall be prioritized by the Tax Administrator in the following
order:
   (a)   Tax
   (b)   Interest
   (c)   Penalty
   (d)   Any other fees or charges
111.   Installment Agreements:
   The Tax Administrator has the discretion to enter into written agreements
with any taxpayer under which the taxpayer is allowed to satisfy liability for
tax in installment payments if the Tax Administrator determines that the
installment agreement will fa­ cilitate collection.
   (a)   Extent to which installment agreements remain in effect.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this Subsection (a), any
installment agreement entered into by the Tax Administrator under this Section
111 shall remain in effect for the term of the agreement.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may terminate any prior installment agree­
ment entered into under this Section 111 if:
         (i)   Information which the taxpayer provided to the Tax Adminis­
trator prior to the date of the installment agreement was inac­ curate, false,
erroneous or incomplete in any manner, deter­ mined in the reasonable
discretion of the Tax Administrator; or
         (ii)   The Tax Administrator reasonably believes and has determined
that collection of the Eligible Tax under the installment agree­ ment is in
jeopardy.
      (3)   If the Tax Administrator finds that the financial condition of the
tax­ payer has significantly changed, the Tax Administrator may unilater­ ally
alter, modify or terminate the installment agreement, but only if the following
conditions are satisfied:
         (i)   the Tax Administrator provide a notice of its findings to the
tax­ payer no later than 30 days prior to the date of change of the in­
stallment agreement; and
         (ii)   the notice given by the Tax Administrator to the taxpayer pro­
vides the reasons why the Tax Administrator believes that a significant change,
justifying a change to the installment agreement, has occurred.
      (4)   The Tax Administrator may unilaterally and without notification al­
ter, modify or terminate an installment agreement entered into by the T.ax
Administrator under this Section 111 if the taxpayer fails to do any of the
following:
         (i)   pay any installment at the time it is due under the installment
agreement;
         (ii)   pay any other liability relating to an Eligible Tax at the time
the liability is due;
         (iii)   provide a financial condition update as requested by the Tax
Administrator.
      (5)   No administrative appeal is permitted in the event of an
alteration, modification or termination of an installment agreement. However,
an appeal may be made to the Court of Common Pleas of this County.
   (b)   Prepayment Permitted. Nothing in this Section 111 shall prevent a
taxpayer from prepaying in whole or in part any Eligible Tax under any
installment agreement with the Tax Administrator.
112.   Confidentiality of Tax Information:
   Any information obtained by the Tax Administrator or Appeals Board, or any
of their respective officers, agents, legal counsel, financial accountants, or
employees as a result of any audit, assessment, return, report, investigation,
hearing, appeal or verification of a taxpayer shall be confidential tax
information. It shall be unlawful, except for official purposes or as provided
by law, for such persons to:
   (a)   Divulge or make known in any manner any confidential information ob­

compromising the amount of tax, interest, or penalty owed, obtaining liens on
the taxpayer's property, or obtaining liens on the taxpayer's property, or

Administrator also re­ serves the right to seek criminal prosecution of a
taxpayer in appropriate circumstances.

DISCLOSURE STATEMENT UNDER THE LOCAL TAXPAYER BILL OF RIGHTS
   It is the obligation of all taxpayers to file all local tax returns
voluntarily and pay all local taxes to which they are subject. However, when
the duly appointed or elected tax collector or tax collection agency for the
municipality and/or school district in which the taxpayer resides determines
that a required return has not been filed, or a tax liability has not been
paid, the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights grants certain legal rights to tax­
payers, and imposes obligations on taxing authorities to ensure that equity and
fairness guide local governments in the collection of taxes. In addition, the
Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights provides the local government entity with
certain legal methods to enforce taxpayer obligations. This Disclosure
Statement sets forth your rights as a tax­ payer in connection with any audit,
examination, appeal or refund claim of taxes for TIONESTA BOROUGH, and any
enforcement or collection actions taken by Tax Collector on behalf of Tionesta
Borough.
Applicability/Eligible Taxes
   This Disclosure Statement applies to all eligible taxes levied by Tionesta
Borough. For this purpose, eligible taxes do not include real property taxes.
The specific eligible taxes levied by Tionesta Borough are: (1) Per Capita Tax
and (2) Earned Income Tax. Unless expressly provided in the Local Taxpayers
Bill of Rights, the failure of any person acting on behalf of the Tax
Administrator to comply with any provisions of this Disclosure Statement,
related regulations or the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights will not excuse the
taxpayer from paying the taxes owed.
Audit/or Examinations
   If we contact you about your tax return or payment of any eligible taxes, we
will send you a letter with either a request for more information or a reason
why we believe a change to your return or taxes may be needed. If we request
information, you will have 30 calendar days from the date of the mailing to
respond. Reasonable extensions of such time will be granted upon application
for good cause. We will notify you of the proce­ dures to obtain an extension
with our initial request for tax information. Our initial in­ quiry may include
taxes required to be paid or tax returns to be filed no more than three years
prior to the mailing date of our notice. If you give us the requested
information or provide an explanation, we may or may not agree with you. If we
do not agree with you, we will explain in writing our reasons for asserting
that you owe us tax (which we call "an underpayment"). Our explanation will
include: (1) the tax period or periods for which the underpayment is asserted;
(2) the amount of the underpayment detailed by tax period; (3) the legal basis
upon which we relied to determine that an underpayment exists; and (4) an
itemization of the revisions made by us to your return or report that results
in our decision that an underpayment exists. If you agree with our changes, you
should pay the additional tax.
Requests for Prior Year Returns
   An initial request by the Tax Administrator into prior year returns may
cover tax re­ turns required to be filed as far back as three years prior to
the mailing date of the no­ tice. If the Tax Administrator determines that the
taxpayer failed to file a tax return, under reported income or failed to pay a
tax for one or more of the tax periods covered by the initial request, the Tax
Administrator may request additional information. The Tax Administrator may
also require a taxpayer to provide copies of federal and Penn­ sylvania tax
returns when the Tax Administrator can show that the taxpayer's federal tax
return(s) is (are) reasonably necessary for the enforcement or collection of
tax, and the information is not available from other sources or the
Pennsylvania Department of Revenue.
Appeals of Decisions
   If we notify you that you owe more tax (what we call an "assessment") and
you do not agree with our decision, you may appeal or seek review by filing a
Petition for reas­ sessment within 90 days of the date of the mailing of the
assessment notice. The Peti­ tion must either be in our hands or postmarked by
the U.S. Postal Service within this 90 day period. Receipts from other carriers
(such as Federal Express) are not accepted as proof of delivery.
   Your petition must explain the legal basis for your position and include all
supporting documents. For your convenience, a form for submission of a Petition
is available at 210 Elm Street, P.O. Box 408 Tionesta, Pennsylvania 16353. Your
Petition must be mailed or delivered to the attention of Colleen M. Call at the
same address. A decision by the Tionesta Borough Council in Executive Session
will be made within 60 days of the date your complete and accurate Petition is
received. If you d not agree with the decision of the Tionesta Borough Council,
you may appeal to the appropriate Court of Common Pleas of Forest County. You
must file your appeal within 30 days after no­ tice of the decision of the
Tionesta Borough Council in Executive Session.
Refunds
   You may file a claim for refund ("Refund Claim") if you think you paid too
much tax (what we call an "overpayment"). You must file the Refund Claim within
three years of the due date for filing the return as extended or one year after
actual payment of the tax, whichever is later. If no report or local tax return
is required for the tax, the Refund Claim must be made within three year after
the due date for payment of the tax or within one year after actual payment of
the tax, whichever is later. If your Refund Claim relates to amounts paid as a
result of a notice asserting an underpayment of tax, your request for Refund
Claim must be filed within one year of the date of payment. Re­ fund Claims
must be made on forms prescribed by us and must include supporting
documentation. You can obtain forms for Refund Claims by contacting us at 210
Elm Street, P.O. Box 408, Tionesta, PA 16353. Your Refund Claim must be filed
with us at 210 Elm Street, P.O. Box 408, Tionesta, PA 16353. If you file a tax
return showing an overpayment of tax, we will treat that as a request for a
cash refund unless you indicate otherwise. If your Refund Claim is denied, you
may file a Petition contesting the denial of the refund. Any Petition must be
filed within the same time limits that apply for a Refund Claim. Alternatively,
you may file a Petition for a refund without first filing a Refund Claim. A
hearing date will be set after your Petition is received and a decision by the
Tionesta Borough Council in Executive Session will be made within 60 days of
the date your complete and accurate Petition is received. The Appeals Petition
form must be used to request a review of a Refund Claim denial. Your Petition
must be mailed or delivered to the attention of COLLEEN M. CALL, TAX ADMINIS­
TRATOR, at the following address: P.O. Box 408, 210 Elm Street, Tionesta, PA
16353.
Enforcement Procedures
   Once it has been determined that you owe a tax, we will take all action we
are legally permitted to take to enforce our claim. Such action may include
obtaining additional in­ formation from you, auditing your records, entering
into a settlement with you of the disputed amount of the tax, or obtaining
liens on your property, wage attachments, lev­ ies, and seizures and sales of
your property in appropriate circumstances. We may enter in to a written
agreement with you for payment of the tax in installments if we believe that
such an agreement will facilitate collection. We may also impose interest and
appli­ cable penalties on the tax you owe, and may seek criminal prosecution of
you in appro­ priate circumstances.
Tax Information Confidentiality
   Information gained by the Tax Administrator or Tionesta Borough Council as
a. result of any audit, return, report, investigation, hearing, appeal or
verification shall be confi­ dential. However, confidentiality will not
preclude disclosure for official purposes, whether in connection with legal
proceedings or otherwise, and it will not preclude dis­ closure to the extent
required by applicable law.

   If you have a complaint about any action relating to the political
subdivision's taxes, Colleen M. Call may be contacted in writing at P.O. Box

§ 26-102. Tap-in Fees.
   A tap-in fee of $300.00 will be charged to any and all property owners who
desire to or who are required to connect to the main distribution line of the
water system. In addition, the property owner shall be responsible for any and
all costs of constructing and installing said connection including, but not
limited to, the cost of the water meter, fittings, pipe, and retapping of the
water line. Prior to connecting, the property owner or the property owner's
contractor must submit a detailed proposal to the Borough showing all work to
be completed and all materials to be installed. This proposal must be approved
by the Borough and the tap-in fee must be paid in full prior to the
commencement of any construction or installation work. The Tionesta Borough
Public Works Director has the right to inspect and/or stop any construction or
installation at any time due to concerns over the construction, installation,
materials, or any other part of the connection process. All connections shall
be inspected by the Borough prior to being covered.
(Ord. 167, 12/21/1982; as added by Ord. 269, 11/20/2012, §2)
§ 26-103. Fire Protection Fees.
   If a sprinkler system or other fire protection system is used or installed
in any building located within the Borough, whether that system is installed by
choice of the property owner or whether it is required by law, the property
owner shall be responsible for the cost of any and all water used in or by the
fire protection system as well as any and all costs associated with the
installation of said system which costs may include, but shall not be limited
to, the installation of a new service line, a new meter, the relocation of the
main water line, any construction costs associated with the installation of the
new lines and appurtenances including the costs of a road bore or any
excavation, and all other costs related to the installation of the system.
These requirements apply regardless of whether the structure is new
construction or whether the use of a structure is changed which necessitates
the installation of a fire protection system. The Borough assumes no liability
as an insurer of property or persons, and that by making water available for
fire protection services, the Borough does not contemplate any special service,
pressure, capacity, or facility other than that ordinarily provided in the
normal operation of the water system. The Borough is exempt from any and all
claims for injury or damage to persons and/or property by reason of fire or
water or the failure to supply water, pressure, or capacity.

charges. Any water service charge not paid in accordance with the rules and
regulations hereafter set forth shall be a lien on the property charged with
the payment thereof. Such water service charge, if not paid after notice as
hereinafter provided, may be collected by an action of assumpsit or by distress
of personal property on the premises or by a lien filed in the nature of a
municipal lien.
(Ord. 167, 12/21/1982, §3; as amended by Ord. 214, 11/4/1997, §2; and by Ord.
269, 11/20/2012, §4)
§ 26-105. Water Service Charge Collector.
   Tionesta Borough Council may designate a person as the Water Service Charge
Collector.
(Ord. 167, 12/21/1982, §4; as amended by Ord. 269, 11/20/2012, §5)
§ 26-106. Rules and Regulations.
   There are hereby established the following rules and regulations for the
operation of the Tionesta Borough water supply system:
   A.   Application for service.
      (1)   Service connection will be made, and water will be furnished, upon
written application by the prospective consumer (or his properly authorized
agent) on a blank prepared by the Borough for this purpose and after the
approval of such application by the Borough. The application for service shall,
in general, clearly outline the class, scope and type of use to be made of the
service, as well as the purpose for which it will be used.
      (2)   The application and these rules and regulations constitute the
contract between the consumer and the Borough; and each consumer, by taking of
water, agrees to be bound thereby.
      (3)   A new application must be made to, and approved by, the Borough
upon any change in the identity of a contracting consumer at a property, or in
the service as described in the application, and the Borough may, upon five
days notice, discontinue the water supply until such new application has been
made and approved.
      (4)   Each application for service shall be made in conformity with and
stating the basis of rates applicable to consumers under the tariff provisions.
   B.   Service connection.
      (1)   The Borough will make all connections to its main and furnish,
install and maintain all service lines from the main to and including the curb
cock and box, which shall be placed inside the curb line, all of which service
line shall the property of the Borough and shall be accessible to and under its
control.
      (2)   All service lines from the curb to the house shall be of pipe
approved by the Borough, laid at least four feet below the surface of the
ground and kept in good repair at the expense of the consumer.
      (3)   No service pipes shall be laid in the same trench with gas pipe,
sewer pipe or any other facility of a public service company, nor within three
feet of any open excavation or vault.
      (4)   There shall be placed in the service pipe, within the wall of the
building supplied, and so located as to drain all of the pipes in the building
as well as the meter, an approved valve, easily accessible to the occupants,
for their protection in enabling them to turn off the water in the case of
leaks and to drain pipes to prevent freezing.
      (5)   Hereafter in all future installations or reinstallations of service
lines, only one property will be supplied through one service pipe. Where more
than one property is now supplied through one service pipe, and under the
control of the one curb cock, any violation of the rules of the Borough by
either or any of the consumers so supplied shall be deemed a violation as to
all, and the Borough may take such action as could be taken against a single
consumer, except that such action shall not be taken until the innocent
consumer, who is not in violation of the Borough's rules, has been given a
reasonable opportunity to attach his pipe to a separately controlled service
connection according to Subsection B(1) and (2). Whenever a service pipe
supplying two or more consumers may, for the purpose of stopping leaks or
making other repairs, require the main stops to be closed, it will be replaced
by a separate service line with curb cock and box for each supply according to
Subsection B(1) and (2). Where one service pipe has been used for two or more
properties held in one ownership and there is a division of such ownership,
whether by sale or otherwise, each property will, thereafter, have its own
service pipe according to Subsection B(1) and (2).
      (6)   All leaks in service lines from the curb to, and in and upon, the
premises supplied shall be promptly repaired. On failing to make such repairs
with reasonable dispatch, the Borough may turn off the water, and it will not
be again turned on until all proper and necessary expense incurred in shutting
off and turning on the water are paid in full.
      (7)   The Borough shall in no event be responsible for maintenance of or
for damage done by water escaping from the service pipe or any other pipe or
fixture on the outlet side of the curb cock; and the consumer shall, at all
times, comply with State and municipal regulations in reference thereto and
shall make any changes thereon that are required on account of change of grade,
relocation of mains or otherwise.
   C.   Use of service must be in accordance with application and contract. The
use of water service by a consumer shall in general be in accordance with the
class, scope and type of use and the purpose stated in his application and
service through his service contract. A consumer shall not use or allow use by
others of water service through his service facilities for other purposes than
covered in his application. [See Subsection G(1).] A new application and
contract will make service for other purposes or character of use available.
   D.   Availability of the different classes of service and rates. The various
classes of services and rates are available to a consumer in accordance with
the obvious intent of and statements as to application made under the different
rates in the schedule of rates.
   E.   Metered consumers.
      (1)   Each metered-rate consumer's service shall have a separate meter to
register the amount of water consumed, except as provided in Rule 46.
      (2)   Public garages, filling stations where cars are washed, factories,
hotels, restaurants, rooming houses, school houses, jails, courthouses or other
public buildings will be supplied at meter rates only.
      (3)   Meters will be furnished, installed and removed by the Borough and
shall remain its property.
      (4)   The consumer shall provide, at his expense, a readily accessible
and protected location for the installation of a meter at such a point as will
control the entire supply to the property, which location must be acceptable to
the Borough as most convenient for its service, so that the meter may be easily
examined, read or removed; and the consumer shall also provide suitable pipe
connections and necessary valves and other fittings as may be designated by the
Borough for the proper installation and protection of the meter. The Borough
has the right to order a meter originally installed inside a building to be
moved outside a building, at the customer's expense, if three consecutive
Borough meter reading attempts pass without the Borough meter reader actually
reading the meter due to not being able to gain entrance inside the building.
Failure to move the meter outside 30 days after being so notified is cause for
a discontinuance of service upon 10 days written notice.
      (5)   In all cases where steam or hot water under pressure is used, a
swing check valve must be placed, at the expense of the consumer, directly
ahead of the meter and before any outlets are taken off from the service pipe,
to prevent injury to the meter.
      (6)   Meters will be maintained by the Borough as far as ordinary wear
and tear is concerned, but the consumer shall be responsible to the Borough for
any injury to, or loss of, any meter arising out of or caused by the consumer's
negligence or carelessness, or that of his servants, employees, members of his
household, or any person upon his premises under or by his consent or
sufferance. The consumer shall permit no one, not an agent of the Borough or
otherwise lawfully authorized to do so, to remove, inspect or tamper with the
Borough's meter or other property of the Borough on his premises.
      (7)   The quantity of water recorded by the meter shall be conclusive on
both the consumer and the Borough, except when the meter has been found to be
registering inaccurately or has ceased to register. In either case, the meter
will be promptly repaired by the Borough, and the quantity of water consumed
shall be estimated by the average registration of the meter on previous
corresponding periods.
      (8)   In case of a disputed account involving the accuracy of a meter,
such meter shall be tested, upon the request of the consumer. In the event that
the meter so tested is found to have an error in registration of 4% or more,
the bills will be increased or decreased accordingly.
      (9)   Each request for the test of a meter for accuracy shall be
accompanied by a deposit, the amount of which shall be equal to the cost of
testing. If the meter so tested shall be found to have an error in registration
of less than 4%, the deposit shall be retained by the Borough as compensation
for such test; if the error in registration is found to be 4% or more, then the
cost of the test shall be borne by the Borough, and the amount of deposit shall
be returned to the consumer.
      (10)   The consumer shall at once notify the Borough of any injury to or
of any cessation in registration of the meter as soon as it comes to his
knowledge.
      (11)   Each meter-rate consumer is subject to a minimum charge, the
amount of which is determined by the size of the meter as set forth in the
schedule of rates.
   F.   Bills.
       (1)   Flat-rate service bills are due and payable every other month at
the Borough Office on the first day of January, April, July and October of each
year, covering service rendered during the previous three months.
      (2)   Bills for water service for building purposes are payable and due
after service is rendered and upon presentation.
      (3)   Bills for water service under metered-service rates will be
rendered as soon after the first days of January, March, May, July, September
and November of each year as it is possible to read the meters and make out
bills. Meters will be read every other month. Said bills will be for water
consumed during the preceding two-month period and are due and payable at face
within 30 days of their mailing to the owner. A 10% penalty shall be assessed
for any such charges remaining unpaid beyond the said thirty-day payment
period.
      (4)   If not paid within 60 days from the due date of the bill, the water
may be shut off upon five days notice. Payments mailed, as evidenced by the
United States Post Office mark, on or previous to the end of the thirty-day
period will be deemed to be a payment within such period. All bills will be
made out in the name of the consumer whom the Borough holds responsible for
their payment.
      (5)   In case of bills for service to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or
any department or institution thereof, the discount or non-penalty provisions
of all schedules are extended so as to provide a thirty-day period during which
payment may be made at net rates.
      (6)   Whenever the consumer desires to have his service contract
terminated or his water service discontinued, he shall notify the Borough to
that effect in writing. The consumer will be responsible for the payment of all
service rendered by the Borough until such written notice is received; and, in
the instance of meter-rate service, a reasonable time from the receipt of such
notice shall have elapsed for the Borough to take the final reading of the
meter or meters; or water service is actually otherwise discontinued by the
Borough.
      (7)   The presentation or nonpresentation of a bill shall not be held to
be a waiver of any of the above rules.
   G.   General.
      (1)   The water may be shut off from a consumer failing to comply with
these rules and will not again be turned on until a satisfactory assurance is
given that these rules will be complied with and all proper and necessary
expense incurred in shutting off and turning on water are paid in full. This
amount is not to be less than $20 for turning on service.
      (2)   Deposits may be required from customers taking service for a period
of less than 30 days, in an amount equal to the estimated gross bill for such
temporary period. Deposits may be required from all other customers, provided
that in no instance will deposits be required in excess of the estimated gross
bill for any single billing period plus one month (the maximum period not to
exceed four months), with a minimum of $5. Deposits shall be returned to the
depositor when he shall have paid undisputed bills for service over a period of
12 months. Any customer having secured the return of a deposit shall not be
required to make a new deposit unless the service has been discontinued and the
costumer's credit standing impaired through failure to comply with these rules
and regulations.
      (3)   All waste of water is prohibited. A consumer shall keep his
faucets, valves, hydrants, service lines and hoses in good order and condition,
at his own expense. Sprinkling of any kind whatsoever must be done with
ordinary spraying nozzles generally in use and shall be subject to such
regulations as may be deemed necessary by the Borough.
      (4)   The water will, after due notice, be shut off from a customer
allowing it to run to prevent freezing, or allowing it to run to waste, and
will not be again turned on until satisfactory assurance is given that the
practice will be discontinued and all proper and necessary expense incurred in
shutting off and turning on the water are paid in full.
      (5)   When a premises will be temporarily unoccupied, the consumer shall
notify the Borough, in writing, and the water will be turned off, and all
charges will cease from that date. When the property is again occupied, the
consumer shall again notify the Borough, in writing, and the water will be
turned on. No refund or allowance will be made for unoccupied property when
written notice, both at the time of vacancy and at the time of occupancy, has
not been given as above provided. No refund will be allowed for property
unoccupied as above stated for a period of time less than one month. The charge
for turning on of any service, regardless of length of time of vacancy, shall
be a minimum of $20, based on the expense incurred in turning the water on.
      (6)   In cases of vacancy of a consumer's property, the consumer must
notify the Borough, in writing, of such vacancy; and upon his failure so to do,
he will become responsible for any damage to the property of the Borough
arising from such failure.
      (7)   Water shall not be turned into any premises by any person not an
agent of the Borough, except temporarily by a plumber to enable him to test his
work, provided it shall be turned off again immediately after the test is made.
      (8)   The authorized agents of the Borough shall have the right of
access, at all reasonable hours, to the premises supplied with water for the
purpose of reading meters, examining pipes and fixtures, observing manner of
using water, and for any other purpose which is proper and necessary in the
conduct of the Borough and will carry with them proper credentials denoting
their employment by the system.
      (9)   The Borough will not be liable for any claim or damage arising from
a shortage of water, the breaking of machinery or other facilities, or any
other cause beyond its control.
      (10)   As necessity may arise in case of break, emergency or other
unavoidable cause, the Borough shall have the right to temporarily cut off the
water supply in order to make necessary repairs, connections, etc., but the
Borough will use all reasonable and practical measures to notify the consumer
in advance of such discontinuance of service. In such cases, the Borough shall
not be liable for any damage or inconvenience suffered by the consumer, nor in
any case for any claim against it at any time for interruption in service,
lessening of supply, inadequate pressure, poor quality of water or any cause
beyond its control. The Borough shall have the right to reserve a sufficient
supply of water at all times in its reservoirs to provide for fire or any other
emergencies and may restrict or regulate the quantity of water used by the
consumers in cases of scarcity or whenever the public welfare may require it.
      (11)   No consumer, unless specifically authorized to do so, shall open
or close any of the Borough's stop cocks or valves in any public or private
line.
      (12)   No agent or employee of the Borough shall have the right or
authority to bind it by any promise, agreement or representation contrary to
the letter or intent of these rules and regulations.
      (13)   The Borough reserves the right to alter or amend these rules and
regulations in the manner provided by law.

   1.   General Application - Except as hereinafter provided:
      A.   No building, other structure or land shall hereafter be used or
occupied, and no building or other structure, or parts thereof, shall be
erected, relocated, altered, extended or enlarged unless in conformity with the
use, height and area regulations specified herein for the district in which

provisions of this Ordinance and after the lawful issuance of all permits and
certificates required by this Ordinance.
      C.   No lot area shall be reduced or diminished so that the yards or
other open space thereon shall be less than prescribed by this Ordinance, nor
shall the density of population be increased in any manner except in conformity
with area requirements herein established. If, on the effective date hereof or
of any subsequent amendments hereto increasing the area or open space
requirements, the lot area or required open spaces are less than the minimum
required by this Ordinance, such area or open space shall not be further
reduced.
      D.   No yard or other open space provided on one lot for the purpose of
complying with the provisions of this Ordinance shall be considered as
providing a yard or open space required on any other lot.
      E.   Unless otherwise specified herein, the requirements for area, width
and open space shall be deemed to be minimum requirements.
   2.   Commencement of Construction. Nothing contained in this Ordinance shall
prevent the construction of a building or other structure which is made
nonconforming by this Ordinance, or subsequent amendments hereto, provided that
either:
      A.   Construction of the foundation shall have been lawfully commenced
prior to the adoption of the previous zoning ordinances, being Ordinance No.
201 adopted July 14, 1992, and construction has thereafter been diligently

nonconforming date.
   3.   Severability. It is hereby declared to be the intent of Borough Council
that:
      A.   If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provisions of this
Ordinance invalid in whole or in part, the effect of such decisions shall be
limited to those provisions which are expressly stated in the decision to be
invalid, and all other provisions of this Ordinance shall continue to be
separately and fully effective.
      B.   If a court of competent jurisdiction finds the application of any
provisions of this Ordinance to any building, structure or tract of land to be
invalid in whole or in part, the effect of such decision shall be limited to
the person, property or situation involved in the controversy, and the
application of any such provision to any other person, property or situation
shall not be affected.
(Ord. 300, 10/19/2021, §104)
§ 27-105. Special Criteria for Conditional Uses and Special Exceptions.
   1.   Conditional uses must be granted or denied by Borough Council after a
review and recommendations by the Tionesta Borough Planning Commission. In
addition to determining compliance of the proposed conditional use with these
guidelines and expressed criteria as set forth in this Ordinance, Borough
Council may also set forth reasonable conditions for approval which it feels
are necessary to preserve and protect the neighborhood and community. See
Chapter 14.
   2.   Special exceptions may be granted by the Zoning Hearing Board after
review and recommendations by the Borough Planning Commission in accordance
with these express standards and criteria. In granting a special exception, the
Board may attach reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary
to implement the purposes of this Ordinance and to protect the neighborhood.
The preservation and integrity of existing development in neighborhoods must be
carefully weighed and given priority in each decision. See Chapter 15.
   3.   Conditional uses (See Chapter 14) and special exceptions (See Chapter
15) must satisfy all other requirements for the zone district in which they are
to be located.

§ 27-901. Supplemental Height Regulations.
   See Lot, Yard and Height Requirements Table §27-900 for height requirements.
Height limits may be increased if the following conditions are met:
   1.   Structure height, in excess of the height permitted above the average
ground level allowed in any district, may be increased, provided all minimum
front, side and rear yard depths are increased by 1 foot for each additional
foot of height; however, such increase shall be limited to no more than 10
additional feet.
   2.   The following structures are exempt from height regulations provided
they do not constitute a hazard: communication towers, church spires, chimneys,
elevator bulk heads, smoke stacks, conveyors, flagpoles, silos, standpipes,
elevated water tanks, derricks and similar structures.
   3.   Any structure with a height in excess of 50 feet will be first referred
to the Tionesta Volunteer Fire Department for a review relative to public
safety considerations.
(Ord. 300, 10/19/2021, §901)
PART 10
SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS
§ 27-1000. Nonconforming Uses and Structures.
   The following provisions shall apply to all nonconforming uses and
structures. It is the intention of the Borough that all legal nonconforming
uses and structures shall be able to continue; however, all changes in such
uses shall only be as allowed in this Ordinance.
   1.   Any nonconforming use may be continued or may be changed to a use of
the same or a more restrictive classification but may not be extended or
expanded unless to a conforming use, except as permitted by the Board in
accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
   2.   Any nonconforming building which has been damaged or destroyed by fire
or any other means may be reconstructed and used as before, if such
reconstruction is initiated within 12 months of discontinuance of use and
completed within 24 months of initial damage and if the restored building
covers no greater area and contains no greater cubic content. If approved by
the Board, a reconstructed structure may exceed its original lot coverage and
cubic content but must meet the minimum yard requirements of the district in
which the structure is located, and it must meet the off-street parking and
loading requirements of this Ordinance.
   3.   In the event that any nonconforming use, conducted in a structure or
otherwise, ceases, for whatever reason, for a period of 1 year, such
nonconforming use shall not be resumed and any further use shall be in
conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance.
   4.   The nonconforming use of a building may be extended throughout those
parts thereof which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the
time of adoption of this Ordinance. A nonconforming building or structure may,
with the approval of the Board, be extended, enlarged or replaced if such
expansion does not occupy an area greater than 50% more than the structure
occupied prior to such expansion, enlargement or reconstruction. Furthermore,
such activities must meet the minimum yard regulations and height restrictions
of the district in which the structure is located, and must meet all off-street
parking and loading requirements of this Ordinance.
   5.   Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the overall
layout, plans, construction, size or designated use of any development,
building, structure or part thereof for which official approval and required
permits have been granted prior to the effective date of this Ordinance and
where construction is complete within 6 months from the date of issuance of the
permit.
   6.   Once changed to a conforming use, no structure or land shall be
permitted to revert to a nonconforming use.
   7.   Whenever the boundaries of a district shall be changed so as to
transfer an area from 1 district to another of a different classification, this
Ordinance shall also apply to any uses which thereby become nonconforming.
(Ord. 300, 10/19/2021, §1000)
§ 27-1001. Existing Lots of Record; and Joinder of Adjacent Lots or Subdivision
of Lots.
   1.   Any lot of record existing at the effective date of this Ordinance, and
held in separate ownership different from the ownership of adjoining lots, may
be used for the erection of a structure conforming to the use regulations of
the District in which it is located even though its lot area and width are less
than the minimum required by this Ordinance; however, such lot must comply with
the yard, height and coverage standards of the Zoning District where it is
located. Where 2 or more adjacent lots of record with less than the required
area and width are held by 1 owner, on or before the date of enactment of this
Ordinance, the request for a permit shall be referred to the Board which may
require replatting to fewer lots, which would comply with the minimum
requirements of this Ordinance.
   2.   No provisions of this Ordinance to side and rear yard requirements
shall prevent the reasonable use of an existing lot of record. The Zoning
Officer may grant a reduction in the requirements for side yards and rear yards
for existing lots of record which lack the required lot width. However, in no
event may such yards be reduced more than ½ without the approval of the Board.
(Ord. 300, 10/19/2021, §1001)
§ 27-1002.   Application of Yard Regulations.
   1.   Where a structure exists on an adjacent lot and is within 150 feet of a
proposed structure, and the existing structure has a front yard less than the
minimum depth required, the minimum front yard shall be the average depth of
the front yard of the existing structure on the adjacent lot and the minimum
depth required for the district. Where structures exist on both adjacent lots,
the minimum depth of the front yard shall be the average depth of the front
yards of the existing adjacent structures.
   2.   All structures, whether attached to the principal structure or not, and
whether open or enclosed, including porches, carports, balconies or platforms
above normal grade level, shall not project into any minimum front, side or
rear yards except as noted in Subsections 3 and 4. However, in residential
districts, accessory buildings (detached private garages, tool houses,
playhouses, sheds, etc.) may project into rear and side yards only. Such
structures shall be located no closer than 5 feet from a side property line and
no less than 5 feet from a rear property line.
   3.   Walls or fences in side and rear yards may not exceed 6 feet 6 inches
in height, measuring from the base of the wall or fence where it meets the
ground up to and including the upper most portion of any posts or poles, and
paved terraces without walls, roofs or other enclosures may be erected within
the limits of any yard. Walls or fences in front yards may not exceed 3 feet 6
inches in height, measuring from the base of the wall or fence where it meets
the ground up to and including the upper most portion of any posts or poles,
provided that they do not impinge on the required free sight triangle at
intersections. Retaining walls and fences are not subject to the 3 feet 6
inches and 6 feet 6 inches high limitation.
(Ord. 300, 10/19/2021, §1002)
§ 27-1003. Temporary Structures.
   Temporary structures in conjunction with construction work shall be
permitted only during the period that the construction work is in progress.
Permits for temporary structures shall be issued for a 6-month period by the
Borough Zoning Officer. Permits for temporary structures may be renewed only
upon good cause shown and upon approval of the Zoning Officer.
(Ord. 300, 10/19/2021, §1003)
§ 27-1004. Signs and Commercial Signs.
   1.   Intent. It is the intent of this article to regulate all signs within
the Borough to ensure that they are appropriate for their respective principal
uses and in keeping with the appearance of the affected property and
surrounding environment and to protect the public health, safety, morals and
general welfare. In addition, the intent of this section is to:
      A.   Encourage good design in the context of the overall image and visual
environment of the Borough.
      B.   Enhance the appearance of the business community, taking into
account the nature of the use, and thus stimulate as well as protect the
economic vitality of the Borough.
      C.   Provide for signage which is adequate but not excessive and which
displays a message through use of pictures, symbols and logos for rapid
comprehension by the public.
      D.   Prohibit the erection of signs in such numbers, sizes, designs and
locations as may create a hazard to pedestrians and motorists.
      E.   Avoid excessive competition for large or multiple signs, so that
permitted signs provide adequate identification and direction while minimizing
clutter, unsightliness and confusion.
      F.   Allow for the coordination of signs to reflect the character of the
architecture, landscape and visual themes which the Borough is supporting.
      G.   Promote signs which are designed utilizing clear, crisp lettering
and bold, uncomplicated symbols which will identify a business or activity
efficiently and also enhance the area where they are located as well as the
general appearance of the street or Borough.
      H.   Prevent sign overload and excessively large signs which creates a
visually chaotic and competitive situation within the Borough.
   2.   Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have

§ 27-1101. Off-Street Loading and Parking.
   1.   Off-Street Loading. Every use which requires the receipt or
distribution, by vehicles, of material or merchandise shall provide off-street
loading berths in accordance with its size per the table in §27-1103 below.
Because of its developed nature and the location of service alleys, on-street
and public parking, off-street loading and parking requirements for current or
future uses in the B-Business District shall not be required to provide loading
spaces.
   2.   In all zoning districts, whenever a new use is established or an
existing use is structurally altered, converted or enlarged, off-street loading
spaces shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of this Chapter.
(Ord. 300, 10/19/2021, §1101)
§ 27-1102. Off-Street Loading Design.
   1.   Size. Each loading berth shall be at least 60 feet in length and 14
feet in width with an overhead clearance of 15 feet. The area used for loading
berths shall not be used to satisfy parking area requirements and shall not
block any driveway used for circulation through the site.
2.   Access. Loading berths shall be designed to provide sufficient turnaround
area so that vehicles are not required to back onto public streets, and the
design shall be subject to review and approval by the Borough. Loading berths
shall have direct access to a driveway and shall be maintained free from
obstruction.
   3.   Location. All loading berths shall be located on the same lot with the
principal use they are intended to serve. No loading berth shall be located in
the minimum required front yard setback. Loading berths shall be located at
least 25 feet from the nearest point of intersection of any two streets.
   4.   Screening. Loading berths that face a residential use or dwelling or
that are located in a SF or MF District shall be screened by a minimum 8-foot
high wall or opaque fence on all sides that face the residential use or
dwelling or any Residential Zoning District and a landscaped strip of not less
than 10 feet in width shall be planted and maintained with appropriate
vegetative landscaping between the loading berth and the residential use or
dwelling. Any architectural screens or fences on corner lots shall not impinge
on the required free sight triangle at intersections.
   5.   Surfacing. All loading berths shall have a paved, concrete or
bituminous surface, with adequate thickness to support the weight of a fully
loaded vehicle and graded with positive drainage to dispose of surface water.
   6.   Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate loading berths shall be
designed to reflect from any adjoining residential use or zoning classification
and away from any street or highway. Spillover lighting shall not exceed 0.2
foot-candle at any property line.
(Ord. 300, 10/19/2021, §1102)
§ 27-1103. Off-Street Loading Requirements.
   In all zoning districts, every use that requires the receipt or
distribution, by tractor-trailer, of material or merchandise shall provide off-
street loading berths in accordance with the following requirements:
 
Gross Floor Area                       Number of Berths Required
Under 5,000 square feet                None
5,000 to 49,999 square feet            1 berth
50,000 to 99,999 square feet           2 berths
100,000 to 160,000 square feet         3 berths
For each additional 80,000 square feet 1 additional berth
 
   In addition to required off-street parking and loading facilities, adequate
storage areas for vehicles awaiting loading and unloading shall be provided.
Under no circumstances shall vehicles be stored on or block access to a public
right-of-way.
(Ord. 300, 10/19/2021, §1103)
§ 27-1104. Off-Street Parking.
   1.   Size and Access. Each off-street parking space shall have an area of
not less than 200 square feet, being at least 20 feet long with a uniform width
of 10 feet, exclusive of access drives or aisles, and shall be in usable shape
and condition. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a single-family
dwelling, no parking area shall contain less than 3 spaces. Parking areas shall
be designed to provide sufficient turnaround area so that vehicles are not
required to back onto public streets. Where an existing lot does not abut on a
road, private street, alley, or other type of easement providing access, an
access drive leading to the parking or storage areas or loading spaces shall be
provided. Such access drive shall not be less than 10 feet wide. Access to off-
street parking areas shall be limited to well-defined locations, and in no case
shall there be unrestricted access along a street. Specifically, single-lane
driveways shall be at least 10 feet wide but shall not exceed 12 feet in width;
double drives (for ingress and egress) may be up to 24 feet wide. There shall
be at least 15 feet between driveways at the street line and at least 5 feet
between a driveway and a fire hydrant, catch basin or street intersection
radius.
   2.   Parking Within Yards. In Conservation, Single-Family, and Multi-Family
Districts, required parking facilities shall be permitted in the rear or side
yards. In Single-Family and Multi-Family Districts that do not have on-street
parking availability, parking is allowed in the front yard in an area
specifically designed for parking purposes. In other districts parking shall
also be allowed in the front yard subject to §27-1104.5.
   3.   Number of Parking Spaces Required. The number of off-street parking
spaces required is set forth in §27-1100. Where the use of the premises is not
specifically mentioned, requirements for similar uses shall apply. If no
similar uses are mentioned, the parking requirements shall be 1 space for each
2 proposed patrons and/or occupants of that structure. Where more than 1 use
exists on a lot, parking regulations for each use must be met. No parking shall
be required for existing or future uses in the B-Business District.
   4.   Location and Parking. Required parking spaces shall be located on the
same lot with the principal use. The Board may permit parking spaces to be
located not more than 200 feet from the lot of the principal use, if located in
the same zoning district as the principal use, and the Board finds that it is
impractical to provide parking on the same lot with the principal use.
   5.   Screening and Landscaping. Off-street parking areas for more than 5
vehicles and off-street loading areas shall be effectively screened on any and
all sides which adjoin a Single-Family or Multi-Family District, Dwelling or
other residential use with screening that shall be no less than 6 feet 6 inches
in height, measuring from the base of the wall or fence where it meets the
ground up to and including the upper most portion of any posts or poles. In
addition, there shall be a planting strip of at least 5 feet between the front
lot line and the parking lot. Such planting strip shall be suitably landscaped
and maintained.
   6.   Minimum Distance and Setbacks. No off-street loading or parking area
for more than 5 vehicles shall be closer than 25 feet to any adjoining property
containing a dwelling, school, hospital or similar institution.
   7.   Surfacing. With the exception of single-family and duplex dwellings,
all parking and loading areas and access drives shall have a paved or oiled
surface, graded with positive drainage to dispose of surface water. Parking
areas larger than 10,000 square feet shall submit a plan, including drainage
provisions, to the Borough Planning Commission for approval. Lots shall be
designed to provide for orderly and safe loading and parking.
   8.   Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking or loading
areas shall be arranged so as to reflect the light away from the adjoining
premises of any residential district or use and away from roads or highways.
   9.   Storage and Parking of Personal Recreational Items. The outdoor storage
of major recreational equipment owned by the occupant of the premises
including, but not limited to, Travel Trailers, Motor Homes, tent trailers,
pickup campers (designed to be mounted on automotive vehicles), boats and boat
trailers shall be permitted in all zoning districts; however, in the Single-
Family and Multi- Family districts, storage locations shall comply with the
following minimum yard requirements (storage shall not take place in these yard
areas):
      Front yard - 40 feet
      Side yards - 10 feet
      Street corner side yard (corner lot) - 40 feet
      Rear yard - 6 feet
   10.   Parking of Vehicles Used in Vocational/Avocational Pursuits. Nothing
in this Chapter shall be considered to prohibit the occupants of a residential
property from parking a truck or bus, owned and/or used by the occupant in his
vocational or avocational pursuits, on the occupant's property at times when
said truck or bus is not used in said vocational or avocational pursuits;
providing, however that truck tractors and/or semi-trailers shall not be parked
in the open air any closer than 150 feet from the nearest residence on a
neighboring property.
   11.   Outdoor Storage of Inoperative, Unlicensed, Uninspected Vehicles.
There shall be no outdoor storage of motor vehicles which are inoperative,
unlicensed, unregistered or lack current Pennsylvania inspection in any
district. Such vehicles must be stored in garages, barns or other enclosed
structures.

development described in the building permit or zoning certificate application
has been completed in compliance with the application and this Ordinance. A
certificate of occupancy shall also be required for a change of use of a
structure or land to a different use or for change to a nonconforming use or
structure. Prior to a certificate of occupancy being issued, the Zoning Officer
shall review the application and information relevant to the property to

§ 27-1203. Appeals, Variances, Special Exceptions and Conditional Uses.
   The Zoning Officer shall receive all appeals, applications for variances and
requests for special exceptions and conditional uses. The applications shall be
on forms as approved by the Borough or the Board, as appropriate, and shall be

Zoning Officer shall send an enforcement notice. The enforcement notice shall
be sent to the Landowner of the parcel on which the violation has occurred, to
any person who has filed a written request to receive enforcement notices
regarding that parcel, and to any other person requested in writing by the
Landowner. The enforcement notice shall state the following:
      A.   The name of the Landowner and any other person against whom the
Borough intends to take action.
      B.   The location of the property in violation.
      C.   The specific violation with a description of the requirements which
have not been met, citing in each instance the applicable provisions of this
Ordinance or Chapter.
      D.   The date before which the steps for compliance must be commenced and
the date before which the steps must be completed.
      E.   A statement that the recipient of the notice has the right to appeal
to the Board within a prescribed period of time in accordance with procedures
set forth in this Chapter.
      F.   A statement that failure to comply with the notice within the time
specified, unless extended by appeal to the Board, constitutes a violation,
with possible sanctions clearly described.
   2.   Causes of Action. In case any building, structure, landscaping or land
is, or is proposed to be, erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered,
converted, maintained or used in violation of this Ordinance, the Borough, the
Zoning Officer, or any aggrieved Landowner or tenant of real property who shows
that his or her property or person will be substantially affected by the
alleged violation, in addition to other remedies, may institute an appropriate
action or proceeding to prevent, restrain, correct or abate such building,
structure, landscaping or land, or to prevent, in or about such premises, any
act, conduct, business or use constituting a violation. When any such action is
instituted by a Landowner or tenant, notice of that action shall be served upon
the Borough at least 30 days prior to the time the action is begun by serving a
copy of the complaint on Borough Council. No such action may be maintained
until such notice has been given.
   3.   Jurisdiction. District justices shall have initial jurisdiction over
proceedings brought under this Ordinance or Chapter.
   4.   Enforcement Remedies. Any person, partnership or corporation who or
which has violated or permitted the violation of the provisions of this
Ordinance shall, upon being found liable therefor in a civil enforcement
proceeding commenced by the Borough, pay a judgment of not more than $500 plus
all court costs, including reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Borough as
a result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or payable
until the date of the determination of a violation by the district justice. If
the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the Borough may
enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each
day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless
the district justice determining that there has been a violation further
determines that there was a good-faith basis for the person, partnership or
corporation violating this Ordinance to have believed that there was no such
violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have been only 1 such
violation until the fifth day following the date of the determination of a
violation by the district justice and thereafter each day that a violation
continues shall constitute a separate violation. All judgments, costs and
reasonable attorney fees collected for the violation of this Ordinance shall be
paid over to the Borough. Nothing contained in this Section 4 shall be
construed or interpreted to grant any person or entity other than the Borough
and its Zoning Officer the right to commence any action for enforcement
pursuant to this Ordinance or Chapter.

§ 27-1306. Hearings.
   The Board shall conduct hearings and make decisions in accordance with the
following requirements:
   1.   Notification shall be given to the public by notice published once each
week for 2 successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the
Borough. Such notice shall state the time and place of the hearing and the
particular nature of the matter to be considered at the hearing. The first
publication shall be not more than 30 days or less than 7 days prior to the
date of the hearing. Written notice shall be given to the applicant, the Zoning
Officer and to any person who has made timely request for the notice. Written
notices shall be prescribed by rules of the Board. In addition to the notice
provided herein, written notice of the hearing shall be conspicuously posted on
the affected tract of land at least one week prior to the hearing. At least 10
days prior to the date of the hearing, the Board shall transmit to the Borough
Planning Commission a copy of the application or appeal so that the Planning
Commission may have the opportunity of submitting a report to the Board.
   2.   The Borough Council may prescribe reasonable fees with respect to
hearings before the Board. Fees for hearings may include compensation for the
Secretary and members of the Board, payment for a stenographer, notice and
advertising costs and necessary administrative overhead connected with the
hearing. The fees, however, shall not include the cost for legal services of
the Board, expenses for engineering, architectural or other technical
consultants or expert witness costs.
   3.   The hearing shall be held within 60 days from the date of the
applicant's request, unless the applicant has agreed in writing to an extension
of time.
   4.   The hearings shall be conducted by the Board or the Board may appoint
any member as a hearing officer. The decision, or, where no decision is called
for, the findings shall be made by the Board, but the parties may waive
decision or findings by the Board and accept the decision or findings of the
hearing officer as final.
   5.   The parties to the hearing shall be the Borough, any person affected by
the application who has made timely appearance of record before the Board, and
the Planning Commission or any other person, including civic or community
organizations, permitted to appear by the Board. The Board shall have power to
require that all persons who wish to be considered parties enter appearances in
writing on forms provided by the Board for that purpose.
   6.   The chairperson or acting chairperson of the Board or the hearing
officer presiding shall have power to administer oaths and issue subpoenas to
compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of relevant documents and

   7.   The parties shall have the right to be represented by counsel and shall
be afforded the opportunity to respond and present evidence and argument and
cross examine adverse witnesses on all relevant issues.

unduly repetitious evidence may be excluded.
   9.   The Board or the hearing officer, as the case may be, shall keep a
stenographic record of the proceedings. The appearance fee for a stenographer
shall be the sole cost and expense of the applicant. The cost of the original
transcript shall be paid by the Board if the transcript is ordered by the Board
or hearing officer or shall be paid by the person appealing from the decision
of the Board if such appeal is made. In either event, the cost of additional
copies shall be paid by the person requesting such copy or copies. In other
cases, the party requesting the original transcript shall bear the cost
thereof.
   10.   The Board or the hearing officer shall not communicate, directly or
indirectly, with any party or party's representative in connection with any
issue involved except upon notice and opportunity for all parties to

The Board shall not take notice of any communication, reports, staff memoranda,
or other materials unless the parties are afforded an opportunity to contest
the material so noticed and shall not inspect the site or its surroundings
after the commencement of hearings with any party or party's representative
unless all parties are given an opportunity to be present.
   11.   The Board or the hearing officer, as the case may be, shall render a
written decision or, when no decision is called for, make written findings on
the application within 45 days after the last hearing before the Board or
hearing officer. Where the application is contested or denied, each decision
shall be accompanied by findings of fact and conclusions based thereon together
with the reasons therefor. Conclusions based on any provisions of this Chapter
or the Planning Code, or any rule or regulation, shall contain a reference to
the provision relied on and the reasons why the conclusion is considered
appropriate in the light of the facts found. If the hearing is conducted by a
hearing officer, and there has been no stipulation that the hearing officer's
decision or findings are final, the Board shall make the hearing officer's
report and recommendations available to the parties within 45 days, and the
parties shall be entitled to make written representations thereon to the Board
prior to the final decision or entry or findings. The Board's decision shall be
entered no later than 30 days after the report of the hearing officer.
   12.   Where the Board fails to render the decision within the period
required by this Chapter or the Planning Code or fails to hold the required
hearing within 60 days from the date of applicant's request for a hearing, the
decision shall be considered to have been rendered in favor of the applicant
unless the applicant has agreed in writing or on the record to an extension of
time. When a decision has been rendered in favor of the applicant because of
the failure of the Board to meet or render a decision as hereinabove provided,
the Board shall give public notice of the decision within 10 days in the same
manner as provided in Subsection 1. of this Section. Nothing in this subsection
shall prejudice the right of any party to appeal the decision to a court of
competent jurisdiction.
   13.   A copy of the final decision or, where no decision is called for, of
the findings shall be delivered to the applicant personally or by mail not
later than the day following the date of the decision. To all other persons who
have filed their name and address with the Board no later than the last day of
the hearing, the Board shall provide by mail or otherwise, a brief notice of
the decision or findings and a statement of the place at which the full
decision or findings may be examined.

§ 27-1307. Board's Functions.
   The Board shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and render final
adjudication in the following matters:

916.1(a)(2) of the Planning Code.
   2.   Challenges to the validity of this Ordinance or other land use
ordinances raising procedural questions or alleged defects in the process of
enactment or adoption, which challenges shall be raised by an appeal taken
within 30 days after the effective date of the ordinance.
   3.   Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer including, but not
limited to, the granting or denial of any permit or failure to act on the
application therefor; the issuance of any cease-and-desist order; or the
registration or refusal to register any nonconforming use, structure or lot.
   4.   Appeals from a determination by the Borough Engineer or the Zoning
Officer with reference to the administration of any floodplain or flood hazard
ordinance or such provisions within this Ordinance or other land use
ordinances.
   5.   Applications for variances from the terms of this Ordinance or flood
hazard ordinance or such provisions within this Ordinance or a land use
Ordinance, pursuant to Section 910.2 of the Planning Code and §27-1307.8 of
this Ordinance.
   6.   Appeals from the Zoning Officer's preliminary determination under
Sections 909.l(a) of the Planning Code.
   7.   Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer or Borough
Engineer in the administration of this Ordinance or other land use ordinances
or provision thereof with reference to sedimentation and erosion control and

involving applications under Article V (Subdivision and Land Development) or
VII (Planned Residential Development) applications of the Planning Code which
are administered by Borough Council or Planning Commission if designated by
Borough Council.
   8.   Variances. The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is
alleged that the provisions of this Ordinance inflict unnecessary hardship upon
the applicant. The Board may by rule prescribe the form of application and may
require preliminary application to the Zoning Officer. The Board may grant a
variance provided that all of the following findings are made where relevant in
a given case:
      A.   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or
exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property, and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such
conditions, and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of this Ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which the
property is located.
      B.   That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of this Ordinance and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
      C.   That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant;
      D.   That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
      E.   That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulations in issue. In granting any variance, the Board may
attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may determine are
necessary to implement the purpose of this Ordinance.
   9.   Special Exceptions. The Board shall hear and decide requests for
special exceptions in accordance with the standards and criteria of this
Ordinance. In granting a special exception, the Board may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to those expressed in this
Ordinance, as it may consider necessary to implement the purpose of this
Ordinance.
   10.   Nonconforming Uses. The Board shall have the power to authorize
changes of lawful nonconforming uses. The Board may impose such conditions as
it determines necessary for the protection of adjacent property, the public
interest and the purposes of this Ordinance.

   No person shall file any proceeding with the Board later than 30 days after
an application for development, preliminary or final, has been approved by an
appropriate Borough officer, agency or body if such proceeding is designed to
secure reversal or to limit the approval in any manner unless such person
alleges and proves that he or she had no notice, knowledge or reason to believe
that such approval had been given. Any such person who has succeeded to his or
her interest after such approval shall be bound by the knowledge of his or her
predecessor in interest. Proceedings shall be in accordance with the Planning
Code.
(Ord. 300, 10/19/2021, §1309)
§ 27-1310.   Stay of Proceedings.
   Upon filing of any proceeding referred to in §27-1306 and during its
pendency before the Board, all land development pursuant to any challenged
ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning Officer or of any agency or body,
and all official action thereunder shall be stayed unless the Zoning Officer or
any other appropriate agency or body certifies to the Board facts indicating
that such stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case
the development or official action shall not be stayed otherwise than by a
restraining order, which may be granted by the Board or by the court having
jurisdiction of zoning appeals on petition after notice to the Zoning Officer
or other appropriate agency or body. Proceedings shall be in accordance with
§915.1 of the Planning Code.

   The Board shall hear requests for special exception applications, as
permitted under the provisions of this chapter. The Board recognizes that

specific district and, where it appears that a use permitted by special
exception fails to comply with all of the definitional aspects thereof or would
be contrary to the public health, safety, morals and/or welfare of the
community at specific locations within a district, the use would not be
permitted there.
(Ord. 300, 10/19/2021, §1500)

minimizing of noxious, offensive or hazardous elements and adequate standards
of parking and sanitation. The preservation and integrity of existing
development in neighborhoods must be carefully weighed and given priority in
each decision.

§ 27-1504. Time Limitation After Approval.
   The approval of a special exception, if authorized by the Board, which
anticipates construction or modification of a structure, creation of new or
revised lot lines or dimensional standards for a property or structure situated

of said approval and shall thereafter expire and be void unless said
construction, modification, new or revised lot lines or dimensional standards
or change of use or occupancy is initiated within said 1-year term or said term
is expressly extended as part of the initial approval or a further extension of
the term being granted by the Board prior to the expiration of the 1-year
period. In the event that the activity anticipated by the special exception
should not be initiated within 1 year of the approval or such additional term
as may be expressed in the approval or should the activity which is the subject
of the special exception be discontinued, the premises or structure or
structure situated thereon shall not thereafter be used except in conformity

made where relevant in a given case:
   1.   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including

topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property,
and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such condition and not
circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of this chapter
in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
   2.   That, because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no
