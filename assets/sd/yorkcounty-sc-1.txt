the provisions affected; the use of a word or words to which no meaning can be
attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words were clearly
intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be corrected and the word or
words supplied, omitted or substituted as will conform with the manifest
intention, and the provisions shall have the same effect as though the correct
words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration shall
be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or extent of

previous ordinance shall not be revived without express words to that effect.

ordinances passed subsequent to this code may be numbered in accordance with

(‘77 Code, § 2-31) (Ord. 4, passed 2-7-77)
§ 30.09 ELECTION AND APPOINTMENTS TO BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS.
   (A)   (1)   The Chief Administrative Officer of the County shall report to
the Council all impending and existing vacancies on county boards and
commissions and boards and commissions which the Council has the legal
responsibility to fill prior to the expiration of the terms of those boards or
commissions whose successors are to be elected or as soon thereafter as is
practicable.
      (2)   The Chairman of the York County Council shall refer the matter of
each impending and existing vacancy to the appropriate committee of Council for
its study and report.
   (B)   At the public meeting of Council next preceding the meeting at which
the election is to be held, the committee to which the matter of nominations
was referred may present to Council one or more nominations to fill each such
vacancy with the names of the incumbent member of each board or commission
whose successors are to be elected.
   (C)   At the meeting of Council next following the meeting at which the
appropriate committee has made its report and nominations to fill vacancies,
nominations may be made from the floor by any member of Council. The Council
shall vote in open session for the number of nominees equal to the number of
vacancies to be filled by voice vote. Nominees receiving a majority of the
votes cast for each vacancy shall be elected. If no candidate receives a
majority vote, the balloting shall continue until there is an election to fill
each vacancy; provided, however, that the election to fill each such vacancy
may be delayed upon a majority vote of Council.
   (D)   In cases in which the Council does not elect, but recommends persons
for appointment by the Governor or some other authority, the same procedure as
applied to elections to County boards and commissions shall be followed
concerning recommendations for such appointments.
   (E)   (1)   No person shall be elected or appointed by the County Council to
serve more than two full consecutive terms on boards or commissions, unless the
person is appointed to the York County Natural Gas Authority (YCNGA) Board.
County Council may recommend a person for appointment to the YCNGA Board for no
more than three full, consecutive terms. Previous service for a full term shall
be counted in determining a member’s service on county boards and commissions
for purposes of the limitations on consecutive service established by this
section, and partial terms of service on county boards and commissions for a
term equal to or greater than one-half of the full term on such board or
commission shall be considered a term for purposes of the limitations contained
in this division.
      (2)   No person shall be reappointed to a county board or commission upon
which the person has served for two consecutive terms until a period of time of
one year has elapsed since the last service of the person upon the board or
commission. No appointee who has served three consecutive terms on the YCNGA
Board may be recommended for reappointment until one year has elapsed since the
appointee’s last service on the YCNGA Board.
      (3)   Residency requirement. All district-specific appointments to any
York County Board or Commission, whether by direct County Council appointment
or by recommendation for appointment, shall be required to maintain their
residence in the district of appointment throughout the duration of the term of
appointment, or be subject to immediate removal and replacement, to clarify
that any county-wide appointee moving out of the county shall be grounds for a
Board member’s immediate removal and replacement, unless an extra-county
domicile is specifically permitted by ordinance. Examples of not maintaining
one’s residence within the district of appointment shall include but not be
limited to, moving a member’s primary residence to another district or outside
the county or no longer residing in the district through the results of a
county redistricting process.

§ 30.10 AUTHORITY OF COUNCIL TO APPOINT BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS; DUTIES;
DELEGATION OF RESPONSIBILITY PROHIBITED.
   (A)   (1)   The County Council has determined the need for boards and
commissions to provide for the general health, safety and welfare of the
citizens of the county and pursuant to the determination, the County Council
has established or restructured certain boards and commissions in the county,
as provided by law.
      (2)   The County Council finds that it has the authority to appoint
certain boards and commissions under The Home Rule Act (Act 283 of 1975, as
amended) and pursuant to its authority, the County Council has appointed
members of certain boards and commissions in the county.
   (B)   The County Council further finds that the duties of boards and
commissions over which the County Council exercises appointment powers shall be
to establish policy and to render decisions on all matters relating to the
regular functions, special activities or other items of business within the
jurisdiction of the boards and commissions.
   (C)   The County Council finds that it is in the best interests of all
boards and commissions and the people of the county for policy-making and other
decisions required of the county boards and commissions to be made by the
entire membership of the boards and commissions.
   (D)   No board or commission, over which the County Council has or exercises
appointment powers, shall delegate its authority to any executive or other
special committee established by the boards and commissions from among its
members to act on behalf of, or in the name of the boards or commissions at any
time.
   (E)   (1)   Annually, upon the request of the Clerk to County Council, each
board or commission member must disclose his employer; spouse’s employer; all
companies or corporations of which he is a member, officeholder, shareholder,
stakeholder, or in which he has any financial interest; and membership on any
public boards by the member, member’s spouse, or persons living in the member’s
household.
      (2)   Additionally, prior to any reappointment to a board or commission,
the re-appointee shall renew a board application which shall be maintained by
the Clerk to Council.
   (F)   No person may serve on a board or commission if that person or any
company or corporation of which that person is a member, officeholder,
shareholder, stakeholder, or in which the person has a direct financial
interest failed to fulfill contractual obligations owed to York County or
failed to complete contractual obligations requiring York County to use
taxpayer dollars to complete the obligations in order to protect public health,
safety, or welfare.
   (G)   Any board or commission member who has a conflict of interest on a
matter before the board or commission, must disclose the conflict of interest
to the board or commission and recuse himself or herself from the discussion
and decision on the matter.
      (1)   A conflict of interest means:
         (a)   An interest distinct from that of the general public in which a
board or commission member may gain an economic benefit from the decision of
the board or commission; or
         (b)   An interest where an individual board or commission member
maintains a duty to an organization appearing before the public body, by virtue
of service upon the organization board.
      (2)   A conflict of interest does not exist if the only economic interest
or reasonably foreseeable benefit that may accrue to the board or commission
member is incidental to the member’s position or which accrues to the member as
a member of a profession, occupation, or large class to no greater extent than
the economic interest or potential benefit could reasonably be foreseen to
accrue to all other members of the profession, occupation, or large class.
      (3)   The minutes of meetings shall record the conflict of interest
disclosed and the recusal.
      (4)   (a)   The County Council may remove a member for cause who fails to
either disclose a potential conflict of interest or recuse himself or herself
as a result of a conflict of interest.
         (b)   A board or commission member removed for cause may appeal the
decision by requesting a hearing before County Council within 30 days after the
notice of removal is sent. A member who fails to request a hearing waives his
right to a hearing. County Council must hear the appeal within 30 days after
receiving the appeal. No more than 15 days after the date of the hearing,
County Council must vote to either reinstate the board or commission member or
uphold the removal and issue a decision to the member.

§ 30.11 ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTIONS; APPROVAL AS TO FORM; REQUIREMENT TO BE IN
WRITING; INTRODUCTION; REFERRAL; READINGS; ADOPTION; AND EMERGENCY ORDINANCES.
   (A)   All ordinances and resolutions shall be submitted to and approved by
the county manager, and by the county attorney as to legality, form and
draftsmanship. Additionally, the county manager and the county attorney may
place an ordinance, in full or by title only, on the agenda for consideration
by Council.
   (B)   As used herein, the term “ordinance” shall mean an ordinance having
the force of law. Resolutions shall not have the force of law, but shall
express the opinion, feeling or recommendation of the Council concerning a
particular thing or matter.
   (C)   All proposed ordinances and resolutions shall be in writing, either
typed or printed. Proposed ordinances must be submitted to the clerk to the
County Council in writing at least 24 hours prior to the meeting, regular or
special, at which introduction is planned.
   (D)   Any member of the Council may introduce an ordinance topic for
discussion and review by requesting through the council chair and county
manager that a topic be placed on an upcoming council agenda for discussion and
debate and the requesting councilmember so noted on the agenda; or
alternatively, by bringing up a topic for discussion and review during the
council non-agenda portion of a council meeting, and requesting that the item
be referred to an appropriate standing committee by the chair, who may
thereafter refer/not-refer the item to committee.
   (E)   All ordinances levying a tax, incurring indebtedness or otherwise
affecting county revenue may be referred to the Committee on Finance, which
shall report thereon before the Council shall vote for their passage.
   (F)   The clerk to the Council shall assign a calendar (agenda) number to
the proposed ordinance. Proposed ordinances shall be listed on the calendar
(agenda) by number and title in the order in which they are introduced.
   (G)   If each member of the Council is furnished with a copy of a proposed
ordinance or resolution, a verbatim reading thereof shall not be required
unless the reading is specifically requested by a member. All ordinances, with
the exception of emergency ordinances as hereinafter set out, shall be read at
three public meetings of the Council on three separate days with an interval of
not less than seven days between the second and third readings. Ordinance
readings are considered held and provided when the Ordinance reading is
favorably voted upon by a majority of Council present at the Council meeting,
regular or special, occurs as part of the county council agenda, including its
consent agenda.
      (1)   At the first reading of an ordinance, a vote shall be taken and
debate or amendment is appropriate, unless the ordinance is voted upon as part
of the consent agenda or appears “By Title Only” in which case no debate or
amendment shall occur. Though not required, the ordinance may be referred by
the Council chair to an appropriate committee unless reference is dispensed
with by a two-thirds majority vote of members present or when the proposed
ordinance shall have been introduced and recommended by a committee.
      (2)   Committee reports on a referred ordinance shall ordinarily be made
at the next consecutive public meeting following first reading, unless a longer
time has been designated by the chair or requested by the committee chair.
Custom and practice of County Council has required committee meetings to occur
immediately prior to the next regularly scheduled County Council meeting.
However, in the event this is not practicable, then it is encouraged that the
committee meeting occur during regular working hours of the county in advance
of the next regularly scheduled meeting. Unless otherwise administered though
the county agenda process, at least one day prior to the second reading of an
ordinance, a complete typewritten or printed copy of the text of the ordinance
shall be delivered to every member of the Council, with such delivery being
made electronically, including delivery through the county agenda software
distribution process. After all amendments and privileged motions, if any, are
disposed of, the question shall be, whether the ordinance shall receive a
second reading. Second reading of a proposed ordinance may not be on the same
day as the first reading. On second reading, a proposed ordinance may be fully
debated and amended, tabled, and the like. After discussion, the proposed
ordinance shall be voted upon.
      (3)   After the ordinance has been given second reading, it shall be
given third reading at a subsequent public meeting of Council and amendments
may be proffered on third reading the same as on second reading. At least seven
days must elapse between the second and third readings of a proposed ordinance.
On third reading, the proposed ordinance may be acted on in the same manner as
on the second reading. After all amendments and privileged motions, if any, are
disposed of, the question shall be the passage of the ordinance. Final action
on an ordinance requiring public hearing shall not be taken until the public
hearing has been held. When adopted by a majority vote of the County Council
the ordinance becomes an official ordinance of the county.
   (H)   A resolution does not have the force and effect of law and may be
adopted at any public meeting of Council. However, unless introduced by an
appropriate committee, every resolution must be coordinated through the chair
of council, the county manager, the clerk to Council, and the county attorney,
and upon introduction thereafter be referred to an appropriate committee unless
referral shall be dispensed by a two-thirds majority vote of members present,
and thereafter voted upon at the meeting. A report of the committee shall
ordinarily be made at the next public meeting and the resolution may be adopted
by the Council at that meeting or any subsequent public meeting. Any resolution
which is up for adoption may be amended. All amendments must be in writing and
germane to the proposed resolution. After all amendments and privileged
motions, if any, are dispensed with, the question shall be the adoption of the
resolution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, non-substantive resolutions such as
honorary acknowledgments and proclamations, and the like may be placed on a
council agenda through coordination with the clerk to Council, the county
manager, and/or the county attorney, as may be appropriate. Similarly,
resolutions promulgated through the ongoing processes and dictates of the
Planning and Development Services Department may be placed on the council
agenda through coordination with the clerk to Council, the county manager, and
the county attorney.
   (I)   Except as otherwise provided herein, all ordinances, resolutions,
codes or policies may be passed or adopted by a majority of the members present
voting for passage or adoption.
   (J)   (1)   Notwithstanding the foregoing requirements, the county may
initiate emergency ordinances and dispense with the processes described above.
In accordance with S.C. Code §§ 4-9-120 and 4-9-130, as may be amended from
time to time, the Council may adopt emergency ordinances. An emergency
ordinance shall be effective immediately upon its enactment without regard to
any reading, public hearing or public notice requirements. Emergency ordinances
shall expire automatically as of the sixty-first day following the date of
enactment.
      (2)   The ordinances must deal with public emergencies affecting life,
health, safety or the property of the people. The ordinances shall not levy
taxes, grant, renew or extend a franchise or impose or charge a service rate.
      (3)   Every emergency ordinance shall be designated as such and shall
contain a declaration that an emergency exists and describe the emergency.
Every emergency ordinance shall be enacted by the affirmative vote of at least
two-thirds of the members of the Council present.

§ 30.12 EFFECTIVE DATE; NUMBERING, FILING, PRINTING, CODIFYING AND THE LIKE.
   (A)   The effective date of each ordinance or resolution passed by the
Council shall be on the day that the ordinance is given third reading or the
date the resolution is adopted unless the effective date of the ordinance or
resolution is set out in the ordinance or resolution.
   (B)   Each ordinance adopted by the Council shall be filed in the office of

ordinance number consistent with the system for numbering ordinances adopted by
the Council.

preceding 12 months shall be printed and made available for public distribution
through the office of the Council by the executive secretary. In accordance
with S.C. Code § 4-9-120, as amended, all proceedings of Council shall be
compiled, indexed, codified and published by title.
   (E)   Every ordinance adopted by the Council shall be forwarded by the clerk
to the council to the codifier of the county’s ordinances. The codifier shall,
immediately or at intervals as the Council may determine, upon receipt, prepare
the ordinance for inclusion in the codified ordinances of the county, as
appropriate, and shall prepare replacement or additional pages to the County
Code.
   (F)   All ordinances adopted by the County Council shall be made available
for public inspection in the office of the clerk to the council during normal
business hours for county offices. Copies of any ordinance adopted by the
Council may be purchased at the office of the clerk to the council at a price
fixed by the clerk which covers the cost of reproduction.

§ 31.08 ALARM SYSTEMS.
   (A)   Statement of policy. It is the policy and goal of the county to give
activated emergency alarms, such as fire and medical alarms and automated calls
for assistance by the sheriff’s office, a high priority in order to ensure that
citizens and residents of the county receive maximum protection in
circumstances requiring a response for assistance from fire and medical and in
situations requiring the assistance of the county’s sheriff’s office. It is
hereby declared to be the policy of the county to minimize false emergency
alarms which deter public safety forces in the effective administration and
execution of their duties in real emergencies; result in additional costs in
the administration of county public safety programs; and impair public safety
forces in responding promptly to real emergencies. It is further declared to be
the policy of the county to recoup a portion of resources wasted by the county
in responding to false emergency alarms by the imposition of user fees.

      DIRECT REPORTING ALARMS PROHIBITED. An alarm or alarming station that
directly reports to the department of public safety communications is
prohibited.
      FALSE ALARM. Any alarm activation, whether audible or silent, caused by

public safety personnel or equipment to be unfounded and not actually required.
      SILENT ALARM. An alarm, typically a panic, holdup or burglar alarm, which
has no ringers or audible indications that the alarm has been activated present
at the site, and in which the signal is transmitted to the monitoring station.

      (4)   Buildings and facilities with multiple occupants shall have a
stand-alone address for each building/facility or a sole building address with

      (5)   Each location which has a telephone will have a unique address
assigned;
      (6)   Telephone or other communications service may not be provided to

four inches in height. Numbers shall be made of a durable and clearly visible
material and shall be in contrast to the color of the building.
      (4)   Numbers shall be put in a conspicuous place immediately above, on,
or at the side of the proper door so that the number is clearly visible from
the street line. In cases where the building is situated more than 50 feet from
the street line, the building number shall be placed near the walk, driveway or
common entrance to the building, or upon the mailbox, gatepost, fence, curb or
other appropriate place so as to be clearly visible from the street line.
(‘77 Code, § 7.5-55)
   (F)   Duties and responsibilities.
      (1)   Whenever any house, building or structure shall be erected or
located in the area of the county after May 1, 1995, it shall be the duty of
county planning and development to inform any party applying therefor of the
number or numbers belonging to or embraced within the limits of any lot or
property, as provided in this section. In case of conflict as to the proper
number to be assigned to any building, the department of public safety
communications shall determine the number of the building. It shall be the
responsibility of all areas not served by the county to coordinate road naming
and house numbering with the county’s department of public safety
communications.
      (2)   It shall be the duty of the owner to secure the correct number or
numbers as designated by the department of public safety communications for the
property and attach the number or numbers so assigned on the building, as

of system. The County Council, upon adoption of this section, will require

notification by the county’s department of public safety communications.
Community service organizations, neighborhood associations and rescue and fire
departments will be encouraged to assist in the implementation.

§ 31.10 PROCEDURE FOR PAUPER BURIALS ESTABLISHED; CREMATION.
   (A)   Legislative findings. As an incident to the enactment of this section,
the County Council of York County, South Carolina, as the governing body of
York County, South Carolina, has made the following legislative findings:
      (1)   Pauper burials have become increasingly costly, difficult and time
consuming for York County and the York County Coroner.
      (2)   In many instances, the family of deceased paupers has failed to
claim the dead body, and the York County Coroner has assumed the responsibility
for burial at public expense.
      (3)   Health problems have arisen from embalming and burying deceased
paupers because of the communicability of HIV and hepatitis infections
resulting from contact with body fluids.
      (4)   Based on the foregoing findings, County Council finds that
cremation, when approved by the York County Coroner, is the most suitable
disposition for the remains of deceased paupers who have no ascertainable
family or whose family does not wish to receive and assume responsibility for
burial.
   (B)   Procedure. The bodies of all deceased persons qualifying for pauper
burials eligible for funding by York County, as determined by the York County
Coroner, who have no ascertainable family or whose family does not wish to
receive the remains or assume the cost of burial shall be cremated. Such
cremations shall be conducted only with the approval of the York County Coroner
pursuant to state law. Cremation shall be conducted only when positive
identification of the deceased has been made, or when the York County Coroner
has made reasonable efforts to identify the deceased. The cremated remains of a
deceased pauper who has no ascertainable family, or whose family does not wish
to receive the remains, shall be humanely disposed of pursuant to the
provisions of state law.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 33.001 WORKERS’ COMPENSATION, EMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION, TORT AND OTHER
LIABILITY; LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
   (A)   The County Council finds that it is beneficial and advantageous, and
in the best interest of the county for the county to be a self-insurer with
respect to workers’ compensation claims, unemployment compensation claims, and
tort and general liability claims.
   (B)   The County Council further finds that, based on the loss experience of
the county, it is economically desirable for the county to operate as a self-
insurer under the terms and provisions of the State Workers’ Compensation Law,
the state unemployment compensation statutes, and the general statutes and laws
relating to tort and general liabilities of the county. The County Council
finds that it would be desirable to create three separate funds, as hereinafter
designated, in order to provide for the payment of contingent liabilities,
administrative expenses, cost of investigation, legal expenses and other costs
incurred in the administration of the State Workers’ Compensation Law,
unemployment compensation statutes, and the payment of tort and general
liability claims.

prescribed and delineated.
   (B)   The uniform policies and procedures by which all county personnel

of employment by the county shall be governed, established, prescribed and

including:
      (1)   Hiring and firing;
      (2)   Compensation, assignment, or classification of employees;

(‘77 Code, § 13-26) (Ord. 1584, passed 9-17-84; Am. Ord. 5288, passed 10-17-88;
Am. Ord. 2601, passed 7-16-01; Am. Ord. 2823, passed 5-1-23)
§ 33.016 RECRUITMENT.
   (A)   The county seeks to employ the best qualified and suitable persons
available. In this effort, the county conducts an active job information and
recruitment program. The county shall fill vacancies by promotion or transfer
within the organization as long as internal candidates meet minimum
qualifications. If the internal recruitment process does not yield a suitable
candidate, applications from other sources shall be considered.
   (B)   The administrative procedure shall be as follows:
      (1)   The County Manager or his/her designee and Human Resources shall
implement a hiring process used for all vacancies that shall include
preparation of a job announcement stating the position title, minimum training
and experience requirements, salary range, and application procedures. Job
opportunities shall be posted on the county website, county bulletin boards,
various job search engines, and at conspicuous locations within county
buildings.
      (2)   Applicants from the department where the vacancy occurs shall be
considered first. If this does not result in filling the position, all other
county employees seeking the position shall be considered. If internal
candidates do not meet the minimum qualifications for the position based on
requirements stated on the position job description, then applicants from other
sources shall be considered.
      (3)   The County Manager or his/her designee and Human Resources shall
select the recruitment sources to be utilized. Job announcements shall be
advertised through a variety of resources, including national job search
engines, educational institutions, employment agencies, professional
organizations, and any medium through which the county will recruit diverse and
qualified candidates.

§ 33.017 HIRING.
   (A)   (1)   In order to apply and be considered for employment with the
county, there must be an available and posted job vacancy. Jobs will be posted
externally and internally for an appropriate amount of time as determined by
the department director and Human Resources. All persons, internal or external
applicants, seeking employment with the county shall apply through the hiring
process implemented by the County Manager.
      (2)   It shall be the responsibility of the job applicant to specify
which available position or positions they wish to apply for and indicate their
preference on the application form.
         (a)   The Human Resources Director, or his/her designee shall
participate in the hiring process with the department directors to verify that
applicants meet minimum qualifications for the posted vacancies. However,
department directors or elected officials make final hiring decisions, subject
to approval of the County Manager. Applicants must meet minimum qualifications
of positions posted based on current job description requirements in order to
be considered for hire, but any combination of education and experience which
would provide the required knowledge, skills and abilities to perform job
requirements may qualify as meeting minimum requirements. (This combination of
education and experience option may not apply to positions which require
specific certifications or educational levels as listed on their existing job
descriptions in order to perform their job duties, i.e. engineers, attorneys,
doctors, veterinarians, County Manager, assistant county managers and
department directors).
         (b)   Interviews shall be scheduled between the hiring department and
the top candidate(s). Interviews should include two or more county employees.
         (c)   After the interviews, reference checks shall be conducted on the
top job candidate(s).
         (d)   Department directors and all regular county employees must
reside in locations to meet requirements of their assigned positions. These
requirements include response times or after hour callbacks if their position
includes these responsibilities.
   (B)   The hiring of personnel within departments under the direction of
elected or appointed officials shall ultimately be vested in the elected
officials. However, elected officials shall be requested to comply with the
selection process as prescribed by the county’s personnel policies and
procedures.

Ord. 3918, passed 8-20-18; Am. Ord. 2823, passed 5-1-23)
§ 33.018 PAY.
   (A)   An employee who receives an original appointment shall be paid at the
minimum rate for the job class covering the position unless:
      (1)   Employees may be employed on a training basis in which case he or
she shall be paid at a rate of 5% less than minimum for the grade. Training
status should remain in effect for any one employee for no more than six months
or until new-hire probationary period is completed and given regular status or
employee is terminated;
      (2)   The employee possesses education or experience above the minimum
required as currently specified in the position’s job description in which the
County Manager may approve employment at a salary above the specified minimum
according to the following schedule: If a newly hired employee, one-half of the
approved increase above minimum may be issued at the time of hire and the rest
may be issued at successful completion of the six-month probation period.
         (a)   If the employee’s documented education and/or experience exceeds
the minimums required as specified in the position’s job description by at
least three years of related work experience and/or at least documentation of
successful attainment of a more advanced academic degree in a field that
relates to the position at least one level above that required the employee may
be paid at a rate up to the maximum salary for the grade if approved by the
County Manager after consultation with the Human Resources Director.
   (B)   An employee who is reinstated within six months to a position
previously held must be paid at the same rate the employee received during the
previous employment or at least equal to the current minimum rate for the
position.
   (C)   Newly elected officials, appointed magistrates, probate judges and
masters-in-equity will be paid using the state mandated requirements for
minimum salaries. In the absence of a state mandated minimum salary, elected
officials will be paid within their position grade and their salary cannot be
reduced during their term of office. For the elected positions who have no
mandated minimum salary, such as sheriff, clerk of court and coroner, the
salary of the outgoing elected official will become the salary of the newly
elected official. Salary adjustments will be made to ensure that salaries do
not fall below the state mandated requirements for minimum salaries. Annual
increases will match the higher of the state or county cost of living
adjustment.
   (D)   Unique, hard to recruit positions pay increase. Elected officials may,
subject to approval by the County Council, petition the County Manager for an
increase in pay for those positions which have proven hard to fill or which, by
their unique nature, are hard to establish parity in pay on a local level. In
these instances, the affected elected official must demonstrate and document in
the records of Human Resources: the absence of qualified individuals meeting
the basic requirements for the position as advertised by Human Resources or
alternatively, the unique aspect of the position, its rarity, or why the
position is difficult to fill at the pay level established for the local level
and thereby qualify for an increase in pay no greater than 20% and in no event
exceeding the maximum salary of the designated pay grade. Upon meeting the
requirements, the request shall be placed on the next available County Council
Agenda, as a personnel matter for discussion in executive session.
   (E)   The County Manager may approve an increase to an employee’s base
salary of 10% if they are to perform as an interim Department Director or
Assistant County Manager for the duration of the temporary assignment. In order
for this to apply, the assignment must be expected to last at least 60 days.
Once the interim assignment ends, the employee’s salary returns to the original
pay plus any increases warranted during this time.
   (F)   Pay periods and tax status changes. County employees are paid biweekly
Friday via direct deposit. When a payday falls on a scheduled holiday, the
county endeavors to pay employees on the workday preceding. It is requested
that employees change tax status for payroll only at the first check of each
quarter or on their final payroll check due to retirement or termination of
employment.
   (G)   Verification of hours. Employees should examine their paycheck
information immediately to ensure that they have been properly paid for all
hours worked and that no improper deductions have been made. Any payment errors
must be reported to Human Resources/Payroll within 14 days. Necessary
corrections will be made on the following payroll.
      (1)   Supervisors must verify that employees accurately reported hours
worked. A supervisor who fails to verify employee hours may be subject to
discipline.
      (2)   A supervisor who intentionally misrepresents or allows an employee
to record an incorrect number of hours worked may be disciplined up to and
including termination.
   (H)   Deductions. The county deducts from employees’ gross pay taxes and
withholding required by taxing authorities. The county may also deduct from
employees’ pay the employees’ share of any premiums or plan contributions for
insurance, retirement and similar plans that are elected by the employee. The
county may make other deductions as required by law or court order. The county
does not make unauthorized deductions and will reimburse employees if such
deductions are made inadvertently and reported to payroll.
   (I)   Advance wages. Cash, debts owed the county, fringe benefits, uniforms,
tools, equipment, vehicles, instruction manuals, keys, county identification
cards and other items belonging to the county that are advanced or issued to an
employee but not repaid or returned by him or her at the time he/she leaves
employment are considered advance of wages, the value of which may be deducted
or withheld from an employee’s pay.
   (J)   The County Manager may approve an increase to an employee’s base
salary up to 10%, not to exceed grade level maximums, to any employee that,
based upon the department director’s statement, has assumed additional
responsibilities that are beneficial to the department but do not warrant a
change in job description and/or grade level.

shall first seek to fill the position by promotion of existing personnel.
      (2)   Decisions shall be made on the basis of an employee’s potential,
merit and qualifications as determined and recommended by the respective
department director, subject to the review of the County Manager or his/her
designee.

adjusted by 5% for one grade advancement; 10% for two-three grade advancements;
and 15% for four or more grade advancements; or to the minimum of the new
grade, whichever is greater, for any increase in grade level due to promotion.
Exceptions to this limitation may be approved by the County Manager or his/her
designee up to 25% above the minimum salary of the new grade level if the
employee meets the qualifications in §
33.018.
      (2)   However, the salary of an employee who is promoted shall not be
increased to above the maximum for the new grade to which the employee is
promoted. The salary change shall become effective at the beginning of the pay
period following the promotion.
      (3)   Policies of the Sheriff’s Office control deputy and detention
center promotions and incentives.
   (C)   Promoted employees shall be required to serve a six-month probationary
period in the new position.

§ 33.020 RECLASSIFICATION.
   (A)   (1)   When department directors identify the need to substantially
change or alter the duties of a position, then the county may conduct a job
analysis, prepare a new job description and may re-evaluate the position to
determine its appropriate classification and salary range. If the newly
evaluated position shows that the position should be reclassified upward then
the reclassification may be treated as a promotion and may be subject to the
provisions defined under §
33.019.
      (2)   All consultant recommendations will be reviewed by the Human
Resources Director and the County Manager prior to approval and implementation
as per determination of the County Manager.
      (3)   Reclassifications requested at any time must be approved by the
County Manager.
      (4)   Department directors should avoid adding new duties to a position
until the County Manager or County Council approves the position for
reclassification.
   (B)   If the newly evaluated position shows that the position should be
classified downward, then the employee currently holding the position may have
the option of:
      (1)   Applying for a transfer to a position classified at a level equal
to the classification previously held; or
      (2)   Choosing to stay in the current position.
   (C)   If the employee chooses to apply for a transfer, then the county shall
give the employee the first available opportunity to transfer to a position for
which the employee is qualified. Until the opportunity for a transfer is made
available to the employee by the county, the employee shall continue to occupy
the current position at no loss in pay and shall continue to be a candidate for
merit increases and benefits as if no reclassification has occurred.
   (D)   If the employee accepts the transfer opportunity offered by the
county, then the acceptance shall be treated as a transfer and shall be subject
to the provisions of §
33.022.
   (E)   If the employee chooses to remain in a position that has been
reclassified downward, or refuses to accept a transfer opportunity when it is
offered by the county, then the continuance of the employee in the reclassified
position shall be treated as a voluntary demotion and shall be subject to the
provisions defined in §
33.021.
   (F)   The reclassification of a position shall become effective after the
approval of the County Council.
   (G)   When an employee is demoted because the position the employee occupies
has been reclassified downward and the employee requests and is willing to
accept a transfer, the employee’s salary shall remain at the same rate for a
period of two years following reclassification if the employee’s salary is
above the maximum for the new grade. If the employee’s salary at the time of
reclassification is below the maximum of the new grade, it shall remain
unaffected by the reclassification, and the employee shall be eligible for
consideration for merit salary adjustments not to exceed the maximum of the new
grade. Salary changes will become effective at the beginning of the pay period
following the date of the change.

be adjusted by 5% decrease in salary for one grade decrease; 10% for a two-
three grade decrease; and 15% for four or more grade decreases, or to minimum
of the new grade, whichever is greater; provided that the employee who is
demoted shall not be decreased to below the minimum for the new grade to which
the employee is demoted or below the employee’s previous salary if returning to
a position previously held within the past six months. The salary change shall
become effective at the beginning of the pay period following the demotion.

the employee is demoted or below the employee’s previous salary if returning to
a position previously held within the previous six-month time period. The
salary change shall become effective at the beginning of the pay period
following the voluntary demotion. Exceptions to this may occur if approved by
the Human Resources Director and County Manager on the following occurrences:
      (1)   Relocation for the good of York County Government.
      (2)   Position has been vacant because of extensive recruitment/retention
difficulties.

§ 33.023 PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL.
   (A)   (1)   Formal employee performance appraisals shall be conducted at
established intervals of an individual’s employment.
      (2)   The purpose of the appraisal shall be to formally assess and
appraise the employee’s performance over a designated period and to provide an
opportunity for the supervisor and the employee to discuss all aspects of the
individual’s performance with respect to fulfilling the requirements, duties
and responsibilities of the position held by the employee.
   (B)   Formal performance appraisals shall be conducted for new employees at
the end of six months and for promoted, transferred and demoted employees at
the end of six months and if necessary following periods of probationary
extensions. After an employee has earned regular status, the employee’s job
performance shall be appraised at least once a year. Special appraisals shall
be conducted periodically, as each supervisor considers necessary.
   (C)   All performance appraisals shall be conducted by the appropriate
supervisor, reviewed by the appropriate department head, discussed with the
employee, and reviewed by the Human Resources.
      (1)   New employees.
         (a)   If the probationary employee receives a satisfactory rating and
is recommended for regular status by the employee supervisor or appropriate
elected official and approved by department director, then the employee shall
be granted regular status.
         (b)   If the probationary evaluation is marginal or unsatisfactory, a
three-month extension of the probationary status may be granted. The extension
shall be based on the supervisor’s and the department head’s judgements that
the employee can improve in deficient areas or may be able to gain required
trainings or certifications. If an extension is granted, a subsequent marginal
rating at the completion of the extended time shall result in termination of
the employee unless an additional extension is requested and approved by the
County Manager. If an employee is not granted an extension, the employee shall
be terminated.
         (c)   If the probationary employee receives an unsatisfactory
performance rating, the employee may be terminated.
         (d)   During the new-hire probationary period a new employee may be
terminated at any time without cause or without notice if his/her work
performance is considered to be below expected levels.
      (2)   Promoted employees.
         (a)   If the promoted employee receives a satisfactory rating and is
recommended for regular status by the department director, or appropriate
elected official, and approved by the department director then the employee
shall be granted regular status.
         (b)   If the promoted employee receives a marginal performance
appraisal, the employee may be granted an extension of three months in the
position. If an extension is granted, a subsequent marginal rating at the
completion of the extended time shall result in either transfer or demotion of
the employee to an existing vacancy of a lower classification, or the employee
may be terminated unless an additional extension is requested and approved by
the County Manager.
         (c)   If the promoted employee receives an unsatisfactory performance
rating, the employee shall be either transferred or demoted to an existing
vacancy of a lower classification or terminated. If transferred or demoted, the
employee shall be required to serve a three-month probationary period in the
new position.
      (3)   Transferred employees. The preceding performance appraisal
procedures for promoted employees shall also be applied to transferred
employees.
      (4)   Regular employees.
         (a)   When a regular employee receives a marginal appraisal, for non-
disciplinary reasons, a special appraisal may be conducted after a period of
three months. If the employee is still marginal, another special appraisal may
be conducted again in three months, or the employee may be transferred, demoted
to an existing vacancy of a lower classification if they meet minimum
qualifications of the position, or terminated. After the second successive
special appraisal of marginal, the employee shall be either reassigned or
demoted to an existing vacancy of a lower classification or terminated.
         (b)   When a regular employee receives an unsatisfactory performance
appraisal, the employee may be terminated. However, if the supervisor, the
department director, and the County Manager concur that the employee may
perform more proficiently in another position, the employee may be transferred
or demoted to an existing vacancy of a lower classification, at which time he
or she shall complete a satisfactory probationary period of three months.
         (c)   Pay for performance salary adjustments may be awarded if funded
by County Council on the basis of performance appraisals accomplished on a
schedule prescribed by County Council. It is expected that employees will
perform at an adequate level to successfully perform all the duties and
responsibilities to which they are assigned. Pay for performance adjustments
are given to employees who meet or exceed an adequate level of performance.
When pay for performance raises are issued, the employees impacted by maximum
salary limits will still receive a “one-time” incentive payment for any portion
of the raise amount that is over their maximum salary and which would have been
issued had the range maximum not been reached.
         (d)   Pay for performance adjustments shall be awarded as follows:
            1.   Employees who receive performance appraisals which indicate
that their performance is substantially below expectations, or below
expectations, shall not receive a pay for performance salary adjustment;
            2.   Employees who receive performance appraisals which indicate
that their performance meets expectations, exceeds expectations, or
substantially exceeds expectations, shall receive their pay for performance
salary increases in accordance with the amount annually appropriated by the
Council.

§ 33.024 GUIDELINES FOR DISCIPLINARY ACTION.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of disciplinary action is to cause the employee
to understand that his or her performance or conduct does not meet the county’s
standards and, if possible, to give the employee a chance to make the changes
necessary to avoid the termination of his or her employment. Disciplinary
meetings will be limited to attendance by the employee and the applicable
supervisors unless attendance by other parties is requested by the employee or
supervisor and approved by the applicable department director or the County
Manager.
   (B)   Types of disciplinary action.
      (1)   In many situations, problems can be corrected by casual, informal
discussions between the employee and his or her immediate supervisor. These
discussions will be documented in the employee’s personnel file for future
reference.
      (2)   If oral discussions have not been effective or if the employee’s
problems of performance or conduct are too serious for unwritten action, a
written warning may be given. The warning should outline the facts briefly and
inform the employee that further problems of the same or a different nature
will result in more severe disciplinary up to and including termination.
      (3)   If other forms of disciplinary action have not been effective, or
if the employee’s problems of performance or conduct have been particularly
serious, the written warning may be accompanied by a suspension without pay for
up to five work days.
      (4)   If a department director feels that other forms of disciplinary
action have been ineffective or that the employee’s performance or conduct
warrants discharge, the department director may recommend that the County
Manager or elected official discharge the employee and the department director
may suspend the employee without pay, or with pay upon receiving approval from
the County Manager or elected official/appointed official, for as long as it
takes for the Manager or elected official to make a decision.
   (C)   Employee signature on warnings. In order to avoid any dispute over
whether an employee has been warned previously, employees are required to sign
copies of all written warnings, suspensions, and similar documents. This
signature does not constitute agreement or an admission. It is merely a
receipt. If an employee refuses to sign a warning or suspension or similar
document, he or she must be suspended immediately and given until 4:00 p.m. on
the next regular workday to sign the document. If he or she does not sign the
document by that time, he or she should be suspended indefinitely and his or
her discharge be recommended to the manager or elected official.
   (D)   Rules of conduct.
      (1)   It is not possible to list all conduct which may result in
disciplinary action, nor is it possible to state what disciplinary action will
be taken with regard to particular problems of conduct or performance. In each
instance an employee’s overall work record and record of prior discipline will
be considered.
      (2)   The list which follows contains common misconduct which results in
disciplinary action up to and including termination.
         (a)   Failure to follow oral or written instructions;
         (b)   Inefficiency in the use of time and the performance of duties;
         (c)   Careless, negligent or improper use of property, equipment, or
technology;
         (d)   Reckless conduct which endangers others or results in minor
property damage;
         (e)   Failure to maintain satisfactory working relationships with the
public or fellow employees;
         (f)   Habitual tardiness or absenteeism;
         (g)   Any action or practice which unfavorably reflects or causes
embarrassment for the county or county officials;
         (h)   Insubordination;
         (i)   Working while under the influence of alcohol, illegal drugs, or
intoxicants;
         (j)   Willful failure to use safety equipment or observe safety rules;
         (k)   Sleeping while on duty;
         (l)   Gambling on county property;
         (m)   Engaging in political activity or displaying campaign materials
while on county work time, in county work places, or on county-issued uniforms
or vehicles;
         (n)   Unprovoked abusive language and unbecoming conduct when dealing
with the public;
         (o)   Falsification of records or misrepresentation of facts;
         (p)   Misuse of county funds;
         (q)   Unauthorized or improper use or disclosure of county records;
         (r)   Unauthorized absences;
         (s)   Willfully damaging or destroying equipment or property belonging
to the county or fellow employees;
         (t)   Theft or inappropriate removal or possession of property
belonging to the county or another employee;
         (u)   Unauthorized possession of firearms on county property;
         (v)   Fighting while on county property; and/or
         (w)   Conviction of a felony.
   (E)   Status of employee. Any employee who has been recommended for
discharge by his or her supervisor, department director or the elected official
by whom he or she is employed, shall be deemed to be an employee without pay
and without benefit under §
33.079 until a final decision has been made by the individual with employment
and discharge authority.
   (F)   Status during investigation. During an investigation, hearing or trial
of any county employee on any criminal charge, or during the course of any
civil action involving an employee or the employee’s status with the county,
when suspension would be in the best interest of the county, the County Manager
may suspend the employee with or without pay for the duration of the
proceedings as a non-disciplinary measure. The maximum amount of time for such
type of suspension shall be one year. If charges have not been resolved within
one year, the employee shall be removed from the payroll, but may be eligible
for rehire.

§ 33.025 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.
   (A)   Ordinarily, termination of employment with the county may occur under
five general conditions. They are:
      (1)   Voluntary termination. The county recognizes the right of any
individual to terminate his or her employment with the county, at will, for any
reasons with or without explanation. A minimum of a two-week (14 calendar days)
notice is required by the county in the case of voluntary termination. If the
employee is in new-hire probationary status and has not gained regular status
or fails to provide and work (or utilize approved leave) the two-week notice to
the county then he or she will not receive payment for accumulated annual
leave.
      (2)   Disciplinary termination. The county may terminate the employment
of any individual in accordance with the policy defined under §
33.024.
      (3)   “For cause” termination.
         (a)   The county may terminate the employment of any individual who,
by his or her conduct:
            1.   Demonstrates a flagrant disregard for the policies established
in this chapter;
            2.   Engages in acts of violence, dishonesty, breach of trust,
moral turpitude or other acts which demonstrate a flagrant disregard for the
duly established laws of the county, state and other duly recognized legal
entities; or
            3.   Demonstrates gross incompetence or gross negligence in
performing the duties and responsibilities required by the position held by the
individual.
         (b)   In general, “for cause” termination applies to conditions or
situations of such import that reason would clearly indicate that the retention
of the individual would be a continuing detriment to the reputation, efficacy
and/or operating capability of the county.
      (4)   Financial exigency termination. The county may terminate the
employment of any individual whose position is dependent upon funding by an
agency other than the county wherein funding is declined, withheld or withdrawn
either by the action of the Council or by the action of the agency who has the
legal authority to withhold or withdraw the funding. This provision applies to
departments, divisions, programs or any other entity affected by the exigency.
The county may also terminate the employment of any individual whose position
is funded by the county’s general revenue funds, but where funding for the
position is eliminated, redesignated, withheld or withdrawn by action of the
County Council because of financial exigency.
      (5)   Layoff or reduction in work force termination. The county may
terminate the employment of an individual when financial exigency, reallocation
of resources, job obsolescence or other conditions necessitates or warrants a
layoff or reduction in the county work force, in an event the layoff or
reduction shall take place in accordance with the policy defined under §
33.027.
      (6)   Job Abandonment. Unexcused absence of three or more days will be
considered job abandonment which may result in termination. The only exception
to this will be with the approval of the County Manager based upon a
recommendation from the department director.
   (B)   Although an employee may be placed in a nonpay status by any of his or
her superiors, the termination of an employee shall be effective only after
approval by the employee’s department director and subject to the review of the
County Manager, as outlined in §
33.024(B)(4).

passed 8-20-18; Am. Ord. 2823, passed 5-1-23)
§ 33.026 GRIEVANCE.
   (A)   This procedure is adopted in accordance with the County and Municipal
Employees Grievance Procedure Act, S.C. Code §§ 8-17-110 et seq.
      (1)   A “grievance” is any complaint by an employee that he or she has
been treated unfairly, unlawfully or in violation of his or her rights under
county policies, with regard to any matter pertaining to his or her employment
by the county. This includes, but is not limited to discharge, suspension,
involuntary transfer, promotion and demotion. If an employee believes that he
or she has not received or been credited with or has otherwise lost wages or
benefits to which he or she is entitled, he or she must present his or her
grievance in accordance with procedure or wages or benefits may be forfeited.
      (2)   An employee who feels that he or she has a grievance must follow
the following procedure:
         (a)   Step 1. He or she must discuss the grievance with his or her
immediate supervisor. If his or her supervisor is unable or unwilling to adjust
the grievance to the satisfaction of the employee, the employee must take Step
2.
         (b)   Step 2. The employee must follow the chain of command in his or
her department, appealing to each successive level of supervision in writing.
At each level each supervisor shall have two work days (Saturdays and Sundays
excluded) to render a decision. If no decision is made within this time, the
grievance shall be considered denied. If a supervisor at a particular level is
unavailable to consider the grievance, it shall be considered denied and the
employee shall appeal to the next level of supervision.
         (c)   Step 3. If the head of the department in which the employee is
employed denies the grievance, this decision shall be final as to any grievance
brought by a probationary employee. A new employee shall be considered
probationary until his or her probationary evaluation is completed and approved
by his/her department director.
      (3)   (a)   Other employees may appeal to the employee grievance
committee the denial of their grievances by department directors by filing a
written request for appeal at the county personnel department. This must be
done within 14 calendar days of the time at which the facts on which the
grievance is based become available to the employee.
         (b)   The written request for appeal must include the following
information:
            1.   The purpose of the appeal and what recommendation is requested
of the Grievance Committee; and
            2.   A statement that the chain-of-command has been followed in the
appeal as is required by the grievance procedure.
         (c)   The Human Resources Department will assist in preparing the
appeal, if requested.
      (4)   Within ten days of receipt of the employee’s request, the
chairperson of the Grievance Committee shall schedule the requested hearing and
notify the Grievance Committee, the employee requesting the hearing, the
affected department and the Human Resources Department. The Human Resources
Director shall assist the chairperson with scheduling the hearing.
   (B)   The County Council shall appoint a committee composed of six employees
to serve for terms of three years, except that the members appointed initially
shall be appointed so that their terms will be staggered, and approximately
one-third of the terms shall expire each year. A member shall continue to serve
after the expiration of his or her term until a successor is appointed. Any
interim appointment to fill a vacancy for any cause prior to the completion of
a member’s term shall be for the unexpired term. Any member may be reappointed
for succeeding terms at the discretion of County Council. All members shall be
selected on a broadly representative basis from among county employees. Members
employed in the same department as the grieving employee and members having
formed an opinion on the issues prior to the hearing, shall not participate in
that employee’s hearing.
      (1)   The committee annually shall select its own chairperson from among
its members. The chairperson shall serve as the presiding officer at all
hearings which he or she attends but may designate some other member to serve
as presiding officer in his or her absence. The chairperson shall have
authority to schedule and to reschedule all hearings.
      (2)   A quorum shall consist of at least four members and no hearings may
be held without a quorum.
      (3)   The presiding officer will have control of the proceedings. He or
she shall take whatever action is necessary to ensure an equitable, orderly and
expeditious hearing. Parties shall abide by his or her decisions, except when a
committee member objects to a decision to accept or reject evidence, in which
case the majority vote of the committee present will govern.
      (4)   The committee shall have the authority to call for files, records
and papers which are pertinent to any investigation and which are subject to
the control of the County Council; to call for or consider affidavits of
witnesses; to request and hear the testimony of witnesses; to consider the
results of polygraph examinations; and to secure the services of a recording
secretary in its discretion. The committee shall have no authority to subpoena
witnesses, documents or other evidence, nor shall any county employee be
compelled to attend any hearing. All proceedings shall be tape-recorded.
Witnesses, other than the grieving employee and the department representative,
shall be sequestered when not testifying. All witnesses shall testify under
oath.
      (5)   All hearings shall be held in executive session unless the grieving
employee requests at the beginning of the hearing that it be held in open
session. The official tape recording and the official minutes of all hearings
shall be subject to the control and disposition of the County Manager or his/
her designee.
      (6)   Neither the grieving employee nor the department may be assisted by
advisors or by attorneys during the hearing itself. However, the committee
shall have an attorney available to it at any and all times it considers
necessary, and the Human Resources Department shall provide assistance in
reading written materials to the committee at the request of the grieving
employee.
      (7)   In disciplinary actions by department directors and their
subordinate supervisors, the employee must receive in reasonable detail written
notice of the nature of the acts or omissions which are the basis for the
disciplinary action. This notice may be amended at any time 24 hours or more
before the commencement of the hearing. The department must demonstrate that
the disciplinary action is for the good of the county. The department shall
make the first presentation. The committee may base its findings and
recommendations on any additional or different grounds developed from the
employee’s presentation.
      (8)   In nondisciplinary grievances the employee must establish that a
right existed and that it was denied him or her unfairly, illegally or in
violation of a county policy. The employee shall make the first presentation.
      (9)   In all grievances, the grieving employee and the department shall
each be limited to one hour of initial presentation. The party required to make
the first presentation shall be entitled to a ten-minute rebuttal of the other
party’s presentation. The chairperson shall appoint himself, herself or another
member of the committee as timekeeper.
      (10)   In all grievances, presentations may be oral or in writing or
both, and may be supported by affidavits or unsworn, signed statements from
witnesses, by records, other documentary evidence, photographs and other
physical evidence. Presentations shall be made by the grieving employee (with
reading assistance from a member of the personnel department if the employee
desires) and by a managerial employee of the affected department. Neither party
may call witnesses or question the other party or question any witness called
by the committee.
      (11)   Except as provided in division (B)(12) below, the committee shall,
within 20 days after hearing an appeal, make its findings and recommendation,
and report the findings and recommendation to the county manager. If the County
Manager approves, the recommendation of the committee shall be his or her
decision and copies of the decision shall be transmitted by the committee to
the employee and to the head of the particular department involved. If,
however, he or she rejects the decision of the committee, the County Manager
shall make his or her own decision without further hearing and that decision
shall be final. Copies of the decision shall be transmitted to the employee and
the head of the particular department involved.
      (12)   In grievances involving the failure to promote or transfer, or the
discipline or discharge of personnel employed in or seeking assignment to
departments under the direction of an elected official or an official appointed
by an authority outside county government, the committee shall, within 20 days
after hearing an appeal, make its findings and recommendation and report the
findings and recommendation to the official. If the official approves, the
recommendation of the committee shall be his or her decision and a copy of the
decision shall be transmitted by the committee to the employee. If, however,
the official rejects the decision of the committee, the official shall make his
or her own decision without further hearing, and that decision shall be final.
A copy of the decision shall be transmitted to the employee.
      (13)   Nothing in these grievance procedures creates a property interest
in employment or a contract of employment, nor does this procedure limit the
authority of the county or an elected or appointed official to terminate any
employee when the county or respective elected or appointed official considers
such action to be necessary for the good of the county.
      (14)   An elected or appointed official may elect not to participate in
this grievance procedure, and in such case, an employee may not appeal the
decision of the elected or appointed official to the grievance committee.

§ 33.027 REDUCTION IN WORK FORCE.
   Should it be necessary at any time to reduce the staff size of a given
department, regular employees shall be notified by the department director at
least two weeks prior to the effective date of the layoff or reduction in work
force, or shall be given pay in lieu of notice or shall be given a combination
of pay and notice totaling two weeks. Within a particular department, those
employees holding a specific position shall be laid off first who have received
a disciplinary action or substandard evaluation within the last six months,
followed by those who have the shortest length of service with the county,
followed by those who have the lowest seniority in the specific position,
followed by those who have the lowest average performance rating over the past
two years or for the entire period of employment if less than two years.
Layoffs or reductions in work force shall be effective only after review by the
department director and approval by the County Manager.

CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT
§ 33.045 NEPOTISM.
   (A)   People in the same immediate family may not be employed or continue to

over another family member’s employment, promotion, salary adjustments or other
related personnel considerations.
   (B)   Employment of close relatives may be permitted in strictly emergency
situations for temporary periods of time not to exceed 30 days. The temporary

      (4)   In circumstances involving real or potential conflicts, employees
who run for public office may be placed on an unpaid leave of absence until
after the election. An employee elected to public office may be terminated,
depending upon his or her position with the county and the position to which he
or she is elected. For purposes of this policy, an employee is considered a
“candidate for public office” as soon as he/she begins actively campaigning for
nomination or election, or when he/she files for candidacy, whichever comes
sooner.
   (B)   Accepting gifts and gratuities. County employees must comply with the
State Ethics Act. County employees or departments may accept gifts not

      (4)   Chief purchasing official; and
      (5)   All members of the judiciary.
   (D)   Conflict of interest. The South Carolina Ethics Act requires a public
official or employee to remove himself or herself from possible conflict of
interest, actions or decisions. Business dealings with a governmental agency
can take place only after:
      (1)   Public disclosure of the possible conflict of interest;
      (2)   Public notice and competitive bidding when that is the normal
contract award process; and
      (3)   Complete removal of the interested official or employee from the
agency’s decision making process.
   (E)   Whistleblower policy. The county is committed to maintaining a
workplace where employees are free to raise good faith concerns regarding the
county’s business practices. Employees are encouraged to report suspected
violations of the law; to identify potential violations of policy; and to
provide truthful information in connection with official inquires and
investigations.
      (1)   The county prohibits retaliation, including harassment,
intimidation, adverse employment actions, or other form of retaliation against
employees who in good faith raise suspected violations of law, cooperate in
inquires or investigations, or identify potential violations of county policy.
      (2)   Reports of suspected violations should be reported to your
supervisor or to a higher level in your chain of command. Complaints against
the County Manager should be made to the chairperson of Council. Complaints
against the Council chairperson should be made to the vice-chairperson.

      (3)   Reports of suspected violations of law or policy and reports of
retaliation will be investigated promptly and in a manner intended to protect
confidentiality. The County Manager or his/her designee will manage such
investigation, and may request the assistance of others within the
organization, counsel, or outside parties as deemed necessary. Investigatory
procedures may vary from case to case depending upon the circumstances.
Employees that intentionally file false reports of wrongdoing may be subject to
disciplinary action up to and including termination.
      (4)   In order to avoid misunderstandings, complaints made to members of
management or to human resources must involve completion of a complaint report,
summarizing the allegations and listing any witnesses. Human resources will
provide a copy of this initial complaint report to the employee. These
reporting procedures are intended to establish a clear record of what has been
reported.
   (F)   Employees service on county boards or commissions. Employees and/or
volunteers may not serve on any board or commission that receive funding from
York County government and is related in any way to the position or department

morning and afternoon breaks. Breaks shall be scheduled so that at least one

§ 33.053 OVERTIME AND COMPENSATORY TIME.
   (A)   No hourly employee shall work past his or her normal schedule without
supervisor’s approval. It is the policy of the county to grant compensatory
time off based on FLSA standards at the rate of one and one-half hours for each
hour actually worked beyond the 40 hours in one work week. At the county’s
option, the employee may be paid at one and one-half times his or her regular
rate for the hours worked in excess of 40 hours if it is considered by the
county to be in its best interest to do so rather than grant compensatory
leave. This action will be approved by the County Manager or his/her designee.
Supervisors have the authority to adjust weekly schedules to reduce overtime
payments or compensation time liabilities. It is the supervisor’s
responsibility to ensure that employees have the opportunity to use earned
compensatory time. If employees are assigned schedules based on the law
enforcement/Fire Protection exemption allowed by the Fair Labor Standards Act,
overtime payments would be calculated based on that schedule according to the
FLSA.
   (B)   All compensatory time requests for leave will be allowed within a
reasonable time as long as the request does not unduly disrupt the operations
of the department. It is the supervisor’s responsibility to manage the use of
compensatory time. Employees will be paid for unused FLSA required banked
compensatory time either at the time of a change in position to exempt status
or termination of employment.
   (C)   Exempt (salaried) employees have no right to compensatory leave, but
weekly work schedules may be adjusted if agreeable to the employee and
department directors and/or supervisor.

§ 33.054 ON-CALL STATUS AND COMPENSATION.

required to be available when needed to handle emergency situations occurring
outside of standard working hours. It is available only to full-time nonexempt
(hourly) employees.
   (B)   When conditions warrant, county departments may schedule sufficient
personnel to work outside of standard working hours. Specific individuals who
are scheduled to be on-call shall be scheduled on a rotation basis consisting
of seven consecutive days per assignment.
   (C)   “On-call” will be considered to be a period of time when an employee
is not required to remain at his/her usual work station and is free to engage
in his/her own pursuits as long as the activity does not limit his/her ability
to report for duty (i.e., use of alcohol or prescription medications), subject
only to the understanding that the employee may leave word at his/her home and
with a department dispatcher where he/she may be reached and report promptly as
outlined by his/her supervisor.
   (D)   An on-call employee shall be paid compensation or receive equivalent
compensatory time based upon County Manager approval for either a minimum of
four hours at straight time, or overtime (if appropriate) for the time actually
called out, whichever is larger, for each seven-day on-call assignment.
Compensatory time earned for being on-call shall be accrued based on FLSA
regulations.
   (E)   Employees shall be considered to be on-call only when so designated in
writing by the appropriate department director and approved by the County
Manager. A copy of this designation shall be forwarded to the official employee
file located in the Human Resources office.

the department director to determine the positions in their respective
departments that would be eligible for Alternative Work Arrangements (AWA).
   (C)   Employees interested in being considered for Alternative Work
Arrangements should discuss with their supervisor and complete the Alternative
Work Arrangement (AWA) Request Form. Alternative Work Arrangements (AWA)
requests are reviewed on a case-by-case basis and are individually evaluated
depending on job-related factors, including but not limited to, customer
service needs, legal requirements, and the employees’ work performance.
Alternative Work Arrangements (AWA) may not be suitable for all positions or
employees. It is the County Manager’s sole discretion to grant Alternative Work
Arrangements (AWA) requests.
   (D)   All AWA request approvals are conditional upon appropriate access to
technology, conference calls, web access and submission of daily logs submitted
of work accomplished. The Alternative Work Arrangement policy can be
discontinued at any time at the county’s sole discretion.

   (C)   Return to Work/Temporary Light Duty Program.
      (1)   Purpose.
         (a)   York County’s policy is to keep its employees healthy and on the
job, therefore a return to work program is important to the employee and to the
county. In a return to work program, injured employees, while recovering, are
kept in a productive capacity while being protected from re-injury. Temporary
light duty in a return to work program gives the employee the opportunity to
earn regular wages and to maintain payroll benefits. This program is also
designed to enhance self- esteem, reduce stress and speed recovery. When
appropriate, light duty also preserves a skilled and stable workforce for York
County.
         (b)   The purpose of the Return to Work/Temporary Light Duty Program
is to temporarily place employees who have sustained work-related injuries, in
positions consistent with the medical restrictions prescribed by an authorized
treating physician. Ideally, the employee will work within his or her own
department. However, it may become necessary to place the employee in another
department and/or adjust work hours to accommodate their medical restrictions.
Employee training may also qualify as a temporary light duty assignment.
         (c)   The goal of the program is to promote psychological recovery and
to minimize lost time by encouraging appropriate levels of activity for injured
employees.
         (d)   York County Risk Management staff will be responsible for
managing the Return to Work/Temporary Light Duty Program. Decisions concerning
the placement of injured and recovering employees will be made jointly by the
employee’s department director supervisor and Risk Management staff.
      (2)   Scope. The Return to Work/Temporary Light Duty Program is designed
to help regular (full or part-time) employees of York County who have received
on-the-job injuries.
      (3)   General guidelines.
         (a)   Temporary light duty is an alternate assignment for an employee
recovering from an on-the-job injury. Work assignments are subject to work
restrictions as determined by the authorized treating physician. The duration
of a temporary light duty assignment may range from one day to a maximum of 12
weeks. If necessary for the employee to remain in the temporary assignment for
12 weeks, Risk Management will consult with the authorized treating physician
as to the necessity for continuing the light duty assignment beyond 12 weeks.
However, a temporary light duty assignment cannot be extended beyond six
months.
         (b)   A return to work authorization stating any physical activity/
limitations, signed by a treating physician, must be submitted to human
resources before an employee may return to work after an illness or injury
(work related or otherwise).
         (c)   Departments may request temporary duty assistance by submitting
the Request for Temporary Light Duty Assistance Form to Risk Management.
Department should be innovative in developing and assigning meaningful tasks
which will allow the employee to utilize their experience, education and
physical capability.
         (d)   Work schedules will be arranged to permit injured employees to
keep physician appointments and any prescribed physical therapy sessions.
         (e)   The temporary light duty employee’s home department (the
department in which the employee worked at time of injury) is responsible for
all salary expenses associated with the employee for the duration of their
temporary duty status.
         (f)   If an employee chooses not to work in an assigned temporary duty
position within the medical restrictions prescribed, then workers’ compensation
indemnity benefits will not be paid.
      (4)   Responsibilities.
         (a)   Risk Management.
            1.   Maintain a list of available temporary duty positions
requested by departments and communicates injury information to department
directors regarding job restrictions to determine availability.
            2.   Assign the employee, under the advisement of the health care
provider, to a temporary position which meets the employee’s medical
restrictions. Consideration will be given to the employee’s home department,
assignment, shift, and the like. However, if temporary duty cannot be arranged
within the employee’s home department, the employee will be assigned to a
different department, if available. Placement decisions will be made jointly by
the employee’s department director/supervisor and Risk Management staff.
            3.   Obtain status reports from the authorized treating physician
concerning employee’s health status/restrictions.
            4.   Notify employee’s home department of the employee’s temporary
placement and provide updates regarding changes in the employee’s medical
restrictions.
            5.   Maintain contact with supervisor of assigned departments
regarding employee’s performance.
            6.   Maintain contact with employee regarding temporary assignment
and overall health condition.
         (b)   Employee.
            1.   Adhere to the temporary limitations identified by his or her
authorized treating physician.

assigned department, the assigned supervisor may request that the temporary
employee be placed elsewhere. This request must be submitted in writing to Risk
Management.
            3.   Advise assigned supervisor and Risk Management if assigned
responsibilities fall outside of medical restrictions.
            4.   Return to full duty in home department upon receipt of return
to work authorizing full duty from authorized treating physician.

      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of the sick leave bank is to protect eligible
employees from undue financial burdens which may result when extended absence
from work is necessary due to a prolonged or catastrophic personal illness or
accident. The sick leave bank will be established by the voluntary donation of
current leave to the bank by county employees, thereby establishing their
eligibility to participate in the bank. Leave hours contributed to the sick
leave bank may not be reclaimed by the donor. Designated donations will not be
allowed.
      (2)   Eligibility for membership.
         (a)   All employees who are on full-time regular status with York
County and who earn sick leave are eligible to participate, as long as they
have at least 96 hours of accrued sick leave available. Participation is
voluntary.
         (b)   To become a member, an employee must complete a membership
application and contribute 16 hours of sick leave during the open enrollment
period.
      (3)   Procedures and regulations for membership.
         (a)   An open enrollment period shall occur between December 1 and
January 1 of each year. January 1 begins each sick bank year. A special open
enrollment may be declared should the bank become depleted.
         (b)   Sick leave bank members must contribute 16 hours of sick leave
at the initial enrollment period and eight additional hours each year at the
open enrollment period except as noted below:
            1.   Any time the total number of hours in the bank reaches a level
equal to or less than 480 hours, an additional assessment of eight hours will
be requested and an open enrollment period declared. If a member does not have
accrued sick time at time of assessment, then time will be assessed when
earned;
            2.   If membership falls below 40 members and the sick leave
balance is less than 240 hours, the Sick Leave Bank Committee may decide to
dissolve the bank rather than making an assessment. If the bank is dissolved,
any days on deposit shall be returned to the current members at the time of
dissolution and credited to their personal sick leave accumulation in
proportion to the days each has contributed.
         (c)   All contributions to the bank remain the property of the bank,
and under no circumstances can a member withdraw his or her accumulated days
from the bank.
         (d)   Any employee may cancel membership from the bank by written
request during the open enrollment period, which runs from December 1 through
January 1.
         (e)   The right to membership or to apply for membership ceases with
cancellation of membership, refusal to comply with assessments, or inactive
status as a county employee.
         (f)   Membership in the bank shall remain confidential and be divulged
only as necessary to maintain and administer the bank.
      (4)   Regulations for use of the bank.
         (a)   In order to make application to receive days from the sick leave
bank, an employee must meet the following criteria:
            1.   The employee must be a current member of the bank for at least
30 calendar days. However, for employees with conditions determined to be pre-
existing to the date of their sick leave bank membership, the employee will not
be eligible for sick leave bank benefits until six months following the
effective date of membership;
            2.    The employee must be absent from work at least ten calendar
days as the result of personal illness or accident before receiving payment for
approved sick leave bank hours. Bank sick leave hours may not be granted for
elective surgery, normal pregnancy, or during a period an individual is
receiving disability benefit payments from any source or during any period of
time an individual is drawing or is eligible to receive worker’s compensation
benefits. Any other absence due to illness or accident which does not meet the
aforementioned exceptions will be considered a covered event;
            3.   The employee must have exhausted all accrued sick, annual,
holiday and compensatory time and not be eligible to activate long-term
disability insurance provisions.
         (b)   1.   An employee or family member of an incapacitated employee
who meets criteria may apply to draw upon the sick leave bank by completing an
“Application for Use of Sick Leave Bank” form. This application must have the
“physician’s Confirmation” completed confirming the nature and expected
duration of the disabling condition. If possible, the application should be
filed at least two weeks prior to use of the leave. This will help to ensure
payment for all eligible sick bank days. If necessary, a department director
may make application for the employee.
            2.   Initial application would be for a maximum of 240 hours.
Employees requesting additional hours should reapply at least two weeks prior
to use of the additional leave. An additional form from the physician must be
completed after each 240 hours drawn from the bank.
            3.   Members may appeal a rejected decision once by reapplying and
submitting additional documentation. Appeal decisions will be made based on
compliance with sick bank policy and will be final.
         (c)   The maximum number of hours, which may be drawn from the sick
leave bank for any covered event is 480 hours.
         (d)   1.   Applications (that include the Employee ID Number) should
be submitted to the Human Resources Director who will coordinate application
review with the Sick Leave Bank Committee. The Sick Leave Bank Committee
consists of the HR Director, immediate supervisor and department director of
the employee requesting sick bank time and the County Manager or his designee.
            2.   The committee is authorized to grant leave up to the total
amount of hours in the sick leave bank and to act only in accordance with this
policy, state statutes and the county personnel policy. Decisions of the Sick
Leave Bank Committee must be approved by the County Manager. Deliberations of
this committee shall remain confidential.
         (e)   If sick leave from the bank is granted to an employee, the
employee is considered to be in active pay status during the use of that leave
and all employment benefits will apply including the accrual of annual and sick
leave.
         (f)   If any sick leave is granted but not used by the employee, the
unused portion of the amount of sick leave transferred is returned to the sick
leave bank. This would apply in the case of an employee’s death or recovery
from the illness or injury. Employees may utilize any granted sick leave bank
hours until released to full duty by their physician.
         (g)   The employee’s department will assume the financial
responsibility for sick leave bank hours paid and must continue to submit time
cards for the employee.

§ 33.095 YORK COUNTY SUBSTANCE ABUSE POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   York County has a vital interest in providing for the safety and
well-being of all employees and the public and maintaining efficiency and
productivity in all of its operations. In fulfillment of its responsibilities,
York County is committed to maintaining a drug and alcohol free workplace. The
public has a right to expect county employees to be free from the effects of
drugs and alcohol as they serve the community. Further, county employees have a
reasonable right to work in an environment safe from the potential dangers
posed by drug and alcohol misuse. In keeping with federal requirements under
the Drug Free Workplace Act of 1988 (41 USC section 701 et seq.), York County
has adopted policies prohibiting the use of drugs in the workplace as well as
the use, manufacture, distribution, or possession of illegal drugs or
controlled substances by county employees on or off the job. York County is
also obliged to comply with the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of
1991 (and implementing regulations issued by the Federal Highway Administration
of the U.S. Department of Transportation (49 CFR Part 382 and 40) which
mandates drug testing for all holders of CDL’s (commercial driver’s licenses).
This act also prescribes test procedures to assure accuracy and privacy of the
results, establishes rules for rehabilitating drivers in violation and
describes sanctions for compliance failure. York County’s testing program
includes: pre-employment, reasonable suspicion, post-accident, random and
return-to-work. The type of testing requirements an employee will be subject to
is dependent on the safety and/or security sensitive nature of the employee’s
position. This policy establishes drug and alcohol testing procedures for
employees of York County in support of organizational values and legal
requirements.
      (2)   York County is also committed to assisting employees who may be
experiencing problems with drugs or alcohol. Employees are encouraged to seek
counseling and treatment for drug abuse problems. The desire on the county’s
behalf to assist employees does not relieve it of the responsibility to
maintain a drug-free workplace. The use of alcohol, illegal drugs, or the
misuse of prescription drugs is not acceptable in the county workplace. Such
behavior seriously affects job performance and can create danger to the public
and co-workers. The use of illegal drugs is not acceptable at any time or
place. The policy and regulations pertaining to a drug-free workplace apply to
all employees in the county.
      (3)   York County reserves the right to adopt additional policies
relating to drugs and alcohol in the workplace.
      (4)   This subchapter contains various rules, policies and procedures
relating to employment. Personnel policies are subject to change at any time,
with or without notice. Neither York County’s policies nor it’s practices, nor
the oral assurances of it’s representatives create a contract of employment.
   (B)   Scope/application.
      (1)   This policy applies to individuals seeking employment and all full-
time and part- time employees of York County except as noted. Employees
appointed by an authority outside the York County Council are also exempted
from this policy. For employees, this policy is effective while the employee is
being compensated by or is acting in an official capacity for York County while
in county vehicles/equipment, on county property or in county facilities. It
does not intend to supersede or conflict with binding state or federal laws,
statutes or regulations. Where a conflict occurs, state and federal mandates
take precedence. (Employees working for the office of sheriff of York County
are not covered by this policy. There is another specific policy for drug
testing that provides for coverage for these employees.)
      (2)   It is the policy of York County that all county work sites shall be
maintained as a drug-free workplace. This policy applies to applicants (any
person who applies to become an employee) and to employees (any person whose
employment is administered by the York County Human Resources Department).
      (3)   York County is dedicated to assuring fair and equitable application
of this substance abuse policy. Therefore, supervisors and managers are
required to use and apply all aspects of this policy in an unbiased and
impartial manner. Any supervisor or manager who knowingly disregards the
requirements of this policy, or who is found to deliberately misuse the policy
in regard to subordinates, shall be subject to discipline up to and including
termination.
      (4)   The appropriate use of legally prescribed drugs and non-
prescription medications is not prohibited. However, the use of any substance
which carries a warning label that indicates that mental functioning, motor
skills, or judgment may be adversely affected must be reported to the
employee’s supervisor and medical advice sought, as appropriate, before
performing work-related duties. The misuse or abuse of legal drugs while
performing county business is prohibited.
      (5)   Elected or appointed officials, poll-workers, and Seniorworks
participants shall be exempt from the testing provisions of this policy.
   (C)   Prohibited conduct.
      (1)   Manufacturing, trafficking, possession and use. Any employee
engaged in the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession or use of
prohibited substances on county premises, in county vehicles/equipment, in
uniform, or while on county business will be subject to disciplinary action, up
to and including termination. Law enforcement shall be notified, as
appropriate, where criminal activity is suspected.
      (2)   Intoxication/under the influence.  Any employee who is reasonably
suspected of being intoxicated, impaired, under the influence of a prohibited
substance, or not fit for duty shall be removed from job duties pending an
investigation and verification of condition. Employees found to be under the
influence of prohibited substances or who fail to pass a drug or alcohol test
shall be removed from duty and subject to disciplinary action up to and
including termination. CDL holders must be removed immediately from performing
safety sensitive functions.
      (3)   Alcohol use and possession.  No employee shall report to duty or
remain on duty when his or her ability to perform assigned functions is
adversely affected by alcohol or when his or her blood alcohol concentration is
.02 or higher. No employee shall use alcohol while on duty or during periods
while they are on breaks or at lunch or performing non-safety-sensitive
functions. No employee shall have used alcohol within four hours of reporting
for duty. No employee shall use alcohol during the hours they are on-call.
Employees are prohibited from consuming alcohol during the eight hours
immediately following certain vehicle accidents or until the employee has been
tested. Violations of these provisions are prohibited and punishable by
disciplinary action up to and including termination.
      (4)   Use of alcohol at county sponsored activities.  Alcohol is
prohibited at all official activities where county business is conducted or
where services are provided. The prohibition applies to both public and private
facilities, vehicles and premises. Alcohol use in conjunction with any county
sponsored activity is prohibited on all county facilities, vehicles and
premises at all times except as expressly approved by the county manager and
county attorney. Any county sponsored activity where the serving of beer, wine
or spirits have been so approved must serve adequate amounts of food; offer
non-alcoholic beverage options; observe state laws regarding the sale and
service of alcoholic beverages; have alternate transportation available;
promote and provide for designated drivers; and have event organizers
acknowledge and understand how these issues affect the county’s general
liability and public image. Violation of these provisions is prohibited and
punishable by disciplinary action up to and including termination.
      (5)   Inspections/searches.  York County reserves the right to conduct
searches or inspections of property assigned to an employee and their personal
belongings whenever there are reasonable grounds to believe that a specific
employee is in possession of alcohol or illegal drugs which are prohibited
under this policy. Such searches or inspections may include, for example, an
employee’s locker, desk, purse or county-assigned vehicle, including being
asked to empty their pockets. Search efforts will be conducted by the
employee’s supervisor/manager in cooperation with local law enforcement
authorities. All searches under this policy will occur with the utmost
discretion and consideration for the employee involved.
   (D)   Requirements.
      (1)   Compliance with testing requirements. All employees (except those
previously specified) are subject to urine drug testing and breath alcohol
testing at the county’s expense as a condition of employment. Any employee who
refuses to comply with a request for testing, who provides false information in
connection with a test, or who attempts to falsify test results through
tampering, contamination, adulteration, or substitution shall be removed from
duty immediately, and be subject to termination. Refusal can include the
inability to provide a specimen or breath sample without a valid medical
explanation, as well as a verbal declaration, obstructive behavior, or physical
absence resulting in the inability to conduct the test.
      (2)   Treatment requirements.  The county encourages all employees to
voluntarily and confidentially seek assistance at an early date, prior to
testing for any substance abuse problem, through the Employee Assistance
Program (EAP), employee health plan or other outside source. The county has
furnished a voluntary Employee Assistance Program to assist all employees who
wish to seek help for alcohol and drug problems. Participation in the EAP is
confidential and will not jeopardize employment or advancement with the county.
Should an employee undergo alcohol/drug treatment, whether voluntary or
mandatory, any absence from the job should be handled in accordance with
existing leave policies and benefit policies. In the case of mandatory
treatment, it is the employee’s responsibility to verify compliance to his or
her supervisor. Refusal to accept referral to mandated treatment or to follow
recommended treatment plans will be considered a violation of this policy and,
therefore, may subject the employee to corrective or disciplinary action up to
and including termination. Employees who fail or refuse to take a test must be
referred to a substance abuse professional (SAP) who: (1) must determine what
assistance or rehabilitation is needed; (2) oversee rehabilitation; and (3) set
up a follow-up testing plan. It remains the responsibility of the employee to
meet established work standards.
      (3)   Notifying the county of a criminal drug conviction.  Any employee
who fails to notify the county within five days of a criminal drug statute
conviction shall be subject to disciplinary action up to and including
termination.
      (4)   Notifying the county of a suspended or revoked driver’s license.
Employees, whose duties require the operation of a county motor vehicle, must
report to the county any change in their driver’s license status, including
suspension and revocation, resulting from alcohol (such as, conviction for
driving under the influence) or drug misuse. Failure to do so may result in
disciplinary action up to and including termination.
      (5)   Refusal to submit.  A refusal to submit to a drug or alcohol test
is defined as: (1) failing to provide adequate breath for testing without a
valid medical explanation after the employee has received notice of the
requirement for breath testing in accordance with policy requirements; (2)
failing to provide adequate urine for controlled substances testing without a
valid medical explanation after the employee has received notice of the
requirement for urine testing in accordance with policy requirements; or (3)
engaging in any conduct that clearly obstructs the testing process after the
employee has received notice of the requirements for breath or urine testing in
accordance with policy requirements. Refusal by a county employee to submit to
an alcohol or drug test, when requested to do so under the terms of this
policy, will be considered the same as a confirmed positive test result. This
action will require that they be referred to a substance abuse professional and
will be grounds for disciplinary action up to and including termination.
   (E)   Drug-Free Awareness Program/education and training.
      (1)   Based upon provisions of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 and
the education and training requirements of 49 CFR Part 382 and 40, York County
will establish a Drug-Free Awareness Program to assist employees and
supervisors to understand and avoid the perils of substance abuse. This program
will be part of an ongoing educational effort to maintain a drug-free
workplace.
      (2)   This program will inform employees about:
         (a)   The dangers of substance abuse in the workplace;
         (b)   York County’s policy of maintaining a drug and alcohol free
workplace; and
         (c)   The requirements of 49 CFR Part 382 and 40 and the county’s
efforts in meeting those requirements.

called for under this policy; however, the cost of any necessary treatment or
rehabilitation shall be at the employee’s expense except where coverage for
these expenses may be provided for eligible employees under provisions of the
county’s benefit programs. Employees will be asked by their supervisor or other
appropriate county officials to report to a testing site. Employees who are
believed to be under the influence of drugs/alcohol will be transported to the
testing site by the employee’s supervisor, deputy sheriff or other appropriate
county officials. Applicants subject to testing will be told to report to the
testing site at a specified time.
         (b)   Those employees who perform safety sensitive functions as
defined in this policy (and listed in Appendix, Exhibit B); or who maintain a
commercial driver’s license and operate vehicles over 26,001 pounds as
identified in this policy shall, as a condition of employment, also be subject
to testing on a random unannounced basis.
         (c)   To obtain satisfactory results from a drug screening, there must
be an absence of any illegal substances and the presence and use of any
prescription drug must be in accordance with the prescribing physician’s
instructions and be consistent with the maintenance of a safe and productive
workplace.
         (d)   Testing shall be conducted in a manner to assure a high degree
of accuracy and reliability using techniques, equipment and laboratory
facilities that have been approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services. All testing will be conducted consistent with the procedures put
forth in 49 CFR Part 40. (Approved testing facilities are noted in Appendix,
Exhibit A.)
         (e)   Drug screening will test for marijuana, cocaine, opiates,
phencyclidine and amphetamines/methamphetamines. If a sample tests positive for
an aforementioned controlled substance, a confirmation test will be conducted
using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis.
         (f)   Tests for alcohol concentration will be conducted utilizing a
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration approved evidential breath
testing device operated by a trained breath alcohol technician. For alcohol
screening, an alcohol concentration of .02 or higher will constitute a positive
test. A positive test will be immediately (within 20 minutes) confirmed by a
second screening. If the second test results in a concentration level of .02 or
higher, the outcome will be deemed a valid positive. A second test resulting in
a concentration of less than .02 will result in an overall negative screening
outcome. With all positive tests, the Medical Review Officer (MRO) will contact
the employee being tested to determine if there is an alternative medical
explanation for test results. If documentation is provided and the MRO
determines that there is a legitimate medical use for the prohibited substance,
the test result may be reported to the county as a “negative.”
         (g)   York County affirms the need to protect individual dignity,
privacy and confidentiality throughout the testing process.
      (2)   Pre-employment testing.
         (a)   All candidates for employment shall be informed that the pre-
employment process includes drug screening. This policy will apply to all
applicants for any regular full-time, regular part-time position and some
temporary positions open except elected officials, Seniorworks and School to
Work program participants, poll/election workers, and county interns. Current
county employees applying for other vacant positions with York County will not
be required to complete a pre- employment test unless they are applying for a
position requiring a CDL or a position included in this policy as a “safety-
sensitive” position. All job applicants must express understanding, by
electronic signature and/or submission of an application, that he or she
understands the offer of employment is contingent obtaining satisfactory
results from a pre-employment drug screen. In considering the hire of job
applicants currently possessing a CDL, York County is required to obtain,
pursuant to the applicant’s consent, information of the applicant’s prior
employment alcohol tests with a concentration of .02 or greater, positive
controlled substances test results, and refusals to be tested, within the
preceding two years, that are maintained by the applicant’s previous employers.
Failure of the applicant to provide such consent will result in denial of
employment, or if such information is obtained after employment is gained with
the county, as an employee the applicant is subject to discipline up to and
including termination. If the requested information cannot be obtained or a
previous employer does not comply with the county’s request, the documentation
of such action must be kept with the applicant’s other testing information. As
an employee, the applicant can perform safety sensitive functions under these
documented circumstances.
         (b)   Applicants who have received an offer of employment must
successfully complete a drug detection test. A negative alcohol/drug test
result does not guarantee an applicant employment. A person may not begin
working for the county before the results of the test are known. Pre-employment
screening for alcohol may be conducted at the county’s option. A verified
positive finding of alcohol or illegal drugs will result in a denial of
employment. In those situations, the applicant will be informed that he or she
has failed to meet medical standards. Applicants testing positive will be
ineligible to apply for employment with York County for one year unless they
provide certified documentation of successful completion of a substance abuse
rehabilitation program. A positive drug/alcohol test administered by York
County may be considered in future hiring decisions.
         (c)   Applicants will be required to sign an informed consent form. A
refusal to consent or failure to appear at the designated collection site on
the appointed date and time will terminate the hiring process.
         (d)   Drug/alcohol test results will be reported to the County
Manager’s Office or his/her designated department and positive test results
will be reported to the applicant by the testing facility. The applicant will
be promptly notified by the Medical Review Officer (MRO) at the drug testing
facility. As part of the notification process, the applicant will be provided
an opportunity to explain positive results.
         (e)   Prescribed use of legally controlled substances under the
auspices of a properly licensed health care professional will not deny the
applicant an opportunity for employment unless the treatment adversely affects
job performance. Prescriptions must be substantiated by a verifiable medical
report.
         (f)   Applicants who refuse to test or who attempt to tamper with
tests may be denied employment.
      (3)   Procedure for pre-employment testing and screening.
         (a)   When the hiring authority has made a selection decision, the
prospective employee will be offered employment contingent on passing a drug/
alcohol screening test. The hiring authority will also inform the County
Manager’s office or Human Resources Department of the contingent employment
offer. Time and most convenient location of a county designated testing
facility will be coordinated through the approved credential verification
vendor. Testing should be completed within two days (48 hours) of the offer of
employment (or request).
         (b)   The testing facility will inform the County Manager’s office or
his/her designated department of test results. If the test results are
negative, the County Manager’s Office or his/her designated department will
notify the hiring authority and process necessary paperwork. A prospective
employee will not begin employment until a negative testing outcome is
established.
         (c)   If test results are positive (drug/alcohol thresholds are
exceeded), the County Manager’s Department or his/her designated department
will record the information and notify the hiring authority. The hiring
authority will take appropriate steps to fill the position with another
candidate. (In cases where the initial testing results are positive, lab
protocol may require that they confirm the testing results directly with the
applicant in order to verify/rule out the presence of prescription drugs.)
      (4)   Random testing and screening.
         (a)   Employees in the below listed categories will be subject to
random, unannounced drug and alcohol testing in accordance with U.S. Department
of Transportation (U.S. D.O.T.) mandated policy and procedures and York County
policies:
            1.   Designated commercial driver’s license holders who operate
commercial motor vehicles exceeding 26,001 pounds per U.S. D.O.T. regulations;
and
            2.   Those employees currently in designated safety-sensitive
positions (see Appendix, Exhibit B).
         (b)   D.O.T. covered employees of the county will be pooled separately
for random selection purposes.
      (5)   Procedures for random testing and screening.
         (a)   1.   The Human Resources Director will arrange to select via a
computer generated random sample the specified number of employee names from
each of the below listed employee groups quarterly:
               a.   CDL holders - 50% of the total number of current license
holders per calendar year to be selected for drug testing quarterly. Twenty-
five percent of the total number of current license holders per calendar year
to be selected for alcohol testing quarterly.
               b.   Others in “safety-sensitive positions” - 25% of the total
number of others per calendar year to be selected for drug and alcohol testing
quarterly.
            2.   The random alcohol test may only be administered just prior to
the employee performing a safety sensitive function, while the employee is
performing a safety-sensitive function or just after the employee has stopped
performing a safety-sensitive function.
         (b)   Human Resources Director or his/her designee notifies the
appropriate department director for each of the employees selected for random
testing. Some employees may be tested more than once in a year, while others
may not be tested at all depending on the random selection process. The
supervisor or department director shall explain to the employee that the
employee is under no suspicion of taking drugs or using alcohol and that the
employee’s name was selected randomly pursuant to this policy. An employee
selected for random testing may obtain a deferral of testing only if the
employee’s supervisor and department director concur that a compelling need
necessitates a deferral on the grounds that the employee is:
            1.   In a leave status (sick, annual, administrative or leave
without pay);
            2.   On official travel status away from the job site or about to
debark on official travel prior to the testing notification. An employee whose
random test is deferred will be subject to an unannounced test within the
following 60 days; or
            3.   Off-shift which would result in the employee reporting for
appropriate screening on the next regularly scheduled shift.
         (c)   Human Resources staff is responsible for making arrangements
with the testing lab for each of the employees selected for random testing.
Department directors are responsible for providing/arranging transportation for
the employee to and from the testing lab.
         (d)   Test results shall be provided to the Human Resources Director
as they become available. The Human Resources Director will notify the
employee’s department director if there is a verified positive test result. The
department director is responsible for taking any follow-up action with the
employee in the event of a verified positive test result. This action may
include referral to the county EAP and/or any appropriate disciplinary action
as outlined in county personnel policies.
         (e)   A return-to-duty test must be conducted prior to an employee
returning to work following a verified positive test result. Thereafter, the
employee may be subject to unannounced follow-up drug tests in the next 12-
month period.
      (6)   Reasonable suspicion testing for substance abuse.
         (a)   1.   All employees except those previously specified (see
division (B) Scope/application) may be subject to fitness for duty evaluation,
to include appropriate urine and/or breath testing when there are reasons to
believe that drug or alcohol use is adversely affecting job performance. The
supervisor’s determination of reasonable suspicion must be based on specific,
contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the appearance, behavior,
speech or body odors of the employee. A reasonable suspicion referral for
testing will be made on the basis of documented objective facts and
circumstances that are consistent with the long or short-term effects of
substance abuse. Suspicion is not reasonable if it is based solely on the
observations and reports of third parties or a violation of a safety rule or
other unsafe work act.
            2.   Examples of reasonable suspicion include but are not limited
to:
               a.   Adequate documentation of unsatisfactory work performance
or on-the-job behavior together with other manifestations of substance abuse
such as: excessive absenteeism, attendance problems, poor work-performance,
and/or erratic behavior;
               b.   Physical signs and symptoms consistent with prohibited
substance abuse such as: bloodshot or watery eyes; very large or very small
pupils; runny nose; excessive perspiration; nausea and vomiting; lack of
coordination; slurred speech; or unpredictable responses to ordinary requests;
               c.   Evidence of the manufacture, distribution, dispensing,
possession, or use of controlled substances;
               d.   Occurrence of a serious or potentially serious accident
that may have been caused by human error;
               e.   Fights (meaning physical contact), assaults, and flagrant
disregard or violations of established safety, security, or other operating
procedures.
         (b)   Supervisors at all levels are responsible to recognize and
evaluate circumstances and behavior that may warrant reasonable suspicion drug/
alcohol testing. Reasonable suspicion determinations will only be made by
supervisors who are properly trained to detect the signs and symptoms of
substance abuse and who can reasonably conclude that an employee may be
adversely affected or impaired in his or her work performance due to prohibited
substance abuse or misuse. The required observations must be made by two of the
employee’s supervisors (supervisor/division head/department director/assistant
County Manager/County Manager as appropriate) who are trained in detecting the
signs and symptoms of misuse of alcohol and drug use. The county Employee
Assistance Program (EAP) should be consulted, if possible, during the
deliberation process. Supervisors who have reasonable suspicion that an
employee is under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs will document the
specific facts, symptoms or observations that form the basis of such reasonable
suspicion in detail. An Observation of Impairment Report prepared by the
supervisor and approved by the appropriate department director/assistant County
Manager/County Manager should be submitted to the Personnel Director.
         (c)   To ensure that supervisors are trained to make reasonable
suspicion determinations, supervisors vested with this authority must attend at
least one hour of training on alcohol abuse and one hour on controlled
substance use as described in division (E), Drug-Free Awareness Program/
education and training. The training covers the physical and behavioral
manifestations of probable misuse of alcohol or controlled substances.
Refresher training will be provided on an as- needed basis. Training will be
documented and maintained in the individual’s personnel file.
         (d)   Individuals directed to test will be provided a written copy of
the facts and rationale leading to the testing decision prior to taking a drug/
alcohol detection test. Employees will be escorted to the testing site.
         (e)   Drug and alcohol testing procedures and thresholds are the same
as in division (H)(2)(c), (d) and (e). However, an employee whose alcohol
concentration is .02 or greater but less than .04 will be removed from duty,
without pay, for 24 hours from administration of the test. An employee with an
alcohol concentration less than .02 need not undergo further treatment nor be
required to take return-to-duty tests. Tests yielding alcohol concentrations
greater than .04 will result in removal from duty without pay until return-to-
duty provisions are satisfied. A positive test result (.02 or greater) may
subject the employee to disciplinary action. All disciplinary actions less than
termination will mandate the employee be evaluated by the county’s EAP. If
intervention is warranted, the employee will be enrolled in a rehabilitation
program. Employees who successfully complete the rehabilitation program are
subject to a follow-up no-notice testing when returned to duty. The EAP will
determine the schedule of no-notice testing; six unannounced tests may be
requested per 12 months for a period of up to 60 months.
         (f)   Employees who fail to successfully complete the rehabilitation
program may be terminated. A second positive drug or alcohol test within five
years may be cause for termination.
         (g)   Refusal to test or attempting to tamper with the testing process
are grounds for discipline up to and including termination.
      (7)   Post-accident testing.
         (a)   Following ANY vehicle or equipment accident, all reasonable
steps to obtain a testing sample from an employee should be implemented
(prudent medical treatment for injuries remains, however, first priority). For
vehicle or equipment accidents in which the employee is medically incapacitated
and law enforcement is present, the county will rely on investigating law
enforcement agencies to direct testing. Any employee refusing to be tested will
be disciplined up to and including termination. Post-accident testing may also
be obtained for any accident that requires filing a worker compensation claim.
         (b)   Post-accident testing should be accomplished as soon as possible
after an accident. As a guideline, testing for alcohol should be conducted
within two hours of an accident; testing for drugs within 32 hours. Testing for
alcohol may not be administered more than eight hours (24 hours for CDL
holders) following an accident. Any employee who fails to remain readily
available for post-accident testing may be deemed to have refused to submit to
such testing. Employees required to take a post-accident test will refrain from
consuming alcohol for eight hours (24 hours for CDL holders) after an accident
or until a valid breath alcohol test has occurred.
         (c)   Reasons for failure to test for alcohol within two hours and for
drugs within 32 hours must be explained in writing by employee’s supervisor/
department director and submitted to personnel.
         (d)   Employees must report out of area, on duty mishaps that result
in the employee being tested for drugs/alcohol by a legally empowered testing
agency. The employee must notify his or her supervisor of the incident as soon
as possible after occurrence.
         (e)   No affected employee will be permitted to take leave until
required testing is complete.
         (f)   Testing procedures/criteria are the same as in division (H)(2)
(c), (d) and (e).
         (g)   Refusal to test or tampering with the testing process is grounds
for termination.
      (8)   Return-to-duty testing.
         (a)   All employees who previously tested positive on a drug or
alcohol test must test negative and be evaluated and released to duty by the
substance abuse professional (SAP) before returning to work. The employee will
be subject to no-notice testing as outlined in division (H)(4).
         (b)   A covered employee must submit to a return-to-duty test before
he or she may be returned to his or her safety sensitive position. The test
result must indicate an alcohol concentration of less than .02 or a verified
negative result on a controlled substance test. Absences will be without pay
following notification of positive test results. Because studies have shown
that the relapse rate is highest during the first year of recovery, return-to-
duty tested employees are subject to follow-up testing which is separate from
the random testing. For employees identified as needing assistance in resolving
problems associated with alcohol/drug abuse, the county may perform at least
six unannounced drug/alcohol tests on such employees during their first year
back in their commercial driver’s license capacity. Return-to-duty follow-up
testing can be conducted for up to 60 months from the date of the employee’s
return to duty.
      (9)   Tests by other jurisdictions. Results of a drug or alcohol test
conducted by legally authorized federal, state or local officials shall be
considered to meet the requirements of this policy if testing conforms to
applicable federal, state or local requirements. A legal demand for testing
must be made while the employee is on duty for the test to be accepted under
the provisions of this policy.
      (10)   Release of testing information.  Employee test results will be
handled confidentially and on a “need-to-know” basis. Records will be stored to
provide carefully controlled access. Records are the property of York County.
Copies of test results shall be made available to the employee for inspection
and copying. Individual records will not be released to outside agencies/
individuals without the employee’s written consent unless mandated by law.
Violation of an employee’s confidentiality can result in disciplinary action
leading to termination.
      (11)   Employee rights.  
         (a)   Embodied in the county’s desire to maintain a drug and alcohol
free workplace is the commitment to assist employees who on their own seek
treatment for substance abuse. The county will not initiate disciplinary action
against an employee who meets all of the following conditions:
            1.   Voluntarily self-identifies as an alcohol/drug abuser before
being identified through other means;
            2.   Obtains professional counseling or rehabilitation through an
EAP or other formal drug/alcohol mediation program;
            3.   Refrains from abusing drugs/alcohol thereafter.
         (b)   Employees have the prerogative to file a grievance for any
disciplinary action pursuant to this policy in accordance with established
county procedures. Compliance with York County’s substance abuse policy is a
condition of employment. Failure or refusal to cooperate fully, sign any
document, submit to any inspection or test, or follow any prescribed course of
substance abuse treatment as called for in this policy may be grounds for
disciplinary action up to and including termination.
   (I)   Generally. This policy is intended to be a unilateral expression of
the general policies, procedures and guidelines concerning the Omnibus
Transportation Employee Testing Act and the Drug Free Workplace Act. It is not
intended to create contractual rights of employment, either express or implied,
between the county and its employees. In addition to the general policies and
procedures listed above, county employees will continue to be covered by the
policies and procedures as listed in the county’s personnel policies. The
county reserves the right to interpret, change, rescind, or depart from this
policy in whole or in part without notice.

EMPLOYMENT POLICIES
§ 33.110 WORKPLACE VIOLENCE POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   Violence is a substantial contributor to death and injury on the
job. Data from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
(NIOSH) reports that homicide, due to workplace violence, is the leading cause
of death for women in the workplace and the second leading cause of death for
men. In addition, an estimated one million workers are assaulted annually in
the U.S. workplace.
      (2)   Employees of York County are entitled to work in an environment,
which is safe and free of unreasonable disruption or violence. Additionally,
citizens, clients and patrons of county programs and facilities are entitled to
conduct their affairs in a similar environment.
      (3)   It is the intent of this policy to ensure that everyone associated
with York County, including employees and citizens, never feel threatened by
another’s actions or conduct.
   (B)   Policy.
      (1)   It is the policy of York County to promote a safe work environment
for its employees. The county is committed to working with its employees to
maintain a work environment free from violence, threats of violence,
harassment, intimidation, and other disruptive behavior. While this kind of
conduct is not pervasive within our workplace, no employer is immune.
      (2)   Violence, threats, harassment, intimidation, fighting, and other
disruptive behavior in our workplace will not be tolerated; that is, all
reports of incidents will be taken seriously and will be dealt with
appropriately. Such behavior can include oral or written statements, gestures,
or expressions that communicate a direct or indirect threat of physical harm.
Individuals who commit such acts may be removed from the premises and may be
subject to disciplinary action, criminal penalties, or both.
      (3)   The county needs your cooperation to implement this policy
effectively and maintain a safe working environment. Do not ignore violent,
threatening, harassing, intimidating, or other disruptive behavior. If you
observe or experience such behavior by anyone on county premises, whether they
are an employee or not, report it immediately to a supervisor or department
director. If the supervisor or department director cannot be notified, then the
report should be given to the Human Resources Director immediately.
   (C)   Policy enforcement.
      (1)   If any part of this policy is determined to be unenforceable under
state or federal law, the remainder of the policy, to the extent possible, will
remain in full force and effect. No part of this policy, or any procedures
related to it, is intended:
         (a)   To be considered a contract for employment; or
         (b)   To affect the county’s right to manage its workplace, or to
discipline its employees, or to guarantee employment, continued employment, or
terms and conditions of the employment.
      (2)   York County reserves the right to make changes to this policy.
   (D)   Training. As part of its commitment to preventing workplace violence,
York County has established training programs for all employees. Training is a
critical component of any prevention strategy. Training is necessary for all
employees, including supervisors and department directors. Training sessions
enable employees to get to know who can help them when potentially violent
situations arise. Employees and supervisors seek assistance at a much earlier
stage when they have met the people that can help them and understand the
proper methods of reporting.
   (E)   Reporting violence.
      (1)   It is everyone’s responsibility to prevent violence in the
workplace. It is the obligation of every employee to immediately report any
threat of violence against any coworker, supervisor, citizen, visitor or other
individual to a supervisor or department director. The potential loss of life
associated outweighs the obligation to preserve any confidence requested by the
employee articulating the threat. Accordingly, if any employee fails to report
another’s threat of violence as outlined above, that employee will be subject
to discipline up to and including termination.
      (2)   Employees should know that every reasonable attempt to preserve the
confidentiality of any reported threat of violence will be made. However, the
county must do everything possible to maintain a safe workplace, acting within
the framework of the law. No employee acting in good faith, who reports real or
implied violent behavior will be subject to retaliation or harassment based
upon his or her report.
   (F)   Weapons. York County specifically prohibits the possession of weapons
by any employee in a county building, including in a county vehicle, unless
such possession or use is an approved requirement of the job.
   (G)   Danger signals.
      (1)   No one can predict human behavior and there is no specific profile
of a potentially dangerous individual. However, the following indicators of
increased risk of violent behavior have been identified by the Federal Bureau
of Investigation’s National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime, Profiling
and Behavioral Assessment Unit:
         (a)   Intimidating, belligerent, harassing, bullying, or other
inappropriate aggressive behavior;
         (b)   Numerous conflicts with supervisors and other employees;
         (c)   Bringing a weapon to the workplace, brandishing a weapon in the
workplace;
         (d)   Making inappropriate references to guns, or fascination with
weapons;
         (e)   Statements showing fascination with incidents of workplace
violence, statements indicating approval of the use of violence to resolve a
problem, or statements indicating identification with perpetrators of workplace
homicides;
         (f)   Statements indicating depression (over family, finances, and
other personal problems) to the point of contemplating suicide;
         (g)   Drug/alcohol abuse; and
         (h)   Extreme changes in behaviors.
      (2)   Each of these behaviors is a clear sign that something is wrong.
None should be ignored. Identifying the problem and dealing with it
appropriately may prevent violence. Be aware that an individual can exhibit one
or more warning signs and never resort to violence. It is important to remember
that people have different levels of sensitivity. What is a violence-triggering
event to one person may not be to another. Each case must be examined on an
individual basis and, to the extent possible, viewed from that person’s
perspective.

§ 33.111 VEHICLE POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   The purpose and intent of this policy is to provide for safe,
efficient and effective use of all county vehicles not otherwise excepted
herein. It is intended to provide regulations and procedures for effective
vehicle management. York County promotes the safety of all employees and
citizens through this policy. These procedures are in addition to all federal,
state and local transportation laws and guidelines.
      (2)   When using county vehicles, employees should be aware that they are
representatives of York County government and that their conduct is a
reflection on the entire organization.
      (3)   Any abuse of the provisions of this policy or failure to comply may
result in disciplinary actions up to and including suspension or dismissal from
employment. County vehicle privileges may also be suspended or terminated.
   (B)   Vehicle definition. County vehicles shall include any automobile,
motorcycle, boat, truck, tractor, heavy equipment, or any other motorized
vehicle which is owned, leased, or in possession or control of York County not
otherwise provided/assigned through an individual written employee contract or
assigned to an elected official or under the direct supervision of the Sheriff.
   (C)   Vehicle authorization.
      (1)   County vehicles are to be used only for county business purposes. A
County Vehicle User Agreement will be signed by all employees and maintained in
their personnel file in Human Resources.
      (2)   County vehicles shall be used in conformity with the following
guidelines:
         (a)   Incidental stops. Personnel assigned county vehicles shall use
the vehicles for county business purposes only. Personal use is limited to
incidental stops which are approved by the Department Director as long as the
stop is in line with the shortest practical distance between two approved
points. Personal use is restricted to obtaining meals, and approved breaks.
Unless approved by County Manager or his designee in advance, county vehicles
are not to be used to transport non-county employees.
         (b)   Take home vehicle. A Take Home Vehicle Authorization form must
be completed before employees are assigned vehicles on a 24 hour basis. The
authorization form should be prepared by the Department Director and forwarded
to the County Manager or his/her designee or appointed/elected official for
approval. Justifications for take home vehicle usage must be due to:
            1.   Economic savings. The use of a take home vehicle must provide
a demonstrated cost savings or economic benefit to York County, such as the
need for reporting to multiple locations or work sites on a frequent basis
before, during, or after work hours. Positions that primarily report to one
single location, such as transportation from home to work at a single office,
job site, or meeting location will not be approved.
            2.   On call. The use of a take home vehicle while on department
approved, scheduled on-call is permitted to support emergency responses.
            3.   Need for special equipment. The use of a take home vehicle
provides efficient access to special vehicles and equipment as well as tools
used to perform work outside of normal working hours.
         (c)   In accordance with IRS guidelines, a non-cash, taxable fringe
benefit of $3 per day shall be included in the employee's reported compensation
for tax purposes. Employees provided with a vehicle are responsible for
maintaining proper documentation of use and for submitting use records to the
Finance (Payroll) Department. Personnel who are classified as "emergency" are
exempt from this requirement. Emergency personnel include the following:

            4.   Emergency Management Office;
            5.   Coroner;
            6.   On-call employee for Water/Sewer Department; and
            7.   Public Safety Communications Department.
         (d)   Business hour usage. Business hour use vehicles will be assigned
to personnel by Department Director for county business purposes only.
         (e)   Overnight usage. County vehicles taken home overnight shall be
locked and parked in a safe location, at the employee’s residence. County

unless approved y the County Manager or his/her designee or appropriate
appointed/elected official. Temporary overnight usage may be approved by
Department Director.
         (f)   Personal vehicles. Personal vehicle use may be allowed in the
performance of county business when a county vehicle is not otherwise
appropriate or available. Employees who use personal vehicles for county
business are responsible for maintaining adequate insurance to meet the
circumstances of employment. The mileage reimbursement rate approved in the
annual budget is intended to cover all costs related to vehicle operation.
Accurate mileage records must be maintained and submitted to Finance for
reimbursement.

         (i)   Vehicle tracking devices.
            1.   York County reserves the right to install vehicle tracking
devices in any county vehicle maintained by the county and used by personnel/
departments that report to the County Manager. These devices allow for the
monitoring of location, speed, seat belt usage, rapid acceleration or harsh
braking, ignition or idle status, engine diagnostics, battery power, and other
information related to the usage of county-maintained equipment. By using a
county-maintained vehicle, employees consent to the monitoring and review of
information obtained through the vehicle tracking system. County employees
should have no expectation of privacy related to their usage of county-
maintained vehicles.
            2.   Vehicle tracking data from these systems are deemed by York
County to be reliable in that the county may use this data to make decisions
based solely, or in part, on the data regarding operational changes affecting
the future use of county vehicles or equipment and employment decisions.
Employees may receive disciplinary action, up to and including termination, for
violation of these policies as detected by monitoring of vehicle tracking
equipment.

per the police report. Failure to complete these requirements should result in
driving privileges being suspended until training requirements have been
fulfilled. Initial course is eight hours and a four hour refresher course shall
be completed every three years. Additional specialty training may be required
by employees of the Sheriff's Office, Emergency Management, and Fire Safety.
         (f)   Submit with employment application and every third year with

      (1)   Before an applicant is hired, the three year motor vehicle driving
record should be turned in during the interview process prior to a conditional
offer of employment and reviewed to ensure suitability for positions requiring

§ 33.112 E-MAIL AND INTERNET POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose. The intent of this policy is to establish the terms of access
to and use of York County’s network, e-mail and internet system. It is intended
to encourage responsible and acceptable use of the network, e-mail and internet
services provided for the county. Efficient utilization of the network and
internet for communications and research can improve the quality, productivity
and general cost-effectiveness of the county’s work force as well as provide
information both internally and to the public about the activities and services
of the county. This policy sets forth York County’s expectations with respect
to what is and what is not acceptable use, and to prevent offensive and/or
inappropriate behavior when using the network. Please refer to the York County
Internet and Email Policy for specific requirements, restrictions and
information.
   (B)   General principles. These principles apply to all York County

will be held accountable for abusive, inappropriate or unethical behavior when
accessing the network from county facilities or equipment.
   (C)   Responsibilities.
      (1)   Proper usage. County employees must not share with others their
assigned internet or network passwords. When creating passwords if the
guidelines in the overall policy are not met you will be prompted to create
another password that meets these criteria. Passwords are required to be

         (a)   York County provides e-mail and internet to its employees as a
fast means of communication for business purposes as deemed necessary by the
department director, the IT director, or the County Manager.
         (b)   York County’s internet system is intended to be used for
business purposes only. Informal or personal use must be limited in duration
and should take place on personal rather than paid time. Using York County’s

conditions of these guidelines and other related county policies. Failure to
observe these guidelines may result in disciplinary action up to termination.

attempting to hack or introduce viruses into a system).
            10.   Use the network to disrupt network users, services or
equipment. Disruptions include, but are not limited to, distribution of
unsolicited advertising, propagation of computer “worms” and viruses, and
sustained high volume network traffic that substantially hinders others in
their use of the network.
            11.   Intercept network traffic for any purpose unless engaged in
authorized network administrative duties.
            12.   Install or use encryption/decryption software on any York

mediums, store such copies on county systems, or transmit them over/through the
county network.
      (5)   It is the responsibility of the supervisor, manager and/or
department director to be aware of how the county’s internet and network
services are being utilized by his/her employees and ensure that employees are
periodically informed and aware of the IT procedures at a minimum on an annual
basis.
   (D)   Social media code of conduct.
      (1)   Social networking, personal websites and blogs have become common
methods of self-expression. The county respects the free speech rights of its
employees but you must remember that citizens, colleagues, and supervisors
often have access to online content you post.
      (2)   You are responsible for your actions. Anything you post can
potentially tarnish the county’s image and will ultimately be your
responsibility. Be conscious that when mixing your business and personal lives
online your business and personal personas are likely to intersect.
      (3)   Employees are cautioned that personal networking should not be made
during work hours using county computers. In addition, employees are cautioned
that posts that they make that contain obscene or harassing material, that are
unlawful, that contain personal attacks on co-workers, that reasonably call
into question the employee’s judgment, or that reasonably cause concern among
the public may result in discipline, up to and including termination from
employment. Similarly, conduct that would violate policies if done in person
also violates county policy if done through social media. Employees may not
disclose confidential information over social medical or similar sites.
Employees who post on media sites and/or media sites and who have identified
themselves as a member or employee of York County must make it clear that they
are expressing their own views and not those of the county.
   (E)   Summary.
      (1)   Employees should expect that behavior that disregards consideration
for themselves, their job, co-workers, or property rights, will be subject to
appropriate review and possible discipline, up to and including discharge. It
is the responsibility of employees to know and comply with all county rules,
including the E-Mail/Internet Use Guidelines.
      (2)   A full copy of the policy may be obtained by contacting Human
Resources or IT.

§ 33.113 INCLEMENT WEATHER POLICY.
   (A)   York County offices will remain open except in only the most extreme
situations. An announcement that the county will be operating on a delayed
basis will be made on the www.yorkcountygov.com website and via an employee
information line 803-684-8564 or 803-324-3242. Announcements may also be made
on local radio, York County Social Media sites, and television stations.
   (B)   If offices are open on regular schedule or delayed and an employee
believes the conditions are too severe to report for duty, he/she may choose to
take annual leave or unpaid leave for the amount of time they are not able to
meet the required work schedule. Employees that do not have annual leave would
be required to be on unpaid leave. The County Manager may, in his or her sole
discretion and based upon the conditions, make a determination on an individual
basis as to the severity of the specific conditions which may prevent an
employee from reporting to work. In that event, the County Manager shall make a
determination as to whether the employee’s absence will be paid or unpaid
leave.
   (C)   Due to the nature of their job requirements, employees working in some
departments are considered essential personnel and must report in inclement
weather. Essential employees work primarily in emergency management, public
safety communications, Sheriff’s Office, detention center, county prison, and
some divisions of Public Works. If an employee is unsure of his/her status he
or she should ask his/her department director. Department directors may
determine which positions are essential on a case by case basis dependent upon
the needs of the department. Essential personnel that are required to work when
offices are closed are paid their normal pay for hours worked. Non-essential
personnel receive administrative leave with pay for the time periods of office
closures.

§ 33.114 CELLULAR/SMARTPHONE USAGE POLICY.
   (A)   The use of county-owned cellular/smartphones is for improved
efficiency in conducting county-related business. Cellular/smart telephones and
services will be provided to certain York County employees to conduct official
county business related to their function with the county that either cannot be
conducted on a land-line telephone or for which it would be inefficient to use
a land-line telephone. Use of county-owned cellular phones for personal use
should be minimized and is discouraged whenever possible. Employees will be
responsible for reimbursement to the county of any personal phone calls, which
result in additional expense over the contracted billing amount. An employee
may not use a county-owned cell phone for private for-profit purposes, to
engage in political activity, or any purpose that would violate any county
policy.
   (B)   All communication equipment purchased, including phone number, is the
property of York County government and will not be transferred or ported to
another vendor or individual unless approved by the IT director or the County
Manager. All costs incurred for replacement or repair of a cellular/smartphone
will be the responsibility of the employee or employee’s department director
depending on how the device was lost, stolen or broken.
   (C)   Managers and supervisors are responsible for educating subordinates
about appropriate cellular telephone procedures and monitoring their usage. The
IT department will monitor all cell phone usage and report any suspected abuse
to the employee’s department director and the County Manager or his/her
designee. In addition, the employee responsible for such abuse may be
disciplined up to and including termination. As a county government, all
cellular phone records are subject to the S.C. Freedom of Information Act.
Employees should not expect any privacy with relation to the utilization of a
county-issued communication device. The county email and internet policy
applies to the email and internet service provided with these devices. These
devices are also subject to FOIA.
   (D)   Due to the critical nature of smartphone content and being vulnerable
to loss or theft, the information technology department will ensure proper
security measures are in place and followed. If any smartphone is discovered to
be a potential security threat and is connected to the county network, it will
be blocked, removed and potentially wiped of all data and disconnected from the
county network until it is deemed secure. Unapproved personal devices found on
the network are also subject to being blocked or wiped. If the smartphone is
lost, it will be wiped remotely to ensure all York County data is protected.
   (E)   Cellular phone usage creates many hazards while driving. If an
employee must use a cellular phone while driving, a hands free device must be
used. If a hands free device is unavailable, the employee must find a safe
location to park the vehicle before using the device. Under no circumstance
should an employee utilize the text or email features on a phone while driving.
The following exceptions to this requirement may apply for those responding to
emergencies:
      (1)   Lawfully parked or stopped;
      (2)   Using a hands-free wireless electronic communication device;
      (3)   Summoning emergency assistance;
      (4)   Transmitting or receiving data as part of a digital dispatch
system;
      (5)   A public safety official while in the performance of the person’s
official duties; or
      (6)   Using a global positioning system device or an internal global
positioning system feature or function of a wireless electronic communication
device for the purpose of navigation or obtaining related traffic and road
condition information. The county shall maintain a written policy regarding
county provided cellphone/smartphone usage. This policy sets forth York
County’s expectations with respect to what is and what is not acceptable use,
and to prevent offensive or inappropriate behavior when using this equipment.
Please refer to the York County Cellphone/Smartphone Usage Policy for specific
requirements, restrictions and information.
   (F)   The policy may be viewed at the county Human Resources Department, the
IT Department or on the county intranet (Sharepoint).

§ 33.115 DRESS CODE POLICY.
   (A)   York County’s dress code allows employees to work comfortably in their
various work places while maintaining and projecting a professional image,
especially when interacting with the public. Since no dress code can cover all
contingencies, employees must exercise a certain amount of judgement. If you
have questions or are uncertain about what is acceptable, professional business
casual attire, please ask your supervisor or Human Resources.
   (B)   Guidelines.
      (1)   Clothing. All clothing must be consistent with standards of a
professional environment and not attract undue attention or serve as a
distraction to others.
      (2)   Work uniforms. All employees who are assigned uniforms must wear
them while working. Uniforms should be clean, neatly pressed, and in good
condition when reporting to work. If the required uniform is unavailable for
any reason (new or temporary employees), employees are expected to comply with
the general requirements for all non-uniform employees, as well as departmental
guidelines that may be available for such circumstances.
      (3)   Non-uniform employees. All non-uniform employees are expected to
wear standard business casual attire except those whose jobs involve dressing
for safety or work in the field. All code enforcement and animal control
officers should wear their York County identification badges when performing
inspections or enforcement activities.
      (4)   Non-compliance. Each employee should use sound judgement and
observe proper dress code requirements at all times. Failure to observe this
policy could result in the employee being sent home or disciplinary action.
   (C)   Specifics.
      (1)   Acceptable business attire. Employees should use the following
standards to determine proper attire on any day, unless otherwise approved by a
supervisor for a specific day or activity.
         (a)   Men. Blazers, suits or sports coats, slacks, dress shirts, polo
shirts with collars, sweaters, jeans (neat and clean).
         (b)   Women. Slacks, dresses, suits, skirts, polo shirts, dress
shirts, jeans (neat and clean).
      (2)   Unacceptable attire. The following standards are guidelines for
improper attire on any day, unless approved by a supervisor for a specific day
or activity.
         (a)   Mini-skirts, shorts, or skorts;
         (b)   Crop tops, tank tops, strapless or thin strapped garments of any
type (unless worn under a jacket, sweater, or shirt);
         (c)   Sweat suits or sweat pants;
         (d)   T-shirt (with the exception of York County issued t-shirts);
         (e)   Hats (except for employees working outdoors or assigned as part
of a uniform);
         (f)   Flip flops;
         (g)   Spandex, leggings or other similar form fitting pants (except
when worn with a long tunic or dress); and
         (h)   Clothing selected or clothing worn in an unsuitable fashion that
disrupts the normal course of business and does not reflect a positive or
professional image.
      (3)   Acceptable casual Friday attire.
         (a)   Fridays have been designated as a casual dress day for non-
uniformed employees. Casual dress is a privilege that is offered to provide a
more relaxed work atmosphere. The County Manager may revoke casual dress on
Fridays if individuals or departments fail to adhere to guidelines for
appropriate attire.
         (b)   Employees should not dress in casual attire on Fridays if they
have a meeting that requires business attire. Casual Friday dress may be
extended to other days at the discretion of department directors.
            1.   Men. Casual slacks, jeans, knit shirts along with casual shoes
like tennis shoes.
            2.   Women. Casual slacks or dresses, jeans, jean dresses and
skirts, along with tennis shoes and other similar casual footwear.

§ 33.116 SMOKING POLICY.
   (A)    In the interest of providing a safe and healthy environment for
employees and the public, and in accordance with the South Carolina Clean
Indoor Act of 1990, the following smoking policy has been adopted: Smoking
(defined as the “act of lighting, smoking or carrying a lighted or smoldering
cigar, cigarette or pipe of any kind”) is prohibited throughout all York County
facilities or buildings or vehicles occupied by York County employees. Vaping
is included in this prohibition and refers to the use of electronic nicotine
delivery systems or electronic smoking devices such as e-cigarettes, e-pipes,
e-hookahs, and e-cigar. County facilities include county owned properties,
leased properties, elevators, courtrooms, restrooms, or facilities in which
company-sponsored offsite conferences and meetings are held. This policy
applies to all York County employees, visitors, temporary employees, student
interns, contractors, consultants and/or their employees working on York County
premises.
   (B)   The success of this policy will depend upon the thoughtfulness,
consideration and cooperation of smokers and non-smokers. All employees share
in the responsibility for adhering to and enforcing this policy.
   (C)   Employees who violate this policy will be subject to discipline in the
same manner and magnitude as violation of other county policies. This policy
recognizes “free choice” in the matter of smoking; however, it recognizes a
more fundamental right of non-smokers to breathe clean air.
   (D)   For employees who desire to stop smoking, smoking education and
cessation programs are available through the county health insurance plans,
through the Employee Assistance Program and through other organizations such as
the American Cancer Society and American Heart Association.
(Ord. 2501, passed 7-16-01; Am. Ord. 1214, passed 5-5-14; Am. Ord. 2019, passed
6-3-19)
§ 33.117 WORKPLACE PRIVACY POLICY.
   The workplace is intended to be a place of work. An important part is
communications and record keeping. No employee is at work 24 hours a day, seven
days a week and there are times when management needs access to communications
or records maintained by employees in their individual workplaces. Personal
items and personal communications received or stored on county premises are not
entitled to a guarantee of privacy. Management may search county property and
documents in county- owned vehicles, employee desks, lockers, file cabinets,
and the like. The county provides electronic and telephonic communication
devices to employees for use in performing their job duties. Although assigned
to the employee, these items still belong to the county. Similarly, any
computer files created or software downloaded on a county computer belongs to
the county. York County may access any data transmitted or stored on county-
owned communications devices (i.e., telephone, pager, blackberry, laptop, and
the like) during transmission of the communication or while in storage on the
county’s equipment. This includes but is not limited to voicemail, e-mail
content, text messages, and the like.
(Ord. 1214, passed 5-5-14)
§ 33.118 NO RECORDING POLICY.
   (A)   Unauthorized recording of co-workers or supervisors is prohibited.
This prohibition includes but is not limited to digital recorders or cell
phones to make audio and/or video recordings. Any employee who violates this
policy is subject to discipline up to and including termination.
   (B)   Secret recordings are prohibited unless authorized in writing by the
county manager, county attorney, or a law enforcement agency. Notwithstanding
the previous limitation, employees who are authorized to enforce county
ordinances or the laws of the State of South Carolina may make audio and video
records for any purpose within the scope of their duties.
   (C)   Employees may make authorized recordings if all of the following
criteria are met:
      (1)   A legitimate purpose for the recording;
      (2)   A recording device in plain view; and
      (3)   The persons being recorded are informed recording is taking place.
(Ord. 4015, passed 11-2-15)
§ 33.119 STUDENT INTERN POLICY.
   (A)   Student internships shall be paid positions within the county. Paid
student interns positions are authorized by the County Manager through the
annual budget process and will be placed on the county payroll in an hourly
status. All paid interns are considered part-time temporary employees and
subject to criminal background checks, new-hire drug screens and must adhere to
York County policies and procedures. The HR Department will maintain a
personnel file for the student interns and provide management of the intern
program with cooperation of department directors. A resume, application form,
or other statement of the student’s qualifications should be contained in the
file. The student intern is responsible for completing all of the necessary
employment forms on or before their first day of employment. Verification must
be provided that the student is actively enrolled in an educational institution
that based on academic requirements may issue class credit for satisfactory
completion of the internship.
   (B)   All paid student internships shall be offered on a one time basis per
individual student and shall be limited to a period of time of up to six
consecutive months.
(Ord. 2019, passed 6-3-19; Am. Ord. 820, passed 4-20-20)
§ 33.120 VOLUNTEER PROGRAM.
   (A)   York County recognizes and supports the use of volunteers to assist
county government in providing services and programs. Departments will provide
all volunteers with written policies and procedures; assignment of job duties,
and information regarding safety practices to:
      (1)   Ensure safety of the volunteer;
      (2)   Reduce liability to the county; and
      (3)   Limit occurrences of property damage.
   (B)   York County volunteers are any citizen that would like to offer their
services without pay. Volunteers must sign a document releasing the county from
any and all liability arising from their volunteer activities as required by
the Risk Management Department. Volunteers are typically not covered by Workers
Compensation benefits unless specifically designated by statute. Volunteers do
not have grievance rights. Employees cannot volunteer to perform work for the
county in the same capacity for which they are paid. Advisory Boards and
Commissions are not covered by this policy.

FUNDS
§ 34.01 VEHICLE/EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT FUND.
   (A)   Legislative findings. The County Council finds that the ownership and
maintenance of a functional, economical and safe fleet of vehicles and
equipment is necessary in order to permit the county to provide an adequate
level of governmental services to its citizens. The County Council further
finds that federal revenue sharing funds and other sources of revenue
historically used for the purchase of new vehicles and equipment have
diminished, and that it is prudent and advisable for the county to establish
methods and procedures for the orderly replacement of county vehicles and
equipment.
   (B)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to create and establish the
“York County Vehicle/Equipment Fund” or “the fund” to provide for the timely
replacement of county vehicles and equipment in order to maintain a highly
functional, economical and safe fleet of vehicles and equipment.
   (C)   Vehicle equipment replacement criteria.
      (1)   It is hereby declared to be the policy of the county to maintain
its vehicle/equipment inventory so as to allow its utilization in an optimum
manner. In determining the useful life, and in deciding to replace or retain
vehicles and equipment, the following factors will be considered:
         (a)   Costs of operation;
         (b)   Reliability (amount and frequency of down time, safety);
         (c)   Job performance capability (including applicability);
         (d)   Capability to meet standards and regulations (such as, C.O.S.H.,
E.P.A., and the like); and
         (e)   Costs to repair versus replacement (due to accident or
breakdown).
      (2)   Each of the factors enumerated above shall be considered in
reaching a decision to replace or retain an item. Each factor enumerated above
is directly affected by the degree and nature of utilization. Utilization shall
be used as basis of projecting useful life for replacement planning purposes.
   (D)   Replacement rates.
      (1)   A replacement rate will be established for each inventory item in
order to accrue monies for the timely replacement of the item. This replacement
rate shall be established by the office of the county manager on the basis of
the following formula:
RR =  C-S
   P
         (a)   “RR” is the annual replacement rate.
         (b)   “P” is the estimated period of use in years.
         (c)   “C” is the estimated cost of a like item at the time of
replacement (including make ready costs).
         (d)   “S” is the estimated salvage value of the existing item at time
of replacement.
      (2)   Rates shall be billed to each department on an annual basis as a
charge to each department’s operating and maintenance budget. Monies accrued
from such charges shall be credited to the fund.
      (3)   Replacement rates may also be adjusted independently of the above
formula to allow for balancing the fund as necessary.
      (4)   Replacement rates for all inventory items shall be developed and
updated annually by Equipment Maintenance and submitted to the office of the
county manager for approval.
   (E)   Estimated period of use.
      (1)   An estimated period of use shall be established for each inventory
item at the time of acquisition. This period shall encompass that time frame
from the date of acquisition to the estimated replacement date.
      (2)   The determination of this calendar period shall be based on an
analysis of the anticipated rate of utilization of the item, combined with
performance experience with similar items.
      (3)   Estimated periods of use shall generally be set for item groups
with similar characteristics, rather than on an individual item basis.
      (4)   Estimated periods of use for all inventory item classes shall be
developed and updated annually by Equipment Maintenance and submitted to the
office of the county manager for approval.
      (5)   The estimated period of use is a replacement program planning guide
only. Individual items may be replaced on a shorter or longer time frame
depending upon their status or upon the status of the replacement fund. The
county manager will review the status of the entire inventory on an annual
basis in order to make the determinations.
   (F)   Replacement costs.
      (1)   Replacement cost shall be established for each inventory item at
the time of purchase. This cost shall be the estimated purchase cost of an
equivalent item at the appropriate end of its estimated period of use. The
basis for determining an equivalent unit shall not include allowances for
extras or upgrading, the items being necessarily funded as a supplementary
capital outlay item by the using department at the time of replacement.
      (2)   Included in the replacement cost shall be make-ready cost, which
includes such items as transfer of radios, installation of decals and special
equipment such as hoists, tanks, and similar special equipment. These costs
will be borne by the fund if the replaced unit was so equipped. Additional or
new capitalized items shall be the financial responsibility of the using
department.
      (3)   It is recognized that some degree of speculation is involved in
estimating future replacement cost particularly for items having a period of
use of more than three years. Factors such as inflation, more stringent federal
and state regulations, technological advances and product availability all can
generate significant fluctuations in such cost.
      (4)   To achieve some degree of consistency in projecting such cost,
projections will be made on the basis of a three-year moving average of the
cumulative purchase cost increases for the following categories of inventory
items:
         (a)   Staff passenger and service vehicles. Passenger sedans, vans,
pickups, police cruisers and similar vehicles;
         (b)   Light equipment. Dump trucks, flat bed trucks and similar light
equipment;
         (c)   Heavy equipment. Motorgraders, loaders, backhoes, dozers and
similar heavy equipment; and
         (d)   Off-road equipment. Landfill compactors, motorgraders, backhoes,
tractors, and similar off-road equipment.
      (5)   The three-year moving average allows for more gradual adjustments
in replacement rates. Equipment Maintenance shall be responsible for reviewing
and updating replacement costs on an annual basis. Updated replacement costs
must be submitted to the office of the county manager for approval.
   (G)   Salvage values.
      (1)   Salvage values shall be established for each inventory item at the
time of purchase. This value shall be the estimated worth of the item at the
approximate end of its estimated period of use.
      (2)   Long term salvage value estimates will be derived from a three-year
moving average of the cumulative salvage value increases or decreases for the
same categories of inventory items as outlined in the previous section.
      (3)   These projections shall be developed and updated annually by
Equipment Maintenance and submitted to the office of the county manager for
approval with the base figure being the adjusted current year salvage value for
the item category. The detail may not be developed on an annual basis for all
special category items. Some items may have no salvage value.
   (H)   Creation of Vehicle Equipment Replacement Fund.
      (1)   There is hereby created and established the York County Vehicle/
Equipment Fund, which shall be administered, invested and disbursed as provided
herein. Replacement rates for each inventory item shall be accrued in the Fund
on the basis of annual billings to each user department.
      (2)   The fund shall be the source of capital for all necessary
replacements for inventory items. The fund shall not be used for the purchase
of additional inventory items, upgrading inventory items at replacement, or
item extras over standard unit components, all costs being a supplementary
capital outlay responsibility of the user department. Subject to the exceptions
contained herein, the fund shall be administered, invested and balanced as a
separate single fund, rather than on an item basis related to replacements of
individual items. If, at the time of replacement of any item, a surplus or
deficit exists in the replacement monies for that item, the surplus or deficit
shall be reconciled within the fund. In order to minimize the need for
reconciliations, and when necessary, to minimize their impact, the surpluses
or, losses shall be amortized over a six-year fiscal period. All inventory
items, corresponding replacement rates, period of utilization, replacement
costs and salvage values will be logged into the fund status balance sheet for
the purpose of assessing existing or projected surpluses or deficits over this
period.
      (3)   Fund surpluses or deficits for any given year shall be determined
on the basis of the following formula:
      FN = RRN + SN - CN
         (a)   “FN” is the fund status in any given year.
         (b)   “RRN” is the cumulative accrued replacement monies for the
inventory for that year.
         (c)   “SN” is the cumulative estimated salvage values for inventory
items to be replaced that year.
         (d)   “CN” is the cumulative estimated replacement costs for inventory
items to be replaced that year.
      (4)   For the purpose of fiscal planning and management, fund surpluses
or deficits shall be maintained within the following ranges:
         (a)   First three years of planning period: maximum allowable average
yearly deficit of 5% of estimated replacement costs; maximum allowable average
yearly surplus plus 5% of estimated cumulative replacement costs;
         (b)   Last three years of planning period: maximum allowable average
yearly surplus or deficit plus or minus 5% of estimated cumulative replacement
costs.
      (5)   If the project fund balance falls outside of these ranges, the
county manager shall recommend to the County Council that adjustments in the
fund be made through either:
         (a)   An overall adjustment upward or downward in annual replacement
rates for either the entire inventory or a given category of inventory items;
or
         (b)   A capital supplement or deduction from the fund.
   (I)   Authorization to transfer funds. The county treasurer is hereby
authorized, empowered and directed to transfer from the York County Medical
Services for the Indigent Fund to the Vehicle/Equipment Replacement Fund the
sum of $1,554,000 in order to provide initial funding for the county vehicle
equipment replacement fund. The County Vehicle/Equipment Replacement Fund shall
be administered, invested and disbursed as provided in this section.
   (J)   County Treasurer’s authority. The county treasurer shall hold,
administer, invest and re- invest all funds transferred to the County Vehicle
Equipment Replacement Fund as a fund separate from all monies or accounts held
by the county; provided, however, that all funds deposited or accruing to the
account of the County Vehicle/Equipment Replacement Fund may be invested
jointly with other county funds to obtain the optimum return on the funds. The
county treasurer shall have all powers and authority to invest and re-invest
movies, funds or assets transferred to the vehicle equipment replacement fund

§ 34.011 RADIO REPLACEMENT FUND.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to create and establish the
"York County Radio Replacement Fund" or "the fund" to provide for the timely
and equitable replacement of radios and radio support equipment.
   (B)   Radio/radio support equipment criteria.
      (1)   It is hereby declared to be the policy of York County to manage its
radio and radio support equipment to allow its utilization in an optimum manner
as determined by the York County Communications System Executive Committee;
hereinafter "the Committee". In determining the useful life, and in deciding to
replace or retain radio and radio support equipment, the following factors will
be considered:
         (a)   Cost of operation;
         (b)   Reliability (amount and frequency of down time and safety);
         (c)   Device performance capability (including applicability);
         (d)   Cost to repair/upgrade versus replacement (due to changing
application requirements or user needs or system failure);
         (e)   Availability of replacement parts and manufacturer technical
support.
      (2)   Each of the factors enumerated above shall be considered in
reaching a decision to replace or retain an item.
      (3)   Rapidly changing technology is a key issue within the replacement
criteria. As radio and radio support technology changes, the Committee may
employ objective criteria not outlined within the ordinance to supplement
replacement criteria outlined above.
   (C)   Replacement rates.
      (1)   A replacement rate will be established for each radio or piece of
radio support equipment in order to accrue monies for the timely replacement of
the item. This replacement rate shall be recommended by the Committee and
approved by the County Manager on the basis of the following formula: R=C/P.
         (a)   "R" - is the annual replacement rate.
         (b)   "P" - is the estimated period of use in years.
         (c)   "C" - is the estimated cost of a like item at the time of
replacement (including operating system, installation, preparation, application
software, and taxes if applicable).
      (2)   Rates shall be billed to each department on an annual basis as a
charge to each department's operating and maintenance budget. Monies accrued
from charges shall be credited to the Fund.
      (3)   Replacement rates may also be adjusted independently of the above
formula to allow for balancing the fund as necessary.
      (4)   Replacement rates for all inventory items shall be developed and
updated by Public Safety Communications annually and approved by the county
manager.
   (D)   Estimated period of use.
      (1)   An estimated period of use shall be established by the Committee
for each inventory item at the time of acquisition. This period shall encompass
that time frame from the date of acquisition to the estimated replacement date.
      (2)   The determination of this period shall be based upon an analysis of
the anticipated supportable lifespan of the item, combined with performance
experience with similar items.
      (3)   Estimated supportable lifespan shall be generally be set for item
type and classification, rather than on an individual basis.
      (4)   Estimated supportable lifespan for all inventory item classes shall
be developed and updated annually by Public Safety Communications, recommended
to the Committee for adoption and approved by the County Manager.
      (5)   The estimated supportable lifespan is a replacement program-
planning guide only. Individual items may be replaced on a shorter or longer
time frame depending upon their status or upon the status of the fund. The
county manager will review the status of the entire inventory on an annual
basis in order to make such determinations.
   (E)   Replacement cost.
      (1)   Replacement cost shall be established for each inventory item at
the time of purchase. This cost shall be estimated purchase cost of an
equivalent item as determined at the appropriate end of its estimated
supportable lifespan. The basis for determining an equivalent unit shall not
include allowances for extras or upgrading.
      (2)   Included in the replacement cost shall be "make-ready cost", which
include such items as current radio and radio support equipment standardized
operating systems, installation and preparation, updated client access
licenses, taxes, and the like. These cost will be borne by the fund if the unit
was so equipped.
      (3)   To achieve some degree of consistency in projecting cost,
projections will be made on the basis of a three-year moving average of the
cumulative purchase cost.
      (4)   The three-year moving average allows for more gradual adjustments
in replacement rates. Public Safety Communications shall be responsible for
reviewing and updating replacement cost on an annual basis and shall be
approved by the county manager.
   (F)   Creation of Radio Replacement Fund.
      (1)   There is hereby created and established the York County Radio
Replacement Fund, which shall be administered, funded and disbursed as provided
herein. Replacement rates for each inventory item shall be accrued in the fund
on the basis of annual billings to each user department.
      (2)   The fund shall be the source of capital for all necessary
replacements of inventory items. The fund shall not be used for the purchase of
additional inventory items, extras or upgrades other than for technology
stabilization at replacement. Subject to the exceptions contained herein, the
fund shall be administered, and balanced as a separate single fund, rather than
on a per item basis related to replacements of individual items. If, at the
time of replacement of any item, a surplus or deficit exists in the replacement
monies for that item, the surplus or deficit shall be reconciled within the
fund. In order to minimize the need for reconciliation, and when necessary, to
minimize their impact, the surpluses or losses shall be amortized over a six-
year fiscal period. All inventory items, corresponding replacement rates,
periods of utilization, and replacement cost will be logged into the fund
status balance sheet for the purpose of assessing existing or projected
surpluses of deficits over this period.
      (3)   Fund balances or deficits for any given year shall be determined on
the basis of the following formula: FN = RRN + SN - CN
         (a)   "FN" - is the Fund Status in any given year.
         (b)   "RRN" - is the cumulative accrued replacement monies for the
inventory for that year.
         (c)   "SN" - is the cumulative estimated replacement cost for
inventory items amortized for that year.
         (d)   "CN" - is the actual replacement cost for inventory items for
that year.
      (4)   For the purpose of fiscal planning and management, fund surpluses
or deficits shall be maintained within the following ranges:
         (a)   First three years of planning period: maximum allowable average
yearly deficit of 5% or estimated cumulative replacement cost; maximum
allowable average yearly surplus plus 5% of estimated cumulative replacement
cost.
         (b)   Last three years of planning period: maximum allowable yearly
surplus or deficit plus or minus 5% of estimated cumulative replacement cost.
      (5)   If the project fund balance falls outside of these ranges, the
county manager shall recommend to the County Council that adjustments in the
fund be made through either:
         (a)   An overall adjustment upward or downward in annual replacement
rates for either the entire inventory or a given category of inventory items;
or
         (b)   A monetary supplement or deduction from the fund.
   (G)   County treasurer's authority. The county treasurer shall hold,
administer, invest and reinvest all funds in the Radio Replacement Fund as a
fund separate from all monies or accounts held by the County; provided,
however, that all funds deposited or accruing to the account of the Radio
Replacement Fund may be invested jointly with other County funds to obtain the
optimum return on the funds. The county treasurer shall have all powers and
authority to invest and reinvest monies, funds or assets transferred to the
Radio Replacement Fund as are generally conferred upon county treasures by
statute, law, ordinance or properly promulgated rule or regulation.
   (H)   Replacement, review and approval - establishment of committee.
      (1)   The final decision to replace or retain radios and communication
equipment shall lie with the York County Council. To aid in this process, the
Committee will be established.
      (2)   The Committee shall be comprised of the assistant county manager,
York County sheriff, public safety communications director, York County
emergency management director, York County fire marshal, county manager, and
advisory members without voting privileges: York County radio shop manager,
Motorola system manager, and user group chairperson.
      (3)   The Committee shall make recommendations to the county manager as
to the need for replacement radios and radio support equipment based on the
"replacement criteria" established above. The Committee will review on an
annual basis all radios and communications equipment and make recommendations
with respect to the retention or replacement of such radios and radio support
equipment based on the criteria established above.
      (4)   The Committee shall not make any recommendations for replacement
unless funds to make such purchases are available through procedures
established by this section.

§ 34.07 FUND BALANCE POLICY.
   (A)   Legislative findings. The County Council, as the governing body of
York County, South Carolina, has made the following legislative findings
incident to the adoption of this section:
      (1)   The County Council recognizes the importance of sound financial
management in the development of financial policies for the county's general
fund, including the adoption of balanced budgets and the establishment of a
formal fund balance policy for the county's general fund.
      (2)   Credit agencies carefully monitor levels of unreserved fund balance
in a governmental subdivision's general fund in order to evaluate the political
subdivision's continued credit worthiness.
      (3)   The Government Finance Officers Association has recommended that a
government, including political subdivisions of the state, establish a formal
policy on the level of unreserved fund balances in its general fund.
      (4)   The County Council finds that a fund balance policy should be
established by Council in order to ensure the long-term fiscal stability of the
county; provide uninterrupted county services in the event of unanticipated
expenditures and/or revenue shortfalls; provide guidelines for budgeting
decisions; maintain and upgrade current investment grade bond ratings; avoid
interest expenses related to issuance of tax anticipation notes in order to
better address operating budget and capital needs; and provide for the orderly,
sound and responsible administration of county fiscal matters.
   (B)   Scope and application of policy. Upon its adoption, this policy will
apply to the county’s general fund.
   (C)   Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases shall have the
following meanings as used in this policy unless the context clearly indicates
or requires a different meaning.
      FUND BALANCE. The difference between assets and liabilities.  FUND
BALANCE is accumulated when revenues exceed expenditures, and decreased when
revenues are less than expenditures.
      UNRESERVED/UNDESIGNATED/UNASSIGNED FUND BALANCE. The portion of fund
balance that is available for appropriation and is not designated or reserved
for a specific purpose.
   (D)   Minimum balance of unreserved, unassigned funds in county general fund
established.
      (1)   Although there is no precise formula for determining an appropriate
unreserved, unassigned fund balance in the county general fund, the following
matters shall be considered in determining an appropriate unreserved,
unassigned fund balance in the county general fund:
         (a)   The timing of revenue collections;
         (b)   The local, state and national economic environment; and
         (c)   The volatility and relative stability of major revenue sources.
      (2)   It shall be the policy of the county to maintain a minimum of 25%
of annual budgeted expenditures as the projected year-ending unreserved,
unassigned fund balance in the county general fund.
      (3)   While the Government Finance Officers Association recommends, at a
minimum, that general-purpose governments, regardless of size, maintain
unreserved fund balances in their general funds of no less than 5% to 15% of
regular general fund operating revenues, or of no less than one to two months
of regular general fund operating expenditures, the minimum targeted amount of
annual unreserved, unassigned fund balance for the county is established at 25%
of regular general fund operating expenses, based on the significant percentage
of annual expenditures that are attributable to salaries and benefits and the
future capital needs of the county.
      (4)   The county’s comprehensive annual financial report shall show
reserves and designations subject to the requirements of generally accepted
accounting principles.
      (5)   The undesignated/unassigned fund balance shall be considered when
developing the annual county budget, and shall be monitored and evaluated
during each fiscal year to ensure year-end results will meet the targeted
unreserved, unassigned fund balance reserve in the county general fund.
      (6)   In the event the projected unreserved/unassigned fund balance is
greater than 25% of annual expenditures, the excess may be appropriated and
used for:
         (a)   One-time expenditures that do not increase recurring operating
costs; or
         (b)   Capital equipment/facilities.
      (7)   If during a review of actual operating revenues and expenditures
the ending unreserved/unassigned general fund balance is projected to fall
below the 25% minimum targeted amount at fiscal year end, the county finance
director/treasurer will report those findings to the county manager, who shall
present a plan for expenditure reductions to the County Council. Appropriations
from the minimum unreserved fund balance shall require the approval of the
County Council, which shall establish a plan to rebuild the unreserved fund
balance to the minimum targeted amount established by this policy
contemporaneously with the approval of such appropriation.
(Ord. 2410, passed 7-19-10)
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY REPLACEMENT FUND
§ 34.10 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
   The County Council finds that the ownership and maintenance of up-to-date
information technology is necessary in order to provide efficient governmental
services to its citizens.
(Ord. 2403, passed 9-2-03)
§ 34.11 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this section is to create and establish the "York County
Information Technology Replacement Fund" or "the fund" to provide for the
timely replacement of information technology equipment and maintain a highly
functional, economical information technology program.
(Ord. 2403, passed 9-2-03)
§ 34.12 INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY REPLACEMENT CRITERIA.
   (A)   It is hereby declared to be the policy of the county to manage its
information technology and allow its utilization in an optimum manner. In
determining the useful life, and in deciding to replace or retain information
technology equipment, the following factors will be considered:
      (1)   Cost of operation;
      (2)   Reliability (amount and frequency of down time and safety);
      (3)   Job performance capability (including applicability);
      (4)   Capability to increase efficiency of staff and services; and
      (5)   Costs to repair/upgrade versus replacement (due to changing
application requirements or user needs or system failure).
   (B)   Each of the factors enumerated above shall be considered in reaching a
decision to replace or retain an item. Each factor enumerated above is directly
affected by the degree and nature of utilization. Utilization shall be
considered as a basis of projecting useful life for replacement planning
purposes.
   (C)   Stability of pricing and rapidly changing technology are also issues
for consideration within the replacement criteria. As information technology
changes the traditional computing environment changes and forces objective
consideration of replacement criteria and standards.
   (D)   Information technology equipment considered a candidate for the
Information Technology Replacement Fund must be microprocessor based with a
value greater than an amount determined by the county manager at the beginning
of each fiscal year. The value of the hardware equipment shall include the
software cost for the operating system and application software, if applicable.
Information technology equipment will be divided into the following categories:
      (1)   Personal computers. Personal computers are defined as desktop
computers and monitors, which are attached to the desktop computer, emulation
terminals, and laptop/portable computers.
      (2)   Servers. Servers will be defined as microprocessor based computers
that provide connections by client computers to perform operations or
processing.
      (3)   Printers. Printers are defined as a print device that has a
microprocessor and network connectivity capability. Individual desktop printers
will not be included in the information technology plan.
      (4)   Network and communication equipment. Network equipment is defined
as core network equipment that has an operating system and provides network
connectivity between facilities or when connecting more than ten network users:
communication equipment is defined as voice over internet protocol (VOIP)
telephony equipment which allows communication over an IP network:
uninterrupted power supplies (UPS) are defined as any battery backup device
used to keep networking equipment up during power outages. Individual desktop
UPS’ will not be included in the information technology plan.
      (5)    In the event information technology equipment is replaced with
funds other than information technology funds, such as grants, drug seizure
funds, or etc., the equipment will be considered replaced and the replaced
equipment will be retired or redeployed at the discretion of the county
manager. The new equipment will then become a part of the Information
Technology Replacement Fund for replacement as normally scheduled in the fund.
The associated fund balance for such replaced equipment will be placed back in
the Information Technology Replacement Fund.
(Ord. 2403, passed 9-2-03; Am. Ord. 912, passed 4-9-12)
§ 34.13 REPLACEMENT RATES.
   (A)   A replacement rate will be established for each piece of technology
equipment in order to accrue monies for the timely replacement of the item.
This replacement rate shall be established by the office of the county manager
on the basis of the following formula: R = C/P
      (1)   "R" is the annual replacement rate;
      (2)   "P" is the estimated period of use in years; and
      (3)   "C" is the estimated cost of a like item at the time of replacement
(including operating system and application software, if applicable).
   (B)   Rates shall be billed to each department on an annual basis as a
charge to each department's operating and maintenance budget. Monies accrued
from charges shall be credited to the fund.
   (C)   Replacement rates may also be adjusted independently of the above
formula to allow for balancing the fund as necessary.
   (D)   Replacement rates for all inventory items shall be developed and
updated annually by the office of the county manager.
   (E)   Estimated period of use.
      (1)   An estimated period of use shall be established for each inventory
item at the time of acquisition. This period shall encompass that time frame
from the date of acquisition to the estimated replacement date.
      (2)   The determination of this period of use shall be based upon an
analysis of the anticipated rate of utilization of the item, combined with
performance experience with similar items.
      (3)   Estimated periods of use shall generally be set for item category
and classification, rather than on an individual item basis. Appendix A shall
serve as a replacement-planning schedule. Appendix A shall be reviewed annually
and adjusted accordingly by the county manager.
      (4)   Estimated periods of use for all inventory item classes shall be
developed and updated annually by the office of the county manager and approved
by the County Council.
      (5)   The estimated period of use is a replacement program-planning guide
only. Individual items may be replaced on a shorter or longer time frame
depending upon their status or upon the status of the Information Technology
Replacement Fund. The county manager will review the status of the entire
inventory of the Inventory Technology Replacement Fund on an annual basis in
order to make the determinations.
(Ord. 2403, passed 9-2-03)
§ 34.14 REPLACEMENT COSTS.
   (A)   Replacement costs shall be established for each inventory item at the
time of purchase. This cost shall be the estimated purchase cost of an
equivalent item as determined at the appropriate end of its estimated period of
use. The basis for determining an equivalent unit shall not include allowances
for extras or upgrading. As a supplemental budget, the using department should
request items during the budgetary process to upgrade a system unit or add to
its capability.
   (B)    Included in the replacement costs shall be make-ready costs, which
include such items as current technology standardized operating systems,
business application software (word processing software, etc.), updated client
access licenses, and the like. These costs will be borne by the fund if the
unit was so equipped.
   (C)   It is recognized that some degree of speculation is involved in
estimating future replacement costs. Factors such as software developments,
technology changes and advances and technology cost fluctuation must be
considered.
   (D)   To achieve some degree of consistency in projecting costs, projections
will be made on the basis of a three-year moving average of the cumulative
purchase cost.
   (E)   The three-year moving average allows for more gradual adjustments in
replacement rates. The county manager shall be responsible for reviewing and
updating replacement costs annually.
(Ord. 2403, passed 9-2-03)
§ 34.15 CREATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY REPLACEMENT FUND.
   (A)   There is hereby created and established the York County Information
Technology Replacement Fund, which shall be administered, funded and disbursed
as provided herein. Replacement rates for each inventory item shall be accrued
in the fund on the basis of annual billings to each user department.
   (B)   The fund shall be the source of capital for all necessary replacements
of inventory items. The fund shall not be used for the purchase of additional
inventory items, item extras over technology standards, or upgrading inventory
items other than for technology stabilization at replacement, all costs being a
supplementary capital outlay responsibility of the user department. Subject to
the exceptions contained herein, the fund shall be administered, and balanced
as a separate single fund, rather than on a per item basis related to
replacements of individual items. If, at the time of replacement of any item, a
surplus or deficit exists in the replacement monies for that item, the surplus
or deficit shall be reconciled within the fund. In order to minimize the need
for reconciliation, and when necessary, to minimize their impact, the surpluses
or losses shall be amortized over a six-year fiscal period. All inventory
items, corresponding replacement rates, periods of utilization, and replacement
costs will be logged into the fund status balance sheet for the purpose of
assessing existing or projected surpluses or deficits over this period.
   (C)   Fund balances or deficits for any given year shall be determined on
the basis of the following formula: FN=RRN+CN
      (1)   "FN" is the fund status in any given year;
      (2)   "RRN" is the cumulative accrued replacement monies for the
inventory for that year; and
      (3)   "CN" is the cumulative estimated replacement cost for inventory
items to be replaced that year.
   (D)   For the purpose of fiscal planning and management, fund surpluses or
deficits shall be maintained within the following ranges:
      (1)   First three years of planning period: maximum allowable average
yearly deficit of 5% of estimated cumulative replacement costs; maximum
allowable average yearly surplus plus 5% of estimated cumulative replacement
costs;
   (2)   Last three years of planning period: maximum allowable average yearly
surplus or deficit plus or minus 5% of estimated cumulative replacement costs.
   (E)   If the project fund balance falls outside of these ranges, the county
manager shall recommend to the County Council that adjustments in the fund be
made through either:
      (1)   An overall adjustment upward or downward in annual replacement
rates for either the entire inventory or a given category of inventory items;
or
      (2)   A monetary supplement or deduction from the fund.
   (F)    Authorization to transfer funds. The county treasurer is hereby
authorized, empowered and directed to transfer funds from the General Fund to
the Information Technology Replacement Fund in the sum as provided by Council
in order to provide initial funding for the county Information Technology
Replacement Fund. The county Information Technology Replacement Fund shall be
administered, invested and disbursed as provided in this section.
   (G)   County treasurer's authority. The county treasurer shall hold,
administer, invest and reinvest all funds transferred to the Information
Technology Replacement Fund as a fund separate from all monies or accounts held
by the county; provided, however, that all funds deposited or accruing to the
account of the county Information Technology Replacement Fund may be invested
jointly with other county funds to obtain the optimum return on the funds. The
county treasurer shall have all powers and authority to invest and reinvest
movies, funds or assets transferred to the Information Technology Replacement
Fund as are generally conferred upon county treasurers by statute, law,
ordinance or properly promulgated rule or regulation.

hereby authorized to transfer information technology assets from their existing
department to another department.
(Ord. 2403, passed 9-2-03)
§ 34.16 REPLACEMENT, REVIEW AND APPROVAL; ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMITTEE.
   (A)   The final decision to replace or retain information technology
equipment shall lie with the County Council. To aid in this process, the county
manager shall establish a review/replacement committee.
   (B)   The committee shall be comprised of the management information systems
director, the purchasing director, assistant county manager for internal
services, the sheriff's office information technology director and solicitor's
office technology director. The county manager may appoint or remove members as
necessary. The committee shall be appointed at the beginning of each fiscal
year and shall serve until the end of the fiscal year.

INVESTMENT OF FUNDS
§ 34.20 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
   As an incident to the enactment of this subchapter, the County Council has
made the following legislative findings. The establishment of a comprehensive
policy for the investment of funds held by the county treasurer for investment
will promote the efficient administration and prudent investment of funds held
by the county treasurer for investment, assist the county treasurer in defining
the scope of permitted investments, establish investment procedures and
objectives, define authorized and suitable investments, establish standards for
authorized investments, establish standards for financial dealers and
institutions receiving public funds under the control of the county treasurer
for investment, assure the safekeeping, custody and collateralization of county
and other public funds held by the county treasurer, establish reporting
standards relating to county investments, establish standards of ethics and aid
in preventing conflicts of interest in county financial affairs, all of which
serves the public interest. This subchapter is intended to establish policies,
standards, rules and regulations for the investment of funds held by the county
treasurer.
(‘77 Code, § 8-81) (Ord. 1592, passed 3-16-92)
§ 34.21 POLICY.
   It is the policy of the county to invest public funds in a manner which will
provide the highest investment return with the maximum security while meeting
daily cash flow demands and conforming to all state and local statutes
governing the investment of public funds.
(‘77 Code, § 8-82) (Ord. 1592, passed 3-16-92)
§ 34.22 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BROKER. Brings buyers and sellers together for a commission paid by the
initiator of the transaction or by both sides; he or she does not position. In
the money market, BROKERS are active in markets in which financial
intermediaries, corporations and other participants buy and sell money or
short-term maturity instruments and in interdealer markets.
   COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT. The official annual financial report
for the county which is audited by an independent auditor, as outlined in S.C.
Code § 4-9-150.
   DEALER. As opposed to a broker, acts as a principal in all transactions,
buying and selling for his or her own account.
   DELIVERY VERSUS PAYMENT. There are two methods of delivery of securities:
delivery versus payment and delivery versus receipt (also called free).
DELIVERY VERSUS PAYMENT is delivery of securities with an exchange of money for
the securities upon delivery and receipt.
   DELIVERY VERSUS RECEIPT. Delivery of securities with an exchange of a signed
receipt for the securities.
   DIVERSIFICATION. Dividing investment funds among a variety of securities
offering independent returns.
   FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC). A federal agency that insures
bank deposits, currently up to $100,000 per deposit.
   LOCAL GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT POOL (LGIP). The aggregate of all funds from
political subdivisions that are placed in the custody of the State Treasurer
for investment and reinvestment.
   MARKET VALUE. The price at which a security is trading and could presumably
be purchased or sold.
   MATURITY. The date upon which the principal or stated value of an investment
becomes due and payable.
   PRIMARY DEALER. A group of government securities dealers that submit daily
reports of market activity and positions and monthly financial statements to
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and are subject to its informal oversight.
PRIMARY DEALERS include Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registered
securities broker-dealers, banks and a few unregulated firms.
   PRUDENT PERSON RULE. An investment standard. In the state, the law requires
that the county treasurer may invest money only in a list of securities
enumerated in the South Carolina Code of Laws.
   SEC RULE 15C3-1. See UNIFORM NET CAPITAL RULE.
   SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. The agency created by Congress to
protect investors in securities transactions by administering securities
legislation.
   UNIFORM NET CAPITAL RULE. Securities and Exchange Commission requirement
that member firms as well as nonmember broker-dealers in securities maintain a
maximum ratio of indebtedness to liquid capital of 15 to 1; also called net
capital rule and net capital ratio. Indebtedness covers all money owed to a
firm, including margin loans and commitments to purchase securities, one reason
new public issues are spread among members of underwriting syndicates. Liquid
capital includes cash and assets easily converted into cash.
(‘77 Code, § 8-83) (Ord. 1592, passed 3-16-92)
§ 34.23 SCOPE.
   This investment policy applies to all financial assets of the county and all
assets held by the county treasurer pursuant to state law. These funds are
accounted for in the county’s comprehensive annual financial report and include
the general fund, special revenue funds, debt service funds, capital projects
funds, proprietary fund types and fiduciary fund types.
(‘77 Code, § 8-84) (Ord. 1592, passed 3-16-92)
§ 34.24 PRUDENCE.
   Investments shall be made with judgment and care (under circumstances then
prevailing) which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in
the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment,
considering the probable safety of their capital, as well as probable income to
be derived. The standard of prudence to be used by investment officials shall
be the “prudent person” standard and shall be applied in the context of
managing an overall portfolio. Investment officers acting in accordance with
written procedures and the investment policy and exercising due diligence shall
be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s risk or
market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a
timely fashion and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
(‘77 Code, § 8-85) (Ord. 1592, passed 3-16-92)
§ 34.25 OBJECTIVE.
   (A)   Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment
program. Investments of the county shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks
to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. To attain this
objective, diversification is required in order that potential losses on
individual securities do not exceed the income generated from the remainder of
the portfolio.
   (B)   The county’s investment portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to
enable the county to meet all operating requirements which might be reasonably
anticipated.
   (C)   The county’s investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective
of attaining a market rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles,
taking into account the county’s investment risk constraints and the cash flow
characteristics of the portfolio.
(‘77 Code, § 8-86) (Ord. 1592, passed 3-16-92)
§ 34.26 DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY.
   (A)   Authority to manage the county’s investment program is derived from
S.C. Code § 12-45-220. Management responsibility for the investment program is
hereby delegated to the county treasurer, who shall establish written
procedures for the operation of the investment program consistent with this
investment policy. Procedures should include reference to safekeeping,
repurchase agreements, wire transfer agreements, collateral/depository
agreements and banking service contracts. The procedures shall include explicit
delegation of authority to persons responsible for investment transactions. No
person may engage in an investment transaction, except as provided under the
terms of this policy and the procedures established by the county treasurer.
   (B)   The county treasurer shall be responsible for all transactions
undertaken and shall establish a system of controls to regulate the activities
of subordinate officials. In the absence or disability of the county treasurer,
the deputy treasurer is authorized to act for the county treasurer in all
matters covered by this policy.
(‘77 Code, § 8-87) (Ord. 1592, passed 3-16-92)
§ 34.27 ETHICS AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
   Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with proper execution of the
investment program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial
investment decisions. Employees and investment officials shall disclose to the
county manager any material financial interests in financial institutions that
conduct business within this jurisdiction, and they shall further disclose any
large personal financial/investment positions that could be related to the
performance of the county’s portfolio. Employees and officers shall subordinate
their personal investment transactions to those of the county, particularly
with regard to the time of purchase and sales.
(‘77 Code, § 8-88) (Ord. 1592, passed 3-16-92)
§ 34.28 INVESTMENT AUTHORITY FOR OTHER POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS AND/OR AGENCIES.
   Officials from those entities with which the county holds and/or invests
funds shall have the authority to provide special instructions to be used in
the investment of the funds. These special instructions shall be provided, in
writing, to the county treasurer prior to the receipt by the county treasurer
of any funds. Special instructions for investments shall conform to the
guidelines of § 34.29 and the requirements of state law. In the absence of
special instructions, investments shall be made within the policy guidelines.
(‘77 Code, § 8-89) (Ord. 1592, passed 3-16-92)

   (B)   In the event of a tie bid, the county treasurer may divide the bid,

§ 34.32 COLLATERALIZATION.
   (A)   Collateralization will be required on two types of investment:
certificates of deposits and repurchase agreements. In order to anticipate

and protected by federal deposit insurance, shall be exempt from the
requirement that security be furnished for it by the bank and security shall be
required only for the portion of the deposits as shall exceed the amount
covered by the insurance. All public officers who have deposited public funds
in banks for which security or collateral is required shall obtain it only for
the amount by which the particular deposit exceeds the sum protected by federal
deposit insurance. The portions of trust funds as may be on deposit in any bank
and for which security is now required shall be secured only for the amount by
which the same exceeds the amount protected by federal deposit insurance.
   (C)   Collateral will always be held by an independent third party with whom
the county has a current custodial agreement. A clearly marked evidence of
ownership (safekeeping receipt) must be supplied to the county and retained.
The right of collateral substitution is granted.
(‘77 Code, § 8-93) (Ord. 1592, passed 3-16-92)
§ 34.33 SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY.
   With the exception of short-term repurchase agreements or “sweep” accounts,
all security transactions, including collateral for long-term repurchase
agreements, entered into by the county shall be conducted on a delivery-versus-
payment (DVP) basis. Securities will be held by a third party custodian
designated by the treasurer and evidenced by safekeeping receipts.
(‘77 Code, § 8-94) (Ord. 1592, passed 3-16-92)
§ 34.34 DIVERSIFICATION.
   The county will diversify its investments to control the risk of loss
resulting from over-concentration of assets in a specific issuer, instrument or
dealer. With the exception of U.S. Treasury securities, certificates of deposit
and authorized pools (The South Carolina Local Government Investment Pool), no
more than 50% of the county’s total investment portfolio will be invested in a
single security type or with a single financial institution.
(‘77 Code, § 8-95) (Ord. 1592, passed 3-16-92)
§ 34.35 MAXIMUM MATURITIES.
   To the extent possible, the county will attempt to match its investments
with anticipated cash flow requirements. Unless matched to a specific cash
flow, the county will not directly invest in securities maturing more than two
years from the date of purchase. However, the county may collateralize its
long-term repurchase agreements using longer-dated investments not to exceed
five years. Maturities of collateral on short-term repurchase agreements or
“sweep” accounts may exceed five years. Reserve funds may be invested in
securities exceeding two years if the maturity of investments are made to
coincide as nearly as practicable with the expected use of the funds.
(‘77 Code, § 8-96) (Ord. 1592, passed 3-16-92)
§ 34.36 INTERNAL CONTROL.
   The treasurer shall establish an annual process of independent review of
conformity with this subchapter by an external auditor. This review will
provide internal control by assuring compliance with policies and procedures
established by this subchapter.
(‘77 Code, § 8-97) (Ord. 1592, passed 3-16-92)
§ 34.37 REPORTING.
   The county treasurer shall submit an investment report to the county
manager, County Council and superintendent of each school district for which
funds are invested on a monthly basis. The investment report shall include the
type of investment, the amount invested, the date of the investment, the
broker/dealer or financial institution with which the funds are invested, the
interest rate of the investment and the maturity date of the investment. The
bid documentation and documentation for securing these funds shall be provided
to the county manager and shall be available to the County Council and school
district superintendents upon request. Material deviations from projected
investment income shall be immediately reported to the county manager by the
county treasurer.
(‘77 Code, § 8-98) (Ord. 1592, passed 3-16-92)
§ 34.38 NOTICE REQUIRED FOR OPENING, TRANSFER, CLOSING OF ACCOUNTS.
   All county elected officials, county employees and county agencies, boards,
commissions and departments shall provide written notice to the county manager
and the county treasurer of the opening, transfer and closing of any account
containing county funds or funds held in an official or administrative capacity
by the elected official, employee, agency, board, commission or department
within ten days after the account is opened, transferred or closed at a
financial institution. The notice shall include the date the account was
opened, transferred or closed; the amount of each account; the nature and
source of the funds deposited or withdrawn from the account; the name of the
financial institution at which the account was opened, transferred or closed;
the account number of the account; the name and address of every person having

§ 34.39 INDEPENDENT AUDIT OF ACCOUNTS.
   All accounts established, opened, transferred or closed by county elected
officials, county employees, county agencies, boards, commissions and
departments which include county funds or funds over which county officials,
employees, agencies, boards, commissions and departments have or exercise
jurisdiction shall be reviewed annually by an external auditor in connection
with the annual audit of the financial statements and condition of the county.

that the county may disclose such submitted information or documents. By
submitting information or documents to the county, the submitting person
assumes the risk and bears sole responsibility for any damage that may arise
from disclosure.
         (b)   The county may, at its sole discretion, assert any relevant and
applicable exemption to disclosure allowed by the South Carolina Freedom of
Information Act.
         (c)   Unless contrary to the South Carolina Freedom of Information
Act, the county shall not be required to disclose the following:
            1.   Evaluative documents, pre-decisional in nature, containing
technical evaluations and recommendations; or
            2.   Documents submitted in response or with regard to an
Invitation for Bids or solicitation of proposals or other request in instances
in which a contract is not made.
         (d)   To the extent a person provides the county with documents that
contain what the person deems to be confidential proprietary information, the
person has a duty to mark such documents “CONFIDENTIAL.” In that instance, the
person must mark “CONFIDENTIAL” each part, by page, paragraph, section or line,
as appropriate, in such manner that it is clear to a reasonable person making a
cursory review of the document as a whole that the relevant part has been
marked confidential. Under those circumstances, the county will endeavor to
take reasonable steps to keep those portions confidential, unless a Freedom of
Information Act request is received. Under the latter circumstances, the county
will endeavor to take reasonable steps to notify the person of the Freedom of
Information Act request so that the person may take, at its sole expense,
whatever steps, if any, it deems necessary to protect its assertion that the
information is confidential and exempt from disclosure.
      (2)   General provisions.
         (a)   Procurement information shall be public record to the extent
required by Chapter 4 of Title 30 (The Freedom of Information Act) of the South
Carolina Code of Laws.
         (b)   Certain commercial, financial or trade secret information, set
forth in any type bin or within any response to a Request for Qualifications or
a Request for Proposals, and designated by a responder as privileged and
confidential, may not be disclosed.
      (3)   Privileged and confidential information.
         (a)   Designation.
            1.   At the time of submitting a proposal or bid, the party
supplying a bid or proposal must identify any portion of the proposal or bid
considered by the party to be privileged and confidential commercial, financial
or trade secret information, and thus eligible to be withheld from public
inspection and copying.
            2.   If the information identified by the party is commercial
information, financial information, or a trade secret, it may be withheld from
public inspection and copying.
            3.   If the party fails to identify information as privileged and
confidential commercial, financial, or trade secret information, the entire bid
or proposal is to be made available for public inspection and copying.
         (b)   Definition and examples.
            1.   PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION is information in
specific detail not customarily released to the general public, the release of
which might cause harm to the competitive position of the party supplying the
information.
            2.   Examples of this type of information would include:
               a.   Customer lists;
               b.   Design recommendations and identification of prospective
problem areas under an RFP;
               c.   Design concepts, including methods and procedures;
               d.   Biographical data on key employees of the bidder.
      (4)   Pre-decisional evaluative documents. Evaluative documents pre-
decisional in nature, such as inter- or intra-departmental memoranda containing
technical evaluations and recommendations, are exempted so long as the contract
award does not expressly adopt or incorporate the inter- or intra-departmental
memoranda reflecting the pre-decisional deliberations.

§ 35.008 PURCHASING PROCEDURES.
   (A)   General purchasing procedures.
      (1)   Maximum practical competition. All specifications shall be drafted
so as to assure cost effective procurement for the purposes intended, and to
encourage competition in satisfying the county's needs, and shall not be unduly
restrictive. Any use of characteristics that serves to limit competition shall
be avoided. The policy enunciated in this section applies to all
specifications, including but not limited to, those prepared for the county by
architects, engineers, designers, draftsmen, and land surveyors.
      (2)   Duties of the procurement director and the using departments. The
procurement director may prepare or review, issue, revise and maintain the
specifications for property, supplies, services, and construction required by
the county. The procurement director may obtain expert advice and assistance
from personnel of the using departments or other advisory sources in the
development of specifications, and may delegate to a using department the
authority to prepare its own specifications. Specifications for property,
supplies, services, or construction items may be prepared by the using
department.
      (3)   Brand name or equal specification. Brand name or equal
specifications may be used when the using department makes a written
determination that one of the following exists:
         (a)   No other design or performance specification or qualified
products list is available;
         (b)   Time does not permit the preparation of another form of purchase
description not including a brand name specification;
         (c)   The nature of the product or the nature of the county's
requirements makes use of a brand name or equal specifications suitable for the
procurement; or
         (d)   Use of a brand name or equal specification is in the county's
best interests.
      (4)   Required characteristics. Unless the procurement director
determines that the essential characteristics of the brand names included in
the specifications are commonly known in the industry or trade, brand name or
equal specifications shall include a description of the particular design,
functional, or performance characteristics required.
      (5)   Nonrestrictive use of brand name or equal specifications. Where a
brand name or equal specification is used in a solicitation, the solicitation
shall contain explanatory language that the use of a brand name is for the
purpose of describing the standard of quality, performance, and characteristics
desired and is not intended to limit or restrict competition.
      (6)   Brand name only specification. Since use of a “brand name only”
specification is restrictive of product competition, it may be used only when
the using agency makes a written determination that only the identified brand
name item or items will satisfy the county's needs and such determination is
approved, in writing, by the procurement director.
      (7)   Competition. The procurement director shall seek to identify
sources from which the designated brand name only item or items can be
obtained, and shall solicit such sources to achieve whatever degree of price
competition is practicable.
   (B)   Completing purchase transactions. All purchases of goods, services,
materials, supplies or equipment made for or on behalf of the county, as set
out below, shall be authorized by the issuance of a purchase order by the
county manager, the procurement director, or someone designated by the
procurement director. In completing purchase transactions, the following
policies, procedures and guidelines shall be observed.
      (1)   Small purchases not exceeding $3,000.00, per transaction, may be
accomplished without securing competitive quotations if the prices are
considered to be fair and reasonable. Action to obtain competitive quotations
need only be taken when the procurement director suspects the price may not be
fair and reasonable, e.g., comparison to previous price paid, personal
knowledge of the price range of the item involved. Every effort should be made
to distribute such purchases equitably among qualified suppliers.
         (a)   In most instances, a county issued purchasing (“P”) card may be
used to procure items totaling $3,000.00 or less per transaction, as herein
described.
            1.   Purchasing Card Program. The procurement director is
authorized to establish a purchasing card program (“P-Card” of “P-Card
Program”). The P-Card is a master charge card issued to county employees to
make small value purchases of supplies, materials, equipment, and services for
county business use.
            2.   The procedures for this program shall be promulgated and
amended as needed by the procurement director and approved by the county
manager.
            3.   This program shall be discontinued at any time as recommended
by the procurement director and approved by the county manager.
            4.   The cardholder shall use the purchasing card for legitimate
business purposes only. Misuse of the card will subject the cardholder to
disciplinary action in accordance with county personnel policies and/or
applicable criminal laws.
         (b)   Permitted P-Card purchases include, but are not limited to:
            1.   Airline tickets;
            2.   Hotel accommodations for travel;

(b) above, the P-Card administrator may designate other goods and services that
may be purchased with a P-Card.
         (d)   Prohibited P-Card purchases include, but are not limited to:
            1.   Personal purchases of any kind;
            2.   Cash advances;
            3.   Gift cards, calling cards, pre-paid cards of any type or
similar products;
            4.   Entertainment, including in-room movies;

            10.   Computers, unless purchased by IT; and
            11.   Services conducted on county-owned property.
         (e)   In addition to the goods and services listed in division (B)(1)
(d), the P-Card administrator may designate other goods and services that may
not be purchased with a P-Card.
      (2)   Single purchase orders exceeding $3,000.00, but less than
$25,000.01 may be awarded by the procurement director, or someone designated by
the procurement director, to the vendor or supplier of such goods or services
whose quotation is most advantageous to the county, after the county has
received telephone, oral, or fax or written (letter or e-mail) quotations from
at least two vendors or suppliers of such goods or services, when practicable
and feasible.
      (3)   Single purchase orders exceeding $25,000.00, but less than
$50,000.01 may be awarded by the procurement director, or someone designated by
the procurement director, after telephone, oral, facsimile, or written (letter
or e-mail) quotations have been received from at least three vendors or
suppliers of such goods and services, when practicable and feasible, and the
purchase order has been approved by the county manager or procurement director.
      (4)   Single purchase orders of $50,000.01 or more shall be publicly
advertised for bids (Invitation for Bids) or proposals (Request for Proposals
or Request for Qualifications) at least once in a newspaper having a general
circulation in the county, at least 15 days prior to the date set for formal
opening of written bids or proposals.
         (a)   Bids or proposal responses provided in writing, based on written
specifications furnished to prospective vendors, shall be received and publicly
opened by the procurement director and the head of the department requiring the
goods and services, at a date and hour to be specified in the advertisement for
the solicitation.
         (b)   The County Council shall award the contract for the furnishing
of such goods and services to the vendor or supplier of such goods and services
submitting the bid, proposal or response, which is determined most advantageous
to the county.
         (c)   Nothing contained in these procedures shall be construed to
require the county manager, procurement director or County Council to accept
the apparent low bid, when it shall appear that the acceptance of some other
bid shall be most advantageous to, or in the best interest of, the county.
      (5)   In the event that the bid or proposal selected as most advantageous
is not the low bid (or least expensive proposal), the procurement director or
department head, at the direction of the County Council, shall prepare a full
and complete statement of the reasons for recommending that the Council accept
the bid or award a contract to the vendor or supplier of goods and services
other than the apparent low bidder or least expensive proposer. Information
provided by the procurement director or department head shall be included in
the minutes of the Council meeting at which final selection and approval is

         (a)   Purchases not exceeding $10,500.00 per transaction, may be
accomplished without securing competitive quotations if the prices are
considered to be fair and reasonable. Action to obtain competitive quotations
need only be taken when the procurement director suspects the price may not be
fair and reasonable, e.g., comparison to previous price paid, personal
knowledge of the price range of the item involved. Multiple quotes are not
required, but recommended. Every effort should be made to distribute such
purchases equitably among qualified suppliers.
         (b)   In some instances, a county issued purchasing (“P”) card may be
used to procure items totaling $3,000.00 or less per transaction, as herein
described.
         (c)   Single purchase orders exceeding $10,500.00 but less than
$25,000.01 may be awarded by the procurement director, or someone designated by
the procurement director, to the vendor or supplier of such goods or services
whose quotation is most advantageous to the county, after the county has
received telephone, oral, or fax or written (letter or e-mail) quotations from
at least two vendors or suppliers of such goods or services, when practicable
and feasible.
         (d)   Single purchase orders exceeding $25,000.00 but less than
$50,000.01 may be awarded by the procurement director, or someone designated by
the procurement director, after telephone, oral, facsimile, or written (letter
or e-mail) quotations have been received from at least three vendors or
suppliers of such goods and services, when practicable and feasible, and the
purchase order has been approved by the county manager or procurement director.
         (e)   Single purchase orders of $50,000.01 or more shall be publicly
advertised for bids (Invitation for Bids) or proposals (Request for Proposals
or Request for Qualifications) at least once in a newspaper having a general
circulation in the county, at least 15 days prior to the date set for formal
opening of written bids or proposals.
   (C)   Cooperative purchasing.
      (1)   COOPERATIVE PURCHASING is a procurement activity conducted by, or
on behalf of, more than one public entity, where the aggregation of volumes by
more than one buyer achieves better pricing, administrative savings, or broader
delivery and installation options.
      (2)   Depending upon the commodity or services being sought, the
procurement director may pursue cooperative purchasing arrangements with the
advice and approval of county management and the County Council.
   (D)   Improper or unauthorized purchases.

accordance with the policies provided within this subchapter may be considered
improper or unauthorized purchases.
      (3)   Purchases made in violation of the current county purchasing
policies or rules established by the County Council may be considered improper
or unauthorized purchases.
      (4)   Any attempt or intent to circumvent this subchapter shall be
considered improper or unauthorized.
      (5)   Purchases made for the purpose of retirement parties, food for
birthdays, Thanksgiving and Christmas gatherings, plaques, or gifts, unless
otherwise approved by the county manager, may be considered improper or
unauthorized purchases.
   (E)   Reimbursement for purchases.
      (1)   In such instances, county employees will be permitted to seek
reimbursement for this purchase by submitting the appropriate documentation and
request to the county's finance office.
      (2)   Under no circumstances is this type of purchasing intended to
replace the procedures provided in this subchapter requiring the submission of
a purchase requisition and the procurement activities of the county's
procurement department.
   (F)   Purchase requisition.
      (1)   In most instances, county officers, employees, agencies and
departments subject to the financial authority of the County Council will be
required to submit a requisition to the procurement department for purchase of
supplies, equipment, materials and services.
      (2)   Before submission, all requisitions should be signed and approved
by the department head or supervisory official of the office, agency, board or
department.
      (3)   The requisition serves to inform the procurement department of the
needs of the using department, and also to correctly define the goods and/or
services that are being requested.
      (4)   An approved requisition signifies authority to charge against a
specific budget account number(s), and to verify that there are sufficient
funds available in the account specified.
      (5)   A requisition is not an order; rather, it is a request that begins
the procurement process.
   (G)   Adequate funds to purchase.
      (1)   In order for services, supplies, equipment or materials to be
purchased, there must be adequate funds available in the appropriate budget
account, which has previously been appropriated by the County Council and is
unencumbered.
      (2)   No purchases can be made without verification that adequate funds
are present in the appropriate budget account.
      (3)   Expenditures (purchases) cannot exceed the allocated budgeted
amount without proper administrative approvals.
      (4)   Departments and agencies making use of procurement services
provided by the procurement department are responsible for ensuring that
approved and adequate funds are available to cover the full cost of a given
purchase.
   (H)   Types of purchase orders.
      (1)   A purchase order provides the documentation of procurement
activity, including a means for encumbering all funds pledged towards a given
purchase.
      (2)   The procurement department utilizes four types of purchase orders
designed for specific situations: basic, blanket, open, and partial payment.
         (a)   Basic purchase orders.
            1.   All purchase orders are created primarily from the information
provided on a purchase requisition.
            2.   Requisitions should include an order date, description of the
product(s) or services, quantity information, budget account numbers, pricing
information, payment terms, and delivery information.
            3.   A purchase order is a legally binding contract, which
authorizes the vendor to ship and invoice for the materials and/or services
specified.
            4.   Only the procurement department is authorized to issue
purchase orders, and only the procurement director, county manager or their
designee is authorized to sign and approve purchase orders.
         (b)   Blanket purchase orders.
            1.   The intent of a blanket purchase order is to reduce
administrative costs associated with routinely creating small purchase orders.
            2.   A blanket purchase order number is issued to suppliers who can
furnish goods and services, based upon prearranged conditions on a demand-type
basis, typically for a maximum dollar limit or for a limited period of time.
            3.   No payments are deducted from the line item listed on a
blanket purchase order, nor is the total value of the purchase order encumbered
on a blanket purchase order until the county's finance department receives an
invoice.
            4.   A blanket purchase order is not transferable from one fiscal
year to the next.
         (c)   Open purchase orders.
            1.   Open purchase orders are similar to blanket purchase orders,
except they have a specific dollar amount assigned to them, and funds are
encumbered when the purchase order is created.
            2.   Open purchase orders are used for work services provided by a
contract, such as maintenance of county-owned equipment, uniform rental or
waste removal at county buildings.
            3.   An open purchase order is not transferable from one fiscal
year to the next.
         (d)   Partial payment purchase orders.
            1.   Partial payment purchase orders have a specific amount of
money assigned to them.
            2.   Funds referenced on a partial payment purchase order are
encumbered.
            3.   Usually, a partial payment purchase order is used for
construction and/or consulting projects.
   (I)   Receipt of purchased items.
      (1)   Shipments of supplies, materials and equipment will be coordinated
by the procurement department.
      (2)   In some cases, partial shipments may arrive in lieu of the complete
order.
      (3)   In most cases, deliveries will be made to the purchasing offices.
      (4)   In some cases, a payment may be requested for the items that have
been delivered.
   (J)   Cancellation of orders.
      (1)   All cancellations of orders shall be made by the procurement
department.
      (2)   An order may be canceled due to an unexpected price increase,
inability of the vendor to supply, or an unacceptable delay in delivery.
   (K)   Changes to an order/updating purchase orders.
      (1)   Sometimes a purchase order requires updating because of a price
change, partial payment request, freight charge, undetermined expense, or the
deletion or addition of a commodity.
      (2)   Only the procurement department can alter a purchase order.
      (3)   An updated purchase order must be approved by the procurement
director, and documentation explaining the change must be attached to the
revised purchase order.

      (6)   Payment and performance bonds.
         (a)   Before entering into a contract, the procurement director may
require a faithful payment and performance bond, written by a corporate surety
company holding a certificate of authority from the Secretary of the Treasury
of the United States as acceptable sureties on federal bonds, and executed and
issued by a resident agent licensed by and having an office in the state,
representing such a corporate surety in such amount equal to the contract
amount or an amount as is reasonably necessary to protect the best interests of
the county.
         (b)   The payment provision shall assure that the contractor provides
suitable evidence of his or her financial condition, to protect the interests
of claimants supplying labor and/or materials to the contractor or his or her
subcontractors.
         (c)   The performance provision shall assure that the contractor
provides suitable evidence of his or her financial condition and his or her
ability to complete the work without financial difficulty.
         (d)   1.   In place of a bond, cash or certified check in the amount
of the contract may be deposited.
            2.   Such deposit will be filed with the executed contract
documents and made a part thereof, all within 30 days from date of awarding a
contract.
         (e)   Failure of the contractor to satisfactorily fulfill his or her
obligations shall be cause for the forfeiture of his or her guaranty.
            1.   In such a case, the procurement director shall document the
circumstances and file such document with the related contract documents.
            2.   This provision shall not apply to procurement involving
completion of reports, studies, plans, and the like, such as the county audit.
         (f)   A performance bond shall always be required on construction
projects that exceed $50,000.00.
      (7)   Liquidated damages. Liquidated damages may be provided in an amount
specified under a contract, in a sum certain to be awarded to the county if a
contractor fails to perform as agreed.
      (8)   Time of receipt.
         (a)   It is each bidder's responsibility to see that his or her bid is
delivered at the time and place specified.
         (b)   1.   The procurement department must receive bids no later than
the time and date identified in the Invitation for Bids.
            2.   Bids received after this date or time will not be considered
and will be marked as a “Late Bid”.
         (c)   All bid responses received prior to the time of opening shall be
date stamped by the purchasing staff and kept in a secure location.
         (d)   Unidentified bids may be opened solely for the purpose of
identification, then properly marked, re-sealed and secured in the bid box.
         (e)   1.   Faxed, computer-generated, or electronically mailed bids
are not acceptable.
            2.   Only original bids, signed by an officer of the bidding firm
on an official bid submittal form provided by the county in the Invitation for
Bids, will be accepted.
      (9)   Pre-bid conferences.
         (a)   1.   Some bids may require a pre-bid conference to be held with
interested bidders.
            2.   These meetings may be held in order to clarify specifications,
answer supplier questions regarding specific bid requirements, or to allow the
bidder to perform an on-site review and inspection.
         (b)   Some pre-bid conferences may be mandatory (where all interested
parties must send a representative in order to be considered responsive) and
others may be voluntary.
         (c)   Any changes to the original solicitation documents will be made
in writing in the form of addenda, and will be mailed, faxed or e-mailed to all
bidders known to have originally received or requested the solicitation.
         (d)   In the event an act of God occurs, the county reserves the right
to accept late or non-attendance at pre-bid conferences.
      (10)   Pre-qualification of suppliers, bidders, proposers.
         (a)   Prospective suppliers, bidders or proposers may be pre-qualified
by the procurement director for particular types of supplies, equipment,
services and construction.
         (b)   Solicitation mailing lists of potential vendors or contractors
shall include, but shall not be limited to, such pre-qualified suppliers,
bidders or proposers; unless it has been determined in writing that a specific
project warrants limitation of offerers to the pre-qualified list, and public
notice of the pre-qualification is given.
         (c)   Vendors may also be asked to respond to an Invitation or a
Request and offer a “fixed price” or “fixed proposal” for a given product or
service.
            1.   In that instance, the county may elect to pre-select a number
of responding vendors to provide the specified product(s) or service(s) (e.g.,
property assessment services used when the county acquires rights-of-way).
            2.   The establishment of a source or sources to be used at a later
lime for the fixed price can provide the county with cost and scheduling
benefits.
            3.   Being placed on a pre-selection listing does not guarantee
that a specific vendor will be used in the future.
      (11)   Bid opening procedure.
         (a)   Unless otherwise specified, bids are opened at the time and
place specified in the Invitation for Bids.
         (b)   At the announced time of bid opening, the procurement director

announcement postponing a bid opening, when there is due cause beyond the
county's control such as inclement weather, fire, power failure, county
emergency, or other cause necessitating such a postponement.
      (13)   Bid acceptance, evaluation, and recommendation.
         (a)   Bids shall be unconditionally accepted without alteration or
correction, except as authorized in this subchapter.
         (b)   1.   Bids shall be evaluated based upon the requirements set
forth in the Invitation for Bids, which may include criteria to determine
suitability for a particular purpose.
            2.   Those criteria that will affect the bid price and be
considered in evaluation for award may include transportation costs, and total
or life cycle costs.
         (c)   Alternative bids may be considered and accepted, provided they
are specifically provided for in the Invitation for Bids and meet the
evaluation criteria specified.
         (d)   All bids accepted will be evaluated using the criteria specified
by the using department.
            1.   In cooperation with the department head or a representative of
the using department and the procurement director, a written recommendation for

period than required by the bid information or this rule.
      (14)   Waiver of technicality.
         (a)   A bid shall be considered responsive only if it substantially
conforms to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids as it relates to
pricing, performance, specifications, delivery requirements, and any other
matter unequivocally stated therein as a determinant of responsiveness.
         (b)   1.   A minor or non-substantive lack of conformity on these
matters may be considered a technicality or irregularity, which may be waived
by the official(s) empowered to make an award.
            2.   A MINOR INFORMALITY or TECHNICAL IRREGULARITY is a variation
from the bid or proposal that does not affect the price of the bid.
      (15)   Correction, cancellation or withdrawal of a bid.

promptness, by written notice to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder,
whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth in the Invitations for
Bids, or to that bidder who offers the bid considered most advantageous to the
county.
            2.   Nothing contained in this subchapter shall be construed to
require the procurement director, county manager or County Council to accept
the apparent low bid, when it appears that the acceptance of some other bid
shall be most advantageous to the county and in the best interest of county
government.
         (b)   In determining the lowest responsive and responsible bidder most
advantageous to the county, in addition to price, the following shall be
considered:
            1.   The ability, capacity and skill of the bidder to perform the
contract.
            2.   Whether the bidder can perform the contract within the time
specified, without delay or interference.
            3.   The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and
efficiency of the bidder.
            4.   The quality of performance on previous contracts.

testing, quality, workmanship, delivery and suitability for a particular
purpose.
         (d)   The county manager or procurement director shall have the
authority to make awards of bids that are less than the mandatory bid amount.
            1.   Upon presentation and recommendation by the county manager of
a selected bid, the County Council shall authorize and approve, by a simple
majority vote, the bid award in excess of the mandatory bid amount set forth in
the RFP.
            2.   The contract file shall contain the basis on which the award
is made.
         (e)   1.   Bid threshold amounts shall include the values associated
with potential options of renewal, provided those options were both requested
within the original solicitation and provided by the responder.
            2.   After review of past performance under contract, the
procurement director, county manager or County Council may determine, at their
discretion, to exercise the option of renewal if in the best interest of the
county.
      (17)   Tie bids. The County Council may consider awarding a tie bid,
based upon the following:
         (a)   The bidder who is the most capable in honoring the county's
desired completion or delivery time.
         (b)   The bidder whose service availability, quality of service,
managerial and organizational support appear to be the most advantageous to the
county.
         (c)   The bidder who is in closest proximity and/or is the most
convenient to the county.
      (18)   Single bid responses.
         (a)   Even though multiple sources have been solicited, there are
occasions when only one bid response is received.
         (b)   When this happens, the procurement director may contact the non-
responsive vendors to establish why there was a lack of response, and to
determine whether to recommend an award or to reject the lone bid and re-bid.
         (c)   If only one bid has been submitted, the procurement director
will determine whether to open the bid or return the bid to the bidder via
certified mail and re-issue the bid notice or use a different method to make
the procurement.
      (19)   Rejection of bids.
         (a)   Every effort will be made to anticipate changes in requirements
prior to the date of opening, and to notify all prospective bidders of any
resulting modifications through an addendum.
         (b)   If for some reason it is found that the specifications have been
misconstrued, misleading or ambiguous, and have caused confusion in bidder
pricing, the procurement director may ask the County Council to reject all
bids, then revise the specifications, publicly advertise and re-bid.
         (c)   If the low bid is under $50.000.01, the procurement director or
county manager shall have the authority to reject all bids without seeking the
County Council's approval.

         (a)   In most cases, an authorized vendor representative is required
to sign his or her name in ink on the provided space of the bid document.

determine if an unsigned bid was an oversight, and to take appropriate measures
to validate or reject the bid response.

criteria, wherein the RFP shall state the relative importance of price and
other evaluation factors.
      (2)   Conditions for use.
         (a)   Competitive sealed proposals furnished as a result of a Request
for Proposals shall be used in those circumstances in which it is both
practicable and advantageous for the county to consider a range of competing
plans, specifications, standards, terms and conditions or solutions to problems
or needs, so that adequate competition will result and award will be made not
principally on the basis of price, but to the respondent whose proposal
contains the most advantageous combinations of price, quality or other
features.
         (b)   When the complex nature of technical details of a particular
procurement make the use of competitive sealed bidding either not practicable
or reasonable, or not advantageous to the county, or when qualifications and
the quality of the service to be delivered can be considered more important
than price, a Request for Proposals may be used.
      (3)   Public notice. Public notice of the Request for Proposals shall be
given in the same manner as an Invitation for Bid.
      (4)   Pre-proposal conferences.
         (a)   As with Invitations for Bids, some Requests for Proposals may
require a pre-proposal meeting to be held with interested responders.

of the proposed procurement, clarify specifications, answer supplier questions
regarding specific bid requirements, or to allow the vendor to perform an on-
site review and inspection.
         (c)   Some pre-proposal conferences may be mandatory (where all
interested parties must send a representative in order to be considered
responsive) and others may be voluntary. In the event an act of God occurs, the
county reserves the right to accept late or non-attendance at a pre-proposal
conference.
         (d)   Any changes to the original solicitation documents will be made
in writing in the form of addenda, and will be mailed, faxed or e-mailed to all

may elect to continue with the evaluation of that response, or recommend that
the County Council reject all proposals, whichever is in the best interests of
the county.
         (d)   Price, experience, professionalism, business qualifications,
completion time and expertise are all pertinent evaluation factors that may
weighed by a staff preselected evaluation team.
            1.   Proposals may be sought on a PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION BASIS,
where a respondent is offering to provide a service or solve a problem, and
where the specification sets forth a predefined criteria or objective to be
met.
            2.   An evaluation of competitive proposal responses of this type
will typically be based upon the “best value” or return as opposed to total
cost or price.
         (e)   Alternative proposal options may be considered and accepted,
provided they are specifically provided for in the RFP and meet the evaluation
criteria specified.
         (f)   1.   As provided for in the Request for Proposals, discussions
may be conducted with responsible offerors who submit proposals for the purpose
of clarification, to assure full understanding of, and responsiveness to, the
solicitation requirements.
            2.   Offerors shall be accorded fair and equal treatment with
respect to any opportunity for submissions.
         (g)   All RFP responses accepted will be evaluated using the criteria
the using department specified in the solicitation document.

architects, project managers, engineers, land surveying, and auditing services.
         (c)   When the complex nature of technical details of a particular

procurement director, county manager or County Council may determine, at their
discretion, whether the exercise of the option of renewal is in the best
interest of the county.
   (F)   Approved contracting relationship formats.
      (1)   The procurement director, with approval of the county manager,
shall have the discretion to use construction management services, design-build
services, or design-bid-build services as alternatives for construction
contracting administration. In exercising such discretion, the county manager
shall consider the method that, at the procurement director's discretion, is
the most advantageous to the county and will result in the most timely,
economical, and successful completion of the construction project. The
determination of the method of source selection utilized shall be stated in
writing and included as part of the solicitation file. However, nothing
ultimately prohibits York County from rejecting all responses to a solicitation
for services.
      (2)   The following relationship formats may be used in any contract or
agreement for construction projects or tasks.
         (a)   DESIGN-BID-BUILD. A project delivery method that includes three
linear phases for completing a construction project - engineering and/or
architectural design, bidding, and construction. As part of the DESIGN-BID-
BUILD project delivery method, the county awards two separate contracts  - the
first for architectural and or engineering design and bid phase services, and
the second for construction according to the design. Under this project
delivery approach, the architect/engineer is selected through a qualification-
based or competitive best value bidding approach, and the contractor is
selected through competitive sealed bidding. This type of construction contract
relationship format is one in which one contractor contracts with York County
to accomplish an entire construction project or task pursuant to specifications
or designs provided by the county, pursuant to the specifications or designs
produced for the county by an architectural firm under contract with the
county.
         (b)   DESIGN-BUILD. The DESIGN-BUILD type of construction contract
relationship format is one in which one contractor supplies all of the work
involved in the project, including the design. York County provides the
performance specifications and the contractor designs and constructs the
project consistent with those performance specifications. In a DESIGN-BUILD
type of contract relationship format, the contractor may even provide the site
as part of the construction contract.
         (c)   CONSTRUCTION MANAGER. Under a CONSTRUCTION MANAGER type of
construction contract relationship format, York County contracts with an
individual or entity to serve as its agent in managing the construction process
on behalf of its interests throughout the construction project. There are two
types of relationship formats - one is a pure agency relationship, and the
other is a relationship in which the construction manager is “at risk.”
            1.   Types of construction manager relationships.
               a.   PURE AGENCY. Under a PURE AGENCY arrangement, the
construction manager acts only as the agent of the owner. In this arrangement,
the only contractual relationship the construction manager has is with York
County. While the pure agency construction manager administers the construction
project throughout the planning, design, and actual construction phases of the
project, the construction manager is not responsible for the means and methods
of the project and does not guarantee that the project will meet the
expectations of the county in terms of cost, timeliness, and quality.
               b.   AT RISK. Under an AT RISK relationship, the construction
manager provides advice and leadership on a project during the planning and
design phases of the project and has control, under the direction of the
county, during the construction phase. While the county will generally contract
separately for the design portion of the project, the at risk construction
manager will contract with the construction trade contractors. Because the at
risk construction manager has control over the means and methods of
construction portion of the project, the at risk manager will be responsible
for the completion of the project consistent with the expectations of the
county in terms of cost, timeliness, and quality.
            2.   Duties of construction managers.
               a.   Procurement process. Whether the relationship formed with

         (u)   Purchases utilizing gifts, grants, or certain special funds that
may be the result of designated appropriations of the County Council (e.g.,
operating funds for the county's library system or Culture and Heritage
Commission) or unique funds entirely controlled by an elected official (e.g.,
Sheriff's Drug Funds). Purchases utilizing such funds will not be based upon
the procedures and policies contained within this subchapter, when there are
other organizational controls (or officials) in place for the management and
expenditure of these special funds;
         (v)   Certain funds received from the United States Department of
Homeland Security, which may be designated to be utilized in a specific
capacity;
         (w)   Purchases for information technology equipment in cases where

in the company or technology (e.g., purchase of additional modules for the
county's public safety software or additional modules are available for City
Works, the county's work order software utilized by multiple York County
departments). Also in cases where specific technology hardware has been
purchased, the county has made a substantial investment, and additional
hardware components are required (e.g., additional storage for the county's
storage area network, or additional/replacement batteries for the existing
uninterrupted power supply in the data center). In case of extreme emergency,
purchases for information technology equipment where such delays may seriously
affect the health, welfare, safety of the citizens of the county and/or
potentially halt county services, an authorized purchase where funding has been
appropriated must be approved by the county manager, procurement director and
the Chairman of the County Council;
         (x)   Financial advisors and services;
         (y)   Mental health wellness services, including but not limited to
medically related services and counseling.
      (2)   Purchases unsuitable for competitive bidding. Some purchases, by
their very nature, are not suitable or practicable for seeking competitive
pricing, such as acquisition of real property, certain emergency purchases or
repairs, unique or one-of-a-kind items only available from a single source,
purchases for repair or additions to existing equipment or systems already in
service, and certain products offered by vendors protected by established
industry distribution rights or territory rights.
      (3)   Emergency purchases.
         (a)   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subchapter, the
county manager or the procurement director may make or authorize, subject in
certain circumstances to the approval of the County Council, emergency
procurements of supplies, services or construction items, when there exists a
threat to the functioning of county government; such as the need to meet
certain deadlines established by courts or other parties outside the control of
the county; the preservation or protection of property; or the health, welfare
or safety of any person; provided such emergency procurements shall be made
with such competition as soon as is practicable under these circumstances.
         (b)   A written determination of the basis for the emergency and for
the selection of the particular contractor shall be made, and shall set forth
the contractor's name, amount, and a listing of the item(s) procured under the
contract.
         (c)   In case of an emergency, the county manager or procurement
director shall have the authority to waive the competitive procurement process,
and authorize the purchase of supplies and services up to $50,000.00 in value,
to prevent significant delays in the work of any using department, where such
delays may seriously affect the health, welfare or safety of the citizens of
the county.
            1.   Emergency purchases of greater value shall require the prior
approval of the County Council.
            2.   Only in cases of an emergency shall an exception to the
purchasing policy be made, with the understanding that the person authorized to
obtain the emergency purchase will personally assume the responsibility of
immediately following up the verbal order with proper justification in written
form, and the proper requisition to the procurement director.
            3.   In cases of emergency, the requestor shall, when possible,
contact the procurement director prior to placement of the order with the
vendor.
      (4)   Sole source, brand name, patented, and other non-competitive
procurement.
         (a)   A contract to purchase may be awarded without competition with
the approval of County Council, when it is determined, after conducting a good
faith effort by reviewing available sources, that the purchase, by its very
nature, is not suitable to seeking competitive bids or proposals, or affords
the county some unique beneficial or economically advantageous service,
commodity, and/or property to the county or its economic development pursuits.
         (b)   When county officials determine that an award of contract for
purchasing should be made by non-competitive means, they should submit copies
of the determining factors in writing to the procurement director.
         (c)   Examples of contracts, which may not be suitable for competitive
bids or proposals, may include the following:
            1.   The product has patented or proprietary rights that provide
superior capabilities unobtainable from similar products, and is not marketed
through other wholesalers, jobbers or distributors whose competition could be
encouraged.
            2.   When the county requires supplies, materials or equipment
produced by only one manufacturer, the procurement director shall specify such
manufacturer's make or brand in the Invitations to Bid, and shall obtain
competitive bids from authorized dealers or distributors of such manufacturer.
            3.   If such manufacturer is the sole bidder and/or the sole source
of supply, the procurement director is authorized to negotiate an open market
order or contract with the manufacturer, for pricing and terms that are the
most advantageous to the county.
            4.   When the county requires supplies, materials or equipment that
are patented or proprietary, but are obtainable from two or more equally
satisfactory and/or competitive makes, brands or types, the acceptable and
competitive makes, brands or types shall be noted in the bid invitation.
            5.   Specifications may refer to one or more brand name products
followed by the words “or equal.”
               a.   The burden of proof that the product is equal for the
intended use is on the bidder.
               b.   When any bidder offers an alternate item for consideration,
the bidder will complete specifications, name the brand and demonstrate that
the alternate is equal.
               c.   It shall be incumbent on each bidder to prove to the
satisfaction of the county that the alternate is equal, in quality or
performance, to the commodities listed in the Invitation For Bids.
            6.   There is a lack of competition for a product or service.
            7.   It is a unique, one-of-a-kind service offer, or a unique offer
that supports a beneficial or economically advantageous service, commodity,
and/or property to the county and/or its economic development pursuits.
            8.   Where the items are needed for trial use or testing.

§ 35.010 CONTRACTS.
   (A)   General provisions.
      (1)   In general terms, a CONTRACT refers to all types of legally binding
agreements, regardless of what they may be called, for the procurement or
disposal of supplies, materials, equipment and services or construction.
         (a)   All contracts for the procurement of supplies, materials,
equipment and services shall be subject to the availability and the annual
appropriation of sufficient funds by the County Council.
         (b)   When funds are not appropriated or otherwise made available to
support continuation of performance in a subsequent fiscal period, a contract
may be considered canceled.
      (2)   (a)   Subject to the limitations of this section, any type of
contract appropriate to the procurement, and which will promote the best
interest of the county, may be used; provided the use of a cost-plus-a-
percentage-of-cost contract is prohibited.
         (b)   A cost reimbursement contract may be used only when a
determination is made in writing that such contract is likely to be less costly
to the county than any other type, or that it is impractical to obtain the
supply, service, or construction item required except under such a contract.
      (3)   (a)   All contracts will be drafted, negotiated or approved by the
county attorney as to form, content and legality.
         (b)   Provisions that may appear within a contract with the county
include, but are not limited to: assumption of risk by successful bidder,
proposer or responder; indemnification by successful bidder, proposer or
responder; non-assignment; provision requiring mandatory mediation prior to
initiation of legal action; termination provision; and clause indicating
contract to be governed by state laws.
      (4)   (a)   All contracts whose total value is in excess of the mandatory
bid limit will be signed by the chairman of the County Council, or in the
appropriate case, the chairman's designee, and receive attestation by the
county manager.
         (b)   The county manager or procurement director is authorized to
approve and execute contracts whose total value does not exceed the mandatory
bid amount. Contracts not involving bid amounts, or involving de-minimis
amounts, such as non-reimbursable utility agreements, other county utility
agreements, NPDES permits, encroachment permits, and permits to construct are
expressly authorized to be executed by the county manager or his or her
designee.
   (B)   Fixed-price or specified-period contracts.
      (1)   Fixed-price contracts.
         (a)   Fixed-price contracts shall ordinarily be used for those
purchases of goods and services or sales and leases where the terms,
conditions, specifications and other factors of the contract can be specified
with a high degree of certainty, and where use of a fixed-price contract will
result in substantial competition between bidders or offerors willing to
compete for the contract.
         (b)   Escalation clauses or other economic adjustments may be included
as appropriate to serve the best interests of the county in achieving the most
economical contract performance.
      (2)   Specified-period contracts. Specified-period contracts may be used
for the procurement of supplies or services, and may be entered into for a
specific period of time that does not exceed a total of three years, with
renewal options that may be requested for up to two additional years; provided
the terms of the contract, and the conditions of renewal or extension, if any,
were included during solicitation; and funds are available for the first fiscal
period at the time of contracting.
   (C)   Multi-term contracts.
      (1)   A contract for supplies or services may be entered into for
renewable periods of time, or until completion of the project(s) described in
the original solicitation, whichever is later, not to exceed a total of three
years, with renewal options that may be requested for up to two additional
years; provided the terms of the contract, and the conditions of renewal or
extension, if any, are included in the solicitation; and funds are available
for the first fiscal period at the time of contracting.
      (2)   (a)   Payment and performance obligations of the county for each
succeeding fiscal period shall be subject to the availability and appropriation
of funds therefor.
         (b)   All multi-term contracts shall contain a clause stating that,
when funds are not appropriated or otherwise made available to support
continuation of performance in a subsequent fiscal period, the contract shall
be canceled.
      (3)   Prior to the utilization of a multi-term contract, it shall be
determined in writing by the procurement director and/or the county manager
that estimated requirements cover the period of the contract and are reasonably
firm and continuing; and that such a contract will serve the best interests of
the county by encouraging effective competition or otherwise promoting
economies in county procurement.
      (4)   Certain bids may be solicited and contracts issued with renewal
clauses to bind the contractor to a renewal period at the sole option of the
county.
         (a)   In such cases, bidders will be asked to bid a firm price to be
applicable during the renewal period.
         (b)   If the county chooses to renew, or in the alternative, to bid
prices geared to pertinent commodity price indexes to be applicable in renewal
periods, if the county chooses to renew.
         (c)   In all cases where the renewal option is involved, the bid
information will state that the county reserves the right to renew the
contract, if awarded, in accord with prices (firm or geared to pertinent price
indexes) included in bids received, and that renewal on such terms is at its
sole option.
         (d)   No contract may be issued for periods exceeding one year.
         (e)   However, the renewal option may be requested for up to two
additional years.
   (D)   State contracts.
      (1)   The state has established a system of competitive procurement for a
number of services, supplies, equipment and materials needed for the operation
and maintenance of state government and the services it provides.
      (2)   Provision has been made within the state's procurement system rules
and procedures for units of local government to also procure certain services,
supplies, equipment and materials acquired through competitive contracts, which
have been negotiated and established by the state.
      (3)   County procurement from contracts negotiated and established by the
state may be determined to be in the best interest of the county and therefore
use of the state contract by the county will be authorized; however, such
authorization does not otherwise relieve county officials from any of the other
procedures or policies contained in this subchapter.
   (E)   Construction contracts.
      (1)   (a)   Construction contracts provide an agreement for the building,
repair, alteration, improvement, installation, or demolition of any public
improvement of any kind on public real property.

compensation.
      (2)   All contracts for construction shall be awarded based upon
competitive sealed bidding described elsewhere in this subchapter.
         (a)   Amendments or change orders to construction contracts, which do

the previously approved project budget, may be approved by the county manager,
or by the employee designated in the construction contract with authority to
approve such amendments or change orders.
         (b)   Every contract modification, change order, or contract price
adjustment under a construction contract with the county of $50,000.01 or
greater, shall be subject to prior approval by the County Council.
         (c)   Written justification shall be prepared and added to the project
file for all change orders in excess of 2% of the total original bid or
contract price.
         (d)   The county manager, procurement director or designated employee
assigned to represent the county in the construction project may approve such
modifications, change orders, or adjustments less than $50,000.01; provided the
additional cost has been included in the overall budget for the project that
was approved by the County Council.
   (F)   Renewal and cancellation of contracts.
      (1)   The procurement director shall have the authority to cancel
contracts under $50,000.01, when the vendor is found to have violated, or
attempted to violate, the provisions of this subchapter.
      (2)   The procurement director shall also have the authority to cancel
contracts under $50,000.01 in any of the following instances:
         (a)   If the vendor fails to make delivery within the specified time.
         (b)   If the vendor fails to provide service when service is part of
the contract.
         (c)   If the supplies, materials or equipment are inferior to the
specifications.
         (d)   If the vendor agrees to cancel.
         (e)   If the contract is fraudulent, and conspiracy or conflict of
interest is detected.

      (3)   In each of the foregoing instances, the procurement director shall
award the contract to the next responsive bidder.
   (G)   Leases.
      (1)   Prior to execution, all leases resulting from actions of the
procurement department to procure supplies, materials, equipment and services
shall be reviewed and approved for form and content by the county attorney.
         (a)   Procurement decisions resulting in leasing arrangements must
follow the specific procedures established in this subchapter for competitive
solicitation based upon the total amount of the lease cost.
         (b)   The procurement director shall be authorized to approve leases
involving procured services, supplies, materials and equipment for which the
total cost of the lease is less than the mandatory bid amount.
         (c)   Upon recommendation by the procurement director or department
head, the County Council must approve all leasing arrangements in excess of the
mandatory bid amount.
         (d)   Threshold amounts referenced herein shall include the values
associated with potential options of renewal; provided those options were both
requested and part of the original solicitation; and provided, after review of
past performance under contract, the procurement director, county manager or
County Council may determine, at their discretion, that exercise of the option
of renewal is in the best interest of the county.
      (2)   A lease may be entered into; provided all conditions for renewal
and costs of termination are set forth in the lease, and the lease is not used
to circumvent normal procurement procedures.
      (3)   A purchase option in a lease may be exercised only if the lease
containing the purchase option was awarded under competitive sealed bidding, or
competitive sealed proposal, or the leased supply or equipment is the only
supply or equipment that can meet the county's requirements, as determined, in
writing, by the department head of the requesting department and the
procurement director.
      (4)   (a)   When a contract is to contain an option for renewal,
extension or purchase, notice of such provision shall be included in the
solicitation.
         (b)   Exercise of such an option is always at the county's discretion
only, and not subject to agreement or acceptance by the contractor.
      (5)   Terms and conditions.

rental or lease of personal property, or for the acquisition of services by an
independent contractor, to exceed a term of three years, with the option to
renew for an additional two years.

procurement director finds that a term longer than three years is required in
order to promote efficiency and economy, or for other reasons that a three-year
term is otherwise impractical.

§ 35.011 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Certificates of insurance.
      (1)   (a)   A CERTIFICATE OF INSURANCE is a standard insurance industry
document issued by an insurer, which demonstrates that an insurance policy
exists and provides additional insurance information that is important in
holding a vendor accountable.
         (b)   By obtaining an appropriate certificate of insurance form from
the vendor, the county is able to verify that specific insurance coverages and
protections are in place, and will legally transfer the risks associated with
the business relationship with a vendor from the county to a third party
insurer.
      (2)   Vendors shall provide proof of coverage on a prepared form that
verifies that they are covered against loss or damages by a reputable insurance
company authorized to do business in the state.
      (3)   The county's goal in requiring certificates of insurance is to
protect the county from all loss or exposure resulting from negligence on the
part of an uninsured or underinsured vendor that furnishes the county with
materials, equipment, supplies or services.
      (4)   The procurement department is assigned responsibility for making
sure all vendors doing business with the county provide adequate proof of their
insurance coverages prior to any procurement activity. If a vendor cannot
provide proof of insurance, the procurement department shall require the
execution of an indemnity form from vendor prior to any procurement activity.
Upon the procurement department obtaining proof of insurance or indemnity
forms, the procurement department shall catalogue those filings in its
software; and, thereafter, convey copies of the forms for retention and audit
purposes.
      (5)   In cooperation with the county's risk management department and the
county attorney, purchasing staff also continually review potential contracts
for purchase or services to make sure appropriate coverages are in place.
      (6)   (a)   As a general rule, for most contracts entered into by the
county, vendors are required to furnish proof of workers compensation and
employer's liability (statutory limits), general liability and automobile
liability.
         (b)   For certain “high risk” contracts, where it could be assumed the
county's exposure may exceed the minimum insurance limits, higher limits of
coverage or additional specialized coverages (such as professional liability,
medical liability or an umbrella liability policy) are required before the
county can conduct business with that vendor.
      (7)   All vendors doing business with the county will be advised that
their contract to do business with the county can be terminated if that vendor
fails to maintain and keep in place any required insurance coverage(s).
      (8)   When practicable, all county contracts shall include hold harmless
and indemnification language to protect the county from negligence or fault of
the vendor or contractor.
   (B)   Inspection of plant and audit of records.
      (1)   Right to inspect plant. The county may, at reasonable times,
inspect the part of the plant or place of business of a contractor or any
subcontractor related to the performance of any contract awarded or to be
awarded by the county.
      (2)   Right to audit records.
         (a)   The county may, at reasonable times and places, audit the books
and records of any person who has submitted cost or pricing data to the extent
that such books and records relate to such cost or pricing data.
         (b)   Any person who receives a contract, change order, or contract
modification for which cost or pricing data is required, shall maintain such
books and records that relate to such cost or pricing data for three years from
the date of final payment under the contract, unless a shorter period is
otherwise authorized in writing.
   (C)   Controversy arising from the bid process.
      (1)   Disclaimers.
         (a)   An Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, or a Request
for Qualifications does not bestow a property interest in, or beneficial right
to, any dissatisfied respondent, bidder, offerer, contractor or subcontractor,
or to any other business, contractor, subcontractor or entity proposed to be
utilized by any respondent or dissatisfied respondent.
         (b)   The county does not recognize any such property interest in,
beneficial right to, or entitlement to any prospective bid award in the county
procurement process.
         (c)   Remedies available to any dissatisfied respondent are limited to
the right to protest and remedies as expressed herein below.
      (2)   Right to protest; protest procedure; review and decision/
resolution; appeal.
         (a)   Right to protest.

solicitation documents, whichever is applicable, or any amendment thereto, if
the amendment is at issue.
            2.   Any actual bidder, offerer, contractor or subcontractor
aggrieved in connection with the intended award or award of a contract shall
protest to the appropriate purchasing officer within seven days, but not
thereafter, of the date notification of award is posted in accordance with this
subchapter.
            3.   The rights and remedies granted in this subchapter to a
disappointed respondent, bidder, offerer, contractor or subcontractor are the
sole rights and remedies provided herein against the county for the loss or
potential loss of an award of a contract under this subchapter.
         (b)   Protest procedure. A protest shall be in writing, submitted to
the procurement director, and shall set forth the grounds of the protest and
the relief requested with enough particularity to give notice of the issues to
be decided, with the approval of the county manager.
         (c)   Duty and authority to attempt to settle protests.
            1.   Prior to commencement of an administrative review, the
procurement director, or designees thereof, shall attempt to settle by mutual
agreement a protest of an aggrieved bidder, offerer, contractor or
subcontractor, actual or prospective, concerning the solicitation or award of
the contract.
            2.   The procurement director, or designees thereof, shall have the
authority to approve any settlement reached by mutual agreement, with approval
of the county manager.
         (d)   Administrative review and decision.
            1.   If, in the opinion of the procurement director, after a
reasonable attempt, a protest cannot be settled by mutual agreement, the
procurement director shall promptly conduct an administrative review, and shall
issue a decision in writing within ten days of completion of the review.
            2.   The decision shall state the reason for the action taken.
         (e)   Notice of decision.
            1.   A copy of the decision, along with a statement of appeal
rights hereunder, shall be mailed or otherwise furnished immediately to the
protestant and any other party that may intervene in the process.
            2.   The procurement director shall also post a copy of the
decision at a date and place communicated to all parties participating in the
administrative review, and such posted decision shall indicate its date of
posting, and be accompanied by a statement of the right to appeal.
         (f)   Finality of decision and appeal.
            1.   A decision shall be final and conclusive, unless fraudulent,
or unless any person adversely affected by the decision requests a further
administrative review by the County Council within ten days of posting of the
decision.
            2.   The request for review shall be directed to the county
manager, who shall forward the request for placement on the Council agenda.
            3.   The request shall be in writing, setting forth the reasons why
the person disagrees with the decision of the procurement director, or his or
her designee.
         (g)   No automatic stay of procurement during protests. In the event
of a timely protest under divisions (C)(2)(a)1. and 2. above, the county shall
not automatically stay the solicitation or award of the contract under this
subchapter; provided, however, that solicitation or award of a protested
contract may be stayed if the procurement director, after consultation with the
head of the using agency and/or county manager, makes a written determination
that the solicitation or award of the contract should be stayed in order to
protect the best interest of the county.
      (3)   Remedies.
         (a)   Remedies prior to an award. In the case of a protest under
division (C)(2) above, if prior to award of a contract, it is determined that
the solicitation or award is in violation of law, then the solicitation or
proposed award may be:
            1.   Canceled;
            2.   Stayed pending review;
            3.   Revised to comply with the law and re-bid; or
            4.   Awarded in a manner that complies with the provisions of this
subchapter.
         (b)   Remedies after an award. In the case of a protest under division
(C)(2), if after an award it is determined that a solicitation or award of a
contract is in violation of law, then:
            1.   If the person awarded the contract has not acted fraudulently
or in bad faith, the contract may be ratified and affirmed; provided it is
determined that doing so is in the best interest of the county.
            2.   If the person awarded the contract has not acted fraudulently
or in bad faith, the contract may be terminated and the person awarded the
contract may be compensated for actual expenses reasonably incurred under the
contract prior to termination.
            3.   If the person awarded the contract has acted fraudulently or
in bad faith, then the contract may be declared null and void.
            4.   If the person awarded the contract has acted fraudulently or
in bad faith, the contract may be ratified; if such action is in the best
interest of the county, without prejudice to the county's right to such damages
as may be appropriate.
      (4)   Frivolous protests.
         (a)   Signature on protest constitutes certificate. The signature of
an attorney or party on a protest or other document for appeal and/or review
constitutes a certificate by the signer that the signer has read such document,
that to the best of the signer's knowledge, information and belief formed after
reasonable inquiry, it is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing
law, or a good faith argument for the protest or reversal of existing law, and
that it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass, limit
competition, or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of
the procurement that is the subject of the litigation.
         (b)   Sanctions for violations. If a protest or other document for
appeal and/or review is signed, or found to be signed, in violation of this
division, the procurement director, county manager or County Council are hereby
authorized, upon their own initiative or upon a motion of an intervening party,
to impose upon the person who signed it, a represented party, or both, an
appropriate sanction, which may include debarment and/or an order to pay to the
other party or parties the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because
of the filing of the protest, pleading, motion or other paper, including a
reasonable attorney's fee.
   (D)   Debarment.
      (1)   Authority. The procurement director is authorized to take actions
to provide for the “debarment” of a vendor, person, contractor or business from
participating in any future procurement with the county.
      (2)   Procedure.
         (a)   After reasonable notice to the person involved and reasonable
opportunity for that person to be heard, the procurement director, after

of contracts.
         (b)   The debarment shall not be for a period of more than three

the county attorney, the same director shall have authority to suspend a person
from consideration for award of contracts if there is probable cause for
debarment.
         (d)   The suspension shall not be for a period exceeding three months.
         (e)   The authority to debar or suspend shall be exercised in
accordance with these regulations.

         (c)   Conviction under state or federal antitrust statutes arising out

accordance with the specifications or within the time limit provided in a
contract; or
            2.   A recent record of failure to perform or of unsatisfactory
performance in accordance with the terms of one or more contracts; provided
that failure to perform or unsatisfactory performance caused by acts beyond the
control of the contractor shall not be considered to be a basis for debarment;
         (e)   Any other cause determined to be as serious and compelling as to
affect responsibility as a county contractor, including debarment by another
governmental entity for any cause;
         (f)   Financial infirmity;
         (g)   The initiation of a frivolous protest under this subchapter; and
         (h)   For violation of the ethical standards set forth in applicable

conclusive, unless fraudulent, or unless the debarred or suspended person,
contractor, vendor or business appeals administratively within 14 days, but not
thereafter, to the county manager, setting forth with particularity why the
decision to debar or suspend is in error.
         (b)   An appeal to the county manager does not stay the effect of the

declared surplus or “excess fixed asset,” and authorized to be sold,
transferred, traded, gifted, dismantled or placed in storage by the county.
         (b)   To facilitate this process, each department shall inventory and

the first publication.
               b.   Sealed offers-to-buy will be submitted to the procurement
director, to be opened on the specified date and time.
            3.   Acceptance or rejection of offers-to-buy.

§ 35.035 ACCOMMODATIONS TAX.
   (A)   Legislative findings.
      (1)   The county wishes to build, maintain and enhance the facilities and
provide services that serve the tourists who visit the county. The county wants
to strongly support the public services that are available to tourists in order
to promote and further encourage tourism in the county. Tourists and other non-
residents account for the overwhelming majority of the use of lodging
facilities in the county and tourism is a year-round industry in the county.
      (2)   The county believes that the imposition of a 3% per night
accommodations tax per unit upon the rentals of hotels, motels and other
lodging establishments in the county that offer accommodations to tourists can
be used for the dedicated purpose of providing and improving services and
facilities for those tourists.
   (B)   Definitions.
      ACCOMMODATIONS. The establishments in the county and guest charges
provided for in S.C. Code § 12-36-920, as amended from time to time, and as
construed by the courts for those statutes. ACCOMMODATIONS exempt from the
state sales tax are exempt from the tax provided for herein. Court decisions
and state regulations defining application and exemption of the state sales tax
on ACCOMMODATIONS shall govern the application or exemption of the tax herein.
      YORK COUNTY. All of the unincorporated area of that county at the time of
the adoption of this subchapter.
   (C)   Tax on accommodations. There is imposed a uniform tax of 3% of the
gross proceeds from the sale or rental of accommodations within the county as
defined in division (B) above. This accommodations tax shall be collected from
every patron or customer when the patron or customer tenders payment for the
accommodations and shall be collected by the provider of the accommodations who
shall hold it in trust for the benefit of the county until paid to the county
as hereinafter provided.
   (D)   Special account. There is established a special account, to be known
as the Local Accommodations Tax Account, into which all funds remitted to the
county under this subchapter shall be deposited.
   (E)   Collection time forms and procedures.
      (1)   The county manager shall provide procedures for remittance of the
taxes to the county which shall utilize to the fullest extent practicable
comparable state return forms, filing dates and procedures so as to reduce
duplication of paper work on the part of providers subject to this section.
      (2)   The county manager is authorized to promulgate the administrative
policies and procedures, including necessary forms, returns and due dates for
forms and returns, as he or she may deem necessary for the proper
administration and enforcement of this section and to amend the same from time
to time as may be required by the circumstances including, the designation and
authorization of county personnel for those purposes. The procedures shall
provide for systematic inspections of accommodations within the county to
determine compliance with this section.
   (F)   An amount of the accommodations taxes collected annually in the
unincorporated area of York County pursuant to S.C. Code § 12-36-920, not to
exceed 20% of the revenue of the preceding fiscal year of the local
accommodations tax authorized pursuant to the South Carolina Local
Accommodations Tax Act, S.C. Code § 6-1-510 et seq., may be used for the
operation and maintenance of facilities, infrastructure and items described in

emergency medical services and emergency-preparedness operations directly
attendant to those facilities, infrastructure and items.

§ 35.122 OPTION TO PREPAY REAL ESTATE TAXES IN INSTALLMENTS.
   (A)   Each taxpayer owning a parcel of taxable real property within York
County is hereby granted the option to pay property taxes in installments as
provided herein; provided that current taxes for the qualifying real property
are paid in full by the installment payment application deadline of January 15.
An installment election is not allowed for taxes paid through an escrow
account.
   (B)   A taxpayer electing to pay ad valorem taxes in installments or
electing to opt out of paying in installments must notify the county treasurer
in writing no later than January 15 of the tax year for which the installment
payments are applicable, and no earlier than December 1 of the preceding tax
year. If the York County Treasurer does not receive written notification from a
taxpayer between December 1 of a current tax year and before January 15 of the
tax year for which installment payments are applicable, the taxpayer must pay
ad valorem taxes in the same manner as the previous taxable year.
   (C)   The York County Treasurer shall notify the York County Auditor and the
York County Tax Assessor of each taxpayer electing the installment payment
option provided herein or electing to opt out of paying ad valorem taxes in
installments. If the York County Tax Assessor determines that the property of a
taxpayer electing the installment payment option of taxes has diminished in
value, an estimated property tax obligation must be adjusted to reflect the
reduced value. Upon being notified of an adjustment for reduced value from the
assessor, the County Treasurer must notify the property owner of the adjusted
estimated property tax obligation.
   (D)   (1)   An installment payment is based on the total property tax for
the previous property tax year, after applying all applicable credits and
adjustments reflecting reduced value as determined by the County Tax Assessor.
An amount equal to 16.667% of the estimated property tax obligation must be
paid to the County Treasurer in each of five installments according to the
following schedule: in the case of the following estimates, the due date is on
or before:
         (a)   First   February 15
         (b)   Second   April 15
         (c)   Third   June 15
         (d)   Fourth   August 15
         (e)   Fifth   October 15
      (2)   The remaining balance is due on or before January 15 of the
following tax year in accordance with S.C. Code § 12-45-70. The County
Treasurer shall notify the County Auditor of the amount of a property owner's
payments received no earlier than October 15 and no later than November 15. A
notice of the remaining tax due and other authorized charges and information
must then be prepared and mailed to the property owner.
   (E)   If a taxpayer electing to pay in installments does not timely make
each payment pursuant to the schedule contained in division (D) above, the
county may refuse to accept all other installment payments. If the county
refuses to accept other installment payments, the remaining balance is due in
accordance with the provisions of S.C. Code § 12-45-70.
   (F)   Estimated property taxes paid in installments during a property tax
year are a credit against the total property tax due on the real property for
the property tax year. The estimated property taxes paid in installments during
a property tax year must be deposited by the County Treasurer in an interest
bearing account. The interest is to be retained by the County Treasurer to
offset the administrative expenses of installment payments. Once final payment
is made, and no later than January 15 of the following taxable year,
installment payments actually paid must be credited to the accounts of the
property taxing entities in the county in the same proportion that millage was
imposed by such entities in the previous tax year with the necessary
adjustments made to reflect current tax year millage impositions when property
taxes for the current year are paid.
   (G)   If the credit allowed for estimated property tax paid during the
property tax year results in an overpayment of property tax, the overpayment
must be refunded to the taxpayer together with the actual interest earned by
the County Treasurer, running from the later of the due date of the
installments resulting in the overpayment, without regard to additional amounts
paid, or the actual date the overpayment was received by the County Treasurer,
to the date the refund is issued; provided, however, that if the overpayment is
issued to the taxpayer within 45 days of the installment payment that resulted
in the overpayment, the County Treasurer may retain the interest earned to
offset administrative costs.
   (H)   Every tax notice for real property, for which the installment payment
option has been elected, must contain a calculation of any estimated property
tax due and a payment schedule and return envelopes for these payments.
   (I)   The payment of estimated property tax as provided in this section and
the credit allowed arising from these payments in no way alters the due date,
penalty schedule, and enforced collection of property taxes as provided by law.
   (J)   The York County Treasurer is authorized and empowered to promulgate
and implement rules, processes and procedures for the administration of this
section.

§ 50.03 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
   (A)   The County Council finds that the public health, safety and welfare
requires that rules, regulations and procedures be established and promulgated
governing the collection, deposit and disposal of permitted solid waste
materials in the county’s municipal solid waste landfill and in county
convenience centers and solid waste collection and disposal facilities. The
Council finds that the South Carolina General Assembly has mandated that a
coordinated statewide solid waste management program is needed to protect
public health and safety, protect and preserve the quality of the environment
and conserve and recycle natural resources. The Council finds that counties
have been mandated by the South Carolina Solid Waste Policy and Management Act
of 1991 to plan for and provide efficient, environmentally acceptable solid
waste management services and programs; to utilize all means of managing solid
waste; to develop and implement source separation, resource recovery or
recycling programs, or all of the above; or enhance existing programs so that
valuable materials may be returned to productive use, energy and natural
resources conserved and the useful life of solid waste management facilities
extended.
   (B)   The Council further finds that local governments have been encouraged
or required pursuant to the South Carolina Solid Waste Policy and Management
Act of 1991 to ensure that solid waste is transported, stored, treated,
processed and disposed of in a manner adequate to protect human health, safety
and welfare and the environment; to promote the reduction, recycling, reuse and
treatment of solid waste and the recycling of materials which would otherwise
be disposed of as solid waste; to promote the education of the general public
and the training of solid waste professionals to reduce the generation of solid
waste in order to ensure proper disposal of solid waste and to encourage
recycling. The County Council is authorized by S.C. Code § 44-96-80(k) to enact
ordinances as may be necessary to carry out its responsibilities under the
South Carolina Solid Waste Policy and Management Act of 1991, not inconsistent
with the state solid waste management plan, any provision of the South Carolina
Solid Waste Policy and Management Act of 1991, any applicable provision of
state law or any regulation promulgated by the Department of Health and
Environmental Control for the health and safety of the public or for the
protection of the environment.
   (C)   Pursuant to its authority and in accordance with the powers conferred
upon it, the Council has determined that there is a substantial need for the
enactment of an ordinance governing rules, practices and procedures for the
collection, deposit and disposal of solid waste matter; defining and regulating
the materials which may be deposited in the county municipal solid waste
landfill(s), transfer stations, convenience centers or other county solid waste
facilities; prohibiting loitering at or trespassing upon county municipal solid
waste landfill sites, county convenience centers or other county solid waste
facilities; prohibiting interference with county solid waste landfill(s),
convenience centers or other county solid waste facilities or the removal,
scattering, probing or recycling, recovery or diversion activities; authorizing
the county manager to promulgate rules and regulations governing the hours of
operation and the maintenance and operating procedures for county municipal
solid waste landfill(s), convenience centers or other solid waste facilities;
materials which may be deposited in county municipal solid waste facilities;
promulgating safety rules and procedures, emergency rules and regulations;
rules and regulations in case of shut-down and other rules and regulations
appropriate to the operation of a county- wide system of solid waste collection
and disposal; providing for penalties for the violation of this section; and
certain other matters.

its citizens requires the promulgation and establishment of additional rules,
standards, regulations and procedures governing the collection, deposit and
disposal of solid waste materials in the county’s municipal solid waste
landfill, county convenience centers and county solid waste facilities. This
subchapter is intended to supplement §§
50.02 through

§ 51.01 YORK COUNTY WATER AND SEWAGE DEPARTMENT CREATED.
   There is hereby created and established the York County Water and Sewage
Department.
(‘77 Code, § 7-7) (Ord. 484, passed 5-7-84; Am. Ord. 5206, passed 12-18-06)
§ 51.02 PURPOSES AND OBJECTIVES OF DEPARTMENT.
   The water and sewage department shall:
   (A)   Coordinate planning activities for the development, acquisition,
construction, ownership, leasing and operation of county-wide water and sewage
systems;
   (B)   Accept, on behalf of the county, grants, appropriations, gifts or
donations from any public or private source for the establishment, creation,
acquisition, expansion, improvement or operation of county water and/or sewer
systems;
   (C)   Devise ways and means to finance the establishment, creation,

   (E)   With the approval of the County Council, enter into contracts or
agreements for the provision of water and sewage services in the county (The
County Council finds that the county has acquired water and sewage systems
which it intends to own and operate through the water and sewage department.);
and
   (F)   Provide other services as may be determined by the County Council, and
perform other tasks as may be assigned by the county manager.
(‘77 Code, § 7-8) (Ord. 484, passed 5-7-84; Am. Ord. 5206, passed 12-18-06)
§ 51.03 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
   (A)   The Council finds that the orderly administration of the county water
and sewage systems requires that Council establish policies and procedures to
regulate the use, operation, administration and extension of the county water
and sewage systems.
   (B)   The Council finds that the policies and procedures established by this
chapter will facilitate the management, use, administration and extension of
the county water and sewage systems, and that the policies and procedures will
promote and protect the health, safety, welfare and development of the county
and its citizens.
(‘77 Code, § 7-50) (Ord. 1485, passed 10-7-85; Am Ord. 5206, passed 12-18-06)
§ 51.04 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   AIR GAP. The unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere
between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water to a tank,
plumbing fixture or other device, and the flood level rim of the receptacle.
   CAPACITY OR IMPACT FEE. A fee paid by customers as a condition of
development approval, to cover a proportionate share of the costs associated
with the design, installation and upgrades of utility infrastructure necessary
to meet increased demands of people utilizing improvements upon the
infrastructure of the system. UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE includes all water and
sewer mains, interceptors, lift stations, pumping stations, elevated and ground
storage facilities, booster station treatment capacity and other capital
appurtenances necessary for the continued effective functioning of the county
water and sewer systems. A “capacity fee” is often referred to as an “impact
fee.”
   COMBINED UTILITY SYSTEM. The county water distribution and sanitary sewer
collection systems.
   EXTENSION. The lengthening of any potable water distribution system or
sanitary sewer collection system piping required to connect a water service to
the water distribution system, or a sewer service to the sanitary sewer
collection system.
   FEASIBLE PROJECT. A project in which (standard county service connection)
fees collected will pay for the total cost of the extension requested.
   METER SET FEE. A fee paid by customers designed to recuperate the costs for
representatives of the York County Water and Sewer Department (YCWSD) to
purchase a water meter, transport it to the project site, physically install it
in the meter box, and restore or “turn on” water service to the customer's
site. The METER SET FEE does not include providing and setting the meter box or
mounting yoke. The METER SET FEE is typically charged to new developments,
where the actual service connections, service lines and meter boxes, yokes and
the like are installed and paid for by parties other than the YCWSD. The METER
SET FEE may also be applicable if the service connections, lines, meter boxes
and the like are installed and paid for by parties other than the county.
   OUTFALL. Any sewer pipe eight inches or larger in diameter that has been
installed to serve a drainage basin. OUTFALL sewers generally consist of piping
eight inches in diameter or larger. OUTFALL piping must be located and sized to
accommodate anticipated flows from the drainage basin being served. Anticipated
flows shall be calculated for total build-out of the drainage basin, as
determined by current zoning district boundaries and regulations (or as
directed by the county engineer). OUTFALL piping must be sized, based on the
following criteria (unless otherwise approved by the county engineer):
      •   For piping 12 inches in diameter and smaller, OUTFALL piping shall be
designed to flow one-half full;
      •   For piping larger than 12 inches in diameter, OUTFALL piping shall be
designed to flow three-quarters full.
   REVENUE. All monies collected for the sale of water and/or sewer service
charges.
   SEWER SERVICE CONNECTION. The piping that connects the sanitary sewer
outfall pipe to a customer’s discharge pipe. The service connection (oftentimes
called a “lateral”) is typically recognized as the piping within the public
rights-of-way or easement line.
   TAP FEE. A charge assessed to applicants for water and sewer service
connections performed by YCWSD, and designed to recover the cost incurred by
the county for making the physical tie to the existing water or sewer piping.
WATER LINE TAPS include installing the tapping saddle or sleeve, tapping valve
or corporation stop, physically making the water service connection, providing
and installing the service piping, providing and installing the meter box,
yoke, and other necessary work and materials to the customer's property line
(or easement line). The WATER TAP FEE does not include the setting of the meter
or the cost of the meter set fee. As with the water tap fee, the SEWER TAP FEE
covers the expenses incurred by the county to provide materials and labor
necessary to make the physical tie to the existing sewer piping, whether it be
a sanitary sewer force main or gravity sewer, and includes extending the
service connection piping to the customer's property line (or easement line). A
SEPARATE TAP FEE applies to connections to the water system piping, and
connections to the sewer system piping, as provided in this section.
   WATER MAIN. Any water distribution system piping that provides potable water
service to a customer. Water mains are typically two inches in diameter or
larger, and they do not include a customer's individual service piping. Water
mains are to be sized and located so that additional service connections beyond
the limits of any associated development can be made with the system,
maintaining minimum residual pressures and flows as required by the SCDHEC.
Water main extensions are to be sized with consideration of current zoning
district boundaries and regulations (or as directed by the county engineer).
   WATER SERVICE CONNECTION. The connection to a water main of a service line
complete to the customer’s property line, right-of-way, or easement line. The
WATER SERVICE CONNECTION shall include service piping, a meter, meter yoke,
meter box, meter stop and any other required appurtenances.
   WATER SERVICE RECONNECTION. If water service has been discontinued for any
reason, any customer desiring to reestablish water service to his or her
property or structure shall be required to pay a reconnection fee, as
established in the YCWSD rate schedule provided herein.
   WHEELING RATE. A transmission rate mechanism or charge for water transported
through the county water system from a point of delivery meter of York County
to another political subdivision of the state operating within York County. The
rate will be applied following a rate study and the adoption of an
intergovernmental agreement with the political subdivision receiving the
transmitted water.
   YORK COUNTY SEWER SYSTEM. The sanitary sewer collection system owned and
maintained by the county. The sewer system includes lines, manholes, valves,
lift stations, and other associated appurtenances used in the collection of
sewage within the county utility service boundaries.
   YORK COUNTY WATER SYSTEM. The water distribution system owned and maintained
by the county. The water system includes lines, valves, hydrants, booster pump
stations, and other associated appurtenances used in the distribution of
potable water within the county utility service boundaries.
(‘77 Code, §7-51) (Ord. 1485, passed 10-7-85; Am. Ord. 6396, passed 12-16-96;
Am. Ord. 5206, passed 12-18-06; Am. Ord. 3619, passed 9-3-19)
§ 51.05 WATER AND SEWER RATES AND CHARGES; TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SERVICE.
   (A)   Legislative findings. As an incident to the enactment of this section,
the County Council finds that the county has acquired and operates water and
sewer systems as a part of the county’s combined utility system. The Council
finds that the previously adopted schedule of permanent rates, fees and charges
for the orderly administration of the county’s combined utility system,
hereinafter referred to as the “county system,” should be amended in order to
provide sufficient revenues to retire revenue bonds issued for the county
system; pay all costs and expenses incurred in the construction, operation and
capital improvement of the county system; and provide a reasonable return upon
county investments in the county system. The Council finds that the schedule of
rates and charges established by this section is reasonable, proper and
appropriate in order to provide for the operation, administration, construction
and maintenance of the county system.
   (B)   Establishment of rates, fees and charges. The following schedules of
rates, fees and charges are hereby established and shall apply to water and/or
sewer services provided by the county system, effective on December 18, 2006:

      (14)   Private fire services. Any person applying for connection to the
county water system for the purpose of a private fire service line shall be
required to meet the following requirements:
         (a)   The customer shall install, at his or her expense, a complete
fire service connection, including but not limited to, the tap, a double-check
detector assembly, and the connection to his or her system. All construction,
including the approval of materials, shall be coordinated with the county’s
water and sewer department. The double-check detector assembly shall be placed
on the right-of-way, and county water and sewer personnel shall be given access
for the purpose of reading the bypass meter;
         (b)   Tap fees for fire service lines shall be an administrative
charge of $500;
         (c)   The base rate for the private fire service shall be equivalent
to the commercial/industrial base rate for the size of the bypass meter set on
the double-check detector assembly. If flow is detected by the bypass meter for
any reason, including maintenance or leakage, the owner shall be charged the
standard commercial rate for water used. In the event of fire flow, the owner
shall be charged the standard commercial rate, based upon the estimated amount
of water used;
         (d)   Private fire service taps are available to county customers who
have existing water service or who have applied for water service.
      (15)   Utility service agreements.
         (a)   The county manager may approve utility service agreements under
which water tap fees, required by division (B)(4) above, and sewer tap fees,
required by division (B)(12) above, are to be paid in no more than three equal
annual installments; provided that the property to be served was developed at
the time of construction of mains from which service is to be provided, and
that public water and sewer service was therefore unavailable at the time of
development.
         (b)   In order to approve the utility service agreements provided for
payment of tap fees in installments, the county manager must ensure that the
following conditions exist:
            1.   If both public water and sewer service are available, the
applicant must agree to connect to both systems;
            2.   In the case of water service, the property must be served by a
private well or wells at the time application for service is made, and the
applicant must agree to disconnect all applicable plumbing fixtures of the
property from the private system in a manner approved by the county and the
South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC);
            3.   A private well may continue to be operated for irrigation or
similar purposes. In the case of sewer service, the property must be served by
a septic tank or tanks or similar private treatment system at the time of
application for public service is made, and the applicant must agree to
disconnect all plumbing fixtures from the existing treatment system and abandon
the system in a manner approved by the county and the SCDHEC;
            4.   A written agreement must be executed by both parties which
specifies terms of initial and subsequent payments toward the required tap fee
(s), and which further provides that amounts held in abeyance shall constitute
a lien against real property served by the connection or connections and that
the terms of the agreement are enforceable against the applicant’s successors
and assigns;
            5.   All other terms and conditions of this section shall apply to
service provided under this chapter.
      (16)   Wheeling rate agreements.
         (a)   Upon request of a political subdivision operating within York
County for the application of a wheeling rate, the Council shall undertake the
conduction of a rate study; the payment of the study may be negotiated in
advance with the requesting governmental entity.
         (b)   In evaluating the appropriate wheeling rate, the study, which
may be re-evaluated and amended from time to time, shall consider such aspects
as proportionate share of the annual depreciated expenses associated with the
assets that provide service to the ultimate customers; rate of return to the
county for investment in the assets; proportionate share of operating and
maintenance expenses related to the assets; and such other aspects as may be
germane to the specific request.
         (c)   Upon conclusion of the study, the county and requesting
political subdivision shall endeavor to enter an intergovernmental agreement
specifying the adoption of the study and the application and implementation of
the rate.
      (17)   Former Blue Granite Franchise Area Surcharge.
         (a)   All customers that are located in the “CWS Franchise Territory,”
as that term is used in that certain Franchise Agreement dated February 5,
2018, by and between York County, South Carolina, and Carolina Water Service
(predecessor in interest to Blue Granite Water Company), and which has now been
terminated, shall pay a flat surcharge (the “Surcharge”) to defray the cost of
the county acquiring the water and sewer utility system owned by Blue Granite
Water Company (“Blue Granite”) and operated within the Clover/River Hills/Lake
Wylie area of York County (the “Blue Granite System”).
         (b)   For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, the surcharge shall be
the lesser of (1) $60 per month per account, or (ii) such amount as may be
determined by the County Manager, or his designee, as sufficient to meet the
purposes of the surcharge. Thereafter the surcharge authorized by this division
shall be set and approved by County Council as part of the annual budget, or
any supplement thereto. The amount of the surcharge will be recalculated every
five years or sooner if a material change occurs effecting the cost of
acquiring the system.
         (c)   The surcharge shall begin and be included with the first monthly
bill issued by the county following its acquisition of the Blue Granite System,
and shall terminate not later than the end of the fiscal year in which the
maturity or prior redemption of the revenue bonds of the county issued to
defray, reimburse, or refinance the costs of acquiring the Blue Granite System
occurs.

CONNECTIONS AND EXTENSIONS
§ 51.15 SERVICE CONNECTION AND EXTENSION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES.
   (A)   (1)   The water and sewage department will provide water and/or sewage
service solely for residential, commercial, industrial, manufacturing,
institutional or other related purposes within the department’s service area,
as defined by the county, subject to the limitations and conditions established
by the agreement between the City of Rock Hill and York County, and subject to
the limitations and conditions established by the county for the
administration, operation and extension of the county water and sewage systems.
By allowing connection to or extension of its water and/or sewage systems, the
water and sewage department does not warrant unlimited water and/or sewage
service. No water is warranted by the water and sewage department for fire
protection. By allowing connection to or extension of its water and sewage
systems, the county assumes no liability for damage due to leaks, malfunctions
or breaks in any portion of the county water or sewage systems.
      (2)   The water and sewage department reserves the right to refuse
service to any applicant, if the county, at its sole discretion, finds that
service to any applicant is uneconomical, the premises for which service is
sought are not located contiguous to the county water and sewage systems, or
service is not otherwise in the best interest of the water and sewage
department.
   (B)   (1)   Water and/or sewage service within the county’s defined service
area will be provided in the order in which applications for service are
approved and connections or extensions of or to the county water and sewage
systems are constructed. Service will be provided on a “first come-first
served” basis.
      (2)   Service is subject to the capacity of the county water and/or
sewage systems, and to the limitations and conditions contained in the water
and sewage department connection and extension policies and procedures. The
water and sewage department reserves the right to refuse service to any
applicant, subject to the terms, conditions and limitations contained in the
policies and procedures of the water and sewage department, and subject to the
terms and conditions of the agreement between the municipal supplier and the
county.
      (3)   Upon approval by the water and sewage department of an applicant’s
application for service, a commitment will be issued approving the requested
service. If a building permit has not been obtained by the applicant from the
building and codes department within 90 days from the issuance of a commitment
by the county to provide water and/or sewage service, the commitment shall
expire and become null and void, and the water and sewage department shall have
no further obligation to provide water and/or sewage service. If for any
reason, a building permit becomes invalid, the water and sewage department’s
commitment to provide water and sewage services becomes null and void. When
service is introduced upon the applicant’s premises, the applicant or any
successor to the applicant shall be subject to all rules, regulations and
limitations upon service, as established by the water and sewage department or
the rules, regulations, policies or procedures of the county relating thereto.
      (4)   The county makes no representations or warranties relating to water
and/or sewage services which extend beyond those expressly contained in writing
in any agreement between the county and the applicant and/or ultimate user or
consumer of county water and/or sewage services. The county makes no
representations or warranties of merchantability or fitness for any particular
purpose.
      (5)   No plumbing system which allows water and/or sewage service to be
provided to real property located outside the county’s defined service area, or
to improvements to real property or to personal property located outside the
county’s service area, shall be connected to the county’s utility systems,
unless written consent is granted to the county to provide utilities within
another jurisdictional area.
      (6)   No connection shall be made between the water and sewage
department’s water system and any unauthorized water source under any
circumstances.
      (7)   No connection to the water and sewage department’s sewage system
shall be made unless the applicant obtains all of its water from the county
water system, except upon the written approval of the water and sewage
department. Any water not obtained from the water and sewage department water
system shall be accurately metered by the water and sewage department, and the
amount of water so metered shall be reported regularly in order to calculate
the applicant’s sewage charges.
      (8)   Piping and stormwater runoff shall not be connected to the county’s
wastewater collection system.
      (9)   All applicants for county water and/or sewage services shall, prior
to the extension of such services, enter into a written utility user’s
agreement with the county. The applicant, and all successors to the applicant,
in consideration of the extension or provision of water and sewer services by
the county, shall agree to save and hold harmless the county, the water and
sewage department, and their respective successors, agents, employees and
assigns, from and against all claims, demands, suits or liability for injury to
persons or loss of, or damage to, property caused by, growing out of, or
occurring in connection with, the construction, inspection, use or maintenance
of the county water and/or sewage system.

existing water mains or sewer outfall lines, must be furnished to the water and
sewage department before it will consider any commitment for service.
      (1)   All the projects as described in division (A) above will be
financed wholly through the applicant’s funds. Any large mains or outfalls
required, which could be defined as part of the basic water and sewage
department system, must be approved by the water and sewage department as to
location and size prior to approval and construction. Approval for construction
will be granted only if the large mains and outfalls are located in public
streets or within easements or rights-of-way granted to the county by
appropriate instruments in recordable form.
      (2)   The water and sewage department maintenance and operation will be
provided only to those water and sewage projects which are built and located in
public streets or within easements or rights-of-way granted to the county.
   (B)   In order to secure an extension of the county water and/or sanitary

      (1)   The County Council may, by ordinance, reduce the size of the
franchised area or revoke a franchise by repeal of the franchise ordinance only
for cause, which may include one of the following:
         (a)   The failure of the franchisee to comply with any term, provision
or condition of this subchapter or its franchise ordinance; or
         (b)   A determination by the County Council that the action would be
in the best interest of the health, safety or welfare of the citizens of the
county.
      (2)   The franchisee shall have the right to appear and to be heard by
the County Council, prior to final action being taken on any ordinance to

WATER AND SEWER CAPACITY OR IMPACT FEES
§ 51.45 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
   (A)   The county finds that each new connection to its combined water and
sewer system requires increased treatment and transmission capacity; upgrades
of utility infrastructure to meet increased demands upon the infrastructure of
such system; increased capacity in water and sewer mains and interceptors, lift
stations, pumping stations and elevated and ground storage facilities and
booster stations; additional demands for increased capacity in water treatment
plants and wastewater treatment plants; and other infrastructure and
appurtenances required, necessary or appropriate in order to provide and
distribute an adequate supply of potable water and provide adequate wastewater
collection and treatment capacity to service new development within the
county’s combined water and sewer system service area, and the area within
which the county provides wholesale service.
   (B)   The construction or installation of new buildings or structures,
changes in the use of existing buildings and structures, and other
circumstances and conditions of new development and construction create
additional demands and needs for county public water and sewer facilities.
   (C)   The Council finds that the costs of such additional capacity,
infrastructure, water and sewer mains, interceptors, lift stations, pumping
stations, elevated and ground storage facilities, booster stations and other
capital improvements and appurtenances, and the additional capacity required
for the effective functioning of the county combined water and sewer utility
systems should be paid by capacity fees or impact fees.
      (1)   A CAPACITY OR IMPACT FEE consists of a payment of money imposed as
a condition of such development approval, requiring the developers or owners of
new buildings and structures, and  existing buildings and structures which are
changed or altered, to pay a proportionate share of the costs of improvements
to the county combined water and sewer utility system, needed to serve those
utilizing such system and improvements that create additional demands and needs
for county water and sewer facilities.
      (2)   Council finds that such capacity fees or impact fees should be
imposed in addition to other county-imposed water and sewer rates, fees,
charges, deposits, meter set fees, tap fees, reconnection fees and other
applicable rates, fees and charges for connection to and use of the county’s
combined water and sewer utility system.

   (B)   A single-family equivalent represents the water or sewer demand of a
typical single-family connection.
      (1)   The number of service units associated with larger connections or
meters is calculated, based on the relative hydraulic capacity of the meter
compared to the smallest meter size.
      (2)   The single-family equivalent service units number associated with
each meter size is multiplied by the net capital cost per single-family
equivalent service unit, which gives the net cost per water meter for water
meters of various sizes, and the net cost for sewer connections of various
sizes.
      (3)   In determining water capacity or impact fees, the net cost per
single-family equivalent service unit as calculated above is multiplied by the
service units associated with each meter size.
         (a)   As determined by the impact fee study for water and sewer system
developed by independent financial advisors for the county, the net capital
cost per single-family equivalent service unit is $3,451.00 per water system.
         (b)   The capacity or impact fee imposed on each single-family
equivalent service unit is approximately 50% of the maximum water system net
capital cost per single-family equivalent service unit.
      (4)   In determining sewer capacity or impact fees, the net capital cost
per single-family equivalent service unit as calculated above is multiplied by
the service units applicable to each meter size.
         (a)   As determined by the impact fee study for water and sewer system
developed by independent financial advisors for county, the net capital cost
single-family equivalent service unit is $5,179.00 per sewer system.
         (b)   The capacity or impact fee imposed pursuant to this section is
approximately 50% of the sewer system net capital cost per single-family
equivalent service unit.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 52.01 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
   The County Council has acquired water and sewer systems which it intends to
own and operate through the water and sewage department. The Council finds that
the life, health and safety of the people of the county require the adoption of
a permanent ordinance to regulate the use of the county water and sewer systems
in order to prevent insanitary conditions, unauthorized connections, unapproved
extensions or other conditions which may adversely affect the life, health and
safety of the people of the county.
(‘77 Code, § 7-70) (Ord. 1585, passed 10-21-85)
§ 52.02 SYSTEM OPERATIONS.
   The sewage treatment and disposal facilities and sewage collection system
owned or operated by the county shall be operated as and considered to be a
single integrated system. The amount necessary to meet annual interest payable
on any debt incurred for construction of the sewer system, the amount necessary
for the amortization of the debt, and the amount necessary for repairs,
maintenance and operation of the county sewage system shall constitute the
minimum amount established as user charges for sewer service by the county.
(‘77 Code, § 7-80) (Ord. 1585, passed 10-21-85)
§ 52.03 APPLICATIONS FOR SERVICE.
   Sewer service connections will be made to premises abutting on streets
having county sewer mains in accordance with the policies and procedures
adopted by the county for the administration, operation and extension of the
county water and sewer systems. Additionally, existing sewer service
connections for premises which do not abut streets having county sewer mains
may be made where the county acquires ownership of a sewer system by eminent
domain or agreement. The owner, lessee or authorized agent of the property to
be benefitted shall make application to the water and sewage department, and
upon compliance with all requirements of the water and sewage department, and
upon approval of the application, the service connections may be permitted in
accordance with county policies, procedures and requirements.
(‘77 Code, § 7-81) (Ord. 1585, passed 10-21-85; Am. Ord. 6823, passed 12-18-23)
USE REGULATIONS
§ 52.15 CONDITIONS AND CHARGES FOR SERVICE CONNECTIONS AND REPAIRS.
   (A)   Sewer service connections for premises abutting streets having county
sewer mains within the right-of-way of streets or roads shall remain the
property of the owner, and shall be the responsibility of the property owner or
occupant.
   (B)   Sewer service connections for premises which do not abut streets
having county sewer mains within the right-of-way of streets or roads shall be
the responsibility of the property owner or occupant to the property line of
the premises if such design is part of a longstanding system that is acquired
by the county.
   (C)   Subject to any applicable covenants and restrictions of record for
specifically burdened properties, sewer service connections for premises having
county sewer mains within the property line when the county acquires ownership
of a sewer system shall remain the property of the owner and shall be the
responsibility of the property owner or occupant.
   (D)   Each applicant for service shall designate with a marker the location
of a new sewer service connection prior to the beginning of work. When the
lowest elevation of plumbing in a building to be served is lower than the rim
elevation of the nearest upstream manhole, the sewer service connection will
not be activated until a backwater valve is installed, as required by the
applicable plumbing code.
   (E)   The charges for making a four-inch or smaller sewer service connection
shall be established in accordance with the water and sewer rate methodology
documents, and as set forth in the county ordinance to establish rates and
charges for water and sewer services.
   (F)   The charges for making sewer service connections larger than four
inches, or where manholes or creek crossings are required, shall be determined
as provided in the county ordinance to establish rates and charges for water
and sewer services. The water and sewage department shall determine the cost to
furnish any service requested, upon submission of an application for a sewer
service connection and all supporting information and data which may be
required by the department. Payment of the determined cost is required prior to
any construction work by the water and sewage department.
   (G)   The property owner or user shall not perform, direct or permit the
performance of any maintenance work within the right-of-way of any street,
road, or easement without the express written approval of the water and sewage
department. Except in extraordinary or unusual circumstances, all maintenance
work required within a street right-of-way shall be performed by the water and
sewage department, or by permittees duly authorized by the department. Ordinary
maintenance and repairs to the county sewer system shall be made by the water
and sewage department. The property owner or user will be charged actual costs
of labor, equipment and materials for repairs to service connections where it
is determined by the department that actions of the property owner or user have
necessitated repairs to the service connection.
(‘77 Code, § 7-82) (Ord. 1585, passed 10-21-85; Am. Ord. 6823, passed 12-18-23)
§ 52.16 PROPERTY OWNER OR OCCUPANT TO KEEP SANITARY APPLIANCES AND PRIVATE
SEWER LINES IN REPAIR.
   In the event any plumbing appliance becomes defective or out of repair in
any manner, the same shall immediately be restored to proper working order or
replaced with a properly working appliance. If any private sewer line becomes
clogged, the same shall be opened and cleared of any obstruction by the
property owner or occupant of the premises. Except as provided in this chapter
or the policies or procedures of the water and sewage department, the costs of
any repair or replacement required by this section shall be at the expense of
the property owner or occupant.
(‘77 Code, § 7-83) (Ord. 1585, passed 10-21-85; Am. Ord. 6823, passed 12-18-23)
§ 52.17 DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE USER CHARGES.
   (A)   The sewer service user charge shall be a monthly charge based upon the
water consumption of the property served, as measured by the water meter on the
property, for the calendar month or other specified period of time.
   (B)   The charges and rates are defined as follows:
      (1)   Sewer service charges will be based upon the applicable county rate
of 100 cubic feet of water used, as determined by the county’s schedule of
rates and charges;
      (2)   A monthly minimum fixed customer charge for the provision of basic
servicing of customer accounts, even if no sewer services are used, applies to
all accounts.
(‘77 Code, § 7-84) (Ord. 1585, passed 10-21-85)
§ 52.18 DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE USER CHARGES FOR PROPERTY OTHER THAN COUNTY
WATER.
   (A)   For a property which uses water, all or a part of which is from a
source other than the water and sewage department distribution system, there
shall be a sewer rental separate from, and in addition to any sewer rental
based on the consumption of water from the county water distribution system.
The separate or additional sewer charges shall be measured by the quantity of
water from the source other than the county system, which is discharged into
the county sewer from the property.
   (B)   The owner of the property shall install and maintain, at his or her
expense, a meter to measure the quantity of water received from other than the
county water distribution system and discharged into county sewers. No meter
shall be installed or used for the purpose without the approval of the water
and sewage department, and the property owner shall pay for water discharged
into the county sewers as though all such water came from the county water
distribution system.
   (C)   If the property owner fails to install and maintain at his or her
expense an approved meter, the water and sewage department shall estimate the
amount of water from sources other than the county system which is discharged
into county sewers from the property. This estimate will be based on records of
the consumption of similar properties or operations. If no applicable records
are available, a formula based on the usage of the property will be utilized to
compute the estimated water discharged into county sewers, and the property
owner will be billed accordingly. The bills shall be collectible and
enforceable in the same manner as any other water and/or sewer bill of the
water and sewage department.
(‘77 Code, § 7-85) (Ord. 1585, passed 10-21-85)
§ 52.19 METERS OR MEASURING DEVICES UNDER CONTROL OF THE COUNTY SYSTEM;
PROPERTY OWNER TO MAINTAIN.
   All meters or other measuring devices installed or required under the
provisions of this chapter shall be under the control of the water and sewage
department. The owner of the property where the measuring device is installed
shall be responsible for its maintenance and safekeeping and any repairs
required will be made at the owner’s expense.
(‘77 Code, § 7-86) (Ord. 1585, passed 10-21-85)
§ 52.20 DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE USER CHARGES FOR USERS OF COUNTY WATER NOT
DISCHARGED INTO COUNTY SEWER SYSTEM.
   (A)   If a customer is charged for sewer service and uses water from the
county water distribution system which is not discharged into the county sewer
system for an industrial or commercial purpose, the quantity of water so used,
and not discharged into the sewer system, shall be excluded from the
calculation of the sewer service charge; provided, however, the quantity of
water so used and not discharged into the county sewer system is measured by a
device which is approved by the water and sewage department and is installed
and maintained at the owner’s expense; and, provided further, the water supply
of the property is metered and the owner pays for the water at the current
metered rate.
   (B)   The sewer customer will pay a user charge based on water consumption.
The charge is computed according to the water and sewer rate methodology
documents using the quantity of water actually discharged into the county sewer
system. If, in the opinion of the department, it is not practical to install a
measuring device to determine the quantity of water discharged into the sewer
system, the water and sewage department may calculate the percentage of metered
water discharged into the sewer system. The quantity of water used to determine
the sewer service charge shall be the percentage so calculated of the quantity
measured by the water meters.
   (C)   Any dispute as to calculation shall be submitted to the county manager
after notice of the estimate is received. The county manager’s decision on the
matter shall be final.
(‘77 Code, § 7-87) (Ord. 1585, passed 10-21-85)
§ 52.21 TIME AND METHOD OF PAYMENT OF SERVICE CHARGES.
   (A)   All sewer service charges shall be due and payable at the same time
and place that water bills are due and payable. They shall be included in the
water bill but stated separately and collected at the same time and in the same
manner. If not paid in full within the time limit for the payment of water
bills, in addition to any and all other penalties provided by law, the county
may cut off water service to the property.
   (B)   For sewer service only customers, the charges will be billed in the
same manner as water charges or water and sewer charges. They shall be subject
to the same time limit for payment as water charges, in addition to any and all
penalties provided by law. The county may cut off sewer service to the property
for failure to pay sewer service charges.
(‘77 Code, § 7-88) (Ord. 1585, passed 10-21-85)
§ 52.22 CHARGES FOR USE OF SYSTEM WITHOUT PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF COUNTY DEPARTMENT.
   (A)   (1)   If wastewater is discharged into the county system without the
actual knowledge of the county, a bill will be made against the user or
customer for the estimated amount of the discharge or for the quantity of water
shown to have been used by the meter.
      (2)   If the sewer service was obtained through an unauthorized device,
the service may be terminated immediately.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of a stopped, broken or damaged meter that has not
registered actual usage of water used by the customer or users, an estimated
bill will be calculated based on prior usage. In the case of no prior usage
history, an estimated bill will be calculated based on a similar type of
customer.
      (2)   The water and sewer accounts billing office, may establish a
procedure for payment of the bill, based on the amount and user’s ability to
pay if the user or customer is not able to pay the bill in full.

service charges have been paid, the deposit will be refunded.
   (B)   Sewer use. Domestic septic tank sludge, treatment plant waste sludge
and wastewater from portable sanitary privies shall only be discharged into
manholes specifically designated by the Water and Sewer Department for this
purpose. The user will be responsible for any and all damages resulting from
improper handling and/or spillage. Continued spillage and/or poor handling
practices shall be cause for revocation of permission to discharge.
   (C)   Conditions. A permit to haul each load of septic tank sludge,
treatment plant waste sludge or wastewater from portable sanitary privies is
required. Permits shall be obtained from the State Department of Health and
Environmental Control and the water and sewage department. The permits must be
in the possession of the hauler/user at the time of discharge into the county
sewer system.
   (D)   Charges. Charges for discharge of domestic septic tank sludge,
treatment plant waste sludge or wastewater from portable sanitary privies will
be calculated and billed monthly. The charges will be based on data from the
hauling permits issued by the county and the State Department of Health and
Environmental Control. Failure to pay bills by the date due shall be cause for
revocation of permission to discharge.

§ 52.43 GENERAL DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS.
   (A)   No user shall contribute or cause to be contributed directly or
indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater which will interfere with the operation
or performance of the systems. These general prohibitions apply to all users of
the systems whether or not the user is subject to national categorical
pretreatment standards or any other federal, state or local pretreatment
standards or requirements. A user may not contribute the following substances
to any systems, including any POTW receiving county wastewater:
      (1)   Any liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature or
quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by interaction with other
substances to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the
system or to the operation of the POTW. At no time, shall two successive
readings on any explosion hazard meter, at the point of discharge into the
system (or at any point in the system) be more than 5% nor any single reading
over 10% of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter. Prohibited materials
include, but are not limited to, gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, benzene, toluene,
xylene, ethers, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates,
perchlorates, bromates, carbides, hydrides and sulfides and any other
substances which the YCWSD, the operator of the POTW, the state or EPA has
notified the user is a fire hazard or a hazard to the system, and any waste
streams with closed cup flashpoint of less than 140° F or 60° C the test
methods specified in 40 C.F.R. Part 262.21.
      (2)   Solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction to the flow
in a sewer or other interference with the operation of the wastewater treatment
facilities such as, but not limited to: grease, garbage with particles greater
than ½ inch in any dimension, animal guts or tissues, paunch manure, bones,
hair, hides or fleshing, entrails, whole blood, feathers, ashes, cinders, sand,
spent lime, stone or marble dust, metal, glass, straw, shavings, grass
clippings, rags, spent grains, spent hops, waste paper, wood, plastics, gas,
tar, asphalt residues, residues from refining or processing of fuel or
lubricating oil, mud or glass grinding or polishing wastes;
      (3)   Any wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 unless the POTW is
specifically designed to accommodate the wastewater, or wastewater having any
other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures,
equipment and/or personnel of the POTW;
      (4)   Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity,
either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or interfere
with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or
animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the POTW, or to
exceed the limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. A toxic
pollutant shall include but not be limited to any pollutant identified pursuant
to § 307(a) of the Act;
      (5)   Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases or solids which either
singly or by interaction with other wastes are sufficient to create a public
nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry into the sewers
for maintenance and repair;
      (6)   Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent or any other
product of the POTW such as residues, sludges or scums, to be unsuitable for
reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case,
shall a substance discharge to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance
with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under
§ 405 of the Act; any criteria, guidelines or regulations affecting sludge use
or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air
Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act or state criteria applicable to the
sludge management method being used;
      (7)   Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate its NPDES and/or
state disposal system permit or the receiving water quality standards;
      (8)   Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in the
treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable
tanning solutions;
      (9)   Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological
activity in the POTW treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case
wastewater with a temperature at introduction to the POTW which exceeds 40° C
(104° F) unless the POTW treatment plant is designed to accommodate the
temperature and approves alternate temperature limits;
      (10)   Any pollutant, including oxygen demanding pollutants, (BOD, and
the like) released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration, which a user
knows or has reason to know will cause interference to the POTW. In no case
shall a slug load have a flow rate or contain concentration or qualities of
pollutants that exceed for any time period longer than 15 minutes more than
five times the average 24-hour concentration, quantities or flow during normal
operations;
      (11)   Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes or
the half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the YCWSD in
compliance with applicable state or federal regulations;
      (12)   Any wastewater which causes a hazard to human life or creates a
public nuisance;
   (B)   When YCWSD or the POTW determines that a user(s) is contributing to
the POTW any of the above enumerated substances in amounts as to interfere with
the operation of the POTW, YCWSD shall:
      (1)   Advise the user(s) of the impact of the contribution on the POTW;
and
      (2)   Develop effluent limitation(s) for user(s) to correct the

§ 52.54 MEASUREMENT OF FLOW/MONITORING FACILITIES.
   (A)   The volume of flow used in computing industrial waste surcharge shall
be based upon metered water consumption maintained by YCWSD. In the event that
a user discharging wastes into the YCWSD system provides YCWSD with evidence
that more than 10% of the total annual volume of water used does not reach the
POTW, an estimated percentage of total water consumption to be used in
computing industrial waste flows and surcharges may be agreed upon between
YCWSD and the user discharging industrial wastes into the POTW.
   (B)   YCWSD shall require to be provided and operated at the user's own
expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow
measurement of the building, sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The
monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but
YCWSD or POTW may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue
hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street
or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping
or parked vehicles.
   (C)   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility
to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The
facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in
a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.

§ 52.55 INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   (A)   The industrial waste of each user discharging same into the POTW shall
be subject to periodic inspection and a determination of the character and
concentration of such waste in order to assure compliance with the requirements
of this section and requirements of the applicable POTW. This inspection shall
be made annually, or more often as deemed necessary by YCWSD, the POTW, SCDHEC
or EPA. YCWSD or its designee and the representative of the POTW shall inspect
the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this code is
being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of
premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow YCWSD or its
designee and the POTW or its representatives ready access at all reasonable
time to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
records examination or in the performance of any of their duties and
responsibilities. YCWSD or its designee or representative, the POTW, SCDHEC and
EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devises as are
necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance, monitoring and/or
metering operations. When a user has security measures in force which would
require proper identification and clearance before entry into the user's
premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards
so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from YCWSD, the
POTW, SCDHEC and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the
purposes of performing their specific responsibilities.
   (B)   Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be representative of
the actual quality of the wastes. The laboratory methods used in the
examination of such wastes shall be those set forth in procedures established
by the EPA pursuant to § 304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR Part 136 and
amendments thereto, or with any other test procedures approved by the EPA.
Sampling shall be performed in accordance with techniques approved by the EPA.
Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not include a sampling or analytical technique for
the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication "Sampling and
Analysis Procedure Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants,"
April, 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical
procedures approved by the EPA.
   (C)   The determination by YCWSD or POTW of the character and concentration
of industrial wastes shall be binding as the basis for charges.
   (D)   Total costs incident to the supervision, inspection, sampling and
analyzing of wastes shall be made to users discharging wastes into the YCWSD
system.

wastewater to a level acceptable to YCWSD and the POTW shall be provided,
operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the
pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to YCWSD
and the POTW for review and shall be acceptable to YCWSD and the POTW before
construction of the facilities. The review of the plans and operating
procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying
the facilities as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to YCWSD and the
POTW under the provisions of this section. Any subsequent changes in the
pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported and be
acceptable to YCWSD and the POTW prior to the user's initiation of the changes.
   (B)   If additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance will be
required to meet the pretreatment standards, the user shall submit the shortest
schedule by which he or she will provide additional pretreatment. The
completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date
established for the applicable pretreatment standard. The following conditions
shall apply to this schedule:
      (1)   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such as, hiring an engineer,
completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for
major components, commencing construction, completing construction, and the
like);
      (2)   No increment referred to in division (B)(1) above shall exceed nine
months;
      (3)   No later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the
final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to YCWSD and
the POTW including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment
of progress to be met on the date and, if not, the date on which it expects to
comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps
being taken by the user to return the construction to the schedule established.
In no event shall more than nine months elapse between progress reports to
YCWSD.
   (C)   The POTW shall annually publish in the largest daily newspaper
published in the City of Rock Hill, a list of the significant industrial users
which were in significant noncompliance with their pretreatment permits at
least once during the 12 previous months. The notification shall also summarize
any enforcement actions taken against the user(s) during the same 12 months,
except for information construed to be confidential as set forth in §
52.70.
   (D)   All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall
be made available to officials of the EPA or approval authority upon request.

DROUGHT RESPONSE PLAN
§ 54.01 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS; DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   The County Council is charged with the protection of the health,
safety and welfare of the citizens of York County. The County Council
understands the fundamental need to make efficient use of the limited and
valuable water resource under its stewardship in order to protect the public's
health, and safety and environmental integrity. The County Council finds that
measures must be taken to insure that an adequate supply of water is available
for use and for human consumption, sanitation, fire protection, and for other
essential needs. The County Council further finds that the Drought Response Act
of 2000 (Code of Laws of South Carolina, 1976, Section 49-23-10, et seq., as
amended), provides authority for the county to develop and enact this Drought
Management and Response Plan ("Plan") in order to establish procedures for
managing water demand and evaluating supply options before and during a
drought-related water shortage and to set forth the authority, policy and
procedure by which the county will manage water demand during a drought-related
shortage.
   (B)   The management provisions of the plan seek to achieve the greatest
public benefit from domestic water use, sanitation, and fire protection; to
allow for the provision of water for other purposes in an equitable manner;
and, to outline the basis by which the county will internally prepare for water
shortages. The response provisions of the plan seek to achieve the greatest
public benefit from limited supplies of water needed for domestic water use,
sanitation, and fire protection; to provide for the allocation of water for
other purposes in an equitable manner; and, to provide the regulations by which
the county will manage and control its customer water usage during various
levels of a drought. Therefore, the plan is directed both towards an overall
reduction in water usage and the optimization of supply.
   (C)   If it becomes necessary to conserve water in its service area due to
drought, the plan authorizes County Manager to issue a declaration that
existing conditions prevent fulfillment of the usual water-use demands. The
declaration will serve to prevent depletion of the water supply and attempt to
prevent depletion of the supply to the extent that water-use for human
consumption, sanitation, fire protection, and other essential needs becomes
endangered.
   (D)   Immediately upon issuance of such a declaration, the regulations and
restrictions set forth under this plan shall become effective and remain in
effect until the water supply shortage has ended and the declaration rescinded.
   (E)   Water uses that are regulated or prohibited under this plan are
considered to be nonessential and continuation of such uses during times of
water supply shortages is deemed to constitute a waste of water, subjecting the
offender(s) to penalties.
   (F)   To satisfy these goals and objectives, the County Council sets forth
the following plan, with regulations and restrictions, on the delivery and
consumption of water. This plan is declared necessary for the protection and
preservation of the public health, safety and welfare. Adoption of this plan by
County Council is pursuant to its powers as the governing body of the county
and in furtherance of the Drought Response Act of 2000, Code of Laws of South
Carolina, 1976, Section 49-23-10, et seq., as amended.

(‘77 Code, § 18-17) (Ord. 786, passed 9-15-86; Am. Ord. 104, passed 1-20-04;
Am. Ord. 7208, passed 11-3-08)
§ 54.03 DROUGHT MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   Introduction. To ensure that the county adequately manages its water
system during drought- related conditions, an organized plan is necessary for
system operation and reliability, proper communications, effective coordination
and ultimate allocation of water use. Prior planning will compliment the
county's ability to respond to drought conditions and to enforcement of plan
regulations and restrictions.
   (B)   Designation of Water System Drought Response Representative.
Administration of a Drought Management and Response Plan requires the skills
needed to undertake a comprehensive public information program and the
judgement required to deal with equity issues arising from enforcement of a
mandatory program. A drought response representative is therefore necessary to
manage the county's water system program and serve as the principal contact for
the news media as the water system's drought response representative. The
drought response representative for the county is the County Manager, Post
Office Box 66, York, South Carolina, 29745. This representative can be
contacted by calling the County Manager's office at (803) 684-8511.
   (C)   Description of water system layout, water sources, capacities and
yields:
      (1)   The county's water system is located in the Central or Santee
Drought Response Management Area of South Carolina. The system serves customers
in unincorporated areas in the northeast quadrant of the county. As of the year
2008, the following statistics apply to the county Water and Sewer Department:
         (a)   Serves approximately 9,000 customers;
         (b)   Consists of 70 miles of water mains;
         (c)   Purchases water from Rock Hill as a primary supplier. Rock Hill
has a SCDHEC permitted water treatment plant capacity of 30 million gallons per
day. Purchases water from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utilities Department as an
alternate supply;
         (d)   Has pumping capacity of up to 4 million gallons per day; and
         (e)   Consists of 3.6 million gallons of storage.
      (2)   The county water and sewer system consists of two systems that
function independently. Both systems pump finished water from supply points
master metered at service area boundaries. The county west system water is
pumped from a booster station on Mt. Gallant Road near Rock Hill. The station
has three booster pumps with 125 HP motors capable of pumping in excess of
2,000 GPM. The system consists of 20 miles of distribution piping and four
water storage tanks of 1.5 million gallon capacity total. The county east
system water is pumped from a booster station on the east side of 1-77 at SC
Hwy. 160. The station operates with two booster pumps with 50 HP motors capable
of pumping in excess of 1,000 GPM. The system consists of 50 miles of
distribution piping and five water storage tanks of 2.1 million gallon capacity
total.
   (D)   Identification of water system specific drought or water shortage
indicators. Operators of every water system must develop historical trends that
are valuable indicators of a system's ability to meet demand when demand begins
to outpace supply. The county's wholesale suppliers have developed system-
specific indicators for use during demand water shortages. These indicators
describe when the various phases of the county's drought response are to be
implemented and meet the requirements of the Drought Response Act of 2000 and
the low inflow protocol for Duke Energy’s Catawba-Wateree project. The
identified system-specific drought phases and wholesale supplier's system
indicators are as follows:
      (1)   Stage 0 - drought watch.
      (2)   Stage 1 - drought/voluntary conservation.
      (3)   Stage 2 - drought/mandatory conservation.
      (4)   Stage 3 - drought/increased mandatory conservation.
      (5)   Stage 4 - drought/emergency conservation.
   (E)   Cooperative agreements and alternative water supply sources.
Successful drought management requires a comprehensive program by the water
utility. In many situations administrative agreements are required with other
agencies to fully implement the plan. Agreements with other water purveyors may
be necessary for alternative water supply sources. Other agreements that
strengthen conservation efforts by large users may be necessary. The county
identifies the following agreements that are in place to facilitate the
implementation of this plan:
      (1)   Water service agreement between the City of Rock Hill and the
county, dated 6-20-2005.
      (2)   Water service agreement between the Town of Fort Mill and the
county, dated 9-21-2001.
   (F)   Description of pre-drought planning efforts. Before the occurrence of
a water supply shortage and the need to implement the emergency provisions of
the plan, it is important that certain pre-response measures be taken with the
aim of conserving the system's source water, as well as the water distributed
to the customer. In regards to the conservation measures listed below, the
county has taken the following actions:
      (1)   On an annual basis, the county will identify the top 10% of the
system's major water users, including industrial and wholesale customers. As
major water consumers, the county will strongly encourage these customers to
enter into conservation agreements and/or voluntarily reduce water consumption
by specified percentages as deemed necessary based on the declared drought
status.
      (2)   A vigorous public education program is critical for achieving
substantial water use reductions. An effective public outreach program will
keep the public informed about the water supply situation, what actions will
mitigate drought emergency problems, and how well the public is doing in terms
of meeting the program goals. Keeping the public involved, informed, and
participating in the decision-making process is key to implementing an
effective drought management plan. Water conservation and drought management
information will be conveyed to the county's customers through utility bills,
public notices, County Council or other public meetings.
   (G)   Description of capital planning and investment for system reliability
and demand forecasting. The county's water distribution system is regulated by
South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control standards. SCDHEC
requires that the water utility plan include and implement a capital
improvement program to address current customer demand and anticipated system
growth. In response to present and anticipated demand over the next five years
the county has implemented incremental capital improvements to enhance system
ability.

§ 54.04 DROUGHT RESPONSE - PROCLAMATION OF DROUGHT PHASES; OTHER RELATED
RESTRICTION; AND RATIONING.
   (A)   Stage 0 drought watch. In cooperation with York County's wholesale
water suppliers, the county will enter the drought watch stage based upon the
indicators as contained in Duke Energy's low inflow protocol document. During
this period, county staff will regularly communicate with all wholesale
providers, public water utilities sharing the system, and other local, state,
and federal agencies to actively monitor drought conditions, review drought
forecasts, and review plans for drought management response and mitigation.
During a drought watch, York County may encourage customers to consider
voluntary water conservation measures in a proactive effort to mitigate
potential drought conditions.
   (B)   Stage 1 drought / voluntary conservation. Upon determination by the
county and its wholesale providers that a moderate water supply shortage
exists, the county will reserve the right to seek voluntary reductions from its
customers in the use of water for all purposes and voluntary reductions on
using water during certain peak water demand periods. Specifically, the goal
during this phase is to achieve a reduction in overall water use of 3 -5%. To
accomplish this, the county will take the following actions:
      (1)   The County Manager will issue a declaration to be released to local
media, the county customers and to the South Carolina Department of Natural
Resources Drought Information Center that stage 1 drought conditions are
present;
      (2)   Provide written notification to the South Carolina Department of
Natural Resources Drought Information Center and publish in a newspaper of
general circulation in the service area of the water system the voluntary
conservation measures that the customers are requested to follow during stage 1
drought conditions, including:
         (a)   Recommend voluntary reduction of residential water use to a
maximum of 350 gallons per household or REU per day;
         (b)   For landscape design and maintenance, the use of low volume hand
held water applications or drip irrigation is encouraged. Recommend the
reduction in the use of sprinklers, irrigation systems or other remote
landscaping devices to no more than two days per week. Established lawns need
only one inch of water per week from a combination of irrigation and rain.
Encourage outdoor watering to be done during off-peak hours;
         (c)   Reduce the washing down of sidewalks, walkways, driveways,
parking lots, tennis courts and other hard surfaced areas;
         (d)   Reduce the washing down of buildings for purposes other than
immediate fire protection;
         (e)   Reduce the flushing of gutters;
         (f)   Reduce the domestic washing of motorbikes, boats, cars,
automobiles, and the like;
         (g)   Reduce the use of water to maintain fountains, reflection ponds
and decorative water bodies for aesthetic or scenic purposes, except where
necessary to support aquatic life;
         (h)   Reduce the amount of water obtained from fire hydrants for
construction purposes, fire drills or for any purpose other than fire-fighting
or flushing necessary to maintain water quality; and
      (3)   Intensify maintenance efforts to identify and correct water leaks
in the distribution system. The utility reserves the right to cease water
service to customers who have been given a ten-day notice to repair one or more
leaks and have failed to do so; and
      (4)   Continue to encourage and educate customers to comply with
voluntary water conservation.
   (C)   Stage 2 drought / mandatory conservation. Upon determination by the
county and its wholesale providers that a severe water supply shortage exists,
the county will reserve the right to impose mandatory restrictions in the use
of water for all purposes and restrictions on times when certain water usage is
allowed. Specifically, the goal during this phase is to achieve a reduction in
overall water use of 5 - 10%. To accomplish these goals, the county will take
the following actions:
      (1)   The County Manager will issue a declaration to be released to the
local media, the county customers and to the South Carolina Department of
Natural Resources Drought Information Center that stage 2 drought conditions
are present;
      (2)   Provide written notification to the South Carolina Department of
Natural Resources Drought Information Center and publish in a newspaper of
general circulation in the service area of the water system the voluntary
conservation measures and mandatory restrictions to be placed on the use of
water supplied by the utility, including:
         (a)   Recommend voluntary reduction of residential water use to a
maximum of 300 gallons per household or REU per day;
         (b)   The county will reserve the right to impose mandatory
restrictions on the use of water supplied by the utility for activities
including:
            1.   For landscape design and maintenance, the use of low-volume,
handheld watering applications or drip irrigation is encouraged. Restrict the
use of sprinklers, irrigation systems or other remote landscape watering
devices to no more than two days per week at designated times. Designated days
and times will be approved by the County Manager. There are no time-of-day
limitations on hand watering or drip irrigation of trees and shrubs during the
watering day;
            2.   Planting of new ornamental plants or seeding/sodding of lawns
is strongly discouraged. However, if newly seeded/sodded lawns require regular
watering to maintain healthy growth, customers may apply for a variance to
permit watering newly seeded/sodded lawns one time per day for the first two
weeks after the seeding/sodding takes place. Watering may only take place at
designated times as indicated in the variance;
            3.   In all cases of landscape irrigation and maintenance, water
runoff is strictly prohibited;
            4.   Discourage water-based recreational activities that require
filling newly constructed or drained structures such as swimming pools, water
slides or other water-based recreational equipment. Reduce filling or
maintaining public or private swimming pools to the minimal amount of make-up
water necessary to maintain the structural integrity of the pool and the
filtration system. Newly constructed public or private swimming pools may be
filled one time per drought period. Recycled water must be in use for water
slides and other water-related activities to continue operations;
            5.   Limit the washing down of sidewalks, walkways, driveways,
parking lots, tennis courts and other hard surfaced areas to designated days
and times as established by the utility. Professional commercial pressure
washing businesses are exempt from this mandatory restriction during a stage 2
drought;
            6.   Eliminate the washing down of buildings for purposes other
than immediate fire protection or regulatory compliance;
            7.   Eliminate the flushing of gutters;
            8.   Eliminate the use of water to maintain ornamental fountains,
artificial waterfalls, misting machines, reflection ponds and decorative water
bodies for aesthetic or scenic purposes, except for the minimum amount of make-
up water necessary to maintain aquatic life; and
            9.   Limit residential vehicle washing to designated days and times
as established by the utility. Encourage the use of commercial car washes that
use the industry's best management practices for the efficient use of water and
those that recycle, reclaim, or reuse a portion of their wash water in their
daily operations. Limit washing of vehicles in car dealerships or in commercial
fleets (rental cars) to no more than once per week except as required for
health and safety.
         (c)   Discourage obtaining water from fire hydrants for construction
purposes, fire drills or any purpose other than fire-fighting or flushing
necessary to maintain water quality.
         (d)   Limit use of water by commercial, agricultural and individual
customers including, but not limited to, the following:
            1.   Stop routinely serving water in restaurants unless requested;
            2.   Limit irrigating golf courses and any portion of its grounds;
            3.   Allow professional and commercial landscaping, nursery and
pressure washing businesses to continue normal operations using handheld hoses
with spring-loaded nozzles or by use of recycled water; and
            4.   Agricultural and livestock operations are encouraged to
implement conservation techniques, explore different water saving methods and
use alternative sources.
      (3)   Intensify maintenance efforts to identify and correct water leaks
in the distribution system. The utility reserves the right to cease water
service to customers who have been given a ten-day notice to repair one or more
leaks and have failed to do so;
      (4)   Publicize widely the penalties to be imposed for proposed mandatory
restrictions and the procedures to be followed if a variance in the
restrictions is requested;
      (5)   Expand the use of education and public relations efforts and
emphasize the penalties associated with violating the mandatory restrictions;
and
      (6)   Provide written notification monthly to the South Carolina
Department of Natural Resources Drought Information Center regarding the
success of the voluntary and mandatory restrictions.
   (D)   Stage 3 drought / increased mandatory conservation. Upon determination
by the county and its wholesale providers that a severe water supply shortage
exists, the county will reserve the right to impose increased mandatory
restrictions on the use of water for all purposes and restrictions on times
when certain water use is allowed. Specifically, the goal during this phase is
to achieve a reduction in overall water use of 10 – 20% or more. To accomplish
these goals, the county will take the following actions:
      (1)   The County Manager will issue a declaration to be released to the
local news media, county customers and to the South Carolina Department of
Natural Resources' Drought Information Center that stage 3 drought conditions
are present.
      (2)   Provide written notification to the South Carolina Department of
Natural Resources Drought Information Center and routinely publish in a
newspaper of general circulation in the service area of the water system the
increased mandatory conservation measures and restrictions to be placed on the
use of water supplied by the utility. Voluntary and mandatory restrictions
include:
         (a)   Recommend voluntary reduction of residential water use to a
maximum of 275 gallons per household or REU per day.
         (b)   York County will impose increased mandatory restrictions on the
use of water supplied by the utility for activities including:
            1.   For landscape design and maintenance, the use of low-volume,
hand held watering applications or drip irrigation is encouraged. Limit the use
of sprinklers, irrigation systems or other remote landscape watering devices to
one day per week at designated times. Designated days and times for all
addresses will be approved by the County Manager.
            2.   Prohibit filling or refilling swimming pools except for the
minimal amount of make-up water necessary to maintain a pools structural
integrity and filtration system.
            3.   Limit the washing to sidewalks, walkways, driveways, parking
lots, tennis courts, and other hard surfaced areas and structures to designated
day and time as established by the utility.
            4.   Limit residential vehicle washing to designated day and time
as established by the utility. Encourage the use of commercial car washes that
use the industry's best management practices for the efficient use of water and
those that recycle, reclaim, or reuse a portion of their wash water in their
daily operations. Limit washing of vehicles in car dealerships or in commercial
fleets (rental cars) to no more than once per week except as required for
health and safety.
         (c)   Customers are strongly encouraged to postpone planting of all
new landscaping until after drought conditions have subsided.
         (d)   Eliminate public building and street washing activities, except
as required for safety or to maintain regulatory compliance.
         (e)   Limit obtaining water from fire hydrants for construction
purposes, fire drills or any purpose other than fire-fighting or flushing
necessary to maintain water quality. No new fire hydrant permits will be issued
by the utility.
         (f)   Encourage industrial/manufacturing process changes that reduce
water consumption.
      (3)   In all cases of landscape irrigation and maintenance, water runoff
is strictly prohibited.
      (4)   Continue to intensify maintenance efforts to identify and correct
water leaks in the distribution system.
      (5)   Publicize widely the penalties to be imposed for increased
mandatory restrictions and the procedures to be followed if a variance in the
restrictions is requested.
      (6)   Continue the use of education and public relations efforts and
emphasize the penalties associated with violating the restrictions.
      (7)   Provide written notification monthly to the South Carolina
Department of Natural Resources Drought Information Center regarding the
success of the restrictions.
   (E)   Stage 4 drought/ emergency conservation. Upon determination by the
county and its wholesale providers that a severe water supply shortage exists,
the county will reserve the right to impose emergency restrictions on the use
of water for all purposes and restrictions on times when certain water use is
allowed. Specifically, the goal during this phase is to achieve a reduction in
overall water use of 25% or more. To accomplish these goals, the county will
take the following actions:
      (1)   The County Manager will issue a declaration to be released to the
local news media, county customers and to the South Carolina Department of
Natural Resources' Drought Information Center that stage 4 drought conditions
are present.
      (2)   Provide written notification to the South Carolina Department of
Natural Resources Drought Information Center and publish in a newspaper of
general circulation in the service area of the water system the proposed
emergency restrictions.
      (3)   York County will impose emergency restrictions on the use of water
supplied by the utility, including:
         (a)   Strongly recommend limiting residential water use to a maximum
of 250 gallons per household or REU per day.
         (b)   Restrict all outdoor water use.
         (c)   The use of sprinklers, irrigation systems or other remote
watering devices is strictly prohibited during a stage 4 drought.
         (d)   Customers are required to postpone planting of new landscaping
until after the emergency drought period has ended. Planting of new ornamental
plants or seeding/sodding of lawns is prohibited due to watering limitations.
During a stage 4 drought, customers who have newly seeded/sodded lawns that
require regular watering to maintain healthy growth may petition for a variance
from these emergency restrictions, however these customers are not guaranteed
that a variance will be granted.
         (e)   Strongly encourage all residential water customers to
voluntarily reduce overall monthly water usage to less than 75% of the
customer's monthly average.
      (4)   Publicize widely the penalties to be imposed for violations of
emergency restrictions and the procedures to be followed if a variance in the
restrictions is requested. Expand the use of education and public relations
efforts.

Department of Natural Resources Drought Information Center regarding the
success of the emergency restrictions.
   (F)   Other declared restrictions; rationing.
      (1)   If the conservation measures of the plan prove inadequate to
mitigate the effects of the drought conditions or water supply availability,
the county may take any additional actions or may choose to impose additional
restrictions as deemed necessary during any of the phases of drought
conditions, including rationing.
      (2)   Should the drought restrictions imposed by the county's primary
water providers or the Drought Management Advisory Group be more or less
stringent, the county reserves the right to modify its restrictions to comply
and conform to those recommended by the organizations.
      (3)   If a drought threatens protection of public health and safety, the
county is hereby authorized to ration water.
(Ord. 104, passed 1-20-04; Am. Ord. 7208, passed 11-3-08)
§ 54.05 ENFORCEMENT OF RESTRICTIONS.

existing water uses otherwise prohibited under the plan if it is determined
that failure to grant such variances could cause an emergency condition
adversely affecting health, sanitation and fire protection for the public. No
such variance shall be retroactive or otherwise justify any violation of this
plan occurring prior to the issuance of the variance. Variances granted by the
county shall include a timetable for compliance and shall expire when the water

person other than the owner or manager of the animals, the owner of the
trespassing stock shall be liable for all damages sustained and for the
expenses of seizure and maintenance. The damages and expenses shall be
recovered, when necessary, by action in any court of competent jurisdiction,

allowing Animal Control to lawfully take custody of the animal or an order
requiring the owner to provide certain care for the animal at the owner’s

   The County Council finds that it is in the public interest that procedures
be established for assigning names for new streets and roads, for processing
requests for naming existing unnamed roads and requests to change the names of
previously named roads in the unincorporated portions of the county. The County
Council finds that it is in the public interest that the department of public
safety communications maintains an up-to-date index listing the names of all
known public streets and roads in the unincorporated portions of the county and
an up-to-date map of the county showing the name and location of all known
public streets and roads. The Council further finds that it is in the public
interest that a uniform policy be adopted for assigning house numbers in
certain unincorporated portions of the county.

§ 57.16 PROCEDURES FOR ASSIGNING NAMES IN NEW SUBDIVISIONS OR DEVELOPMENTS.
   (A)   (1)   Before any new street or road shall be named in any
unincorporated portion of the county, the developer or owner of the subdivision
or development shall submit to the department of public safety communications
the first, second and third choices for names of the streets or roads, together
with a map, drawn to scale, showing the location of the streets or roads in
question and the location of all property or lots fronting thereon.
      (2)   If the suggested names do not duplicate or phonetically resemble
the names of any existing street or road in the county, regardless of the use
of a suffix such as street, avenue, boulevard, drive, lane, and the like, the
department of public safety communications shall recommend the road name
request as submitted to the Planning Commission.
   (B)   Following approval of a name for a street or road by the Planning
Commission, the planning department shall give written notification of the
approval to the department of public safety communications. The department of
public safety communications thereafter will notify all public safety entities,
developers, appropriate U.S. Postal facilities, and the most proximate city or
town of the approved changes.
   (C)   (1)   In the event one or more street or road names are not approved
because the street or road names duplicate or phonetically resemble the names
of existing streets or roads, the developer will be notified in writing of the
disapproval.
      (2)   The owner, developer or sub-divider of the property in which the
new street or road is established may appeal a denial of the decision to the
Planning Commission. An application for appeal can be obtained from the
planning department. This appeal shall be filed within 15 days of written
notification from the county on the denial of a road or street name.
   (D)   The department of public safety communications shall maintain an up-
to-date index listing the names of all streets and roads in the county,

street or road, which notice shall specify the date, time and place that the
public hearing will be held. The Planning Commission shall conduct a public
hearing upon the request, which public hearing may coincide with the next
regularly scheduled meeting of the Planning Commission and interested parties
and the public at large may be heard in support of or in opposition to the
requested change of name.

COMMUNICATIONS OR PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (A)   The Planning Commission or the department of public safety

change of name of any street or road within the county:
      (1)   When there is duplication of names or other conditions which tend
to confuse the traveling public or the delivery of mail, orders or messages;

§ 70.10 REGULATION OF OFF-HIGHWAY VEHICLES.
   (A)   Legislative findings. The York County Council, as the governing body
of York County, South Carolina, finds that there has been a proliferation of
the use of all off-highway vehicles within public rights-of-way, utility
rights-of-way, and on private property without the consent of the owners of
such property. The York County Council finds that the unregulated use of all
off-highway vehicles disturbs the public peace and threatens the health, safety
and welfare of citizens of York County; damages the integrity of public rights-
of-way, utility rights-of-way and damages private property; causes excessive
noise and dust; constitutes a risk to the safety of operators of all off-
highway vehicles and the general public; and should be regulated in order to
provide for the health, safety, and welfare of York County and its citizens.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.

and having an engine displacement of less than 800 cubic centimeters.
      OFF-HIGHWAY MOTORCYCLE. Any motorized, off-highway vehicle traveling on
two wheels, having a seat or saddle designed to be straddled by the operator

safety agency or any fire department, hospital or ambulance service while
providing or exercising official duties and powers; or to the operation of off-
highway vehicles on private property owned by the operator or for which the
operator has written permission from the owner.
   (D)   Owner's responsibility. It is unlawful for the owner of an off-highway
vehicle to permit its operation on private property without permission of the
owner or occupant; within public rights-of-way except as provided by law; or
within rights-of-way of public or private utilities without the written consent
of such utilities.
   (E)   Liability insurance required. No off-highway vehicle as defined in
this Code will be required to be insured under a liability insurance policy
unless such vehicle is required to be insured under a liability insurance
policy in compliance with existing or subsequently enacted statutory insurance
requirements for such vehicles under South Carolina law. All vehicles,

adequate exit facilities, automatic or other fire alarm apparatus or fire
extinguishing equipment, or by reason of age or dilapidated condition, or from
any other cause, creates a hazardous condition.
   (B)   Whenever the fire official or the official’s duly authorized
representative deems any chimney, smokestack, stove, oven, incinerator, furnace
or other heating device, electric fixture or any appurtenance thereto or
anything regulated under a nationally approved standard in or upon any
building, structure or premises not specifically mentioned in this code, to be
defective or unsafe so as to create an immediate hazard, the official shall

complied with by the owner, operator, occupant or other person responsible for
the condition or violation to which the order or notice pertains. Every order
or notice shall set forth a time limit for compliance dependent upon the hazard

complied with by the owner unless the owner and occupant have otherwise agreed
between themselves, in which event the occupant shall comply.
   (C)   No person shall remove a notice affixed under §

§ 94.01 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
   Incident to the adoption of this chapter, the York County Council, as the
governing body of York County, South Carolina, makes the following findings:
   (A)   York County is a body politic and political subdivision of the State
of South Carolina and as such possesses all powers granted to counties by the
Constitution and the laws of the State of South Carolina including the powers
enumerated in S.C. Code §§ 4-9-10 et seq. The York County Council is authorized
and empowered to enact regulations, resolutions and ordinances in relation to
health and order in counties or respecting any subject as appears to them
necessary or proper for the security, general welfare and convenience of
counties or for preserving health, peace, order and good government in them as
provided in S.C. Code §§ 4-9-10 et seq., as amended, including S.C. Code § 4-9-
25 thereof and the general law.
   (B)   Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor
to indoor air pollution and that breathing second hand smoke (also known as
environmental tobacco smoke) is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers,
including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer. The
National Cancer Institute has determined that secondhand smoke is responsible
for the early deaths of up to 65,000 Americans annually. [National Cancer
Institute (NCI), "health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke;
the report of the California Environmental Protection Agency, Smoking and
Tobacco Control Monograph 10," Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health,
National Cancer Institute (NCI), August 1999.]. The Surgeon General has
declared that (i) secondhand smoke causes disease and premature death in
nonsmokers exposed to smoke; (ii) children exposed to secondhand smoke have an
increased risk for sudden death syndrome, acute respiratory infections, ear
problems, and more severe asthma; (iii) adults exposed to secondary smoke have
a higher risk of coronary heart disease and lung cancer, (iv) there is no safe
level of exposure to second hand smoke, and (v) separating smoking and non
smoking sections of indoor areas does not sufficiently remove the threats of
secondhand smoke in enclosed areas.
   (C)   A significant amount of second hand smoke exposure occurs in the
workplace. Employees who work in smoke-filled businesses suffer a 25-50% higher
risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and
cancer, as well as increased acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease
in lung function. (Pitsavos, C; Panagiotakos, D.B.; Chrysohoon, C; Skoumas, J.;
Tzioumis, K.; Stefanadis, C; Toutouzas, P., "Association between exposure to
environmental tobacco smoke and the development of acute coronary syndromes:
the CARIO2000 case-control study, "Tobacco Control" 11(33): 220-225, September
2002.)
   (D)   Smoke-filled workplaces result in higher worker absenteeism due to
respiratory disease, lower productivity, higher cleaning and maintenance costs,
increased health insurance rates, and increased liability claims for diseases
related to exposure to secondhand smoke. ("The high price of cigarette
smoking," Business & Health 15(8), Supplement A: 6-9, August 1997.)
   (E)   When there is a presence of second hand smoke in enclosed spaces or in
outside areas where there is a public gathering resulting in people being in
close proximity in places that are otherwise open to the public at large
persons who do not smoke are forced to bear unwarranted health risks and
inappropriate deprivation of peaceful enjoyment of the premises to which they
have been invited or permitted to enter, even when steps have been taken to
separate "smoking" and "nonsmoking" areas within the confined space.
   (F)   The county recognizes that smoke creates a danger to the health and
safety of the public at large and that, in order to protect the health and
welfare of the public, it is necessary to restrict smoking in the manner
provided for in this chapter (the "Ordinance").
(Ord. 909, passed 2-2-09)

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 111.001 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
   The County Council, as the governing body of York County, South Carolina, as
an incident to the enactment of this chapter, has made the following
legislative findings and determinations:
   (A)   The county finds that it is authorized and empowered by S.C. Code §§
58-12-30 et seq., to regulate the operations of any cable television system
which serves customers within its territorial limits by the issuance of
franchises.
   (B)   The County Council finds that it is necessary and proper to exercise
its power to grant franchises for the provision of cable television service in
the unincorporated area of the county in order to provide for the orderly
control of cable television system and services.
(Ord. 3502, passed 10-7-02)
§ 111.002 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The county finds that the development of cable television and
communications systems has the potential of having great benefit and impact
upon the people of the county. Because of the complex and rapidly changing
technology associated with cable television, the county further finds that the
public convenience, safety and general welfare can best be served by
establishing certain regulatory powers, which may be vested in the county or
such persons as the county shall designate.
   (B)   Further, it is recognized that cable communications systems have the
capacity to provide not only entertainment and information services to the
county's residents but can also provide a variety of broadband, interactive
communications services to institutions and individuals.
   (C)   For these purposes, the following goals underlie the regulations
contained herein:
      (1)   Where economically and technically feasible, communications
services should be available to the maximum number of county residents, as
provided for herein;
      (2)   The cable television systems should be capable of accommodating
both the present and reasonably foreseeable future communications needs of the
county to the extent that such integration is economically and technically
feasible;
      (3)   The cable television systems should be maintained as necessary
during the franchise term so that the new facilities, if any, may be integrated
to the maximum extent possible with existing facilities; and
      (4)   The communications systems authorized by this article shall be
responsive to the needs and interests of the local community;
   (D)   The public, educational and governmental needs for reasonable access
to the cable system shall be met.
(Ord. 3502, passed 10-7-02)
§ 111.003 TITLE.
   (A)   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "York County Cable
Communications Regulatory Ordinance," and it shall become a part of the
ordinances of the county.
   (B)   This chapter shall take effect and be in force from and after the date
as established herein.
   (C)   All ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict with the provisions
of this chapter are hereby repealed. The provisions of this chapter are hereby
declared to be severable, and if any provision or section of this chapter is
declared to be unconstitutional or unenforceable by the final order of a court
of competent jurisdiction, such declaration shall not affect the

§ 111.015 GRANT OF FRANCHISE; TERRITORY.
   (A)   Grant of franchise.
      (1)   In the event that the county shall grant to the grantee a
nonexclusive, revocable-for-cause as provided herein, franchise to construct,
operate and maintain a cable communications system within the county, said
franchise shall constitute both a right and an obligation to provide cable
services, as regulated by the provisions of this chapter and the franchise
agreement.
      (2)   The franchise agreement shall include by reference those provisions
of the grantee's "application for franchise" that are finally negotiated and
agreed to by the county and grantee.
   (B)   Terms/conditions. The franchise shall be granted under the terms and
conditions contained in this chapter, except as they may be varied by the
franchise agreement itself, consistent with the other applicable statutory
requirements. In the event of conflict between the terms and conditions of this
chapter or the franchise agreement and the statutes, statutory requirements
shall control.
   (C)   Ordinance provisions. Any franchise granted by the county is hereby
made subject to the applicable general ordinance provisions of the county now
in effect and hereafter made effective. Nothing in the franchise shall be
deemed to waive the requirements of the various general codes and ordinances of
the county regarding permits, fees to be paid or manner of construction.
   (D)   Franchise territory. The franchise territory shall be the entire
county, or portions thereof, for which a franchise is granted under authority
of this chapter. The service area shall be the entire territory defined in the
franchise agreement.
(Ord. 3502, passed 10-7-02)
§ 111.016 USE OF PUBLIC STREETS AND WAYS; COUNTY AND GRANTEE FACILITIES.
   (A)   Public streets and ways. For the purpose of operating and maintaining
a cable communications system in the county, the grantee may erect, install,
construct, repair, replace, reconstruct and/or retain in, on, over, under,
upon, across and along the public streets and ways within the county such
wires, cables, conductors, ducts, conduits, vaults, manholes, amplifiers,
appliances, pedestals, attachments and other property and equipment as are
necessary to the operation of the cable communications system; provided,
however, that the grantee complies with all design, construction, safety and
performance provisions contained in this chapter, the franchise agreement and
other applicable regulations.
   (B)   County facilities.  At the county's option, the county may require a
grantee to utilize county owned conduit or other suitable facilities for any
portion of its cable communications system which is being newly constructed or
rebuilt. The consideration, if any, for the use of county conduit or other
facilities shall be as stated in the franchise agreement. A reasonable fee, if
any, for the use of county facilities established in the franchise agreement
may be adjusted at the periodic performance evaluations.
   (C)   Grantee facilities. No poles shall be erected by the grantee without
prior approval of the appropriate governing authorities with regard to
location, height, type and any other pertinent aspect. However, no location of
any pole of the grantee shall be a vested right, and such poles shall be
removed or modified by the grantee at its own expense whenever the appropriate
governing authority determines that the public convenience would be enhanced
thereby. The grantee shall utilize existing poles and conduits, where possible.
The county shall have the right, during the life of the franchise, to install
and maintain upon the poles owned by the grantee, at fair market value under
the same terms and conditions as other users of the poles, any wire and pole
fixtures that do not unreasonably interfere with the cable system operations of
the grantee.
(Ord. 3502, passed 10-7-02)
§ 111.017 FRANCHISE REQUIRED; TERM, ACCEPTANCE.
   (A)   Required. No cable communications system shall be allowed to occupy or

   (B)   Term. The term of any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall
be ten years, unless otherwise stated in the franchise agreement.
   (C)   Acceptance.
      (1)   Following approval by the county, any franchise granted pursuant to
this chapter, and the rights, privileges and authority granted thereunder,
shall take effect and be in force from and after the date on which the grantee
accepts, signs and affixes its corporate seal to the franchise agreement.
      (2)   By accepting the franchise, the grantee agrees to be bound by all
the terms and conditions contained in this chapter and said franchise. The
grantee also agrees to provide all services specifically set forth in its
application to provide cable television service within the confines of the
county, and by its acceptance of the franchise, the grantee specifically
acknowledges and agrees that its application is thereby attached and
incorporated by reference and made a part of the franchise.
      (3)   By accepting the franchise, the grantee acknowledges that it does
so relying upon its own investigation and understanding of the county in
connection with the system and the franchise.
      (4)   By accepting the franchise, the grantee acknowledges that it has
not been induced to enter into the franchise by any understanding or promise or
other statement not expressed therein, whether oral or written, concerning any
term or condition of the franchise, regardless of whether such statement was
made by or on behalf of the county.
      (5)   By accepting the franchise, the grantee acknowledges that it has
carefully read the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement.
   (D)   Nonexclusive. Any franchise granted hereunder shall be nonexclusive.
The county specifically reserves the right to grant at any time such additional
franchises containing substantially equivalent standards, terms and conditions

deems appropriate.
   (E)   Time of the essence. Whenever the franchise agreement shall set forth
any time for an act to be performed by or on behalf of either party, such time
shall be deemed of the essence, and any failure of the party to perform within
the time allotted shall always be sufficient ground for the other party to
invoke an appropriate penalty.
   (F)   South Carolina law governs. In any controversy or dispute under this
chapter, the law of the State of South Carolina shall apply to the extent such
law has not been superseded or preempted.
   (G)   Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or
portion of this chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by
any court of competent jurisdiction, or by any federal, state, county, or local
statute or regulation, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and
independent provision and shall be excised as such; and such holding shall not
affect the validity of the remaining portions hereof.
(Ord. 3502, passed 10-7-02)
§ 111.018 TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL.
   (A)   Transfer/sale/lease/assignment. Any franchise granted hereunder cannot
in any event be sold, transferred, leased, assigned or disposed of, including
but not limited to by force or voluntary sale, receivership or other means,
without the prior consent of the county, and then under such reasonable
conditions as the county may establish.
   (B)    Notice. The grantee shall promptly notify the county of any actual or
proposed change in, transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of control
by the grantee or of its franchise privileges, directly or indirectly, by sale,
by gift or assignment to any person or entity not previously in control of the
grantee or under common control with the grantee, voluntary sale, merger,
consolidation or otherwise, except publicly traded issue, not in control of the
grantee. The word "control" as used herein is not limited to major stockholders
but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. A rebuttable
presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the
disposal by the grantee, directly or indirectly, by gift, assignment, voluntary
sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of 5% or more at one time of the
ownership or controlling interest in the system, or 20% cumulatively over the
term of the franchise, of such interests to a corporation, partnership, limited
partnership, trust or association, or person or group of persons acting in
concert.
   (C)   Franchise subject to cancellation. Every change, transfer or
acquisition of control for which notice is required under subsection (B) above
by the grantee shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and
until the county shall have consented thereto, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld.
      (1)   For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such
change, transfer or acquisition of control, the county may inquire into the
legal, financial, character, technical and other public interest qualifications
of the prospective controlling party, and the grantee shall assist the county
in any such inquiry.
      (2)   Consistent with applicable federal regulations, in connection with
any request for approval, the grantee shall submit to the county all
information reasonably requested by the county, and will otherwise comply with
all federal regulations in connection with any proposed change, transfer or
acquisition of control. Failure to do so may result in the county's denying the
request pursuant to such regulations.
   (D)   Pledge of franchise. The county agrees that any financial institution
having a pledge of the franchise or its assets for the advancement of money for
the construction and/or operation of the franchise shall have the right to
notify the county that it, or its designees satisfactory to the county, will
take control and operate the cable television system.
      (1)   Further, said financial institution shall also submit a plan for
such operation that will ensure continued service and compliance with all
franchise obligations during the term the financial institution exercises
control over the system.
      (2)   The financial institution shall not exercise control over the
system for a period exceeding one year, unless extended by the county at its
discretion, and during said period of time it shall have the right to petition
for transfer of the franchise to another grantee.
      (3)   If the county finds that such transfer, after considering the
legal, financial, character, technical and other public-interest qualifications
of the applicant, is satisfactory, the county will transfer and assign the
rights and obligations of such franchise as are in the public interest.
      (4)   The consent of the county to such transfer shall not be
unreasonably withheld.
   (E)   County consent. The consent or approval of the county to any transfer
of the grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the
county or other governmental entity in and to the streets, and any transfer
shall, by its terms, be expressly subordinate to the terms and conditions of
this chapter and the franchise agreement.
   (F)   Non-approval. In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the
county will not approve any transfer or assignment of the franchise prior to
completion or rebuild of construction of the proposed system.
   (G)   Controlling party signatory. Any approval by the county of transfer of
ownership or control or rebuilds of the cable system shall be contingent upon
the prospective controlling party becoming a signatory to the transfer
amendment with the county.
(Ord. 3502, passed 10-7-02)
§ 111.019 FRANCHISE RENEWAL; POLICE POWERS.
   (A)   Renewal. Upon completion of the term of any franchise granted under
this chapter, the county may grant or deny renewal of the franchise of the
grantee in accordance with the provisions of the Cable Act.
   (B)   Police powers.
      (1)   In accepting the franchise, the grantee acknowledges that its
rights hereunder are subject to the police powers of the county to adopt and
enforce reasonable general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of
the public; and it agrees to comply with all applicable general laws and
ordinances enacted by the county pursuant to such power.
      (2)   Any conflict between the provisions of this chapter or the
franchise and any other present or future lawful exercise of the county's
police powers shall be resolved in favor of the latter, except that any such
exercise that is not of general application in the jurisdiction, or applies
exclusively to the grantee or cable communications systems, which contains
provisions inconsistent with this chapter shall prevail only if, upon such
exercise, the county finds an emergency exists constituting a danger to health,
safety, property or general welfare and such exercise is mandated by law.

certified public accountant, reflecting the total amounts of annual gross

payment.
   (B)   Payment additional. This payment shall be in addition to any other tax
or payment owed to the county or other taxing jurisdiction by the grantee.

under this chapter.

made on or before the dates specified herein, the grantee shall pay an interest

reasonable.

fair market value.
      (5)   Upon receipt of reasonable notice of the county's intent to
purchase the system at the value established above, the grantee shall have 30

instruments of conveyance to the county as shall be necessary for this purpose.
      (7)   In the event the county and the grantee are unable to agree upon
the value of the cable communications system within the time limits set forth
above, either party may require by reasonable notice to the other that the
value of the cable communications system be submitted to arbitration in the

panel shall be in accordance with subsection (A)(4) above.

(Ord. 3502, passed 10-7-02)
§ 111.068 EXTENSION OF SERVICE.
   (A)   Density. The grantee shall provide service to any new residential
dwelling units or commercial subscribers within the initial service area and
any additional areas annexed to the county where there are at least 18
potential subscribers or residential dwelling units per proposed cable plant
mile for residentially zoned areas, and at least 50 subscribers per proposed
cable plant mile for commercially zoned areas, except where served by another
cable company.
   (B)   Lack of density. In other areas with less than 18 residential dwelling
units or 50 commercial subscribers per proposed cable plant mile, the grantee
shall offer a cost-sharing arrangement with residents. The cost-sharing
arrangement shall consist of the following:
      (1)   On the request of one or more potential subscribers desiring
service, the grantee shall prepare, at its cost, an engineering survey and cost
analysis to determine the cost of plant extension required to provide service
to each subscriber from the closest point where available quality signals
exist.
      (2)   The cost of construction shall be allocated based on the following
formula: If a request for extension of service into a residential area requires
the construction of cable plant which does not pass at least 18 potential
subscribers per strand or trench mile, the grantee and subscribers will each
bear their proportionate share of construction costs. For example, if there are
nine subscribers per strand mile or trench mile, the grantee's share will equal
9/18 or ½ of construction cost. The remaining cost will be shared equally by
each subscriber.
      (3)   The average cost of line extension shall be recalculated annually
and based upon then-current costs for labor and materials.
      (4)   The grantee shall be permitted to receive the share to be paid by
participating subscribers in advance of any work being performed.
      (5)   The grantee shall be permitted to administer and manage all aspects
of the plant extension project as are consistent with the grantee's cable
construction processes.
   (C)   New construction. In cases of new construction or property development

provided at the grantee's expense.
      (1)   The grantee shall also provide specifications as needed for
trenching. Costs of trenching and easements required to bring service to the
development shall be borne by the developer or property owner.
      (2)   Except for the notice of the particular date on which trenching
will be available to the grantee, any notice provided to the grantee by the
county of a preliminary plant request shall satisfy the requirement of
reasonable notice if sent to the local general manager or system engineer of
the grantee prior to approval of the preliminary plant request.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the State of South Carolina has in S.C. Code, Title 4,
Chapters 9 (Article 1), 25, and 27, and amendments thereto, delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
Therefore, the County Council of York County, South Carolina does ordain as
provided in this chapter.
(Ord. 2508, passed 6-2-08; Am. Ord. 2924, passed 6-3-24)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The areas of special flood hazard of York County are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   Furthermore, these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities,
and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
   (C)   Furthermore, upon examination of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency's National Flood Insurance Program standards for floodplain development,
York County Council has determined that, due to continuing growth and
development, topography and the extensive riverine floodplain systems, and a
recurring history oflocal flooding within the non-Special Flood Hazard Areas of
the Regent Park Community, the minimum standards of the National Flood
Insurance Program are not wholly sufficient to protect its citizens and their
properties from the effects of flooding, especially in situations where
flooding could be exacerbated by development that would otherwise be allowable
under the minimum standards of the National Flood Insurance Program, and that
higher standards and additional protections must be employed through creation
of a special community-based floodplain overlay district to protect the public
and property within the Regent Park Community of York County.
(Ord. 2508, passed 6-2-08; Am. Ord. 2924, passed 6-3-24)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to protect human life and health,
minimize property damage, and encourage appropriate construction practices to
minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that
uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be
protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. Uses of the
floodplain which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or
erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion are
restricted or prohibited. These provisions attempt to control the alteration of
natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are
involved in the accommodation of flood waters, and control filling, grading,
dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion.
Additionally, the chapter prevents or regulates the construction of flood
barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood
hazards to other lands.
   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are to protect human life and health,
to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize damages from
flooding, and to ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property
is in a flood area. The provisions of the chapter are intended to minimize
damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains,
electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in the
floodplain, and prolonged business interruptions. Also, an important floodplain
management objective of this chapter is to minimize expenditure of public money
for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding.
   (C)   Floodplains are an important asset to the community. They perform
vital natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters, moderation of
peak flood flows, maintenance of water quality, groundwater recharge,
prevention of erosion, habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations,
recreational opportunities, and aesthetic quality. These functions are best
served if floodplains are kept in their natural state. Wherever possible, the
natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water
bodies should be preserved and enhanced. Decisions to alter floodplains,
especially floodways and stream channels, should be the result of careful
planning processes that evaluate resource conditions and human needs.

§ 151.05 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE. Structures that are located on the same parcel of
property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the
use of the principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a
minimal investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to
have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are
detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING BUILDING). An extension or increase in the floor
area or height of a building or structure. ADDITIONS TO EXISTING BUILDINGS
shall comply with the requirements for new construction regardless as to
whether the addition is a substantial improvement or not. Where a firewall or
load-bearing wall is provided between the addition and the existing building,
the addition(s) shall be considered a separate building and must comply with
the standards for new construction.
   AGRICULTURE STRUCTURE. A structure used solely for agricultural purposes in
which the use is exclusively in connection with the production, harvesting,
storage, drying, or raising of agricultural commodities, including the raising
of livestock. AGRICULTURAL STRUCTURES are not exempt from the provisions of
this chapter.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the local administrator's interpretation
of any provision of this chapter.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or VO Zone on a community's flood
insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths of one to three feet where a
clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident.
   AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD. Also considered as a flood-prone area, the
land in the floodplain within a community subject to a 1% or greater chance of
flooding being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Areas of special flood
hazard, whether mapped or unmapped, and located outside of or beyond the
boundaries of any area indicated as a special flood hazard area (SFHA) as
mapped by the Federal Emergency Management Agency are not subject to the
National Flood Insurance Program's (NFIP's) floodplain management regulations
and the purchase of flood insurance is considered not mandatory.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year. This is the regulatory standard also referred to as the "100-year
flood."
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of surface water resulting from a
flood that has a 1% chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given
year.
   BASEMENT. Means any enclosed area of a building that is below grade on all
sides.
   BUILDING.  Any structure built for support, shelter, or enclosure for any
occupancy or storage.
   COMPENSATORY STORAGE. Excavation within or directly contiguous to a flood
hazard area, above the seasonal high groundwater table elevation and below the
design flood elevation, of a hydraulically-equivalent volume provided to
balance the effects of proposed fill and development in the flood hazard area
(no net loss of floodplain storage volume). Areas excavated for compensatory
storage shall become part of the flood hazard area and not be separated from
the flood hazard area by an open channel or closed conduit or culvert.
   CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT. A structure or other improvement that, because of its
function, size, service area, or uniqueness, has the potential to cause serious
bodily harm, extensive property damage, or disruption of vital socioeconomic
activities if it is destroyed or damaged or if its functionality is impaired .
Critical development, also known as critical facility or facilities, include
health care and safety facilities, utilities including water treatment,
wastewater treatment and pumping stations, government facilities, data
facilities, facilities that manufacture, utilize and/or store hazardous
materials, and any building or structure meeting the occupancy classification
of Category III and IV buildings in accordance with the Risk Assessment Table
of the latest edition of the International Building Code.
   DEVELOPMENT.  Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of
equipment or materials.
   ELEVATED BUILDING.  A non-basement building built to have the lowest floor
elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter
walls, pilings, columns, piers, or shear walls parallel to the flow of water.
   EXECUTIVE ORDER 11988 (FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT).  Issued by President Carter
in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be conducted
in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard areas,
unless there is no practicable alternative.
   EXISTING CONSTRUCTION.  Means, for the purposes of determining rates,
structures for which the start of construction commenced before February 3,
1993 (initial FIRM date, or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before
that date).
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR MANUFACTURED HOME SUBDIVISION. A
manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities
for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed
(including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of
streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is
completed before the initial ordinance date of November 4, 1981.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR MANUFACTURED HOME
SUBDIVISION. The preparation of additional sites by the construction of
facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be
affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets,
and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete slabs).
   FLOOD. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters, or the
unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). An official map of a community, issued by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, where the boundaries of the areas of
special flood hazard have been defined as Zone A.

the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of
special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY. The official report provided by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the flood
boundary floodway maps, non-encroachment area maps and the water surface
elevation of the base flood.
   FLOOD-RESISTANT MATERIAL. Any building material capable of withstanding
direct and prolonged contact (minimum 72 hours) with floodwaters without
sustaining damage that requires more than low-cost cosmetic repair. Any
material that is water-soluble or is not resistant to alkali or acid in water,
including normal adhesives for above-grade use, is not flood-resistant.
Pressure- treated lumber or naturally decay-resistant lumbers are acceptable
flooring materials. Sheet-type flooring coverings that restrict evaporation
from below and materials that are impervious, but dimensionally unstable are
not acceptable. Materials that absorb or retain water excessively after
submergence are not flood-resistant. Please refer to Technical Bulletin 2-93,
Flood-Resistant Materials for Buildings Located in Special Flood Hazard Areas
in Accordance with the National Flood Insurance Program, document number FIA-
TB-2, dated 4/93, and available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

entering a building. "Wet floodproofing" measures minimize damage to a
structure and its contents from water that is allowed into a building.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the portion of the
overbank floodplain that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation by a designated
height.
   FREEBOARD. A vertical-measured factor of safety usually expressed in feet
above the base flood elevation (BFE) for purposes of flood plain management.
FREEBOARD tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could
contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected
size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and
the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT FACILITY. A facility which cannot be used for its
intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to
water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and
unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood
processing facilities. The term does not include long-term storage,
manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface,

      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified:
         (a)   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
Interior; or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of lnterior in states without approved
programs. Some structures or districts listed on the state or local inventories
may not be "historic" as cited above, but have been included on the inventories
because it was believed that the structures or districts have the potential for
meeting the "historic" structure criteria of the DOI. In order for these
structures to meet NFIP historic structure criteria, it must be demonstrated
and evidenced that the South Carolina Department of Archives and History has
individually determined that the structure or district meets DOI historic
structure criteria.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC). Applies to all new and renewed flood
insurance policies effective on and after June 1, 1997. The NFIP shall enable
the purchase of insurance to cover the cost of compliance with land use and
control measures established under Section 1361. It provides coverage for the
payment of a claim to help pay for the cost to comply with state or community
floodplain management laws or ordinances after a flood event in which a
building has been declared substantially or repetitively damaged.
   LIMITED STORAGE. An area used for storage and intended to be limited to
incidental items that can withstand exposure to the elements and have low flood
damage potential. Such an area must be of flood resistant or breakaway
material, void of utilities except for essential lighting and cannot be
temperature controlled. If the area is located below the base flood elevation
in an A, AE and Al-A30 zone it must meet the requirements of § 151.35(D).
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE (LAG).  An elevation of the lowest ground surface that
touches any of the exterior walls of a building or proposed building walls.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area. Any unfinished
or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building
access, or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a
building's LOWEST FLOOR provided that such an enclosure is not built so as to
render the structure in violation of other provisions of this chapter.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. MANUFACTURED
HOME does not include a recreational vehicle.

1981.
   NON-ENCROACHMENT AREA (NEA). The channel of a river or other watercourse,
including the area above a bridge or culvert when applicable, and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot as
designated in the Flood Insurance Study report.
   NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM (NAVD) OF 1988. Vertical control, as corrected
in 1988, used as the reference datum on Flood Insurance Rate Maps.
   POST-FIRM BUILDING. For insurance rating and regulatory compliance purposes,
a post-FIRM building is one that was constructed or substantially improved
after December 31, 1974, or after the effective date of the initial Flood
Insurance Rate Map of a community, whichever is later.
   PRE-FIRM BUILDING.  For insurance rating and regulatory compliance purposes,

has incurred flood-related damages on two occasions during a ten-year period
ending on the date of the event for which a second claim is made, in which the
cost of repairing the flood damage, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25% of
the market value of the building at the time of each such flood event.
   SECTION 1316 OF THE NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE ACT OF 1968. The act provides
that no new flood insurance shall be provided for any property found by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency to have been declared by a state or local
authority to be in violation of state or local ordinances.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA).  Is defined by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) as an area having special flood, mudflow or flood-
related erosion hazards and shown on a Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) or a
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) Zone A, AO, Al-A30, AE, A99, AH, AR, ARIA, AR/
AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, AR/Al-A30, Vl-V30, VE or V. The SFHA is the area where the
National Flood Insurance Program's (NFIP's) floodplain management regulations
must be enforced and the area where the mandatory purchase of flood insurance
applies. For the purpose of determining Community Rating System (CRS) premium
discounts, all AR and A99 zones are treated as non-SFHAs.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION.  For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (P.L. 97-348), includes
substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit
date. The ACTUAL START means the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of
slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for footings, piers or
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the ACTUAL START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the
building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
building.
   STRUCTURE.  A walled and roofed building, a manufactured home, including a
gas or liquid storage tank, or other man-made facility or infrastructure that
is principally above ground.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE.  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Such repairs may be undertaken successively and their costs counted
cumulatively. Please refer to the definition of SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This term includes structures that have
incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include either:
      (1)   Any project of improvement to a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions (does not include
American with Disabilities Act compliance standards); or
      (2)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
      (3)   Permits shall be cumulative for a period of five years. If the
improvement project is conducted in phases, the total of all costs associated
with each phase, beginning with the issuance of the first permit, shall be
utilized to determine whether SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT will occur.
   SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION.
Where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets,
utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50% of the value of the streets, utilities
and pads before the repair, reconstruction, or improvement commenced.
   VARIANCE. Is a grant of relief from a term or terms of this chapter.
   VIOLATION.  The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with these regulations.
   WATERCOURSE.  Refers to the channel and banks of an identifiable
watercourse, and not the adjoining floodplain areas. The flood carrying
capacity of a watercourse refers to the flood carrying capacity of the channel
(except in the case of alluvial fans, where a channel is not typically
defined).

§ 151.10 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
consideration. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the special flood hazard area or uses permitted within
such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter does not
create liability on the part of York County or by any officer or employee
thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.

§ 151.23 DEVELOPMENT PERMIT; CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Development permit. Application for a development permit shall be made
to the local administrator on forms furnished by him or her prior to any
development activities. The development permit may include, but not be limited
to, plans drawn to scale showing: the nature, location, dimensions, and
elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures; and the
location of fill materials, storage areas, and drainage facilities.
Specifically, the following information is required:
      (1)   A plan that shows the 1% annual chance flood (also known as the
100-year floodplain area of special flood hazard) and the 0.2% annual chance
flood (also known as the 500-year flood hazard area) boundaries, including base
flood elevations, if available, or a statement that the entire lot is within an
area of special flood hazard must be provided by the development permit
applicant when the lot is within or appears to be within the floodplain as
mapped by the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the floodplain identified
pursuant to either the duties and responsibilities of the local administrators
of §
151.24, or the standards for subdivision proposals of §
151.36(N) and the standards for streams without estimated base flood elevations
and/or floodways of §
151.37. The plan must be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by it. The plan
must show the floodway or non- encroachment area, if any, as identified by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the floodway or non-encroachment area
identified pursuant to either the duties and responsibilities of the local
administrators of §
151.24 or the standards for subdivision proposals of §
151.36(N) and the standards for streams without estimated base flood elevations
and/or floodways of §
151.37.
      (2)   Where base flood elevation data is provided as set forth in §
151.04 or the duties and responsibilities of the local administrators of §
151.24(K), the application for a development permit within the flood hazard
area shall show:
         (a)   The elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest
floor of all new and substantially improved structures; and
         (b)   If the structure will be floodproofed in accordance with the
non-residential construction requirements of §
151.36(B), the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure
will be floodproofed.
      (3)   Where base flood elevation data is not provided as set forth in §
151.04 or the duties and responsibilities of the local administrators of §
151.24(K), the provisions in the standards for streams without estimated base
flood elevations and/or floodways of §
151.37 must be met.
      (4)   Where any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of
proposed development, the application for a development permit shall include:
         (a)   A description of the extent of watercourse alteration or
relocation;
         (b)   An engineering report, utilizing detailed methods accepted by
FEMA, on the effects of the proposed project on the flood-carrying capacity of
the watercourse and the effects to properties located both upstream and
downstream; and
         (c)   A map showing the location of the proposed watercourse
alteration or relocation.
      (5)   Prior to the commencement of any work on the alteration of a
watercourse, the applicant must procure and submit to the local administrator
any applicable Federal or State approvals or permits, including a Conditional
Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) if proposed work is located within a FEMA
special flood hazard area.
   (B)   Certifications.
      (1)   Floodproofing certification. When a structure is floodproofed, the
applicant shall provide certification from a registered, professional engineer
or architect that the non-residential, floodproofed structure meets the
floodproofing criteria in the non-residential construction requirements of §
151.36(B) and §
151.39(B)(2).
      (2)   Certification during construction. A lowest floor elevation or
floodproofing certification is required after the lowest floor is completed and
before the approval of a open floor inspection by the Building Official. As
soon as possible after completion of the lowest floor and before any further
vertical construction commences, or floodproofing by whatever construction
means, whichever is applicable, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to
submit to the local administrator a certification of the elevation of the
lowest floor, or floodproofed elevation, whichever is applicable, as built, in
relation to mean sea level. This certification shall be prepared by or under
the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional engineer
and certified by it. Any work done prior to submission of the certification
shall be at the permit holder's risk. The local administrator shall review the
floor elevation survey data submitted. The permit holder immediately and prior
to further progressive work being permitted to proceed shall correct
deficiencies detected by such review. Failure to submit the survey or failure
to make the corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a stop-work
order, and/or place a hold on permit inspections, including issuance of a
certificate of occupancy, for the project until the deficiencies have been
corrected.
      (3)   As-built certification. Upon completion of the development a
registered professional engineer, land surveyor or architect, in accordance
with South Carolina law, shall certify according to the requirements of §
151.23(A), §
151.23(B)(l) and §
151.23(B)(2) of this section that the development is built in accordance with
the submitted plans and previous pre-development certifications.

development to assure that all necessary permits have been received from those
governmental agencies from which approval is required by federal or state law,
including section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of
1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334.
   (C)   Watercourse alterations.
      (1)   Notify adjacent communities and the South Carolina Department of
Natural Resources, Land Resources, Land, Water, and Conservation Division,
State Coordinator for the National Flood Insurance Program, prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such
notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (2)   In addition to the notifications required watercourse alterations
per division (C)(l) above, written reports of maintenance records must be
maintained to show that maintenance has been provided within the altered or
relocated portion of the watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not
diminished. This maintenance must consist of a comprehensive program of
periodic inspections, and routine channel clearing and dredging, or other
related functions. The assurance shall consist of a description of maintenance
activities, frequency of performance, and the local official responsible for
maintenance performance. Records shall be kept on file for FEMA inspection.
      (3)   If the proposed project will impact the configuration of the
watercourse, floodway, non-encroachment area, or base flood elevation for which
a detailed flood insurance study has been developed, the applicant shall apply
for and must receive approval for a conditional letter of map revision with the
Federal Emergency Management Agency prior to the start of actual construction.
      (4)   Within 60 days of completion of an alteration of a watercourse,
referenced in the certification requirements of §
151.23(A)(4), the applicant shall submit as-built certification, by a
registered professional engineer, to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   (D)   Floodway encroachments. Prevent encroachments within floodways unless
the certification and flood hazard reduction provisions of §
151.36(G) are met.
   (E)   [Reserved].
   (F)   Adjoining floodplains. Cooperate with neighboring communities with
respect to the management of adjoining floodplains and/or flood-related erosion
areas in order to prevent aggravation of existing hazards.
   (G)   Notifying adjacent communities. Notify adjacent communities pnor to
permitting substantial commercial developments and large subdivisions to be
undertaken in areas of special flood hazard and/or flood-related erosion
hazards.
   (H)   Certification requirements.
      (1)   Obtain and review actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level)
of the lowest floor of all new or substantially improved structures, in
accordance with administrative procedures outlined in §
151.23(B)(2).
      (2)   Obtain the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to
which the new or substantially improved structures have been floodproofed, in
accordance with the floodproofing certification outlined in §
151.23(B)(l).
      (3)   When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, obtain
certifications from a registered professional engineer or architect in
accordance with the non-residential construction requirements outlined in §
151.36(B).
   (I)   Map interpretation. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact
location of boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where
there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions), make the necessary interpretation. The person contesting the
location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation as provided in this subchapter.
   (J)   Prevailing authority. Where a map boundary showing an area of special
flood hazard and field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations for flood
protection elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table,
and the like) shall prevail. The correct information should be submitted to
FEMA as per the map maintenance activity requirements outlined in §
151.36(1)(2).
   (K)   Use of best available data. When base flood elevation data or floodway
data has not been provided in accordance with §

elevation data and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other
source, including data developed pursuant to the standards for subdivision
proposals outlined in §
151.37(E), in order to administer the provisions of this chapter. Data from
preliminary, draft, and final flood insurance studies constitutes best
available data from a federal, state, or other source. Data must be developed
using hydraulic models meeting the minimum requirement of NFIP approved model.
If an appeal is pending on the study in accordance with 44 CFR Ch. 1, Part 67.5
and 67.6, the data does not have to be used.
   (L)   Special flood hazard area/topographic boundaries conflict. When the
exact location of boundaries of the areas special flood hazards conflict with
the current, natural topography information at the site, specific site
information shall take precedence when the lowest adjacent grade (LAG) is at or
above the BFE. The property owner may then apply and be approved for a letter
of map amendment (LOMA) by FEMA. The local administrator in the permit file
will maintain a copy of the letter of map amendment issued from FEMA.
   (M)   On-site inspections. Make on-site inspections of projects in
accordance with the administrative procedures outlined in §
151.25(D).

administration of this chapter and make these records available for public
inspection.
   (P)   Annexations and detachments. Notify the South Carolina Department of
Natural Resources Land, Water and Conservation Division, State Coordinator for
the National Flood Insurance Program, within six months, of any annexations or
detachments that include special flood hazard areas. The community must
incorporate applicable maps from surrounding jurisdictions into this chapter
within 90 days of date of the annexation.
   (Q)   Federally funded development. The President issued Executive Order
11988, Floodplain Management May 1977. E.O. 11988 directs federal agencies to
assert a leadership role in reducing flood losses and losses to environmental
values served by floodplains. Proposed developments must go through an eight-
step review process. Evidence of compliance with the executive order must be
submitted as part of the permit review process.
   (R)   Substantial damage determination. Perform an assessment of damage from
any origin to the structure using FEMA's Residential Substantial Damage
Estimator (RSDE) software to determine if the damage equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   (S)   Substantial improvement determinations. Perform an assessment of
permit applications for improvements or repairs to be made to a building or
structure equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the
improvement or repair is started. Cost of work counted for determining if and
when substantial improvement to a structure occurs shall be cumulative for a
period of five years. If the improvement project is conducted in phases the
total of all cost associated with each phase, beginning with the issuance of
the first permit, shall be utilized to determine whether substantial
improvement will occur.
   (T)   Methods of market value determination. The market values shall be
determined by one of the following methods:
      (1)   The current assessed building value as determined by the county
assessor's office or the value of an appraisal performed by a licensed
appraiser at the expense of the owner within the past six months;
      (2)   One or more certified appraisals from a registered professional
licensed appraiser in accordance with the laws of South Carolina. The appraisal
shall indicate actual replacement value of the building or structure in its
pre-improvement condition, less the cost of site improvements and depreciation
for functionality and obsolescence; or
      (3)   Real estate purchase contract within six months prior to the date
of the application for a permit.

§ 151.25 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Inspections of work in progress. As the work pursuant to a permit
progresses, the local administrator shall make as many inspections of the work
as may be necessary to ensure that the work is being done according to the
provisions of this chapter and the terms of the permit. In exercising this
power, the administrator has a right, upon presentation of proper credentials,
to enter on any premises within the territorial jurisdiction at any reasonable
hour for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action.
   (B)   Stop-work orders. Whenever land surface elevations or contours are
altered, including incidentally through placement of fill material or
stockpiles, and/or, a building or part thereof is being constructed,
reconstructed, altered, or repaired in violation of this chapter, the
administrator may order the work to be immediately stopped. The stop-work order
shall be in writing and directed to the person doing the work. The stop-work
order shall be in writing and directed to the person doing the work. The stop-
work order shall state the specific work to be stopped, the specific reasons
for the stoppage, and the conditions under which the work may be resumed.
Violation of a stop-work order, including the unauthorized removing or
mutilating of a posted stop-work order sign, constitutes a misdemeanor with
possible fines up to $500 per day with each day representing a separate
offense.
   (C)   Revocation of permit. The local administrator may revoke and require
the return of the development permit by notifying the permit holder in writing,
stating the reason for the revocation. Permits shall be revoked for any
substantial departure from the approved application, plans, or specifications;
for refusal or failure to comply with the requirements of state or local laws;
or for false statements or misrepresentations made in securing the permit. Any
permit mistakenly issued in violation of an applicable state or local law may
also be revoked.
   (D)   Periodic inspections. The local administrator and each member of his
or her inspections department shall have a right, upon presentation of proper
credentials, to enter on any premises within the territorial jurisdiction of
the department at any reasonable hour for the purposes of inspection or other
enforcement action.
   (E)   Violations to be corrected. When the local administrator finds
violations of applicable state and local laws, it shall be his or her duty to
notify the owner or occupant of the building of the violation. The owner or
occupant shall immediately remedy each of the violations of law on the property
he or she owns.
   (F)   Actions in event of failure to take corrective action. If the owner of
a building or property shall fail to take prompt corrective action, the
administrator shall give him or her written notice, by certified or registered
mail, to his or her last known address or by personal service, that:
      (1)   The building or property is in violation of this chapter;
      (2)   A hearing will be held before the local administrator at a
designated place and time, not later than ten days after the date of the
notice, at which time the owner shall be entitled to be heard in person or by
counsel and to present arguments and evidence pertaining to the matter; and
      (3)   Following the hearing, the local administrator may issue such order
to alter, vacate, or demolish the building; or to remove fill as appears
appropriate.
   (G)   Order to take corrective action. If, upon a hearing held pursuant to
the notice prescribed above, the administrator shall find that the building or
development is in violation of this chapter, he or she shall make an order in
writing to the owner, requiring the owner to remedy the violation within such
period, not less than 60 days, the administrator may prescribe; provided that
where the administrator finds that there is imminent danger to life or other
property, he or she may order that corrective action be taken in such lesser
period as may be feasible.
   (H)   Appeal. Any owner who has received an order to take corrective action
may appeal from the order to the York County Stormwater Appeals Board by giving
notice of appeal in writing to the administrator within ten days following
issuance of the final order. In the absence of an appeal, the order of the
administrator shall be final. The Stormwater Appeals Board shall hear an appeal
within a reasonable time and may affirm, modify and affirm, or revoke the
order.
   (I)   Failure to comply with order. If the owner of a building or property
fails to comply with an order to take corrective action from which no appeal
has been taken, or fails to comply with an order of the Stormwater Appeals
Board following an appeal, he or she shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall
be punished in the discretion of the court.
   (J)   Denial of flood insurance under the NFIP. If a structure is declared
in violation of this chapter and after all other penalties are exhausted to
achieve compliance with this chapter, then the local administrator shall notify
the Federal Emergency Management Agency to initiate a Section 1316 of the
National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 action against the structure upon the
finding that the violator refuses to bring the violation into compliance with
this chapter. Once a violation has been remedied the local administrator shall
notify FEMA of the remedy and ask that the Section 1316 be rescinded.
   (K)   The following documents are incorporated by reference and may be used
by the local administrator to provide further guidance and interpretation of
this chapter as found on FEMA's website at www.fema.gov:

PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 151.35 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   Development may not occur in an area of special flood hazard where
alternative locations exist due to the inherent hazards and risks involved.
Before a permit is issued, the applicant shall demonstrate that new structures
cannot be located out of the area of special flood hazard and that
encroachments onto the area of special flood hazard are minimized. In all areas
of special flood hazard the following provisions are required:
   (A)   Reasonably safe from flooding. Review all permit applications to
determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from
flooding.
   (B)   Anchoring. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.
   (C)   Flood resistant materials and equipment. All new construction and
substantial improvements shall be constructed with flood resistant materials
and utility equipment resistant to flood damage, in accordance with Technical
Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant Materials Requirements, dated August 2008,
as may be amended and made available by FEMA.
   (D)   Minimize flood damage. All new construction or substantial
improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood
damages.
   (E)   Critical development. Critical development shall be elevated to the
500-year flood elevation or be elevated to the highest known historical flood
elevation (where records are available), whichever is greater. If no data
exists establishing the 500-year flood elevation or the highest known
historical flood elevation, the applicant shall provide a hydrologic and
hydraulic engineering analysis that generates 500-year flood elevation data.
   (F)   Utilities. Electrical, ventilation, plumbing, heating and air
conditioning equipment (including ductwork), and other service facilities shall
be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating
within the components during conditions of the base flood plus two feet. This
requirement does not preclude the installation of outdoor faucets for shower
heads, sinks, hoses, and the like, as long as cut off devices and back flow
devices are installed to prevent contamination to the service components and
thereby minimize any flood damages to the building.
   (G)   Water supply systems. All new and replacement water supply systems
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
system.
   (H)   Sanitary sewage systems.
      (1)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
      (2)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (I)   Gas or liquid storage tanks. All gas or liquid storage tanks, either
located above ground or buried, shall be anchored to prevent flotation or
lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads.
   (J)   Alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements. Any alteration,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement to a structure that is in compliance
with the provisions of this chapter, shall meet the requirements of “new
construction” as contained in this chapter. This includes post-FIRM development
and structures.
   (K)   Non-conforming buildings or uses. Non-conforming buildings or uses may
not be enlarged, replaced, or rebuilt unless such enlargement or reconstruction
is accomplished in conformance with the provisions of this chapter. Provided,
however, nothing in this chapter shall prevent the repair, reconstruction, or
replacement of an existing building or structure located totally or partially
within the floodway or non-encroachment area, provided that the bulk of the
building or structure below base flood elevation in the floodway or non-
encroachment area is not increased and provided that such repair,
reconstruction, or replacement meets all of the other requirements of this
chapter.
   (L)   American with disabilities act (ADA). A building must meet the
specific standards for floodplain construction outlined in §
151.36, as well as any applicable ADA accessibility requirements and
accessibility requirements promulgated by the South Carolina Building Codes
Council. The accessibility requirements are not justification for issuing a
variance or otherwise waiving these requirements. Also, the cost of
improvements required to meet the accessibility requirements shall be included
in the costs of the improvements for calculating substantial improvement.

§ 151.36 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all areas of special flood hazard (Zones A, AE, AH, AO, Al -30, V, and
VE) where base flood elevation data has been provided, as set forth in §
151.04 or outlined in the duties and responsibilities of the local
administrator in §
151.24, the following provisions are required:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the
lowest floor, and the associated electrical, ventilation, and plumbing
connections, heating and air conditioning equipment (including ductwork), and
other service facilities, elevated no lower than two (2.0) feet above the base
flood elevation. No basements are permitted below BFE. Should solid foundation
perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces shall be provided in accordance
with the elevated buildings requirements in §
151.36(D) below.
   (B)   Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure
(including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor, and the associated
electrical, ventilation, and plumbing connections, heating and air conditioning
equipment (including ductwork), and other service facilities, elevated no lower
than two (2.0) feet above the level of the base flood elevation. Should solid
foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient
to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in
accordance with the elevated buildings requirements in §
151.36(D) below. No basements are permitted below BFE. Structures located in A-
zones may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation provided that all areas of the
structure below the required elevation are watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water, using structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of
buoyancy. A registered, professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this Chapter are satisfied. Such certifications shall be
provided to the official as set forth in the floodproofing certification
requirements in §
151.23(B)(l). A variance may be considered for wet floodproofing agricultural
structures in accordance with the criteria outlined in §
151.53. Agricultural structures not meeting the criteria of §
151.53 must meet the non-residential construction standards and all other
applicable provisions of this chapter. Structures that are floodproofed are
required to have an approved maintenance plan with an annual exercise. The
local administrator must approve the maintenance plan and notification of the
annual exercise shall be provided to same.
   (C)   Manufactured homes.
      (1)   Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved on
sites outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured
home park or sub-division, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision, or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on
which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a
flood, must be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of
the manufactured home, including the associated electrical, ventilation, and
plumbing connections, heating and air conditioning equipment (including
ductwork), and other service facilities, is elevated no lower than two feet
above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
      (2)   Manufactured homes that are to be placed or substantially improved
on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that are not
subject to the provisions for residential construction in §
151.36(A) above must be elevated so that the lowest floor of the manufactured
home, including the associated electrical, ventilation, and plumbing
connections, heating and air conditioning equipment (including ductwork), and
other service facilities, is elevated no lower than two (2.0) feet above the
base flood elevation, and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored
foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
      (3)   Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement. For the purpose of this requirement,
manufactured homes must be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement in accordance with Section 19-425.39 of the South Carolina
Manufactured Housing Board Regulations, effective date May 25, 1990, as
amended. Additionally, when the elevation requirement would be met by an
elevation of the chassis at least 36 inches or less above the grade at the
sight, the chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or other foundation
elements of equivalent strength. When the elevation of the chassis is above 36
inches in height, an engineering certification is required.
      (4)   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood-prone areas. This
plan shall be filed with and approved by the local administrator and the local
emergency preparedness coordinator.
   (D)   Elevated buildings.
      (1)   New construction and substantial improvements of elevated buildings
that include fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are useable
solely for the parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage in an
area other than a basement, and which are subject to flooding shall be designed
to preclude finished space and be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters.
      (2)   Designs for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings on different walls having a
total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of each opening shall be no higher than one foot
above the higher of the interior or exterior grade immediately under the
opening;
         (c)   Only the portions of openings that are below the base flood
elevation (BFE) can be counted towards the required net open area;
         (d)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions;
         (e)   Fill placed around foundation walls must be graded so that the
grade inside the enclosed area is equal to or higher than the adjacent grade
outside the building on at least one side of the building; and
         (f)    Openings are still required when the Lowest Adjacent Grade
(LAG) is located between the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) and the freeboard, and
a LOMA has not yet been approved by FEMA.
   (E)   Hazardous velocities. Hydrodynamic pressure must be considered in the
design of any foundation system where velocity waters or the potential for
debris flow exists. If flood velocities are excessive (greater than five feet
per second), foundation systems must be designed by a registered professional
engineer, licensed in the State of South Carolina.
   (F)   Enclosures below BFE.
      (1)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator).
      (2)   The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned
or finished into separate rooms and must be void of utilities except for
essential lighting as required for safety, and cannot be temperature
controlled.
      (3)   One wet location switch and/or outlet connected to a ground fault
interrupt breaker may be installed below the required lowest floor elevation
specified in the specific standards outlined in §
151.36(A), §
151.36(B), and §
151.36(C).
      (4)   All construction materials below the required lowest floor
elevation specified in the specific standards outlined in
151.36(A), §
151.36(B), and §
151.36(C) above should be of flood resistant materials.
   (G)   Floodways or non-encroachment areas. Located within areas of special
flood hazard established in §
151.04 are areas designated as floodways or non-encroachment areas. The
floodway or non-encroachment area is an extremely hazardous area due to the
velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles and has
erosion potential. The following provisions shall apply within such areas:
      (1)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, additions, and other developments shall be permitted unless:
         (a)   It has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in the flood levels
during the occurrence of the base flood. Such certification and technical data
shall be presented to the local floodplain administrator; or
         (b)   A CLOMR has been approved by FEMA. A Letter of Map Revision must
be obtained upon completion of the proposed development.
      (2)   If §
151.36(0)(1) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements
shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions.
      (3)   No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except in an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be
placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided
the anchoring and the elevation standards of §
151.36(C) and the encroachment standards of §
151.36(G)(l) are met.
      (4)   Permissible uses within floodways or non-encroachment areas may
include: general farming, pasture, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture,
forestry, wildlife sanctuary, game farm, and other similar agricultural,
wildlife, and related uses. Also, lawns, gardens, play areas, picnic grounds,
and hiking and horseback riding trails are acceptable uses, provided that they
do not employ structures or fill. Substantial development of a permissible use
may require a no-impact certification. The uses listed in this subsection are
permissible only if and to the extent that they do not cause any increase in
base flood elevations or changes to the floodway or non-encroachment area
configuration or other unforeseen circumstances.
   (H)   Recreational vehicles.
      (1)   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is:
         (a)   On wheels or jacking system;
         (b)   Attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and
security devices; and
         (c)   Has no permanently attached additions.
      (2)   Recreational vehicles placed on sites shall either be:
         (a)   On-site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; and
         (b)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or meet the
development permit and certification requirements of §
151.23, general standards outlined in §
151.35, and manufacture homes standards in §
151.36(C), and elevated buildings standards in §
151.36(D).
   (I)   Map maintenance activities. The National Flood Insurance Program
requires flood data to be reviewed and approved by FEMA. This ensures that
flood maps, studies and other data identified in §
151.04 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         (a)   For all development proposals that impact floodway or non-
encroachment area delineations or base flood elevations, the community shall
ensure that technical or scientific data reflecting such changes be submitted
to FEMA as soon as practicable, but no later than six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include, but are not
limited to:
            1.   Floodway or non-encroachment area encroachments that increase
or decrease base flood elevations or alter floodway or non-encroachment area
boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large-scale development proposals requmng the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with §
151.37(A).
         (b)   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical
data, required in accordance with this §
151.36(I) and prepared in a format required for a conditional letter of map
revision or letter of map revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall also be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         (c)   The floodplain administrator shall require a conditional letter
of map revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway or non-encroachment area encroachments that
increase the base flood elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which, alters a watercourse, results in
any increase of the base flood elevation where FEMA has provided base flood

§ 151.37 STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATIONS AND/OR
FLOODWAYS.
   Located within the areas of special flood hazard (Zones A and V) established
in §
151.04, are small streams where no base flood data has been provided or where
no floodways or non-encroachment areas have been identified. The following
provisions apply within such areas:
   (A)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements or new development shall be permitted within 100 feet of the
stream bank unless certification with supporting technical data by a
registered, professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such
encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   (B)   If §
151.37(A) is satisfied and base flood elevation data is available from other
sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas
shall comply with all applicable flood hazard ordinance provisions of §
151.35 and shall be elevated or floodproofed in accordance with elevations
established in accordance with §
151.24(K).
   (C)   Data from preliminary, draft, and final flood insurance studies
constitutes best available data. Refer to FEMA Floodplain Management Technical
Bulletin 1-98, Use of Flood Insurance Study (RS) Data as Available Data. If an
appeal is pending on the study in accordance with 44 CFR Ch. I, Part 67.5 and
67.6, the data does not have to be used.
   (D)   When base flood elevation data is not available from a federal, state,
or other source one of the following methods may be used to determine a BFE.
For further information regarding the methods for determining BFEs listed below
refer to FEMA's manual, Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A
Areas.
      (1)   Contour interpolation.
         (a)   Superimpose approximate Zone A boundaries onto a topographic map
and estimate a BFE.
         (b)   Add one-half of the contour interval of the topographic map that
is used to the BFE.
      (2)   Data extrapolation. A BFE can be determined if a site within 500
feet upstream of a reach of a stream reach for which a 100-year profile has
been computed by detailed methods, and the floodplain and channel bottom slope
characteristics are relatively similar to the downstream reaches. No hydraulic
structures shall be present.
      (3)   Hydrologic and hydraulic calculations. Perform hydrologic and
hydraulic calculations to determine BFEs using FEMA-approved methods and
software.
   (E)   In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation is not
available, the applicant shall provide a hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
analysis that generates base flood elevations for all subdivision proposals and
other proposed developments containing at least 50 lots or five acres,
whichever is less. This must be provided regardless of the location of the
floodplain in relation to the lots (i.e., the lots are shown outside of the
floodplain or floodplain is used for open space/recreational area).

REGENT PARK FLOODPLAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT
§ 151.40 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Regent Park Floodplain Overlay District, as delineated in
Figure 1, is to regulate development within the Regent Park Community's mapped
FEMA Special Flood Hazard Area and the mapped area of special flood hazard, as
identified in the York County Regent Park Flood Study dated February 27, 2023,
to standards higher than the National Flood Insurance Program's minimum
standards, based in part on a “No Adverse Impact” approach to floodplain
management. The Regent Park Community has experienced repeated local flooding
of non-special flood hazard areas within the community, resulting in
significant property damage. By adopting and enforcing higher standards, the
intent is to provide additional protections for people and property that exceed
FEMA's minimum standards from risks associated with flooding in floodplain
areas, minimize disruption of commerce and critical services, and minimize the
need for costly repairs due to flooding.

(Ord. 2924, passed 6-3-24)
§ 151.41 APPLICABILITY.
   The standards and requirements in this section apply to development located
within the specific watershed defined in the Regent Park Flood Study as adopted
pursuant to §
151.04(B). In instances where there is a conflict between the higher standards
in the Regent Park Floodplain Overlay District and the standards applicable to
areas of special flood hazard identified as adopted pursuant to §
151.04(A), the standards in the Regent Park Floodplain Overlay District shall
control.
(Ord. 2924, passed 6-3-24)
§ 151.42 CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.
   Any application for a development permit within the Regent Park Floodplain
Overlay District shall meet the development permit and certification
requirements of §
151.23 and include the following additional certification:
   (A)   Certification of no adverse impact.
      (1)   A professional engineer, land surveyor or architect, licensed in
the State of South Carolina, shall certify that the development of the
property, within and/or adjacent to areas of special flood hazard, will not
adversely affect flood risks impacting any other properties, whether
downstream, upstream and adjacent to, as measured at the property boundary by
any of the following:
         (a)   Increase in flood elevation,
         (b)   Increase in flood stage,
         (c)   Increase in flood velocity,
         (d)   Increase in flood flow,
         (e)   Increased potential for scour, erosion and sedimentation,
         (f)   Decrease in flood storage or floodway width, and,
         (g)   Any other adverse impact deemed significant or as specified by
the local administrator, unless the impact is mitigated as provided for in an
approved community or watershed-based plan.
      (2)   This certification shall employ FEMA-approved standards for
hydraulic and hydrological analysis to determine no adverse impact and all data
shall be provided digitally for review and corroboration by the administrator
or any governmental review agency acceptable to York County. All studies shall
take into consideration a “full build out” condition for the studied watershed.
This certification shall not be required if the conditions within §
152.44(H)(2) are met.
(Ord. 2924, passed 6-3-24)
§ 151.43 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   In all areas of special flood hazard within the Regent Park Floodplain
Overlay District where base flood elevation data has been provided pursuant to
§
151.04(B) or as outlined in the duties and responsibilities of the local
administrator in §
151.24, the requirements of §
151.35 shall apply in addition to the following higher general standards:
   (A)   Critical development.
      (1)   Existing critical development, if it cannot be reconstructed
outside of the 500-year area of special flood hazard as part of development,
shall be elevated or floodproofed to either (1) the 500-year flood elevation,
or (2) the freeboard elevation above the base flood elevation pursuant to §
151.44(A), whichever is greater. If no data exists establishing the 500-year
flood elevation or the highest known historical flood elevation, the applicant
shall provide a hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis that generates
500-year flood elevation data in compliance with §
151.37.
      (2) New critical development shall not be permitted to be located within
the 500-year area of special flood hazard.
   (B)   Utilities. All provisions of §
151.35(F) shall apply with the exception that freeboard shall be provided in
accordance with §
151.44(A).
   (C)   Sanitary sewage systems. All provisions of §
151.35(H) shall apply with the addition that gravity sewer manhole rims must be
constructed at or above the freeboard pursuant to §
151.44(A) or be flood-proofed.
   (D)   Storage or stockpile of hazardous materials. Facilities, located
within an area of special flood hazard and used for the storage or stockpiling
of hazardous materials meeting minimum reportable quantities pursuant to the
Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) and 40 CFR Part 370,
shall comply with requirements of the International Building Code (IBC), the
International Residential Code (IBC), and ASCE 24-14 Flood Resistant Design and
Construction, as applicable, and with the freeboard requirements.
   (E)   Dam breach analysis.
      (1)   Plans for proposed development, located downstream of an existing
dam or include construction of a new dam as part of the development, shall show
the inundation boundary that may result from a dam breach failure. Inundation
boundaries shall be provided for any dam meeting the size and/or hazard
potential classifications pursuant to S.C. Reg 72-2 of the South Carolina Dams
and Reservoirs Safety Act Regulations, or any dam as otherwise identified by
the local administrator. Inundation boundaries provided by the SCDHEC Dam
Safety Program may be utilized to fulfill this requirement. If the entire
proposed development's property is not located within a dam breach failure
inundation boundary, the plans shall include a statement that the development
is not located within a dam breach failure inundation boundary.
      (2)   If development is proposed to be located downstream of an existing
dam that has not been provided with dam breach modeling and inundation mapping
as made available by the SCDHEC Dam Safety Program, the development plans shall
provide a dam failure or breach analysis with an inundation boundary.
      (3)   Where there are multiple dams meeting either §
151.35(P)(l) or §
151.35(P)(2), the worse-case inundation boundary shall be shown.
      (4)   A dam breach analysis shall be prepared using BREACH, HEC-HMS, or
HEC-RAS (unsteady flow), DAMBRK, DSS-WISE™, or other South Carolina Dam Safety
Program approved equivalent engineering dam break flood model and mapping
software. Flood routings must be performed using HEC-RAS (unsteady flow),
FLDWAV, and DAMBRK. The applicant shall be responsible for determining the
appropriate dam breach parameters so a breach outflow analysis can be developed
and a resultant hydrograph routed downstream through the area of new
development.
      (5)   The dam breach analysis method shall be prepared by a registered
professional engineer, licensed in the State of South Carolina, and demonstrate
the “sunny day” failure scenario for a “complete and sudden” breach while the
impoundment level is at the principal spillway crest or maximum impoundment.
The “sunny day” dam failure scenario represents an “any given day” type of
breach that is NOT hydrologically induced (i.e., not rainfall driven), but is
more likely caused by some weakness in the dam that may have gone unnoticed. A
"complete and sudden" breach implies a failure where the entire dam is removed
instantaneously at a point in time in the simulation.
      (6)   Proposed development located within an inundation area shall meet
the minimum requirements of §
151.36(A) through (F), as applicable, as long as:
         (a)   Surface flow within the inundation area is not unduly
restricted,
         (b)   Development does not increase the hazard classification of the
dam,
         (c)   Development does not increase the potential for loss of life or
property damage within the dam breach analysis inundation zone.
      (7)   A dam breach analysis shall not apply to the use of any building or
structure in existence as of the effective date of this chapter, nor shall it
prevent the restoration of a damaged building or structure, or prevent the
continuance of the use of such building or part thereof as such use existed at
the time of such damage, but shall apply to any alteration of a building that
provides for a change in such use of any building after the effective date of
this chapter.

§ 151.44 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all areas of special flood hazard within the Regent Park Floodplain
Overlay District where base flood elevation data has been provided pursuant to
§
151.04(B) or as outlined in the duties and responsibilities of the local
administrator in §
151.24, the requirements of §
151.36 shall apply in addition to the following higher specific standards:
   (A)   Freeboard.
      (1)   Freeboard requirements are based on FEMA's Federal Flood Risk
Management Standard (FFRMS) Freeboard Value Approach (FVA). This approach
establishes a minimum vertical elevation requirement above the base flood
elevation for all actions involving development, structure elevation, dry
floodproofing, and mitigation reconstruction projects in all areas of special
flood hazard. Minimum freeboard shall be provided as either:
         (a)   Two feet of freeboard shall be added to the base flood
elevation; or,
         (b)   For critical development or critical facilities, a freeboard of
three feet shall be added to the base flood elevation.
      (2)    Freeboard, meeting requirements of §
151.44 (A)(l), shall result in and include a horizontal extension of the base
floodplain boundary limits to the point where the ground contour elevation
intersects with the extended freeboard elevation as illustrated in Figure 2.
All development within the extended horizontal flood boundary limits based on
freeboard shall be subject to the freeboard requirements of this chapter.

IMAGES/0-0-0-8604.png]
   (B)   Compensatory storage.
      (1)   Compensatory storage, as illustrated in Figure 3, may be provided
to offset the loss of flood storage resulting from when fill is used for
development or when elevating a structure within areas of special flood hazard,
as an option allowed under §
151.44(H).
      (2)   Compensatory storage should be located onsite and adjacent to or
opposite the areas of new floodplain fill. If such placement location is not
feasible, hydraulic analysis shall be provided to demonstrate that the proposed
location is a hydraulically equivalent site and that the proposed storage
volume is sufficient to not result in an adverse impact to adjacent properties.
Compensatory storage located on a hydraulically equivalent site provides
additional floodable area so that flood elevations, peaks, stages, and
velocities of floodwater are not increased and therefore will not adversely
impact adjacent properties.
      (3)   Compensatory storage shall be provided at a minimum ratio of 1.15
cubic yards of excavation for every cubic yard of fill (1.15:1).
      (4)   The floodplain storage volume lost below the existing 10-year
frequency flood elevation must be replaced below the proposed 10-year frequency
flood elevation. The floodplain storage volume lost above the existing 10-year
frequency flood elevation must be replaced above the proposed 10-year frequency
elevation.
      (5)   Compensatory storage areas shall be designed to drain freely and
openly to the channel and not retain water, nor create aquatic life stranding
areas.
      (6)   No area below the elevation of normal channel stage, the waterline
of a pond, or other body of water including seasonally high groundwater, can be
credited as a compensating excavation volume. Excavation above the base flood
elevation is also not allowed for credit as a compensating volume. Additional
test pits should be excavated to demonstrate that the proposed compensatory
storage will not intercept the seasonal high groundwater table.
      (7)   A recorded deed and plat restriction are required to prohibit any
modification to the compensatory storage areas.

151.36(A) shall apply with the exception that freeboard shall be provided in
accordance with §
151.44(A) .
   (D )   Non-residential construction. All provisions of §
151.36(B) shall apply with the exception that freeboard shall be provided in
accordance with §
151.44(A).
   (E)   Manufactured homes. All provisions of §
151.36(C) shall apply with the exception that freeboard shall be provided in
accordance with §
151.44(A).

151.36(I) shall apply with the following exceptions:
      (1)   The provisions found in §
151.36(I)(1)(a)2. shall also include development that increases the base flood
elevation in any amount through placement of a structure or fill; and,
      (2)   Where FEMA has provided base flood elevation data, a conditional
letter of map revision (CLOMR) shall be required for any proposed development
that increases or decreases the base flood elevation where measured at any
adjacent property boundary, or otherwise alters the floodplain boundary.
   (H)   Fill. All provisions of §
151.36(M) shall apply with the following exceptions. The placement or
stockpiling of fill, whether permanent or temporary, including loose or
compacted soils, gravel or rock, within areas of special flood hazard is
discouraged due to reduction in flood storage capacity, adversely altered
natural drainage patterns, potential for increased flood elevation, stage and
velocity increases, erosion and scour, and diminishment of wildlife habitat.
The use of fill shall be limited only to the elevation of individual structures
and buildings, utilities, infrastructure, and public road crossings. Other
methods of elevating structures should be considered first. The following
provisions shall apply to all fill placed in the areas of special flood hazard:
      (1)   Certification with supporting technical data, prepared by a
registered professional engineer, licensed in the State of South Carolina, is
provided to demonstrate that the fill will not result in adverse impact to
other properties upstream, downstream, and adjacent to the development as
measured at the property boundary by any increase in base flood elevation,
floodway elevation, flood peaks, flood stage, floodwater velocity, scour and
erosion/sedimentation, and/or decrease in floodway width or flood storage. The
Floodplain Administrator will evaluate each fill encroachment/development and
determine which of the following options will be required.
         (a)   Compensatory storage shall be provided to compensate for all
storage lost or displaced in a regulatory floodplain meeting the requirements
of §
151.44(B); and/or,
         (b)   A detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in
accordance with standard engineering practice that meets or exceeds FEMA's
guidelines and standards for flood risk analysis and mapping. The analyses may
incorporate compensatory storage at hydraulically equivalent sites within the
proposed project area as part of the required demonstration.
      (2)   If fill results in an adverse impact which results in any increase
to the base flood elevation at any adjacent property boundary within a FEMA
Special Flood Hazard Area, the applicant shall:
         (a)   Submit to FEMA, through York County, a CLOMR or other
appropriate map change application. A floodplain development permit will not be
issued until FEMA has issued the CLOMR. Within 60 days of completion of
construction activities, the applicant shall apply to FEMA, through York
County, for a letter of map revision (LOMR). The applicant is responsible for
all technical submissions and fees required to obtain all official letters from
FEMA.
         (b)   Obtain, and provide copy of, a written and notarized agreement
from all affected property owners thereby agreeing to allow their property to
be adversely impacted by flood waters resulting from the development.
      (3)   Fill shall be designed and constructed meeting the minimum
requirements of ASCE 24-14 Flood Resistant Design and Construction to be stable
under conditions of flooding, including rapid rise and drawdown, prolonged
inundation, and flood-related scour and erosion.
   (I)   Roads, bridges, and culverts.
      (1)   New roadways constructed within or adjacent to areas of special
flood hazard shall be constructed so that the centerline elevation of the
finished road surface is no less than two feet higher than the base flood
elevation.
      (2)   New roadways and bridges located in an area of special flood hazard
shall meet the requirements of §
151.36(G) and §
151.36(M).
      (3)   Replacement of existing bridges and culverts shall meet the
requirements of §
151.36(G), if applicable.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.001 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the Stormwater Management and Sediment
Control Ordinance of York County, South Carolina.
(Ord. 2819, passed 6-17-19)
§ 152.002 AUTHORITY.
   The provisions herein are adopted pursuant to the authority conferred upon
York County (the “county”) by the South Carolina Constitution, the South
Carolina General Assembly including S.C. Code §§ 48-1-10 et seq. (the “South
Carolina Pollution Control Act”), and §§ 48-14-10 et seq. (the “South Carolina
Stormwater Management and Sediment Reduction Act”), and the regulations
promulgated thereunder; and, in compliance with the requirements imposed upon
the county by the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
General Permit for Storm Water Discharges from Regulated Small Municipal
Separate Storm Sewer Systems (SMS4s), issued in accordance with the federal
Clean Water Act, the South Carolina Pollution Control Act and regulations
promulgated thereunder.
(Ord. 2819, passed 6-17-19)
§ 152.003 JURISDICTION.
   The provisions herein shall apply to all lands within the unincorporated
area of York County, and those municipalities which, by approval of SCDHEC and
by written agreement executed with York County, contract to have this chapter
administered by York County within their corporate limits. All lands under the
jurisdiction of another entity with the power of eminent domain are exempt from
the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 2819, passed 6-17-19)
§ 152.004 PURPOSE.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to protect, maintain, and enhance
the environment of York County and the short-term and long-term public health,
safety, and general welfare of the citizens of York County by establishing
requirements and procedures to control the potential adverse effects of
increased stormwater runoff associated with both future development and
existing developed land. Proper management of stormwater runoff will help to
minimize damage to public and private property, ensure a functional drainage
system, reduce the effects of development on land and stream channel erosion,
attain and maintain water quality standards, enhance the local environment
associated with the drainage system, reduce localized flooding, reduce
pollutant loading to the maximum extent practicable, maintain to the extent
practicable the pre-developed runoff characteristics of the area, and
facilitate economic development while mitigating associated pollutant, flooding
and drainage impacts.
   (B)   It is further the purpose of this chapter to comply with the federal
and corresponding state stormwater discharge (NPDES) regulations (40 CFR 122.26
and S.C. Regulation 61-9.122.26) developed pursuant to the Clean Water Act and
to ensure that York County has the authority to take any action required to
obtain and comply with its NPDES permit for stormwater discharges. Among other
things, these regulations require York County to establish legal authority
which authorizes or enables York County at a minimum to:
      (1)   Control the contribution of pollutants to the York County MS4 and
receiving waters by stormwater discharges associated with residential,
commercial, industrial, and related facilities activity and the quality of
stormwater discharged from sites of residential, commercial, industrial, and
related facilities activity;
      (2)   Prohibit illicit discharges to the York County MS4 and receiving
waters;
      (3)   Control the discharge to the York County MS4 and receiving waters
of spills, dumping or disposal of materials other than stormwater;
      (4)   Control, through intergovernmental agreements, contribution of
pollutants from one municipal stormwater system to another;
      (5)   Require compliance with conditions in ordinances, permits,
contracts or orders;
      (6)   Carry out all inspection, surveillance and monitoring procedures
necessary to determine compliance and noncompliance with permit conditions
including the prohibition on illicit discharges to York County MS4 and
therefore to the receiving waters of the MS4 system.
   (C)   The application of this chapter and the provisions expressed herein
shall be the minimum stormwater management requirements and shall not be deemed
a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by statute. In addition, if
site characteristics indicate that complying with these minimum requirements
will not provide adequate designs or protection for local property or
residents, it is the responsibility of the owner and the operator to provide
appropriate management practices, control techniques, system design,
engineering methods and such other programs and controls as are required by
York County’s NPDES permit.
   (D)   This chapter is to be construed to further the purpose of controlling
and reducing pollutant discharges to the York County MS4 and thus to the waters
of the state in order to assure the obligations of York County under its NPDES
permit issued by DHEC as required by 33 USC 1342 and 40 CFR 122.26.
(Ord. 2819, passed 6-17-19)
§ 152.005 CONSTRUCTION AND SCOPE.
   (A)   It is the goal of the York County Council that the provisions of this
chapter will result in reduction of the discharge of pollutants within the York
County MS4, those areas of the unincorporated county currently outside of the
MS4, and the county’s receiving waters to the maximum extent practicable using
management practices, control techniques, system design, engineering methods
and such other programs and controls as are required by York County’s NPDES
permit.
   (B)   The application of this chapter, the provisions expressed herein, and
the federal and state stormwater regulations, shall provide the minimum
stormwater management requirements and shall not be deemed a limitation or
repeal of any other ordinances of York County or powers granted to York County
by the State of South Carolina statues. The York County Stormwater Management
Design Manual contains additional specific stormwater management requirements.
   (C)   This chapter is also construed to further its purpose of controlling
stormwater runoff in York County to reduce flooding using best management
practices, control techniques, system design, engineering methods and such
other programs and controls as necessary to achieve this goal.
   (D)   The York County Stormwater Administrator or designee shall be
primarily responsible for the coordination and enforcement of the provisions of
this chapter, the York County Stormwater Management Program, and York County's
MS4 NPDES permit.
(Ord. 2819, passed 6-17-19; Am. Ord. 3420, passed 10-5-20)
§ 152.006 SEVERABILITY.
   The provisions of this
Chapter 152 are hereby declared to be severable, and if any provision or
section of this chapter is declared to be unconstitutional or unenforceable by
the final order of a court of competent jurisdiction, such declaration shall
not affect the constitutionality, legality, or enforceability of any other
section or provision of this chapter, which shall be deemed severable, valid,
enforceable, and effective.
(Ord. 2819, passed 6-17-19)
§ 152.007 PROHIBITIONS AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   No person shall, without having first provided for compliance with
this chapter and with any program, plan, permit, or regulation of the York
County Stormwater Management Program (SWMP) adopted in accordance with this
chapter, conduct the following:
      (1)   Develop any land;
      (2)   Engage in any industry or enterprise;
      (3)   Construct, operate or maintain any landfill, hazardous waste
treatment, disposal or recovery facility, solar farm, or any other industrial
or related facility; or
      (4)   Dispose of any hazardous or toxic substance or other pollutant.
   (B)   The following development activities are exempt from the provisions of
this chapter:
      (1)   Construction or improvement of single-family residences or their
accessory buildings, which are separately built and not part of a larger common
plan of development or sale, that results in a disturbed area of less than one
acre, provided that the work is performed in a manner consistent with these
regulations.
      (2)   Land disturbing activities on agricultural land for production of
plants and animals useful to man, including but not limited to: forages and sod
crops, grains and feed crops, cotton, and peanuts; dairy animals and dairy
products; poultry and poultry products; livestock, including beef cattle,
sheep, swine, horses, ponies, mules, or goats, including the breeding and
grazing of these animals; bees; fur animals and aquaculture, except that the
construction of any agricultural structure, which requires a building permit,
that results in the disturbance of one or more acres of land are not exempt
from the provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   Land disturbing activities undertaken on forestland for the
production and harvesting of timber and timber products. For sites that are
substantially cleared of trees, pursuant to legitimate forestry activities, no
land development applications that would result in a change from forestland to
non-forest or non-agricultural use shall be approved for one year after the
date the clearing is completed, in accordance with S.C. Code § 48-23-205(C)(1)
(a), or five years after the date the clearing is completed if the harvest was
a willful violation of regulations, in accordance with S.C. Code § 48-23-205(C)
(1)(b).
      (4)   Activities undertaken by persons who are otherwise regulated by the
provisions of S.C. Code Title 48, Chapter 20, the South Carolina Mining Act.
      (5)   Certain land disturbing activities undertaken by persons who are
exempt from the provisions of the Stormwater Management and Sediment Reduction
Act as set forth in S.C. Code § 48-14-40.
      (6)   Linear highway projects designed by the county or its agents shall
be permitted based on SCDOT criteria as set forth in S.C. Regulation 72-400 and
SCDOT’s Requirements for Hydraulic Design Studies (2009) as approved by SCDOT.
      (7)   If conducting construction activities in response to a public
emergency (e.g., earthquake, extreme flooding conditions, widespread disruption
in essential public services), and the related work requires immediate
authorization to avoid imminent endangerment to human health, public safety, or
the environment, or to reestablish essential public services, stormwater
discharge is allowed on the condition that a complete and accurate notice of
intent and plan is submitted within 30 calendar days after commencing
construction activities establishing that eligibility for coverage under this
permit. Documentation must be provided in the Stormwater Pollution Prevention
Plan to substantiate the occurrence of the public emergency.
(Ord. 2819, passed 6-17-19; Am. Ord. 3420, passed 10-5-20)
§ 152.008 CONTIGUOUS PROPERTY.
   In order to preclude inappropriate phasing of developments to circumvent the
intent of this chapter, when a proposed development activity will occur on a
lot or parcel that has contiguous lots or parcels of lands owned in whole, or
in part, by the same property owner, the criteria defined in §
152.018 of this code will be applied to the total land area comprising the
contiguous lots or parcels of lands. The criteria defined in §
152.018 also applies to any development regardless of size or disturbed area
that is part of a larger common plan of development or sale.
(Ord. 2819, passed 6-17-19)
§ 152.009 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   The Stormwater Administrator shall develop, maintain, implement, and enforce
such design or engineering standards, as may be required, that is consistent
with the Stormwater Management Program and provides a sound technical basis for
the achievement of stormwater management and water quality objectives.
   (A)   The Stormwater Administrator shall develop and maintain a Stormwater
Management Design Manual (Design Manual), approved and adopted by County
Council in conjunction with the adoption of the York County Stormwater
Management and Sediment Control Ordinance, the terms and provisions of which
may be amended from time to time in accordance with the approved Stormwater
Management Program, and thereafter amendments thereto independently approved by
County Council. The Design Manual shall serve as guidance for the design,
construction, and maintenance of facilities which discharge stormwater. The
Design Manual shall be used to assist in the design and evaluation of
stormwater management facilities in York County. The Design Manual will
include, but not be limited to, guidance in selecting environmentally sound
practices for managing stormwater. Description of specific techniques and
practices shall be included directly or by reference. Use of techniques
emphasizing use of natural systems shall be encouraged.
   (B)   Best management practices (BMPs) can be either structural or non-
structural and may be enforced by specific prescription in zoning requirements,
subdivision regulations, or on a site-specific basis as may be prescribed to
meet Stormwater Management Program objectives. The Design Manual shall be
updated periodically to reflect the most current and effective practices and
shall be made available to the public.
   (C)   Although the intention of the Design Manual is to establish uniform
design practices, it neither replaces the need for engineering judgment nor
precludes the use of information not presented. Other accepted engineering
procedures may be used to conduct hydrologic and hydraulic studies or provide
for other accepted BMPs if approved by the Stormwater Administrator. The Design
Manual will include, but not be limited to:
      (1)   Guidance and specifications for the preparation of comprehensive
stormwater pollution prevention plans (C-SWPPP). Acceptable techniques for
obtaining, calculating and presenting the information required in the plans
shall be described, as will design conditions which must be accounted for;
      (2)   Minimum specifications for designing, constructing, and maintaining
stormwater management facilities. These specifications shall be established in
accordance with current good engineering practices; and
      (3)   Post-development performance standards for stormwater management
facilities and practices. Methodology/criteria for evaluation will include:
         (a)   Hydrologic and hydraulic evaluations;
         (b)   Evaluation of best management practices (BMPs); and
         (c)   Evaluation of downstream impacts.
(Ord. 2819, passed 6-17-19)
§ 152.010 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions, as may be
amended from time to time, shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or
requires a different meaning.
   ADVERSE IMPACT. A significant negative impact to land, water and associated
resources resulting from a land disturbing activity. The negative impact
includes increased risk of flooding, degradation of water quantity, increased
sedimentation, reduced groundwater recharge, negative impacts on aquatic
organisms, negative impacts on wildlife and other resources, and threatened
public health.
   ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE. A prohibited discharge into the York County Stormwater
System or receiving waters, which occurs by chance and without planning or
consideration prior to occurrence.
   APPLICANT. A person, firm, or governmental agency who applying to York
County to obtain approval of a permit for a land disturbing activity and to
obtain approval to discharge (including stormwater) into the waters of the
state.
   AS-BUILT OR RECORD DOCUMENT PLANS. A set of engineering or site drawings
that delineate the specific permitted stormwater management facility as
actually constructed.
   BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMPs). A wide range of management procedures,
schedules of activities, prohibitions on practices and other management
practices to prevent or reduce the discharge of pollutants to surface waters of
the state. BMPs also include treatment requirements, operating procedures, and
practices to control site runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or waste disposal
or drainage from raw materials storage in order to effectively reduce erosion
and sedimentation impacts. BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMPS) must be designed,
installed and maintained during land disturbing activities.
   BUFFER ZONE. An area, strip, or plot of dense undisturbed perennial native
vegetation, either original or reestablished, surrounding streams and rivers,
ponds and lakes, wetlands, seeps, or other surface waters that borders
jurisdictional surface waters of the United States within which construction
activities are restricted. BUFFER ZONES are established for the primary
purposes of protecting water quality and maintaining a healthy aquatic
ecosystem in the runoff, enhancing water infiltration, and minimizing the
discharge of potential sediment, nutrients or pollutants to receiving surface
waters.
   CERTIFIED EROSION PREVENTION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL INSPECTOR or CEPSCI or

including boundary signs, lot stakes, surveyor markings, etc., indicating
construction activities which may occur on a specific plot. [63 Federal
Register No. 128, July 6, 1998, p. 36491]
      (1)   A common plan for development or sale identifies a site where
multiple separate and distinct construction activities (i.e. areas of
disturbance) are occurring on contiguous areas. Such site may have one operator
or owner or several operators and owners. Construction activities may take
place at different times on different schedules, in separate stages, and/or in
separate phases, and/or in combination with other construction activities. Each
developer, operator or owner for each site or project determined to be a part
of a LCP are subject to permitting requirements as defined by this chapter.
      (2)   Projects and sites identified as part of a larger common plan for
development or sale are linked through permitting by York County as part of one
plan, referred to as the LARGER COMMON PLAN. LCP projects must ensure that
adequate stormwater management facilities are designed into the project(s) or
site(s) to control pollution and protect water quality during all stages or
phases of development. Project or sites added as part of a LCP may be required
to expand existing or provide additional stormwater management facilities to
control pollution from land disturbance activities from other contiguous areas
or proposed additional phases as required by this chapter.
      (3)   LCP projects are typically identified by the documentation that
identifies the scope of the project including such things as plats, blueprints,
marking plans, contracts, building permits, public notice or hearing, and
zoning requests. If master calculations have been prepared and/or submitted for
an entire site, then all phases and parcels at that site would be considered

   LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT (LID). An approach to land development (or
redevelopment) that works with nature to manage stormwater as close to its
source as possible, the LID employs principles such as preserving and
recreating natural landscape features, minimizing effective imperviousness to
create functional and appealing site drainage that treat stormwater as a
resource rather than a waste product. There are many practices that have been
used to adhere to these principles such as bioretention facilities, rain
gardens, vegetated rooftops, rain barrels, and permeable pavements. By
implementing LID principles and practices, water can be managed in a way that
reduces the impact of built areas and promotes the natural movement of water
within an ecosystem or watershed. Applied on a broad scale, LID can maintain or
restore a watershed’s hydrologic and ecological functions.
   MAINTENANCE. Any action necessary to preserve stormwater management

PERMIT AND SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS
§ 152.016 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   Federal regulations governing stormwater management, as specified in 40 CFR
122.26, and state regulations, as specified in S.C. Regulation 61-9.122.26
adopted pursuant thereto, and S.C. Regulation 72-300 et seq. are adopted as the
minimum requirements for all facilities as defined in the respective
regulations,
(Ord. 2819, passed 6-17-19)
§ 152.017 SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Requirements of operators:
      (1)   The primary permittee is responsible for preparation and submittal
of the C-SWPPP and to comply with the requirements of this chapter and the most
current South Carolina NPDES Construction General Permit (NPDES-CGP).
      (2)   In developing plans for residential subdivisions, individual lots
in a residential subdivision development shall be required to obtain and comply
with the OS-SWPPP. The residential subdivision development, as a whole, shall
be considered a larger common plan (LCP) and to be a single land disturbing
activity requiring a C-SWPPP. Hydrologic parameters that reflect the LCP shall
be used in all engineering calculations.
      (3)   If individual lots or sections in a residential subdivision are
being developed by different operators, all land disturbing activities related
to the residential subdivision shall be covered by the approved C-SWPPP for the
residential subdivision. If the primary permittee obtains coverage under a C-
SWPPP for the development and thereafter sells lots within the development,
then, at the discretion of the primary permittee, permit coverage shall be one
of the following:
         (a)   The primary permittee may require that the new lot owner obtain
their own coverage under the C-SWPPP as a secondary permittee. The primary
permittee must make the OS-SWPPP, design plans and a copy of the CGP available
to the new owner seeking individual lot(s) coverage., or
         (b)   The primary permittee may require that the new lot owner obtain
their own permit coverage as a new primary permittee with their own C-SWPPP.
      (4)   When the operator (new owner) makes changes after the C-SWPPP has
been approved the new owner must notify the county in writing within 14
calendar days. The new owner may not commence work at the construction site
until the C-SWPPP has been modified with the new owner information, and they
have received NOI coverage from SCDHEC. If the new owner elects to modify the
layout of the construction site, thereby altering the approved C-SWPPP, the new
owner must apply for a new permit and new NOI coverage.
      (5)   If an individual lot owner or residential builder elects not to
follow the drainage provisions in the primary permittee’s approved OS-SWPPP,
the county will require the individual lot owner or residential builder to
obtain coverage under their own C-SWPPP as a primary permittee.
      (6)   If a lending institution takes operational control of a
construction site due to foreclosure, permittee filing for bankruptcy,
abandonment, etc., then the lending institution is responsible for the
construction site’s stormwater discharges. A permit is required under this
chapter prior to the entity initiating construction activity at the site.
      (7)   Contractors employed by the primary or secondary permittee, whose
work at the construction site may disturb soils or whose work may otherwise be
necessary to implement the OS-SWPPP, must complete a contractor certification
form or must submit an annual blanket NOI covering all construction activities
within a LCP statewide to SCDHEC.
   (B)   Residential subdivisions, which were approved prior to the effective
date of these regulations and have an active approved land disturbance permit
from York County, are exempt from these requirements. Previously approved
subdivisions must comply with the chapter requirements in effect at the time
the phase of development was approved. They must also comply with the
requirements of the most current SC NPDES-CGP as outlined under Section 2.4.2
of that permit. Development of new phases of existing subdivisions which were
not included in the total disturbed area of an active land disturbance permit
shall comply with the provisions of these regulations and the most current SC
NPDES-CGP.
      (1)   When the subdivision development reaches the condition where it is
50% built, the following actions must be taken:
         (a)   The detention pond shall be cleaned of all deposited sediment,
overgrowth of invasive vegetation (weeds, vines, shrubs, trees) shall be
removed, and all areas draining to and including the detention pond shall have
reached final stabilization; and
         (b)   A new home owner’s association document must be filed with the
Stormwater Administrator defining the new contact person for the responsible
party for maintaining the detention pond and/or any water quality features or
BMP’s installed in the subdivision.
         (c)   The primary permittee may elect at this stage of development to
request a notice of termination of the permit coverage and closure of the land
disturbance permit with the county as long as all common area and rights of way
have reached final stabilization and secondary permittees have NOI coverage for
the lots under their ownership.
      (2)   When the subdivision development is developed to a point between
50% and 90% built, individual lot controls as well as other erosion and
sediment control BMPs shall provide the sediment control to meet 80% trapping
efficiency rather than only the sediment/detention pond.
      (3)   Once the subdivision is 90% or greater built and the disturbed
areas are stabilized according to the requirements of SC NPDES-CGP and S.C.
Regulation 72-300 et seq., then all permittees may file a request for a notice
of termination of the permit coverage for the subdivision. As a precondition to
requesting a notice of termination, the applicant shall submit as-built
drawings of the stormwater management facilities and certification that all
work has been performed in accordance with the requirements to the Stormwater
Administrator.
   (C)   For land disturbance activities involving 10,000 square feet but less
than two acres of actual land disturbance which are not part of a LCP, the
operator shall submit a simplified stormwater management and sediment control
plan (SMSCP) meeting the requirements listed below. This plan does not require
approval by SCDHEC and is not required to be prepared by an engineer, Tier B
surveyor, or landscape architect; however, if an individual with one of these
licenses prepares the plan, then they must sign and seal the plans. The
appropriate SCDHEC notice of intent form will be required to be submitted to
the county for approval and then submitted to SCDHEC for notification.
      (1)   A narrative description of the stormwater management facilities to
be used.
      (2)   A general description of topographic and soil conditions of the
development site.

land disturbing activities and the expected date the final stabilization will
be completed.
      (5)   A plat of the property illustrating property boundaries including
any utility and storm drainage easements.
      (6)   A map of the parcel on which the land disturbance activities will
take place, printed from York County’s Geographic Information System (GIS)
Division’s internet mapping system.
      (7)   A sketch plan to accompany the narrative containing:
         (a)   Site location drawing of the proposed project, indicating the
location of the proposed project in relation to roadways, jurisdictional
boundaries, streams and rivers, and the boundary lines of the site on which the
work is to be performed. GIS mapping information may be utilized;
         (b)   All areas within the site which will be included in the land
disturbing activities shall be identified and the total disturbed area
calculated;
         (c)   Topographic contours of the site;
         (d)   Anticipated start and completion dates of the various stages of
land disturbing activities and the expected date final stabilization will be
completed.

structural sediment/erosion control BMPs and stormwater management control
measures (if applicable).
         (f)   The simplified SMSCP shall contain the following certifications
by the operator:
            1.   Land disturbing activities will be accomplished pursuant to
the plan;
            2.   Construction site inspections will be conducted by the
operator on a routine basis;
            3.   A copy of each inspection report shall be provided to the
Stormwater Administrator; and
            4.   The Stormwater Administrator has the right to conduct on-site
inspections.
   (D)   For land disturbance activities of 1.0 or more acres, or that creates
8,700 square feet or greater of impervious surface area that will result in
more than 1.0 cubic foot per second increase in peak runoff rates between pre-
development and post development conditions for the 10-year, 24-hour storm
event, or that require a storm drain pipe or culvert conveyance system (one or
more pipes), or which alter the existing storm drain systems, or cause
downstream impact, or otherwise require engineering design and calculation
preparation by an engineer or design professional, all of the requirements of
C-SWPPP as described in §
152.018 shall apply. For sites that disturb less than 1.0 acre but meet one or
more of the other criteria listed, the Stormwater Administrator has the
discretion to reduce some of the requirements of the C-SWPPP as described in §
152.018.
   (E)   Commercial and industrial sites which disturb 10,000 square feet but
less than 1.0 acre of area and otherwise are not part of a LCP may be eligible
to submit a simplified plan as described in §
152.017(C). If any of the constraints listed in §
152.017(D) are required as part of the C-SWPPP, then the plan must meet all of
the requirements of §
152.018.
   (F)   York County shall require a land disturbance permit for those
individual residential lot sites which may receive automatic permit coverage
under the South Carolina NPDES-CGP.

design flows downstream. The analysis of downstream conditions in the report
shall address each and every point or area along the project site’s boundaries
at which runoff will exit the property. The analysis shall focus on the portion
of the drainage channel or watercourse immediately downstream from the project.
This area shall extend downstream from the project to a point in the drainage
basin where the total area of the development comprises 10% of the total basin
area. In calculating runoff volumes and discharge rates, consideration may need
to be given to any planned future upstream land use changes. The analysis shall
be performed in accordance with the county’s Stormwater Design Manual.
   (E)   All stormwater systems shall be checked to demonstrate no increase in
velocity, peak flow, water surface level elevation in relationship to upstream,
adjacent, and downstream property in the 100-year storm, unless an adequate
permanent drainage easement is dedicated and obtained. Open channels and closed
storm sewers and culverts shall be sized to carry runoff from the appropriate
design storm event and to preclude the creation of backwater inundation of any
area outside of a dedicated drainage easement.
(Ord. 2819, passed 6-17-19)
§ 152.025 MINIMUM WATER QUALITY REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The Stormwater Quality section of the C-SWPPP shall comply with
SCDHEC’s Regulations 72-300, the NPDES-CGP, and the county’s Stormwater Design
Manual.
   (B)   All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately
treated before discharge in order to ensure maximum pollutant removal is
achieved to the extent where these discharges shall not cause or contribute to
violations of the water quality standards. It will be presumed that a
stormwater management system complies with this requirement if:
      (1)   For sites one acre and greater, the preferred method is to design
water quality BMPs to trap 80% of total suspended solids (TSS) based on annual
loadings by particle class. Other alternative methods as a default criterion
include (1) designing BMPs to capture separately through BMP applications the
first 1.0-inch of runoff volume from the entire drainage area of the site and
discharge it over a 24-hour period, or (2) employing an anti-degradation
approach to pre-development versus post development. The specific requirements
for these approaches shall be described further in the Design Manual.
         (a)   For construction sites located within 3/4 mile of Lake Wylie,
Catawba River, Broad River, a drinking water supply source, or within 500 feet
of a perennial stream, as designated on the USGS map or as delineated by a
professional wetlands consultant, all water quality BMPs shall be designed to
achieve a sediment removal efficiency of 85% or greater for TSS.
      (2)   The Stormwater Administrator has discretion to require more
stringent controls for water quality where the Stormwater Administrator
determines the minimum standards of this section are not adequate. Areas where
more stringent controls may apply include outstanding resource waters, trout
waters, wetlands, steep slopes, 303(d) listed waters, TMDLs or other sensitive
areas.
   (C)   All development and redevelopment projects and portions of
redevelopment projects disturbing 1.0 acre or more of area and that will result
in more than 1 cubic foot per second increase in peak runoff rates shall meet
the requirements of this section even though there is not a change in land use.

§ 152.026 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FACILITIES.
   (A)   Stormwater management facilities may include any structural and non-
structural stormwater management measure used to convey and treat storm water
runoff including, but not limited to piping, ditches, basins, ponds,
proprietary devices, low impact development features, water quality buffers,
filtration and/or other treatment devices. Natural swales and other natural
runoff conduits shall be retained where practicable.
   (B)   Where additional stormwater management facilities are required to
satisfy the minimum control requirements, the following measures are examples
of what may be used in their order of preference or used in conjunction with
multiple measures:
      (1)   Green infrastructure (GI) or low impact development (LID)
practices, such as minimizing the area of streets, parking lots and rooftops;
bio-retention swales and basins; porous pavement; or other innovative measures
to reduce runoff volume and protect water quality when used in conjunction with
onsite detention for larger storm events;
      (2)   Facilities designed to encourage overland flow, slow velocities of
flow, and flow through buffer zones;
      (3)   Regional stormwater detention structures (dry basins);
      (4)   Regional stormwater retention structures (wet basins);
      (5)   On-site stormwater detention structures (dry basins);
      (6)   On-site stormwater retention structures (wet basins); and
      (7)   Infiltration practices, where permeable soils are present.
   (C)   Where detention and retention structures are used, designs which
consolidate these facilities into a limited number of large structures are
preferred over designs which utilize a large number of small structures, unless
GI/LID features are used to provide post construction water quality. Individual
lot LID’s will be limited for use up to a maximum of six lots in a proposed
subdivision unless approved by the Stormwater Administrator.
   (D)   C-SWPPPs can be rejected by the Stormwater Administrator if they
incorporate structures and facilities which have the potential to result in
significant long-term maintenance problems. The structure design parameters
outlined in the Design Manual must be met to prevent being rejected.
   (E)   The drainage system and all stormwater management structures within
the county (including both public and private portions) will be designed to the
same engineering and technical criteria and standards. Environmental
Compliance’s review will be the same whether the portion of the drainage system
will be under public or private control or ownership.
   (F)   All stormwater management measures shall be designed in accordance
with the design criteria contained in the Stormwater Management Design Manual
using procedures contained in the Manual or procedures approved by the
Stormwater Administrator.
(Ord. 2819, passed 6-17-19)
§ 152.027 HYDROLOGIC CRITERIA.
   The hydrologic criteria to be used for the C-SWPPP’s Stormwater Management
and Sediment Control section shall be as follows:
   (A)   The 25-year, 24-hour duration design storm for all cross-drain
culverts and drainage designs.
   (B)   The 10-year design storm for all interior culverts and drainage
conveyance system designs, plus 25-year design storm for all channel
conveyances.
   (C)   The 2-year, 10-year and 25-year, 24-hour design storms for all
detention and retention basins using procedures contained in the Stormwater
Management Design Manual or approved by the Stormwater Administrator. All
drainage designs shall be checked using the 100-year, 24-hour storm for
analysis of local flooding, and possible flood hazards to adjacent structures
and/or property.
   (D)   All hydrologic analysis will be based on pre-development and post-
development land use conditions.
   (E)   For the design of storage facilities, a secondary outlet device or
emergency spillway shall be provided to discharge the excess runoff in such a
way that no danger of loss of life or facility failure is created. The size of
the outlet device or emergency spillway shall be checked for passing the 100-
year, 24-hour storm, as a minimum requirement.
(Ord. 2819, passed 6-17-19)
§ 152.028 CONSISTENCY WITH WATERSHED MASTER PLANS, WATERSHED RESTORATION PLANS
OR FLOOD STUDIES.
   If applicable, the C-SWPPP’s Stormwater Management and Sediment Control
Section shall be consistent with watershed master plans, watershed restoration
plans or flood studies adopted and approved by the county.
(Ord. 2819, passed 6-17-19)
§ 152.029 OWNERSHIP AND COUNTY PARTICIPATION.
   All stormwater management facilities required by this chapter shall be
privately owned and maintained unless the county accepts the facility for
county ownership and maintenance.

at all times.
   (F)   The responsible parties shall be designated in the SWPPP, the
maintenance agreement, and final plat.
   (G)   For developments which establish a property owner’s association (POA)
or home owner’s association (HOA) or other common owner entity, provisions for
long term maintenance of site stormwater facilities and/or BMPs, as outlined in
the SWPPP, must be defined in the maintenance agreement. The provisions of this
agreement must also identify a source of funding to support future required
maintenance and upkeep activities, and an entity responsible for general
upkeep, maintenance and repair. The Stormwater Administrator must be notified
prior to any changes in status and personnel or contact information for record
keeping and inventory purposes in accordance with its NPDES MS4 permit
requirements.
   (H)   If the Stormwater Administrator determines that the stormwater
management facilities and/or BMPs were specifically designed as part of a LCP
to receive stormwater runoff from properties other than just the parcel the
feature is located on, then the county may determine that each parcel located
within the LCP served by the stormwater management facilities, and/or BMPs
constitutes a responsible party. The county may issue a notice of violation
and/or impose a percentage of the maintenance and repair costs to each
responsible party.
   (I)   The responsible parties shall inspect the stormwater management
facilities and/or BMPs at the frequencies listed in the maintenance agreement,
SWPPP, or the Stormwater Management Design Manual (whichever applies) and
perform any necessary maintenance including routine and non-routine activities.

   (M)   No person shall place any structure, equipment, fill, landscaping or
vegetation into stormwater management facilities and/or BMPs, or within a
drainage easement that transport stormwater to the stormwater management
facilities and/or BMPs which would limit or alter the functioning of the
stormwater management facilities and/or BMPs without the written approval of
the county.
   (N)   The responsible parties may landscape the stormwater management
facilities, BMPs and other areas if the landscaping is designed, installed and
maintained as prescribed in the Stormwater Management Design Manual. The
responsible parties shall take reasonable care to ensure that the stormwater
management facilities and/or BMPs do not contain conditions that are unsafe or
that adversely affect water quality including, but not limited to, leaving
tools or equipment or misusing pesticides and/or herbicides in the stormwater
management facilities and/or BMPs.
   (O)   The county must be notified in writing of any changes in maintenance
responsibility for the stormwater management facilities and/or best management
practices. In order to transfer maintenance responsibilities a letter of
acceptance by the entity accepting permanent maintenance responsibilities shall
be filed with the Stormwater Administrator.

record for future verification by the county for a period of at least five
years. Those records shall be made available to the county upon request.
(Ord. 2819, passed 6-17-19)
§ 152.034 FAILURE TO MAINTAIN.
   (A)   If the county determines at any time that any permanent stormwater
management facilities and/or BMPs have been eliminated, altered or improperly
maintained, the responsible parties shall be issued a notice of violation by
mail. The notice shall specify the corrective measures required to bring the
facility and/or BMP back into compliance with the design parameters and
specified period of time within which the necessary corrective actions must
take place.
   (B)   For a minor maintenance repair, a second notice and final notices will
be issued by both regular and certified mail.
   (C)   If the responsible parties fail or refuse to meet the requirements of
the inspection and maintenance agreement, or as outlined in the Stormwater
Management Design Manual, the county, after 30 days of the final written notice
(except, that in the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to
public health or public safety, then one 24-hour notice shall be sufficient),
may correct a violation of the design standards or maintenance requirements by
performing or having performed the necessary work to place the facility or
practice in proper working condition. The county may assess the responsible
parties for the cost of repair work, including any associated plans, permits,
oversight, inspection, and maintenance reporting, which shall become a lien on
the property, and which lien may be placed on the ad valorem tax bill for such
property and collected in the ordinary manner for such taxes.

EASEMENTS AND RIGHT-OF-WAYS
§ 152.035 DRAINAGE EASEMENTS AND RIGHT-OF-WAYS.
   (A)   All stormwater drainage easements and rights-of-way shall be indicated
and properly labeled on design plans and final plats. An adequate drainage
system, including necessary open ditches, pipes, culverts, storm sewers,
intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges and other necessary appurtenances
shall be installed according to plans and specifications approved by the
county. Drainage easements should be located, as consistently as possible, in
naturally occurring draws, swales and similar topographic locations. In cases
when it is necessary to construct a new drainage easement at a location where a
concentration of runoff has not occurred before, the new drainage easement
shall be located and constructed to minimize land disturbance, minimize flow
velocity and discharge into another drainage easement or stream.
   (B)   The design and construction of an approved stormwater drainage system
is viewed (by York County Planning and Development Services Department) as
equal in importance to all other items of road and subdivision construction.
Extreme caution shall be utilized in design to minimize changes in naturally
occurring stormwater runoff features. All owners / operators undertaking
stormwater drainage improvements shall first obtain for that purpose a land
disturbance permit from the county prior to commencing any such improvements.
This permit is obtained from the York County Planning and Development Services
Department.
(Ord. 2819, passed 6-17-19)
§ 152.036 ACCEPTANCE BY COUNTY.
   The county shall be presented with a written recorded drainage easement, in
addition to referencing on the final plat, and either a separate easement or
combined with the drainage easement for any post-construction BMP. Such
easements shall run with the land and provide York County or its designated
agents the right to access, inspect, monitor, maintain, repair, or replace any
portion of or infrastructure contained within the easement. Generally, the
owner of the property for which the easement is written will be responsible for
maintenance, repair, or replacement of the easement and any infrastructure
contained within the easement. The York County Council must specifically
approve any drainage or other easement before the county has the duty or
responsibility to maintain the easement(s). The county reserves the right to
accept only those easements which are a direct result of the collection and
distribution of stormwater related to county-dedicated roadway construction and
maintenance. Any facilities conveyed to York County under the provisions of
this chapter shall contain a covenant obligating the grantor to be responsible
for the maintenance of the facilities for a period of two years after the
facilities have been accepted by the county governing body.

PERFORMANCE SECURITY
§ 152.045 RESOURCE REMEDIATION FUND.
   (A)   Each and every new development is required to contribute to the
Resource Remediation Fund. This fund will provide assurance that all exposed
soil surfaces will be stabilized, and any other areas of storm water management
and sediment control deficiency will be addressed, in the event a development
discontinues or proper control measures are not installed and/or maintained.
   (B)   Prior to the issuance of any building and/or land disturbance permit
for a development or phase of development, every applicant must pay York County
a non-refundable resource remediation fee in accordance with
Chapter 31 - County Policies of this code. These fees will be held in a
separate, use restricted, interest bearing account known collectively as the
Resource Remediation Fund (the “RRF”). Monies deposited into the RRF may be
used by the county to remediate sites that, in the determination of the
Stormwater Administrator: are under construction or post-construction and
developed; have been abandoned; have been left in an unstable condition; or
contain stormwater management or sediment control deficiencies in violation of
this chapter. By submitting an application for land disturbing activity, each
applicant gives the county express authority to enter upon the subject property
during and after development activities for the purpose of performing
inspections and/or needed remediation, as determined by the Stormwater
Administrator.
   (C)   For all new development and all redevelopment of sites, an applicant
must provide to the county a notarized certification that the applicant has no
known direct or indirect contractual, business, financial, or familial
relationship (“relationship”) to a RRF site where fund money is outstanding or
operator at such site. Based on this statement, the county has the right to
request, and the applicant must supply, additional specific information
concerning any such affiliations.
   (D)   For sites at which monies from the RRF are spent, an applicant with a
relationship to any operator on such RRF site(s) or a relationship with a
person who in the past has significantly failed to comply with any provision of
this chapter or previously issued permit, will not be allowed to further
participate in this program and no further review of a permit for land
disturbing activity will be conducted by the county or permit issued, until
such time that all RRF monies are repaid to the county in full by the applicant
or other such related person. This is in addition to any other penalty or
injunctive relief authorized under this chapter.
   (E)   Staff will review funding on an annual basis and recommend any needed
changes.

§ 152.046 PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES.
   (A)   A performance guarantee may be requested by York County for any
commercial and subdivision project. The performance guarantee provides funds to
assure that all exposed soil surfaces will be stabilized should development
discontinue, proper control measures are not installed and/or maintained, or
provide for remedy should the permittee fail to comply with the soil erosion
permit and the approved soil erosion plan.
   (B)   A performance guarantee can be applied for the following situations:
      (1)   Offsite sedimentation.
      (2)   Final stabilization.
   (C)   As a precondition for county consideration of a final stabilization
performance guarantee, permittee shall make all necessary effort to attempt
full and complete stabilization of the site in accordance with the approved C-
SWPPP and the NPDES-CGP. As determined by the Stormwater Administrator, if,
after 14 calendar days, there is no visual evidence of germination and the
extended 10-day weather forecast predicts unfavorable conditions for
precipitation, the county may consider a final stabilization performance
guarantee at that time.
   (D)   This performance guarantee shall cover all expenses incurred by York
County, including administrative and legal costs and remediation required to
implement and maintain soil erosion and sedimentation controls until the site
is stabilized. If the performance guarantee does not cover the cost of
remediating the site, the permit holder will be responsible for the additional
costs. The performance guarantee may be used to pay outstanding permit/
inspection fees.
   (E)   The performance guarantee shall be in the form of a bank/cashier’s
check or irrevocable letter of credit and shall be in the amount professionally
determined to complete the remediation, subject to the Stormwater
Administrator’s approval.
   (F)   The performance guarantee shall be an amount that is at least 150% of
the estimated costs and expenses.
   (G)   This performance guarantee must be submitted prior to a final plat
approval of a subdivision or the issuance of a certificate of occupancy/
completion for a commercial building or single-family dwelling.
   (H)   This performance guarantee shall be issued for a period that extends
for the duration of the permit through project completion and issuance of a
notice of termination. The performance guarantee maybe released to the
applicant only upon the issuance of a notice of termination, or, in the case of
a transfer of permit, a new performance guarantee that meets all the
requirements of this section. In the case of off-site sedimentation, the
performance guarantee shall be released once all remediation has been
completed. If the owner/operator fails to complete the required remediation
satisfactorily within the required period of time, the performance guarantee
shall be forfeited and applied to the cost of completion of the required
remediation.
   (I)   Additional funds required for the completion of the remediation will
be the sole responsibility of the developer.
   (J)   If permitting and construction takes in excess of one year to
complete, the Stormwater Administrator may allow for the surety period to be
extended. This must be requested by the owner prior to the expiration date.

The Stormwater Administrator shall duly notify the owner of said property or
the representative on site and the inspection shall be conducted at a
reasonable time.
   (B)   Upon refusal by any property owner to permit an inspector to enter or
continue an inspection, the inspector shall terminate the inspection or confine
the inspection to areas concerning which no objection is raised. The inspector
shall immediately report the refusal and the grounds to the Stormwater
Administrator. The Stormwater Administrator and/or other authorized personnel
shall promptly seek appropriate compulsory process.
   (C)   In the event that the Stormwater Administrator or designee reasonably
believes that discharges from the property into the County MS4 may cause an
imminent and substantial threat to human health or the environment, the
inspection may take place at any time and without notice to the owner of the
property or a representative on site. The inspector shall present proper
credentials upon reasonable request by the owner or representative.
   (D)   Inspection reports shall be maintained, pursuant to county record
retention policies, at the Department.
(Ord. 2819, passed 6-17-19)
§ 152.053 CONSTRUCTION INSPECTION.
   (A)   Inspection and enforcement can be divided into two distinct
categories, during construction and post-construction. Construction inspection
ensures that the storm drainage systems, stormwater management facilities and
erosion and sediment control measures are constructed and installed in
accordance with the approved C-SWPPP and OS-SWPPP. All construction inspection
shall conform as outlined in the most current SCDHEC NPDES-CGP. In addition,
the following apply:
      (1)   No stage of work, related to the construction of stormwater
management facilities, shall proceed the next subsequent stage of work,
according to the sequence specified in the approved staged construction and
inspection control schedule until it is inspected and approved.
      (2)   The permittee shall notify York County Environmental Compliance
before commencing any work to implement the OS-SWPPP and upon completion of the
work.
      (3)   Inspections, by a qualified individual who is provided by the
permittee, must comply as outlined in the most current SCDHEC NPDES-CGP or may
be required at the discretion of the Stormwater Administrator at sites that
have compliance problems and at sites where stormwater discharges to
environmentally sensitive waters. Copies of all inspection reports shall be
submitted to the county within three working days from the date of the
inspection.
      (4)   Once construction is complete and final stabilization is reached,
the permittee may request notice of termination approval. Minimum requirements
include the following:
         (a)   A final inspection shall be conducted by the county.
         (b)   Any changes to final plat showing the location of all stormwater
easements and the responsible party for the maintenance of the system shall be
submitted. References shall be made to any and all ownership and lessee
covenants established for ensuring the maintenance and long term functioning of
the stormwater system. The plats shall also show conflicts with other new or
existing easements.
         (c)   As-built construction drawings of the stormwater management
facilities, including detention ponds, basins, ditches, swales, culverts,
piping, manholes and other related structures and features, shall be submitted
to show that the constructed project meets the requirements of the approved C-
SWPPP and on-site stormwater pollution prevention plan (OS-SWPPP).
         (d)   Verification from the design professional that all components of
the storm water management system meet the approved land disturbance permit and
specifications or achieve the function for which they were designed. In
addition, the site shall be cleared of all temporary BMPs (i.e., silt fence,
waddles, rock check dams, etc.) and all construction trash and debris from the
storm water system and the site as a whole.
         (e)   Upon receipt of the MS4 certification statement from the county,
the permittee shall submit a signed notice of termination form to SCDHEC. At
this point, the land disturbance permit is closed and the responsibility for
the operation and maintenance of the storm drainage systems and stormwater
management facilities are transferred from the operator to the persons
responsible for maintenance.
      (5)   “As-built” plans, certified by a registered professional, shall be
submitted upon completion of the stormwater management facilities. The
registered professional shall certify that:
         (a)   The facilities have been constructed as shown on the “as-built”
plan; and
         (b)   The facilities meet the approved C-SWPPP or achieve the function
for which they were designed.
      (6)   Acceptable “as-built” plans shall be submitted prior to:
         (a)   The use or occupancy of any commercial or industrial site.
         (b)   Ninety percent build out of a residential subdivision once the
multi-purpose basin has been converted from a sediment basin to the post-
construction water quality feature.
         (c)   Release of any performance security held by the county.
         (d)   Approval of a new C-SWPPP if the plan proposes to use existing
stormwater management facilities that does not have an acceptable “as-built”
plan on file at the Environmental Compliance office.
         (e)   Approval and/or acceptance for recording of plat or drawing, the
intent of which is to cause a division of a single parcel of land into two or
more parcels.

ENFORCEMENT, PENALTIES, AND CORRECTIVE ACTION
§ 152.061 VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Upon determination that a violation of any of the provisions of this
chapter or the SWMP has occurred, the Stormwater Administrator may give timely
notice at the property where the violation has occurred or at the address of
the permit holder. To the furthest extent practicable, written notice shall be
provided within five business days of the observed violation. This notice shall
specify: the nature of the violation, the potential penalty, if applicable, the
corrective action required, which may include restoration of impact to offsite
land and waters, and the amount of time in which to correct deficiencies, if
appropriate. It shall be sufficient notification to deliver the notice to the
person to whom it is addressed via email or by placing written notice in the
on-site construction mailbox, or by depositing a copy of such in the United
States Mail, sufficient postage prepaid, certified and addressed to the address
used for tax purposes.
   (B)   Upon determination that a violation of any of the provisions of this
chapter or the SWMP has occurred, the county may choose to pursue in magistrate
court action for criminal fines and penalties to the maximum extent allowed by
law. The county may also choose, at its sole discretion, to proceed with
imposing civil fines and corrective action requirements via a consent process.
The consent process consists of the following procedures: First, the county’s
Stormwater Administrator shall hold a fact finding meeting with the violator.
Second, the Stormwater Administrator shall develop a draft consent agreement
that contains corrective actions and penalties based on the facts found. Third,
the draft consent agreement is presented to the violator which may be
negotiated for a mutually agreeable action resolution. Should the parties fail
to agree on the consent agreement terms, the administrative process shall
conclude and the Stormwater Administrator will present an administrative order
to be enforced against the violator to the fullest extent of the violations
issued. Where the violator refuses to comply with the administrative order, the
county may pursue criminal and/or civil penalties for all violations as
authorized by this chapter in a court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in
this section shall limit the ability of the county to pursue corrective action,
including, but not limited to, stop work orders under §
152.065.
   (C)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, at all times, the County Attorney or
associated legal counsel may institute injunctive, mandamus or other
appropriate action or proceedings at law or equity, including criminal
proceedings, for the enforcement of this chapter or to correct violations of
this chapter, and any court of competent jurisdiction shall have the right to
issue restraining orders, temporary or permanent injunctions, mandamus or other
appropriate forms of remedy or relief.
(Ord. 2819, passed 6-17-19)
§ 152.062 CRIMINAL PENALTIES.
   The county has the authority to charge any person who negligently,
willfully, or intentionally violates any provision of this chapter with a
misdemeanor punishable within the jurisdictional limits of the magistrate's
court. Each day of a violation shall constitute a new and separate offense.
(Ord. 2819, passed 6-17-19; Am. Ord. 3420, passed 10-5-20)
§ 152.063 ADDITIONAL LEGAL MEASURES.
   Where the county is fined and/or placed under a compliance schedule by the
state or federal government for a violation(s) of its NPDES permit, and the
county can identify the person(s) who caused such violation(s) to occur, the
county may pass the penalty and cost of compliance through to the responsible
person(s).
(Ord. 2819, passed 6-17-19)
§ 152.064 CORRECTIVE ACTION.
   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be required
to comply with the Stormwater Administrator’s notice. Where a violation of this
chapter has not been corrected by the violator within the applicable time
period for correction, York County, or its contractor, may enter upon the lot
or parcel of land and correct the violation, including offsite impact, and the
costs incurred as a result of such action (including inspection,
administration, labor and equipment costs) shall be collected from the
remediation fee, other means of security in place and sufficient to cover such
costs, or shall become a lien upon the property and shall be collected in the
same manner as county taxes are collected. These costs shall be assessed in
addition to any other penalty or injunctive relief authorized under this
chapter.
(Ord. 2819, passed 6-17-19)
§ 152.065 STOP WORK AND ASSOCIATED FEES, PENALTIES AND COSTS.
   (A)   The following activities shall result in an immediate stop work order
placed on the subject property which shall carry with it a civil penalty, as
enforced by the Stormwater Administrator:
      (1)   Any person who proceeds with any work which requires a land
disturbance permit, a SMSCP hereunder without first submitting a plan and
obtaining the permit, where applicable,
      (2)   Any person who proceeds with any land disturbance on any project
without a pre-construction conference or issuance of the final land disturbance
permit.
      (3)   Any illicit discharge, illicit connection or improper disposal as
defined per §
152.041,
      (4)   Off-site sedimentation, which is actively entering or threatening
to enter a surface water or natural waterway, or has entered upon and
accumulated on an adjacent property, as a result of failure of a BMP or
stormwater management facility, or noncompliance with an approved SMSCP or C-
SWPPP.
   (B)   A stop work order may be issued for violations of the conditions of
the land disturbance permit, C-SWPPP or SMSCP, not specifically identified in §
152.065(A), or construction not in accordance with the letter or intent of the
approved plans, the existence of which poses an immediate and substantial
danger to a downstream area or adjacent property in the judgment of the
Stormwater Administrator or designee.
   (C)   The stop work order will require correction of NOV issues, and shall
otherwise stop all other project related activities.
   (D)   The county retains the right to place a hold on any building permit
applications pending before the county and any building permits issued by the
county to the financially responsible party, owner of the property or
contractor until violations identified in the NOV are corrected.
   (E)   Any person in violation of a stop work order is subject to payment of
all fees, bonds, and penalties prior to the lifting of the stop work order.
(Ord. 2819, passed 6-17-19)
§ 152.066 PERMIT SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION.
   A land disturbance permit may be suspended or revoked if one or more of the
following violations have been committed:
   (A)   Violations of the conditions of the approved C-SWPPP or the OS-SWPPP;
   (B)   Construction not in accordance with the letter or intent of the
approved plans;
   (C)   Non-compliance with correction notice(s) or stop work order(s);
   (D)   The existence of an immediate danger in a downstream area in the
judgment of the Stormwater Administrator; or
   (E)   The operator did not renew the land disturbance permit upon the
permit’s expiration date or renew NOI coverage from SCDHEC upon its expiration
date.
(Ord. 2819, passed 6-17-19)
§ 152.067 CIVIL PENALTIES.
   In addition to or in lieu of the criminal penalties authorized by this
chapter, the county has the authority to assess a civil penalty of not more
than $1,000 per violation against any person who has violated any provision of
this chapter. Each separate day of a violation constitutes a new and separate
violation. No penalty may be assessed until the person alleged to be in
violation has been notified of the violation. The Stormwater Administrator
shall determine the amount of the civil penalty to be assessed under this
section for violations under the jurisdiction of the county. Written demand for
payment shall be made upon the person responsible for the violation and shall
set forth in detail the violation for which the penalty has been invoked. If
payment is not received or equitable settlement reached within thirty days
after demand for payment is made, a civil action may be filed in circuit court
to recover the amount of the penalty. The Stormwater Administrator may hold in
abeyance the written demand for payment until the deadline for appealing the
administrative decision regarding the underlying violation has expired or until
the appeals process as delineated in §
152.081 is exhausted. All civil fines collected pursuant to the provisions of
this section shall be directed to fund the costs associated with stormwater
education, correcting violations and/or enforcing the provisions of this
chapter.

§§ 152.068 – 152.070 [RESERVED].
WAIVERS AND VARIANCES
§ 152.071 GENERAL.
   The Stormwater Administrator may grant a waiver or variance from the
requirements of this chapter where it does not conflict with federal or state
regulations. These situations apply where there are exceptional circumstances
applicable to a site exist such that strict adherence to the provisions of the
chapter will not fulfill the intent of the chapter.
(Ord. 2819, passed 6-17-19)
§ 152.072 REQUESTING A WAIVER OR VARIANCE.
   (A)   A written request for a waiver or variance shall be required and shall
state the specific waiver or variance sought and the reasons, with supporting
data, that a waiver or variance should be granted. The request shall include
all information necessary to evaluate the proposed waiver or variance and shall
be submitted as a stand-alone document at the front of the C-SWPPP submittal. A
request for a waiver or variance shall be accompanied by a fee in accordance
with
Chapter 31 - County Policies of this code.
   (B)   Waiver from permanent water quality control.
      (1)   A project may be eligible for a waiver of stormwater management
requirements for water quality control if the applicant can justly verify that:
         (a)   The proposed land development activity will return the disturbed
areas to the pre-development land use and runoff conditions.
         (b)   The proposed land development will create land use conditions
that are highly likely to discharge less pollutants than the pre-development
land use conditions.
         (c)   The pre-development land use conditions are unchanged at the end
of the project.
      (2)   This waiver does not exclude water quality, erosion prevention,
sediment control and water quantity controls from being implemented during the
active construction phases of a particular project.
   (C)   Waiver from permanent water quantity control.
      (1)   A project may be eligible for a waiver of stormwater management
requirements for water quantity control if the applicant can justly verify
that:
         (a)   The proposed project and reasonable assumptions for future
development conditions in the watershed will not create any adverse impacts on
the receiving natural waterway or road crossings downstream of the property.
            1.   These adverse impacts may include but are not limited to the
following:
               a.   Increased flow velocity or volume that would increase
channel erosion.
               b.   Increased peak flow rates or volumes that are higher than
the capacity of downstream bridges and culverts.
               c.   Increased flow depth or volume that would flood
outbuildings, air conditioning units, crawl spaces, or finished floor
elevations.
            2.   Reasonable assumptions for future development conditions shall
be made for undeveloped properties upstream of the construction site. The
Engineering Department can aid in the determination of future watershed
development conditions.
         (b)   The installation of stormwater management facilities would have
insignificant effects on reducing downstream peak flow rates and flood peaks.
         (c)   Stormwater management facilities are not needed to protect
downstream developments and the downstream drainage system has sufficient
capacity to receive the increases in runoff from the development.
         (d)   The imposition of peak flow rate control for stormwater
management would create, aggravate, or accelerate downstream flooding.
      (2)   This waiver does not exclude water quality, erosion prevention,
sediment control and water quantity controls from being implemented during the
active construction phases of a particular project. The Stormwater
Administrator will grant waivers based on the review of the items listed above.
(Ord. 2819, passed 6-17-19)
§ 152.073 REVIEW PROCEDURE.
   The Stormwater Administrator shall conduct a review of the request for a
variance and issue a decision within 10 working days of receiving the request.
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Stormwater Administrator may appeal
such decision as specified in §
152.081.

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
§ 153.01 COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ADOPTED.
   (A)   Legislative findings. The York County Council, as the governing body
of York County, finds that:
      (1)   The General Assembly of South Carolina enacted in 1994 an amendment
to the South Carolina Code of Laws by adding new Chapter 29 to Title 6 entitled
“South Carolina Local Government Comprehensive Planning Enabling Act of 1994”
(“1994 Planning Act”) which repealed all previously-enacted planning acts and
codes;
      (2)   The1994 Planning Act requires the local planning commission to
develop and maintain a planning process which will result in the systematic
preparation and continued reevaluation and updating of certain planning
elements considered critical, necessary, and desirable to guide the development
and redevelopment of its area of jurisdiction;
      (3)   The required planning process shall include the development,
recommendation to the governing body, periodic review, and updating of a
comprehensive plan, to include amendments;
      (4)   Pursuant to S.C. Code § 6-29-340, the 1994 Planning Act provides
for the planning commission to create and distribute maps relative to the plans
and programs it is charged with developing;
      (5)   In November of 2025, upon recommendation by the York County
Planning Commission, York County considered and adopted the 2025 York County
Comprehensive Plan and 2025 Land Use Plan element including the 2025 Land Use
Map; and
      (6)   Pursuant to S.C. Code § 6-29-340, the 1994 Planning Act provides
the Planning Commission with the power and duty to revise periodically its
plans and programs;
      (7)   The York County Planning Commission has found it appropriate and
necessary to recommend amendment of 2025 Land Use Plan element of the 2025 York
County Comprehensive Plan in order to amend the entire 2025 Land Use Map in
order to correct manifest errors which resulted from the digitizing process
used to create the 2025 Land Use Map;
      (8)   These errors have created misaligned land use districts and areas
on the map where no land use district was specified creating difficulties in
accurately implementing the 2025 Land Use Plan;
      (9)   These errors exist throughout the entirety of the 2025 Land Use Map
and the revisions need to be made in order to correct these manifest errors
appearing upon the map on a county wide basis;
      (10)   The York County Council finds it necessary and appropriate to re-
evaluate the 2025 York County Comprehensive Plan and the 2025 Land Use Plan Map
in order to meet changing conditions;
      (11)   In order for the 2025 York County Comprehensive Plan and 2025 Land
Use Plan Map to remain responsive and relevant to these changing conditions,
the Plan and Map may be amended from time to time pursuant to the power and
authority granted the planning commission under S.C. Code § 6-29-340 and
pursuant to the authority within §
153.01 (B) and S.C. Code § 6-29-510(E);
      (12)   It is appropriate and necessary to amend the entire 2025 Land Use
Map to correct manifest errors as a result of the digitizing process used to
create the 2025 Land Use Map; these errors have created misaligned land use
districts and areas on the map where no land use district was specified
creating difficulties in accurately implementing the 2025 Land Use Plan; these
errors exist throughout the entirety of the 2025 Land Use Map and the revisions
need to be made in order to change the errors appearing upon the Map on a
county wide basis; and
      (13)   Such an amendment to the 2025 Land Use Map would promote the
public health, safety, order, appearance, prosperity and general welfare of the
County.
   (B)   Amendment of the 2025 York County Comprehensive Plan Land Use Map.
Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in the legislative findings and by
virtue of this section, the York County Council hereby amends the 2025 Land Use
Plan Map of the 2025 York County Comprehensive Plan in order to correct
manifest errors which occurred as a result of the digitizing process utilized
in the creation of the initial 2025 Land Use Map. The Amended 2025 Land Use Map
will eliminate misaligned land-use districts appearing on the initial map and
will eliminate those areas appearing on the initial map where no land-use
districts were designated. The entirety of the Amended 2025 Land Use Map is
incorporated herein by reference, with the original map being maintained in the

§ 153.58 PROCEDURES FOR IMPOSITION; CALCULATION AND COLLECTION OF IMPACT FEES.
   (A)   In general. An applicant shall be notified by the county of the
applicable impact fee requirements at the time of application for a building
permit, and calculated and paid prior to issuance of a building permit.
   (B)   Calculation.
      (1)   Upon receipt of an application for a building permit, the director
shall determine: (a) whether it is a residential or non-residential use; (b)
the specific category (type) of residential or non-residential development, if
applicable; (c) if residential, the number of new dwelling units; (d) if
nonresidential, the number of new or additional square feet of floor area and
the proposed use, and; (e) the impact fee district(s) in which the new
development is located. After making these determinations, the director shall
calculate the impact fees due. If the applicant has requested an offset
pursuant to division (C), the offset shall be calculated and subtracted from
the impact fees due.
      (2)   If the type of land use proposed for new development is not
expressly listed in the specific fee setting impact fee ordinance, the director
shall: (a) identify the most similar land use type listed and calculate the
impact fees based on the fees for that land use; or (b) identify the broader
land use category within which the specific land use would apply and calculate
the impact fees based on the impact fees for that land use category.
      (3)   An applicant may request a non-binding estimate of impact fees due
from the director for a particular new development at any time. The estimate
may change depending on the time a formal application for a building permit is
submitted.
      (4)   The calculation of impact fees due from a multiple-use new
development shall be based upon the fees due for each use.
      (5)   The calculation of impact fees due from phased development shall be
based upon the demand generated by each specific use of the phase of
development.
   (C)   Offsets.
      (1)   Offsets against the amount of impact fees due from a new
development may be provided by an applicant for the dedication of land and/or
the provision of public facility system improvements that are identified in the
capital improvement plan for the particular public facility if either (a) the
costs of such land or public facilities have been included in the capital
improvement plan for the public facility or the impact fee calculation
methodology, or (b) the land dedicated is determined by the director to be a
reasonable substitute for the cost of public facilities which are included in
the capital improvement plan and applicable impact fee calculation methodology.
      (2)   Applications for offsets shall be made on forms provided by the
director and shall be submitted concurrent or prior to an application for
building permit. The application for an offset shall be accompanied by evidence
establishing the eligibility of the applicant for the offset. The director
shall calculate the applicable impact fees without the offset and then
determine whether an offset is due and, if so, the amount of the offset. The
offset shall be applied against the impact fees due. In no event shall an
offset be granted in an amount exceeding the impact fees due.
      (3)   Offsets for dedication of land or provision of public facility
system improvements that are identified in the capital improvement plan shall
be applicable only as to impact fees imposed for the same types of public
facilities. Even if the value of the dedication of land or provision of a
public facility exceeds the impact fees due for the type of public facility,
the excess value may not be transferred to impact fees calculated as due from
the applicant for other types of public facilities, nor may the excess value be
transferred to other applicants or properties.
   (D)   Collection.
      (1)   The director shall collect all applicable impact fees at the time
of issuance of a building permit unless:
         (a)   The applicant is determined to be entitled to a full offset;
         (b)   The applicant has been determined to be not subject to the
payment of impact fees; or
         (c)   The applicant has taken an appeal pursuant to §
153.61, and a bond or other surety in the amount of the impact fee, as
calculated by the director, has been posted with the county.

Am. Ord. 2718, passed 7-16-18)
§ 153.59 ESTABLISHMENT OF IMPACT FEE ACCOUNTS; APPROPRIATION OF IMPACT FEE
FUNDS; AND REFUNDS.
   (A)   Impact fee accounts. An impact fee account is established by the
county for each public facility for which impact fees are imposed. The accounts
shall clearly identify the category, account, or fund for which the impact fees
are imposed. Subaccounts may be established for individual impact fee districts
and subdistricts. All impact fees collected by the county shall be deposited
into the appropriate impact fee account or subaccount, which shall be interest
bearing. All interest earned or monies deposited to the accounts or subaccounts
shall be credited to and shall be considered funds of the account. The funds of
each account shall not be commingled with other funds or revenues of the
county. The county shall establish and implement necessary accounting controls
to ensure that the impact fee funds are properly deposited, accounted for, and
appropriated in accordance with these procedures, and any other applicable
legal requirements.
   (B)   Appropriation of impact fee funds.
      (1)   In general. Impact fee funds may be appropriated for public
facilities identified in the capital improvement plan, as may be amended from
time to time, of the public facility and for the payment of principal, bonds,
contracts, and other obligations issued by or on behalf of the county to
finance the public facilities.
      (2)   Restrictions on appropriations. Impact fees shall be appropriated
only (a) for the public facility for which they were imposed, calculated and
collected, or included within, provided for in, or authorized by an amended
capital improvements plan; (b) within the impact fee district or subdistrict
where collected. They shall be appropriated and expended within three years of
the date they were scheduled to be expended in the capital improvements plan or
any amended capital improvements plan. Impact fees shall not be appropriated or
expended for funding maintenance or repair of public facilities nor for
operational or personnel expenses associated with the provision of the public
facility.
      (3)   Appropriation of impact fee funds outside of district or
subdistrict where collected. Except for public education facilities impact
fees, impact fee funds may be appropriated for a public facility located
outside of the district or subdistrict where collected, if the demand for the
public facility is generated in whole or in part by the new development or if
the public facility will serve the new development.
   (C)   Procedure for appropriation of impact fee funds.
      (1)   The county shall, each year, identify public facility projects
anticipated to be funded in whole or in part with impact fees. The public
facility recommendations shall be based upon the impact fee annual review set
forth in §
153.57(B) and such other information as may be relevant, but shall not be part
of the annual budget and capital improvements programming process.
      (2)   The recommendations shall be consistent with the provisions of
these procedures, the fee setting impact fee ordinance for the public facility,
applicable legal requirements, and any guidelines adopted by the County
Council.
      (3)   The County Council may include impact fee-funded public facilities
in the county’s annual budget and capital improvements program. If included,
the description of the public facility shall specify the nature of the public
facility, the location of the public facility, the capacity to be added by the
public facility, the service area of the public facility, the need/demand for
the public facility and the anticipated timing of completion of the public
facility.
      (4)   The County Council shall verify that adequate impact fee funds are
or will be available from the appropriate impact fee accounts for the specified
public facility.
   (D)   Refunds.
      (1)   Eligibility for refund.
         (a)   Expiration or revocation of permit or approval. An applicant or
a successor-in-interest who has paid impact fees for new development for which
an approval or permit has expired or been revoked is eligible to apply for a
refund of impact fees paid.
         (b)   Failure of county to appropriate impact fee funds within time
limit. The county shall notify the owner of record of a development that has
been paid impact fees if the county has failed to appropriate and expend the
impact fees collected from the applicant within the time limits established in
division (B)(2), and the owner of record is eligible to apply for a refund of
impact fees paid. The accounting shall be based on a first-in, first-out basis.
         (c)   Reduction in density or intensity of new development. The
applicant or a successor-in- interest who paid impact fees is eligible for a
refund if the density or intensity of the development for which the impact fees
are paid is reduced after payment of the fees, and the fees are not
appropriated and expended.
      (2)   Refund application for expiration or revocation of permit or
approval. Applications for a refund due to expiration or revocation of a permit
or approval of the development shall include: (a) evidence that the applicant
is the property owner or the duly designated agent of the property owner, (b)
the amount of the impact fees paid and receipts evidencing such payments, and
(c) documentation evidencing the expiration or revocation of the permit or
approval. Failure to apply for the refund within 60 days following expiration
or revocation of the permit or approval shall constitute a waiver of
entitlement to a refund. No interest shall be paid by the county in calculating
the amount of the refunds.
      (3)   Refund application for failure of county to appropriate and expend
funds. Applications for refunds due to county failure to appropriate and expend
fees collected from an applicant within the time limits established in division
(B)(2) shall be initiated by the owner-of-record within 120 days after the
county has notified the owner of a right to a refund. To receive the refund,
the owner-of- record shall submit (a) evidence that the applicant is the
property owner or the duly designated agent of the property owner, and (b) the
amount of the impact fees paid and receipts evidencing the payments. Refunds
shall include any interest earned on the impact fees being refunded.
      (4)   Refund application due to reduction in density or intensity.
Applications for refunds due to a reduction in density or intensity of
development shall include (a) evidence that the applicant is the property owner
or developer who paid the impact fees or, if the applicant is the current
owner, evidence that the developer has waived rights to a refund, (b) the
amount of the impact fees paid and receipts evidencing payments, and (c)
documentation evidencing a reduction in density or intensity of the new
development. No refund shall be approved until a revised new development plan
is approved by the county; with any right to a refund being waived unless a
written request for a refund is initiated within two years of the county
approval of the revised new development plan, or final construction is
completed, whichever is later. The refund shall be paid to the current property
owner or developer, as appropriate. The refund shall be calculated in
accordance with the following formula:
      (SU1 x F) - (SU2 x FI), where:
      SU1   =   public facility demand generated originally by the new
development;
      SU2   =   public facility demand currently generated by the new
development;
      F   =   impact fee in effect at the time of original approval of the new
development;
      F1   =   impact currently fee in effect at the time of approval of the
new development.
      (5)   Method of refund. The county may, at its option, make refunds of
impact fees by direct payment, by offsetting such refunds against other impact
fees due for the same public facility for new development on the same property,
or by other means subject to agreement with the person receiving the refund.

Am. Ord. 6322, passed 12-19-22)
§ 153.60 APPEALS.
   (A)   A fee payor may pay an impact fee under protest. A fee payor making
the payment of impact fees is not stopped from exercising the right of appeal
under this subchapter, or stopped from receiving a refund for any overpayment
of the fees, if that is determined to be the case on appeal.
   (B)   An appeal from any decision of the director pursuant to these
procedures shall be made to the County Manager. If the notice of appeal is
accompanied by a letter of credit in a form satisfactory to the County Attorney
in an amount equal to the impact fees due, the development may be approved. The
filing of an appeal shall not stay the imposition or the collection of impact
fees unless a bond or other sufficient surety is provided.
      (1)   No later than 30 days after receiving the appeal, the County
Manager or his or her authorized designee shall conduct an appeal-review in
which the appellant and a representative from York County may present
justification and documents related to the issue on appeal.
      (2)   The Manager shall consider all pertinent justification and
materials submitted by the appellant and by the county representative, and all

section, and School Impact Fee Study and Amended Capital Improvement Plan
prepared for the Fort Mill School District by TischlerBise (dated June 14, 2018
and revised September 7, 2022, and any amendments thereafter). The maximum
allowable school impact fee is stated in Attachment B: Fort Mill School
District Fee Calculations (dated November 29, 2022), which is attached to
Ordinance No. 6822 and incorporated herein by reference. The impact fee amount
for the school district which will be charged is established in Attachment A:
Fort Mill School District Public Education Facilities Impact Fee Schedule,
which is attached to Ordinance 2818 and Attachment A: The Fort Mill School
District Public Education Facilities Impact Fee Schedule, which is attached to
Ordinance No. 6822, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.
   (B)   The following general procedure shall be followed by the county upon
receipt of an application for a building permit for new residential
development:
      (1)   Identify the number and type of dwelling units in the proposed new
residential development; and
      (2)   Multiply the number of dwelling units by the impact fee per the
type of dwelling unit.
   (C)   In lieu of calculating the amount(s) of impact fees by reference to

payor may request that the amount of the required impact fees be determined by
reference to an Individual Assessment of Development Impact for the proposed
development.
      (1)   If a fee payor requests the use of an Individual Assessment of
Development Impact, the fee payor shall be responsible for retaining a
qualified professional to prepare the Individual Assessment of Development
Impact that complies with the requirements of this section, at the fee payor's
expense.
      (2)   Each Individual Assessment of Development Impact shall be based on
the same level of service standards and system improvement costs for capital
improvements for public education facilities used in School Impact Fee Study
and Amended Capital improvement Plan prepared for the Fort Mill School District
by TischlerBise (dated June 14, 2018 and revised September 7, 2022, and any
amendments thereafter), and shall document the relevant methodologies and
assumptions used.
      (3)   Each Individual Assessment of Development Impact shall be submitted
to the director or a designee, and may be accepted, rejected, or accepted with
modifications by the director or a designee as the basis for calculating public
education facilities impact fees. If an Individual Assessment of Development
Impact is accepted or accepted with modifications by the director or a designee
as a more accurate measure of the demand for capital improvements for public
education facilities created by the proposed new development than the
applicable fees in Attachment A of Ordinance No. 2818 and Ordinance No. 6822,
then the impact fees due under this subchapter shall be calculated according to
such assessment.
      (4)   The decision of the Director regarding the Individual Assessment of
Development Impact shall be final. A fee payor may appeal the Director's
decision pursuant to the appeal procedures identified in Ordinance 2718 (impact
fee procedures).

the standards and procedures in county zoning, land development and land use
ordinances and regulations is subject to the following conditions and
limitations:
      (1)   The form and content of a site specific development plan submitted
by a landowner must conform and comply with county planning, zoning,
subdivision stormwater management and sediment control, building, electrical,
mechanical, life safety, fire, water and sewer, road and other codes,
ordinances and regulations applicable to such development or development plan;
      (2)   No vested right in a site specific development plan shall be
established except in conformity with county planning, zoning, subdivision
stormwater management and sediment control, building, electrical, mechanical,
life safety, fire, water and sewer, road and other land use codes, ordinances
and regulations;
      (3)   If the Planning Commission approves a vested right for one or more
phases of a phased development plan, a site specific development plan shall be
required for approval with respect to each phase in accordance with regulations
in effect at the time of vesting;
      (4)   No vested right is established under a conditionally approved site
specific development plan or conditionally approved phased development plan.
Any approved site specific development plan or approved phased development plan
or phase thereof may be terminated by the Planning Commission upon its
determination, following notice and a public hearing, that the landowner has
failed to meet the terms of the approval; and
      (5)   A vested right established in accordance with the provisions of
this subchapter shall be vested upon approval by the Planning Commission of the
site specific development plan or specific phase of a phased development plan
that authorizes the developer or landowner to proceed with investment in
grading, installation of utilities, streets and other infrastructure and to
undertake other specific expenditures necessary to prepare for application for
a building permit. No developer or landowner shall proceed with investment in
grading, installation of utilities, streets or other infrastructure, or shall
undertake other significant expenditures necessary to prepare for application
for a building permit before a site specific development plan or phased
development plan or phase thereof authorizing such improvements and
expenditures has been approved by the Planning Commission. No investment in
grading, installation of utilities, streets or other infrastructure, or other
significant expenditures shall give rise to or establish a vested right until
the Planning Commission has approved the site specific development plan or
phased development plan or phase thereof that authorizes the developer or
landowner to proceed with improvements or undertake other significant
expenditures on the real property which is proposed for development.
   (B)   A site specific development plan for which a variance, regulation or
special exception is necessary, does not qualify and may not claim or receive
vested right status unless and until the variance, regulation or special
exception is obtained and the site specific development plan has been approved
without conditions or exceptions. A phased development plan for which a
variance, regulation or special exception is necessary does not qualify and may
not obtain a vested right until the variance, regulation or special exception
is obtained and the phase of the phased development plan has been approved

   (C)   A vested right for a site specific development plan expires two years
after vesting; provided, however, that the landowner of real property with a
vested right may apply to the Planning Commission no more than 60 days before
the end of the vesting period, but not thereafter, for an annual extension of
the vested right for a period of one year. If a timely and proper written
application is made, the Planning Commission must approve applications for no
more than five successive annual extensions unless an amendment to land
development ordinances or regulations has been adopted that prohibits approval
of such annual extension applications. The Planning Commission shall designate
the vesting point for a phased development plan as the date of approval of each
phase of the phased development plan. The Planning Commission may extend the
time for a vested site specific development plan to a total of five years upon
a determination that there is just cause for the extension and that the public
interest is not adversely affected. Upon expiration of a vested right, a
building permit may be issued for development only in accordance with
applicable land development ordinances and regulations then applicable.

plan which has been approved by the Planning Commission may be amended if the
amendments are approved by the Planning Commission pursuant to the provisions
of applicable county land development ordinances and regulations.
   (E)   A validly issued building permit does not expire or is not revoked
upon expiration or termination of a vested right, except for public safety
reasons or as prescribed by the applicable building code.

phased development plan may be revoked by the Planning Commission upon its
determination, after notice and a public hearing, that there was a material
misrepresentation by the landowner or substantial non-compliance with the terms
and conditions of the original or amended approval.
   (G)   A vested site specific development plan or a vested phase of a phased
development plan is subject to later enacted federal, state or local laws or
ordinances adopted to protect public health, safety and welfare, including, but
not limited to, building, fire, plumbing, electrical and mechanical codes and
non-conforming structure and use regulations which do not provide for the
grandfathering of the vested right. The issuance of a building permit vests the
specific construction project authorized by the building permit to the
building, fire, plumbing, electrical and mechanical codes in force at the time
of the issuance of the building permit.
   (H)   A vested site specific development plan or vested phased development
plan or phase thereof is subject to later local governmental overlay zoning
that imposes site plan-related requirements but does not affect allowable
types, height as it affects density or intensity of uses or density or
intensity of uses.
   (I)   A change in the zoning district designation or land use regulations
made subsequent to vesting that affects real property does not operate to
affect, prevent or delay development of the real property under a vested site
specific development plan or vested phase of a phased development plan without
the consent of the landowner.
   (J)   If real property having a vested site specific development plan or
vested phased development plan or phase thereof is annexed, the governing body
of the municipality to which the real property has been annexed must determine,
after notice and public hearing in which the landowner is allowed to present
evidence, if the vested right is effective after the annexation.
   (K)   The County Council, the Planning Commission and local zoning, planning

building, fire, plumbing, electrical and mechanical codes and non-conforming
structure and use regulations which do not provide for grandfathering of the

that a vested right exists or does not exist pursuant to other statutory
provisions.

dwellings
§ 156.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to allow the occupancy of temporary emergency
dwellings under certain circumstances in order to address personal hardships.
Because such hardships or needs are personal, temporary and transitory, the
approval of a temporary emergency dwelling permit does not constitute a long-
term use, authorization, permit or approval that conflicts with the York County
Comprehensive Plan or constitutes a threat or hazard to the health, safety and
welfare of York County, the permittee, occupants of the permitted temporary
residence or adjoining property owners.
(Ord. 1409, passed 4-6-09; Am. Ord. 2716, passed 6-20-16)
§ 156.02 TEMPORARY EMERGENCY DWELLING PERMIT AUTHORIZED; PERSONAL HARDSHIP
DEFINED.
   The owner of a parcel of land in York County may apply for a temporary
emergency dwelling permit to authorize up to one temporary emergency dwelling
on his or her parcel under the following circumstance:
   (A)   A temporary emergency hardship exists when a fire, flood, or other
accident renders a permanent dwelling uninhabitable;
   (B)   The owner of the parcel is in the process of repairing or rebuilding a
permanent dwelling on that parcel because a temporary emergency hardship
rendered the permanent dwelling uninhabitable;
   (C)   The owner must have occupied the permanent dwelling prior to the
temporary emergency hardship and must intend to occupy the repaired or rebuilt
permanent dwelling.
(Ord. 1409, passed 4-6-09; Am. Ord. 2716, passed 6-20-16)
§ 156.03 CRITERIA AND STANDARDS.
   Every temporary emergency dwelling permit authorized and issued in
accordance with this chapter shall meet all of the following criteria and
standards:
   (A)   There shall be no more than one temporary emergency dwelling per
parcel;
   (B)   A current vehicular license shall be maintained for any recreational
vehicle used as a temporary emergency dwelling. A recreational vehicle shall be
defined as described in the Zoning Code;
   (C)   A temporary emergency dwelling shall be maintained in a manner which
will facilitate its removal by the expiration date of the permit;
   (D)   The placement of the temporary emergency dwelling must meet SCDHEC
requirements for water and wastewater connections and York County requirements
for temporary electrical service;
   (E)   Setback requirements applicable to a residential structure shall be
met.
(Ord. 1409, passed 4-6-09; Am. Ord. 2716, passed 6-20-16)
§ 156.04 APPLICATION.
   To apply for a temporary emergency dwelling permit, the parcel owner shall
submit a completed application on a form supplied by the planning department.
In addition, the parcel owner must submit copies of issued applicable permits
for the repairing or rebuilding of the permanent dwelling intended for the
owner’s occupation on the subject parcel. The temporary emergency dwelling
permit application shall be accompanied by:
   (A)   A site plan drawn to a scale large enough to allow determination of
the following:
      (1)   The size and boundaries of the parcel;
      (2)   The size and location of access, including driveways and access
easements, from the parcel to a county, state or public road;
      (3)   The approximate location and size of all existing structures on the
parcel; and
      (4)   The proposed location and size of the temporary dwelling;
   (B)   A description of the proposed dwelling; and
   (C)   A notarized statement signed by all owners of the parcel (excluding
lien holders) setting forth the circumstances which necessitate the temporary
dwelling.
(Ord. 1409, passed 4-6-09; Am. Ord. 2716, passed 6-20-16)
§ 156.05 DECISION ON APPLICATION.
   A permit for a temporary emergency dwelling may be issued by the York County
Council upon a finding that:
   (A)   The application is complete;
   (B)   Grounds exist for the application and that a temporary emergency
hardship exists under this chapter; and
   (C)   The standards and criteria required by this chapter have been met.
(Ord. 1409, passed 4-6-09; Am. Ord. 2716, passed 6-20-16)
§ 156.06 CONDITIONS.
   When approving a request for a temporary emergency dwelling permit, the
Council may attach any conditions that are reasonably necessary to mitigate the
impacts of the temporary emergency dwelling on adjacent parcels or
infrastructure. Such conditions may include increased buffering or screening
requirements, additional setbacks, driveway and access restrictions,
requirements for the provisions of utilities to serve the temporary emergency
dwelling and such other requirements or conditions as may be necessary or
appropriate under the circumstances and conditions applicable to the parcel for
which a temporary emergency dwelling permit is sought. Council may also
prohibit any improvements that, in its opinion, would increase the permanence
of the temporary emergency dwelling or otherwise prevent or hinder its removal
by the end of the term of the temporary emergency dwelling permit.
(Ord. 1409, passed 4-6-09; Am. Ord. 2716, passed 6-20-16)
§ 156.07 PERMIT TERM, REVOCATION, AND EXPIRATION.
   (A)   Term. A temporary emergency dwelling permit issued to an applicant
based on compliance with the requirements of this chapter shall be valid for a
period not exceeding 90 days from the date of County Council approval.
   (B)   Revocation. If the County Council determines that:
      (1)   Any of the requirements of this chapter have not been satisfied;
      (2)   Any of the conditions attached to the permit have not been met; or
      (3)   The grounds authorizing the permit no longer exist, then the
temporary emergency dwelling permit may be revoked after notice to the holder
of the permit. If the permit holder fails to demonstrate to the satisfaction of
Council or officials charged with the administration of county codes on or
before the next regularly scheduled meeting of Council that no grounds for
revocation exist, then the permit may be revoked and the matter referred to
county code enforcement officials for appropriate action.
   (C)   Expiration. Occupancy of a temporary dwelling shall cease immediately
upon expiration or revocation of a temporary emergency dwelling permit. All
utilities shall be disconnected and the temporary emergency dwelling shall be
removed upon expiration or revocation of the temporary emergency dwelling
permit. An unoccupied recreational vehicle may be stored on the property with
all utilities disconnected so long as it meets the setback requirements for a
residential structure and no one lives in the recreational vehicle. Once the
owner completes repair or construction of the permanent dwelling, the
recreational vehicle must comply with all requirements of the Zoning Code.
   (D)   Penalty.
      (1)   Any violation of York County Code of Ordinances Chapter 156 shall
constitute a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum fine of $470 or imprisonment
for no more than 30 days. Each day that a violation continues shall be deemed a
separate and distinct offense. Violations shall be enforced by any duly
commissioned code enforcement officer using the county ordinance summons or by
the York County Sheriff or any deputy sheriff.
      (2)   In addition to the above penalty, the York County Council may
institute an action for an injunction, abatement, or any other appropriate
action to enforce the expiration or revocation of the temporary emergency
dwelling permit.
(Ord. 1409, passed 4-6-09; Am. Ord. 2716, passed 6-20-16)
§ 156.08 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND CONDITIONS FOR TEMPORARY EMERGENCY
DWELLINGS.
   In addition to all other conditions and requirements under this chapter, the
following requirements and conditions shall apply to temporary emergency
dwellings:
   (A)   A temporary emergency dwelling shall be permitted only if it is
located on a lot that is 10,000 square feet in area or greater;
   (B)   The principal use of the lot shall be residential and the principal
structure on the lot shall be a detached single-family residential building;
   (C)   No more than one temporary emergency dwelling shall be permitted on
any single parcel of record and shall be permitted only if a principal dwelling
unit is located on the affected parcel or a principal dwelling unit is being
constructed;
   (D)   The temporary emergency dwelling shall not be served by a driveway
separate from that serving the principal dwelling; and
   (E)   A detached temporary emergency dwelling shall be located in the rear
or side yard only.
