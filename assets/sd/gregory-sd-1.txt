(Prior Code, § 13.08.030) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 51.04  TOTAL COST OF OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE; GENERATION OF REVENUE.
   (A)   The city, or its city engineer, shall determine the total annual costs
of operation and maintenance of the wastewater system which are necessary to
maintain the capacity and performance, during the service life of the treatment
works, for which such works were designed and constructed. The total annual
cost of operation and maintenance shall include but need not be limited to
labor, repairs, equipment, replacement, maintenance, necessary modifications,
power, sampling, laboratory tests and a reasonable contingency fund.
   (B)   The purpose of this chapter shall be to generate sufficient revenue to
pay all costs for the operation and maintenance of the complete wastewater
system. The costs shall be distributed to all users of the wastewater system in
proportion to each user's contribution to the total loading of the treatment
works. Factors such as strength (BOD and TSS), volume and delivery flow rate
characteristics shall be considered to ensure a proportional distribution of
operation and maintenance costs to each user (or user class).
(Prior Code, § 13.08.040)
§ 51.05  USER'S WASTEWATER CONTRIBUTION PERCENTAGE; DETERMINATION.
   (A)   The city, or its city engineer, shall determine each user's average
daily volume of wastewater, which has been discharged to the wastewater system,
which shall then be divided by the average daily volume of all wastewater
discharged to the wastewater system, to determine each user's volume
contribution percentage. The amount used is the total average contribution
percentage. The amount used as the total average daily volume of wastewater
shall exclude infiltration and inflow. The city, or its city engineer, shall
determine each user's average daily poundage of 5-day, 20° Centigrade
biochemical oxygen demand which has been discharged to the wastewater system,
which shall then be divided by the average daily poundage of all 5-day, 20°
Centigrade biochemical oxygen demand discharged to the wastewater system to
determine each user's biochemical oxygen demand contribution percentage.
   (B)   The city, or its city engineer, shall determine each user's average
suspended solids poundage which has been discharged to the wastewater, to
determine the user's suspended solids contribution percentage. Each user's
volume contribution percentage, biochemical oxygen demand contribution
percentage and suspended solids contribution percentage shall be multiplied by
the annual operation and maintenance costs for wastewater treatment of the
total volume flow, of the total 5-day, 20° Centigrade biochemical oxygen demand
and of the total suspended solids, respectively.
(Prior Code, § 13.08.050)
§ 51.06  SURCHARGE SYSTEM FOR USERS WITH BOD AND TSS; DETERMINATION.
   The city, or its city engineer, will determine the average suspended solids
(TSS), and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) daily loadings for the average
residential user. The city, or its city engineer, will assess a surcharge rate
for all nonresidential users discharging wastes with BOD and TSS strengths
greater than the average residential user. Such users will be assessed a
surcharge, sufficient to cover the cost of treating such users above-normal-
strength wastes. Normal-strength wastes are considered to be 200 ppm BOD and
250 ppm TSS.
(Prior Code, § 13.08.060)
§ 51.07  USER'S WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGE; DETERMINATION.
   Each nonresidential user's wastewater treatment cost contributions as
determined in §§
51.05 and
51.06 shall be added together to determine each user's annual wastewater
service charge. Residential users may be considered to be 1 class of user and
an equitable service charge may be determined for each such user based upon an
estimate of the total wastewater contribution of this class of user. The
Governing Body may classify industrial, commercial and other nonresidential
establishments as a residential user, provided that the wastes from these
establishments are equivalent to the wastes from the average residential user
with respect to volume, suspended solids, and 5-day, 20° Centigrade biochemical
oxygen demand. Each user's wastewater treatment cost contribution will be
assessed in accordance with the rate schedule adopted as part of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 13.08.070)
§ 51.08  PAYMENT OF SERVICE CHARGE AND PENALTIES.
   The city shall submit an annual statement to the user for the user's annual
wastewater service charge or 1/12 of the user's annual wastewater service
charge may be included with the monthly water and/or wastewater utility
billing. The city shall add a penalty of 10% per month if the payment is not
received by the city within 15 days. Should any user fail to pay the user
wastewater service charge and penalty within 3 months of the due date, the city
may stop the wastewater service to the property.
(Prior Code, § 13.08.080)
§ 51.09  REVIEW OF SERVICE CHARGE.
   The city shall review the total annual cost of operation and maintenance, as
well as each user's wastewater contribution percentage, on an annual basis, and
will revise the system as necessary to assure equity of the service charge
system established in this chapter, and to assure that sufficient funds are
obtained to adequately operate and maintain the wastewater treatment works. If
a significant user, such as an industry, has completed in-plant modifications
which would change that user's wastewater contribution percentage, the user can
present at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Governing Body such factual
information, and the city shall then determine if the user's wastewater
contribution percentage is to be changed. The city shall notify the user of its
findings as soon as possible.
(Prior Code, § 13.08.090)
§ 51.10  PROHIBITED DISCHARGES.
   The discharge of any waters containing toxic or poisonous solids, liquids or
gases in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other
wastes, to injure or interfere with any sewage treatment process, constitutes a
hazard to humans or animals, creates a public nuisance, or creates any hazard
in the receiving waters of the wastewater treatment plant, is prohibited.
(Prior Code, § 13.08.100)
§ 51.11  CLEAR WATER CONNECTIONS PROHIBITED.
   No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation
drains, areaway drains or other sources of surface runoff or ground water to a
building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly or
indirectly to a public sanitary sewer.
(Prior Code, § 13.08.110)
§ 51.12  NEW SEWERS AND CONNECTIONS; PROPER DESIGN.
   The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of sanitary sewers and
sewer connections, and the methods to be used in excavations, placing of the
pipe, jointing, testing and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the
requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and
regulations of the city and the state.  In the absence of code provision or in
