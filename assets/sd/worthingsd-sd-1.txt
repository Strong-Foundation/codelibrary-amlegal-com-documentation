§ 73.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   COMPRESSION RELEASE ENGINE BRAKES OR JAKE BRAKES. A compression release
engine brake, compression brake, or decompression brake, commonly referred to
as a jacobs brake or jake brake, is an engine braking mechanism typically found
on diesel engines. When engaged, it operates by opening exhaust valves near the
end of the compression stroke, allowing the release of compressed gas from the
cylinders. This action slows down the vehicle by utilizing engine resistance.
(Ord. 2024-04-01, passed 5-6-2024)
§ 73.02 PROHIBITION OF COMPRESSION ENGINES OR JAKE BRAKES.
   It shall be unlawful for any person within the city limits of the City of
Worthing to generate loud or disturbing noises with any mechanical devices
operated by compressed air used to assist braking on semi-tractors.
Additionally, no person shall utilize motor vehicle brakes within the city
limits if they are
activated or operated by the engine's compression or any related unit or part
thereof. The use of a truck or truck-tractor's “jake brake” within city limits
is strictly prohibited, except in cases of imminent danger involving potential
collision with property, individuals, or animals. To ensure awareness of this
regulation, appropriate signage notifying semi-tractor drivers shall be
prominently posted throughout the city.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 112.01 RATIONALE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   Rationale. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually-
oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety and general welfare
of the citizens of the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations
to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually-oriented businesses
within the city. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor
effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable
access to any communicative materials, including sexually-oriented materials.
Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or
deny access by adults to sexually-oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually-
oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor
effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
material.
   (B)   Findings.
      (1)   Based on evidence of the adverse secondary effect of adult uses
presented in hearings and in reports made available to the City Commissioners,
and on findings, interpretations and narrowing constructions incorporated in
the cases of City of Littleton v. Z.J. Gifts D-4, L.L.C., 124 S. Ct. 2219 (June
7, 2004); City of Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., 535 U.S. 425 (2002);

PHE, Inc. v. State, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 269 (2004); Yorko v. State, 690 S.W. 2d
260 (Tex. 1985); SOB, Inc. v. County of Benton, 317 F.3d 856 (8th Cir. 2003);

336 F.4d 1153 (9th Cir. 2003); North Avenue Novelties, Inc. v. City of Chicago,
88 F.3d 441 (1996); World Wide Video of Washington, Inc. v. City of Spokane,
386 F.3d 1186 (9th Cir. 2004); Lady J. Lingerie, Inc. v. City of Jacksonville,
176 F.3d 1358 (11th Cir. 1999).
      (2)   And based upon reports concerning secondary effects occurring in
and around sexually-oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, Austin,
Texas - 1986; Indianapolis, Indiana - 1984; Garden Grove, California - 1991;
Houston, Texas - 1983, 1997; Phoenix, Arizona - 1979, 1995 through 1998;
Chattanooga, Tennessee - 1999 through 2003; Minneapolis, Minnesota - 1980; Los
Angeles, California - 1977; Whittier, California - 1978; Spokane, Washington -
2001; St. Cloud, Minnesota - 1994; Littleton, Colorado - 2004; Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma - 1986; Dallas, Texas - 1997; Greensboro, North Carolina - 2003;
Amarillo, Texas - 1977; Roncek, McCleary Expert Reports - 2004; New York, New
York Times Square -1994; and the Report of the Attorney General’s Working Group
on the Regulation of Sexually-Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of
Minnesota).
      (3)   The City Commissioners finds the following.
         (a)   Sexually-oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses,
are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects, including, but
not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of
disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug
trafficking, negative impacts on property values, urban blight, litter and
sexual assault and exploitation.
         (b)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral and anal sex,
sometimes occur inside the premises of or in the parking lot of unregulated
sexually-oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, those which
provide private or semi-private booths, rooms or cubicles for viewing films,
video or live sexually explicit shows, which acts pose a risk to public health
through the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
         (c)   Sexually-oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive
land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and
should be separated from other sexually-oriented businesses; to minimize the
secondary effects associated with such uses; and to prevent an unnecessary
concentration of sexually-oriented businesses in one area.
         (d)   Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a
harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or
abating, and said substantial interest exists independent of any comparative
analysis between sexually-oriented and non-sexually-oriented businesses.
(Ord. 226, passed 11-24-2005)

§ 150.20 ESTABLISHMENT.
   A board of adjustment is hereby established for the city, which shall
consist of the members of the City Commissioners, pursuant to SDCL § 11-4-24.
(Ord. 2010-248-5, passed 5-24-2010)
§ 150.21 POWERS AND DUTIES.
   The Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers and duties:
   (A)   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in
any requirement or determination made by the authorized official of the city in
the enforcement of this subchapter;
   (B)   To hear and decide appeals to decisions made by the authorized
official of the city regarding building permits; and
   (C)   To hear and decide upon petitions for variances to vary the strict
application of the height, area, setback, yard, parking or density requirements
as will not be contrary to the public interest. A variance shall not be allowed
to vary the use regulations.
(Ord. 2010-248-5, passed 5-24-2010)
§ 150.22 APPEAL PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Any person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by any decision
of the authorized official, may present to that official a notice of appeal,
setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying
the grounds of the illegality. The notice of appeal shall be filed with the
authorized official of the city, who shall transmit to the Board of Adjustment
all information and records concerning the appeal. Such notice of appeal shall
be presented to the authorized official within 30 days after the filing of the
decision in the office of the authorized official.
   (B)   The Board of Adjustment shall keep a public record of all findings and
decisions. All meetings shall be held at the call of the Chairperson and at
such other times as necessary. Each session at which an appeal is to be heard
shall be a public meeting. A sign shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the

notice of the public hearing in a legal newspaper of the city no less than ten
days before the public hearing.
   (C)   The public hearing shall be held. The appellant may appear in person,

compliance with the specific rules governing the action considered at the
public hearing shall be completed by the Board of Adjustment. The concurring
vote of two-thirds of the members of the Board of Adjustment shall be necessary
to approve any appeal or arrive at any determination.
(Ord. 2010-248-5, passed 5-24-2010)
§ 150.23 VARIANCES.
   (A)   The Board of Adjustment shall have the jurisdiction to hear and decide
upon petitions for variances to vary the strict application of the height,
area, setback, yard, parking or density requirements as will not be contrary to
the public interest. For the purpose of these regulations, public interest
shall include the interests of the public at large within the city, not just
neighboring property owners. At all times, the burden shall be on the applicant
to prove the need for a variance.
   (B)   The following issues are to be considered, each and all of them, as
determining factors in whether or not the issuance of a variance is justified.
      (1)   An unnecessary hardship must be established by the applicant who
applies for the variance. For the purpose of this subchapter, an unnecessary
hardship is a situation where, in the absence of a variance, an owner can make
no feasible or reasonable use of the property. Convenience, loss of profit,
financial limitations or self-imposed hardship shall not be considered as
grounds for approving a variance by the Board of Adjustment.
      (2)   Literal interpretation of the provisions of this subchapter would
deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the
same district under the terms of this subchapter.
      (3)   The variance requested is the minimum variance that will alleviate
the hardship.
      (4)   Granting of the variance will comply with the general purpose and
intent of this subchapter, and will not be offensive to adjacent areas or to
the public welfare.
      (5)   No nonconforming use or structure in the same district and no
permitted or nonconforming use or structure in other districts shall be
considered grounds for the issuance of a variance.
      (6)   Exceptional and extraordinary circumstances apply to the property
that do not apply to other properties in the same zone or vicinity and that
result from lot size or shape, topography or other circumstances which are not
of the applicants making.
      (7)   In order to preserve the intent of the zoning regulations and to
protect the public interest, the Board of Adjustment may attach conditions to a
variance. A variance shall remain valid only as long as the property owner
complies with any terms and conditions of the variance, as attached by the
Board of Adjustment.
      (8)   (a)   An application for a variance, available from the authorized
official of the city, shall be completed by the landowner requesting the
variance. Completed applications shall be returned to the authorized official
for review.
         (b)   To be considered completed, the application shall contain the
following information:
            1.   Legal description of the land on which such variance is
requested, together with local street address;
            2.   Name and address of each owner of the property;
            3.   Name, address, phone number and signature of the applicant;
            4.   Zoning district classification under which the property is
regulated at the time of such application;
            5.   Description of the variance sought from the zoning
regulations;
            6.   Be accompanied with a site plan unless waived by the
authorized official; and
            7.   Any other information concerning the property as may be
requested by the authorized official or the Board of Adjustment.
      (9)   The authorized official shall review the application, and shall
make a recommendation to the Board of Adjustment to either approve or not
approve said application. The authorized official’s recommendation shall
include a summary of the application, and the reasons and justification for
either approval or disapproval of the application.
      (10)   The authorized official shall set the date, time and place for a
public hearing to be held by the Board of Adjustment. The authorized official
shall notify the landowner by mail, and shall post notices of the public
hearing at the city office and on the property affected by the proposed
variance no less than seven days prior to the scheduled public hearing. No less
than ten days before the public hearing, the authorized official shall publish
notice of the public hearing in a legal newspaper of the city.
      (11)   The public hearing shall be held. The applicant may appear in
person, or by agent or attorney. Minutes of the public hearing shall be
recorded and kept in the records of the Board of Adjustment. Written findings
certifying compliance with the specific rules governing the action considered
at the public hearing shall be completed by the Board. The concurring vote of
two-thirds of the members of the Board of Adjustment shall be necessary to
approve any variance or arrive at any determination.
(Ord. 2010-248-5, passed 5-24-2010)
§ 150.24 COURT REVIEW.
   Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Adjustment may petition
a court of record within 30 days after the filing of the Board’s decision as

of this chapter and all relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. The
authorized official may waive the submission of plans if he or she finds that
the nature of the work applied for is such that reviewing of plans is not

first obtaining a permit from the City. If a building permit is not obtained, a
separate grading permit must be obtained from the City for each site and may
cover both excavations and fills.
Exceptions:
1.   A separate grading permit is not required from the City where a site plan
for a new building, structure, or addition is submitted for plan review where
an excavation below finished grade for basements, footings, and foundations of
a building, retaining wall, or other structure is authorized by a valid
building permit.
2.   A fill of less than 1 foot in depth and placed on natural terrain with a
slope flatter than one unit vertical to five units horizontal (20 percent
slope), or less than 3 feet (914 mm) in depth not intended to support
structures, which does not exceed 300 cubic yards (153 m3) on any one lot and
does not obstruct a drainage course.

such operations do not affect the lateral support or increase the stresses in
or pressure upon any adjacent or contiguous property.
9.   Exploratory excavations under the direction of soils engineers or
engineering geologists.
10.   An excavation that 1) is less than 2 feet (610 mm) in depth or 2) does
not create a cut slope of less than 5 feet (1,524 mm) in height and steeper
than one unit vertical in one and one-half units horizontal (66.7 percent
slope).
Exemptions from the permit requirements of this chapter shall not be deemed to
grant authorization for any work to be done in any manner in violation of the
provisions of this chapter or any other laws or ordinances of this
jurisdiction.
1804.7.1 Grading permit requirements. Grading shall be performed in accordance
with a grading plan approved by the City. Submitted plans shall indicate
existing elevations, proposed elevations, method of erosion control, and shall

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 154.01 DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any human-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations located within the
area of special flood hazard.
   FLOOD or FLOODING. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (a)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (b)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. This term also
includes park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles placed on a
site for greater than 180 consecutive days.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building or manufactured home that is
principally above ground.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.
      (a)   Means any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the
cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure
either:
         1.   Before the improvement or repair is started; or
         2.   If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before
the damage occurred. For the purpose of this definition, SUBSTANTIAL
IMPROVEMENT is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or
not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.
      (b)   The term does not, however, include either:
         1.   Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with
existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which
are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
         2.   Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.
   (B)   This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special
flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas of special flood hazards or
uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages.
This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the municipality, any
officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for
any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Prior Code, § 11.02)
§ 154.02 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The legislature of the state has, in SDCL Chapter 9-36 and § 7-18-14,
delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations
designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its
citizenry.
(Prior Code, § 11.01)
§ 154.03 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the municipality are subject to periods of
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental service, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in areas of special flood hazards, which increase flood heights and velocities,
and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are
inadequately flood proofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss.
   (C)   To locate areas of flood hazard, refer to the flood zones identified
on the FEMA map on record with the city.
(Prior Code, § 11.01)
§ 154.04 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions to specific areas by provisions designed:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   (G)   To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an
area of special flood hazard; and
   (H)   To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazards
assume responsibility for his, her or their actions.
(Prior Code, § 11.01)
§ 154.05 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
(Prior Code, § 11.01)
§ 154.06 LAND THAT APPLIES.
   This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the
jurisdiction of the municipality.
(Prior Code, § 11.03)
§ 154.07 COMPLIANCE.
   No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended or
altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other
applicable regulations.
(Prior Code, § 11.03) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 154.08 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and
another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(Prior Code, § 11.03)
§ 154.09 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation of this chapter, all provisions shall be:
   (A)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (B)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (C)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
(Prior Code, § 11.03)
§ 154.10 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes.
(Prior Code, § 11.03)

         (b)   Review all development permits to determine that all necessary
permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local governmental
agencies from which prior approval is required; and
         (c)   Review all development permits to determine if the proposed
development adversely affects the flood carrying capacity of the area of
special flood hazard.
   (B)   For the purpose of this chapter, ADVERSELY AFFECTS means damage to
adjacent properties because of rises in flood stages attributed to physical
changes of the channel and the adjacent overbank areas.
      (1)   If it is determined that there is no adverse effect and the
development is not a building, then the permit shall be granted without further
consideration.
      (2)   If it is determined that there is an adverse effect, then technical
justification (i.e., a registered professional engineer’s certification) for
the proposed development shall be required.
